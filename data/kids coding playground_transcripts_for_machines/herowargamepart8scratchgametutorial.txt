welcome back guys it's K playground here today back with another video on Scratch and today we will be making the eighth and final part of the hero war game so if you haven't checked out the other parts for the hero war game it's in the description below and you can also check on our channel for the other seven parts so deathray all right so when the green flag is clicked for the death ray it'll hide but it'll go to front later so when I receive death ray deathray then it will show it will go to player has some life stealing capabilities it'll go to player then it'll Glide 1 second to zombie King and then it will broadcast beam touched beam touched you message beam touched and then it will hide so the beam touched thing has multiple things so let's go back to the player so when I receive beam touch it will change lives by minus 50 so it does 50 damage it'll steal 50 damage 50 Health from you and then gain 500 for himself so pretty greedy man so let's add that part over in the zombie King so when I receive beam touched it will switch costume the costume 4 which is the healing one it will change King HP King HP zombie King HP by 500 and then it'll wait one second then it'll switch costume back to costume one all all right let's make sure we don't have any more Siege things cuz we got this from The Siege let's make sure okay uh now let's work on the icons and the UN andu lose and we are basically done unless I'm forgetting something you know so let's go to the icons so icon one so when the green flag is clicked it will hide all right so when I receive start game start game then it will show and then if then we have to have it equals one if then hero select Ed is equal to one it will switch costume to costume one which is you know the arrow one so these are all the icons and it'll go to x I made it to a position where it will not uh overlap with the variable so let's actually do that 170 158 and then let's go if hero s this equal to two this switch costume to costume 2 and I'll go to x 182 167 so just for reference this is 1 2 three just the three bodies and then now duplicate that again so if hero is equal to three three so costume three 187 six and 167 so let's move these all to Icon ah it's fine I don't have to move that think it's pretty laggy you know it's too much I'll I'll move it to the other ones so it's being kind of stubborn with the lagging so I actually moved it up one column so I can get it into the Sprites and then I'll move it back down so there's just too much Sprites you know so there you go icon one two three all right so now let's go to Icon 2 so the basically the same thing so when the green flag is clicked it will hide and then when I receive start game it'll show if then here's one blah blah blah and then this time it'll be 58 165 for the first one switch costume costume 2 oh but there's no costume two it's called lightning cuz you know I got it from the lightning so this is costume one two and then three and then switch costume to costume 2 which is basically costume three so yeah we have Nega 58 165 and then this is going to be 101 162 and then if hero s is equal to three then it switch costume 2 which is basically costume three if you get what I'm saying and then it'll point in Direction 90 then after that it will go to X 11 and then 160 two so I do have a set size for these so the icon is actually going to be 20 for this one and for the first icon I have it at size 20 as well and the third one I have at size 25 so change that okay so now let's work on icon 3 so when the G flag is clicked it will um hide and then when I receive start game it will show then here's one it switch costume to Griffin a which I have over here Griffin a it will go to X4 163 so actually the Griffin's kind of big so actually for Griffin only it set size to 15% and now if your equal 2 you'll switch costume your costume one which is um The Apprentice so so The Apprentice and then if then hero selct is equal to three then it'll switch costume to the defender chip so actually have names for these so that's a lot easier but let's actually change the position so that's 41 163 right this is4 163 as well and then this is 143 those are the positions I got and then I actually got this set size 25% for this one I think which is already is and then a point in Direction 90 so that's just for the icons so the icon one is actually tilted for some reason so let's actually change icon one back to the direction it normally is at 82 so yeah so all the icons as you can see are over here for some reason I don't know why this one's a little smaller let's actually take a look at it huh so now since we have all of that done um it's actually supposed to look like that deciding and then um let's hide all the variables so we have all these let's hide all these and let's see if it works as you can see all the power up things are over here so if you double click on this thing you can actually change it to a different form which it look like that so double click and then this is for power up two so and then we can move it like that and then this is for power up three so now we have the variables like that it will look more pleasing as you can see well that's a little far A little bit closer is good there we go yeah I think I have to change the position of some of these seems to be all the right positions but it's just a little off for some reason um move the score up here too just seems to be a little off I think if you full screen it'll be fine no yeah it's just a little off I think I have to move the heel um a little back so let's see how far we have to move this back that's good so whatever position that is it'll go to that now and then this icon to whatever position that is it will go to that instead and let's see if the other ones are also weird oh these are fine oh this one's a little off all right let's see how what position that is okay so let's see icon three so whatever position that is it'll go to x just like that and then now let's see the elf Warrior see if that's also fine oh no that's not fine all right so let's move this Arrow over here whatever position that is and then this Griffin guy and then change to whatever position that is so it should be all right now hopefully yeah all right I think this spectral Arrow should go down a little bit so let's yeah whatever position that is and yeah all right so now let's work on the you win you lose or game over as they call it spray so when the green flag is clicked it will go to front layer it will go to x00 0 then it will hide then it will when I receive game over so I think we actually have to make the game over thing so let's do that real quick yeah okay so we go to the player so when the green when if then so if then we need a or then lives is equal to zero lives is equal to zero or lives is less than zero then it will broadcast game over so let's make that game over let's add that over here just like that all right so now let's work on the game over again so have this when the G click it'll go to front layer then when I receive game over it will switch costume to costume one which is the game over thing and it'll show and then stop all then when I receive King Dead costume two which is basically you win because when the King dies he's the last boss it'll show and then stop all so I also made it so some Sprites hide when you win or you lose so I think I'll track down all the Sprites where I added that all right I forgot to add one thing for the um the old one so let's actually do this so when I receive old one dead so this is for all the enemies and stuff so when I receive old one dead it'll wait one second delete this clone then same with the Speedy enemy when I receive old one dead then same with the armored enemy oh crap let's restore that Sprite so I just restored the Sprite that was really scary just click edit and restore the Sprite so so let's move this back up that's really scary so when I receive old one dead and then same with the armored enemy receive old one dead and um yeah so the game should work now uh I want to make it so the enemies hide well when the game you win all right the game should work now I don't think I made any Sprites hide basically when when they're doing that so let's take a look at the game so I actually have some music for this game but we're not going to add that yet CU I have to download it and everything so you can just add music from the scratch profile and I'll have the music in the original game so I'll play the game and see how I'll tell you how it goes as I play so here I am fighting The Siege monster it seems to be working oh no he's summoning peons on me guys oh no let's see if we can use the Griffin bomb him Griffin so let's shoot him a few times oh no I lost okay it's fine I'll show you the game to test it out since I can't always win because this game is kind of hard not going to lie so I'm going to set the score to a th000 cuz I'm always like unpausing and pausing and stuff so and it takes time off my margin they're just attacking me while I do that let's just set my score to a th000 let's just select a hero and then set my score to a th000 all right so so there was a random zombie over here so I figured out why I don't even know why how The Siege monster dead thing got into here so let's actually just delete that so I don't know how any of the siege monster code even got into the Sprite and there's another piece of Siege monster code and it was showing the enemy so you actually want to set this to Hidden so I don't know how that even got into there cuz I don't remember putting it into there so anyway um it should work now so if you have any problems you can just check it out on our on my project and look at each piece of the game and see if it works so I'm going to give myself a th000 score and test it out real quick so I'm going to give myself some quick cheats so then I can show you the game a lot quicker just select alware oh I forgot to click on the cheats oops a let's do that start yeah I just use this guy wait no L4 is better uh where's the bomb yeah okay there we go start the game over here as you can see I have all these things let's do all that let's hit him all right I just gave myself some hacked power ups so I can show you the game so as you can see uh The Siege monster does work it's summoning its peons and um it's taking damage and everything so great and now we beat The Siege monster so now let's play until we get to the old one as you can see the old one's about to come out uh there we go he's summoning his Vineyards and he's going to try to hit me as you can see so let's shoot him and then that's the old one so actually I forgot to change this so go to the old one so this is actually switch costume to costume 2 there's a bunch of like small things so this actually the dead OTE the Dead one so this is when I received old one dead and then now we will go to the old ones Vin ball and this is actually when I receive old one spawn not old one dead so that's why I wasn't shooting anything either no King spawn old one spawn so I'm just testing for bugs here and finding these small bugs to put all right so let's restart that so let's give myself some powers and then now The Siege monster is out so let's just get rid of him real quick let's just Spam my hacked amount of things now the old ones here too so just get almost full screen this so as you can see old one is shooting Vine balls at me and he also has the vineard over there so yeah I'm just going to shoot him down and the poison effect as you can see like right there and then let's just take get rid of him real quick oh why is there a zombie on me okay let's just get rid of him real quick oh now the zombie King's out cuz I had a bunch of um things and then now the dude's going to come out and the mysterious man and then he's G give me some a th000 health and then this guy is summoning peons while also stealing my HP so that's not very nice of you yeah so let's just beat him easy okay I have infinite power ups I should be using these more I have the Griffin here spamming the first power up there we go do all that and then that and then that and that there's the U Win and that the end of the project so this is the end of the hero War series and and if you have

code if you have any like um you know any questions or anything just comment on my scratch project cuz I knew there was a bunch of like small things and bugs that happen once in a while because we're taking um scripts from different Sprites so anyway that's the hero war game so let me just delete this real quick and yeah so please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below what
