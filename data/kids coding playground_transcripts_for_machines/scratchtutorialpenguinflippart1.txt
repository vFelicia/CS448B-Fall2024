hello everyone and welcome back to kids coding playground channel today we'll be making a new game called penguin flip this is more of a advanced uh topic on scratch it will be require you to have a good knowledge of scratch basic scratch programming if you do not have it i would not recommend this game yet you can check out the beginner and intermediate lesson the point of the game is to make the penguin flip up into the air and land it onto the iceberg so every time the penguin lands onto the iceberg you get some points so the skull will go up so we try to get the penguin onto the iceberg without dropping him into the water or hitting the edge if you drop into the water or hitting the edge on the top or the side then the penguin will lose the life here so as you can see right now the penguin has three lives so we want to keep the penguin off the from the water or hitting the edge we want to try to get them flip and then to turn to the um iceberg here to get the point so what will we be learning today here are some of the concepts we'll be learning we'll learning how to calculate the horizontal vertical speed and position so that means how how how far and how fast the penguin will be jumping up into the air and landing to the other side and we will be using repeat until loop um this is just a loop that we can use to make things uh do something over and over again we'll be learning a broadcasting message basically sending message from one sprite to another and also we'll be learning about pointing the object towards something this is basically the object is point to the let's say the penguin the arrows point or the penguin and you can move the arrow or the arrows pointing to the mouse those kind of uh functionality and also we will be learning to use random and we'll be using some custom blocks so this is a user defined code the blocks that you could make up a bunch of different code to form a single function and they could be reused over and over again in the in the in the code and we will be learning about our sensing touching the color uh uh this will be the sensing like the penguin touch the ice iceberg and it will land it so we'll be checking the color and also learning about broadcasting message between the sprite and how to change the broadcast like one broadcast go to the next the sprite will do something it will broadcast something then the other sprite will do something so this is kind of the basic uh the some of the things we'll be learning about the game so uh before i do that let me kind of show you how the game actually works so here is the uh sample game as you can see we i added something else else also the fish that kind of jump up and down between the block the ice block the penguin standing on and the iceberg so the fishes can go up and down the fish is the bonus uh point so you don't actually have to get the fish you can land on the iceberg without getting the fish but if you get the fish then you get more points so as you can see right now ten lives and zero score so as if i move the the arrow um closer to the penguin that means you know the the gap is less right between the uh the penguin and the arrow so the the distance he will jump is less and if i move uh lower the the the height is also less right the gap the vertical height is also less between the penguin and the arrow so it will jump less so i move it higher the penguin will jump higher and if i move further the penguin will jump further so the basically we're trying to find the gap between the arrow and the penguin so let's say if i do this right let's see right here so as you can see so the penguin flips and he landed on the iceberg so once he landed on iceberg he gets some points so uh the fish i think is 50 bonus point and if you land on the iceberg you get 10 so it doesn't matter you can have anything you like so let me try again so if i landed you see again i get the fish and the ending point on the uh uh iceberg so let's say if i miss i want to see oh i got it again this cannot okay let me try it harder like if i put here right so the penguin will jump really far and very high so probably he gonna miss this time so let's see you see that so he missed so he missed then you don't get any point let's say do lower here right he fall into the water also you don't get any points and you lose your life so we will try to uh kind of jump the penguin and without losing your life and get onto the iceberg so this is kind of the point of the game so as you can see so every time you make it over so you can see you get 10 points so i did not catch the fish this time so i get 10 points and you want to keep the fish between the iceberg and the the block that the penguin is standing on so we'll be working on this game today all right be sure to click on like share subscribe and click on this notification bell to receive all the latest updates from this channel thank you all right guys so we'll begin the programming this uh game called penguin flip so uh let's rename this okay so this is a penguin flip i'll call it two because i already have penguin flip or i'm gonna confuse that so let me kind of zoom in a little bit here okay so before we begin we need to create some variable to help keep track of this game so we'll creating a total of a six variable each gap so this is the horizontal gap between the penguin and the arrow sprite and then we're gonna make one called each speed so so this one will calculate the speed uh how fast uh the penguin will move horizontally next we'll create one called v gap this is the vertical gap for the uh between the penguin and the arrow sprite and we'll make one more call vspeed so this is the vertical speed that the penguin will be traveling up and we'll make one more call uh lives so this is the number of dive the penguin have let's make one last one this one will be score so we'll keep track of the score for the penguin okay so my variable we don't really need it so we can delete that so uh this one you know you can show click on the checkbox to show up or you can uncheck it to hide it for debugging purposes like let's say you do something wrong in your code and you want to see what's going on you might have to have it checked uh but for now let's kind of remove this for now for us so we actually run into issue we'll try to take a look at that so maybe we'll put the score on this side and the live on this side so we have six of our variable that we're gonna keep track of so next we're gonna draw the backdrop so the backdrop is gonna kind of draw the ocean or something so we'll go to here and then we'll click on this here and then we can check the field uh what we can do is we can use the one here on the middle here this kind of feel like the top is a little bit darker and then bottom will be a little bit lighter so we can do like two sets of color on the same same field so for this uh the left left side will click on the left side first this is the top portion i will try and make it blue so let's see let's see a 60 maybe it doesn't really matter which one it is close enough should be good enough so once you're trying to make this here even number it's kind of hard to get to 60 exactly 62 is fine i will make this brightness about here all right 87. so this is darker blue so and then this side will make it lighter so this will will make it like maybe 57 like this a little bit 35 and 100 so this is a little bit lighter so now we kind of have a dark field in the light field and maybe we'll take this out we don't want the outline so what we're going to do is we're going to draw a rectangular box oops it fills up all my things okay so i made a mistake over here so i should have drawn the box first and then change the color because that kind of messed it up when i moved to the box it's trying to change it to back to solid so that's one mistake i did so hopefully you guys will not make this mistake let's draw the box first actually so we're gonna draw the box we're gonna try to put it all the way on top drag it out so we'll cover the whole screen now we'll fix this now we'll go to the fix the color now so earlier i must kind of mess that up now we will try to fix it i will go 6185.87 here we'll use 57 or something it's a little hard to drag this out the way that you want but something close enough should be okay okay all right here we go so now we have this this fill color so you see the top piece is a little bit darker blue and the bottom piece is a little bit lighter blue so it's kind of make it a two two color background like a fill okay so next so we have the color done right so now we're gonna draw the ocean piece in the bottom so make it a little bit darker color so we'll try to use the same color as the uh as this uh this this here this this dark side so 61 85 87 we'll try to do something similar so we're going to draw a little bar down here i'm going to extend this out a little bit so now we can have the ocean floor so we'll have 61.857 you have to automatically select it for us so we are good so we're done with the background with the sky and the ocean okay so next we're gonna have to draw this ice block so um what we can do is we're gonna create a new sprite click here click on this paint this will create a new sprite for us so here uh what we can do is we're going to select the color so for white color we're going to bring this to 0 bring that saturation 0 and make that to 100 and be sure to click no outline so that you could get the white box so as you can see i'm trying to put it in the middle right here in this little square here in the middle right so now i have my uh white box so this is the ice block that uh we will put the penguin on okay and we can rename this to ice block okay so the penguin has a his block to sit on or stand on we'll move it somewhere maybe here on this side here floating in the water okay all right so next we will work on the iceberg so we're going to draw an ice bucket as well alright so we are going to draw the iceberg now um what we can do is right click on this and duplicate so put it somewhere here okay so this iceberg here will rename it to iceberg now inside this iceberg we are going to change it a little bit make it a little bit smaller don't change the height just changing the width okay one more to the middle here so next we'll draw the line so for the line we're gonna increase this to maybe three and we're gonna we will going to change the color of the line make it um let's say 60 and then this is we'll put it at 75 maybe 75 76 we'll do 100 so now we have this good nice blue line so we will draw the line up and down so every time you draw you'll see a little little dot we're trying to connect those so what we can do is this you start from the base here so you draw the line up you see this little dot connect down down a little bit draw the line up again see little dot connect down again so you try and make a shape of a little eyes it doesn't really have to be perfect and down again and one more and then down again okay so now i'm going to connect this to in here so now we have a little eyes um iceberg kind of thing right i think my line is not really straight so let me see if i can undo that last piece so oops so let's change it back to three i don't know how it changed back to one so sometimes they do mess that up so let me do my line again i'm gonna go on a little bit further a little bit because i did not do it to the end over here okay now if i want to connect these two lines straight you can click on this and hold down the hold down the what you call it the um the shift key and then let's see we can connect this okay all right so good enough right a little bit slanted i think i did a better job on my first uh when i made the game so anyway so as you can see you can kind of connect them all so let's now let's go to fill so we're going to fill it with a different color inside maybe we can fill it with a lighter color inside so here we'll do the fill so maybe we'll do 60 we can just feel solid let's say 60 maybe 60 61 um 75 and we'll do 70 okay so here okay we can say fill right and the outline we can go back click on this you can change down into a different color but um whatever color you like you can have like two colors as you can see inside darker outside lighter but if you wanted lighter inside we can change that maybe you can do something brighter here this will be lighter right so we'll fill it again so you can see the the so just play around with your color whatever you like so um but uh so we have two colors so this one outside we can click on this and then you can change it to a different color if you want so this one um maybe we can change it to a little bit over here okay i'll go down a little bit okay so we have a darker blue and a lighter blue right okay so now we have done the iceberg so we have both the ice block and the iceberg right so let me um so next we'll go on and work on getting the penguin and the the arrow sprite next so uh we'll stop right here for right now so um we'll continue on the next next lesson you
