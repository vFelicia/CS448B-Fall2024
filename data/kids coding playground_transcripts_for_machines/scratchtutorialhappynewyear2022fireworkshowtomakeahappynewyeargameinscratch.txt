welcome back guys it's kids on playground here and today we're back from another video in scratch and today we'll be making a 2022 new year's game so let's see how this goes so click on the firecracker you make it move so here it's moving and you have to touch the match to light it and then you throw the firecracker anywhere you want by clicking and if you do it five times something special will come up so let's do that five times see as you can see it says happy new year 2022 so here we have and that's the special thing that comes up so today we'll be coding this on scratch so let's go okay before i begin please like share subscribe because it turns out most of our viewers are not subscribed so please subscribe and do us a favor so let's the first thing we should do is rename our project to happy new year 2022 and of course we never need the cat and our backdrop will always be our night city and our i have everything in the backpack so just come to my project and export the sprites if you uh just come in and export the sprites that you might want to we actually drew these all by ourselves so you see we have our match for our firecracker we have our happy and then we have our new and then we have our year and then we have our 2022 so um to make this you just have to uh get the h just get like the h and then choose a costume go to the letters and then get an a and ctrl c and then ctrl v and then add it to the place you want and after that delete the costume so just do that for to make happy new year and 2022 it might take a while but you can always come to my project on gumball098 and export the pro sprites from there so yeah we have that and um yeah so so i'm going to draw the sparkle sprite so best for our firecrackers so let's just draw that right now just a very small green dot so let's just zoom in a little bit yeah hold down shift and we have our sparkle i think we need that to be a little bigger that should be decent size i'm pretty sure okay yeah i think that should be fine and now let's work on the code so match has no code actually so we have a little head start over there and now we go straight to the firecracker so let's do the firecracker so let's go so when the green flag is clicked we will so i'm going to show you how i drew the match so let's look at let's take a quick look if you do want to draw your own match so let's see so so the fire is this orange thing and the outline is a darker orange and you just use the reshape tool to reshape the edges to make some sort of fire shape and that's the same applies for the uh the inside fire like the inner part the second layer and we have our match thing it's burnt so it's the black thing and this we can ungroup this real quick so and we have one uh brown piece of wood and one lighter brown piece of wood so that's for our match right so if you do want to draw that on your own here is a quick little small kind of tutorial to show you so and i'm also going to rename my sparkle sprite yeah i'm gonna move that over here so let's go back to the firecracker and let's show you how to draw both sprites so for the regular one all we have to do is uh take this orange sort of rectangle and reshape the outside and the edges out and we have this uh yellowish type of circle that we put over there and we have the part on the top with the little lighter part okay and that's for our first sprite and our second sprite is this one and let's it's just the same one duplicate this one if you do want to draw this and uh just kind of use lines to shape the edges like a line line line line line line and just shape the edges and then fill it in and that's how you make your sprite so we are done here off you might know how to make the sparkles but if you don't just come to my project and export it so let's go back to firecracker so when the green flag is clicked we make a new variable called counter placement counter the second thing we're gonna put since we just made our variable counter is set counter to zero because you have to make it five or more so we have that over there and now we'll set the size to a hundred and um it will go to the position marked and a point in direction 90. so yeah okay we also have to switch the custom plus we want all right and now i'll point direction 90 and delete this clone so now yeah and when i start as a no when this sprite is clicked it'll make a clone of itself because you click on the sprite and it'll make a clone so let's create a clone of myself and now when i start as a clone it will repeat until touching match because it will keep on following your mouse so repeat untouched until touching the match and it will go to mouse pointer because it'll follow your mouse pointer until it touches the match and it'll wait until now it's down so that's when you uh fire so no no that's when you click on the firecracker my bad and it will wait until now it's down let me put that under and now we will repeat ten times uh change size by minus five that just gives effect to make it smaller and smaller and smaller so change size by minus five and then we have if then statement if then statement and then you put an or so it's five or more so we put five the counter is greater to or equal to so the counter has to be e greater than five or equal uh and it'll broadcast happy new year so we still have some code to do here but it's very short so let's just finish this up real quick broadcast happy new year and now let's finish up the code so when i start as a clone it will go to the front layer so it's in front of the happy new year the match all that good stuff and it will show and set size to 100 and now it will point in direction 45 so it's a little bit tilted to give some kind of effect so 45 and now it will repeat until it's touching the match you know follow your mouse pointer so so go to mouse player let's just move that a little bit and go to mouse pointer and then switch costume to costume 2. so switch costume to costume 2. and now it will start sound poising so let's get oh it's already here oh that's probably because i put in the backpack but that's fine so it should be inside the sound thing so start sound toysing and it will wait until now it's down and now it will set a new variable x because it has to follow your mouse so set x set and y yeah but yeah so y and so set x to mouse x so that's just one of these and then duplicate that set y to mouse y so it will follow your mouse and now it will glide 0.5 seconds to where you have clicked to shoot oh yeah not this one sorry uh glide 0.5 seconds to mouse pointer and now it would change counter by one because you shot one firework so it would change the counter and when it gets to five it'll do the amazing happy new year thing so so change counter by one and then hide and then it will broadcast so yeah let's see if it works so let's see if it works it works but we just don't have the sparkle effect yet so let's zoom out so then you can see out the code feel free to pause here so feel free to pause and suck in all this code so just in case if you did uh if you missed some so now let's go to the sparkles and work on the sparkles so when the green flag is clicked it will erase all so by the way if you do not know there's this button called ad extension there's music pen video sensing all of these and we just click pen and we already have it here because it was from a backpack so it will erase all because in the beginning you always have to erase all the graphic effects that you made earlier and then it will hide and it'll wait one second and it will go to the front layer and after that i'll repeat 200 times to give effect and it will create a clone of myself so just make a bunch of effects uh some little sparkles some that's just very cool for some effect and now when i receive bang it will start the sound gong which we don't have yet so let's just get that yep this is a gong and it'll start on gong and you'll repeat 100 times for effect and it'll change color effect by two so just some effect added to the sparkles so and then when i receive bang it will set color so this is also for effects so there's a lot of effects that we could use to make this improve so set color effect to pick random negative 100 to positive 100 so there's a bunch of colors that the scratch the the thing makes there's a lot of colors to pick from so now let's when i receive bang it will it will set speed we have to make a new variable speed as always so it'll set speed to pick random 0.1 to three to give more effect and it'll set ghost effect to zero so this is just a bunch of effects we could use and set ghost effect to zero and it will change color effect by 25. and now it will set the pen color so this is just a bunch of set the pen color to a pick random of 50 to 500 so there's a bunch of colors that we could pick from here 50 to 500 and now pen up and it will go to x and then you put an x inside the x and you'll go to y y that's where you i'll put your mouse and you explode the thing so that's exactly where the sparkles are going to be so now um we'll put pen down to draw it yes pin down and now we will point in direction uh point in direction pick in a point in direction negative 180 pick random so pick random negative 180 to positive 180 so there's different directions and it'll explode in different directions with this piece of code so and now it will show and it will reset the timer and now it will repeat 30 times move speed steps speed steps and so it's a random amount of steps it will move so we just put 0.1 to 3 so it'll move speed steps so it'll be just random and we have our change y by zero minus timer and now it will repeat another 30 so let's get that repeat another 30. set speed to speed time so you have a times reported times here and then put set speed to speed times 0.9 so since you throw the firework and it goes fast fast and then slow it's because you have to the times just by 0.9 because anything times a decimal will make it smaller so that'll be a smaller value so it will go slower so go fast and then it'll go slow so that's the point of this piece and then it'll move speed steps we already have that over here move speed steps and i'll change ghost effect put that inside there chain ghost effect uh so it just fades away for extra effect so it will just fade away and i'll pick random one two three and it'll hide and it'll erase all it'll just repeat after that so hide and erase all so that's our code so let's make sure we got all this code and i know that's a really big script so i'm just going to try to make sure so feel free to pause and see if you got everything done so yeah so uh and we just tested out the game it was all wrong so we had to do something and we just found out that the speed is only for this sprite only so it's only for the sparkles so i'm going to rename this speed 2 so we know which one's speed and which one's the real speed so let's make a new variable called speed and for this sprite only not for all sprites this is a private variable so for this right only and then so the reason for this is that if you throw a firecracker and all the sparkles will move differently so let's replace all the speeds with speed twos with speed so speed uh do we have any more speed to instead put speed in so let's replace this with speed and set this to speed and then one more and there we go so now i think the the sparkles will move correctly so we got all the speeds and now i'm going to delete speed 2 so now it's gone and let's do this so okay so let's try this so you have the thing you throw so uh we just i just found out that my dot is just a little bit too big for the other one so that's why it's making it so i'm just gonna shrink this a little bit hopefully i think that's big enough so let's just try one more time okay so yeah let's try it yeah it's still a little bit too big delicious yeah there we go hopefully this is big enough now so now let's move on to the happy new and year 2022 so this is really easy code so let's just finish this wrap this up real quick so when the green flag is clicked he'll hide and clear graphic effects and it will point in direction 90 and it will go to x so it will be all the way back 400 why uh 139 doesn't really matter and when i receive happy new year then i will show and it will glide one second to negative 102 y this is already the right coordinates because it'll just glide like whoo and then it will broadcast move new which will move the new sprite then yeah the new sprite so let's just click right move new and then it will go forever and change color effect by 1. just perfect and now we move to new so on new when the green flag is clicked it will clear graphic effects will hide it'll point in direction 90 it'll go to x400 why yeah 142 that's fine and when i receive move new it will wait one second and it will show and it will glide one second to the position it's already at because that's where we want the new to be and i'll broadcast move here and this will trigger year so broadcast move here and then it will go forever and change color effect by one now let's move to year so we have to go to here now so when the green flag is clicked it will clear graphic effects it will hide and it will go to x 400 so it's all the way in the back why 72 ish it's fine and i'm gonna go to back to here and just try to do that and just change it up real quick so when i receive move year then it will wait one second show glide one second to a different position so let's just drag in the position is gliding to now where's the light there we go and no broadcast instead of move year you'll have to broadcast move 2022 and we have to go to 2022 now and i'm just going to drag this across because i think we just need to do some tweaking and that'll be all good so let's go to 2022 and clear graphic effects hide and instead yeah go to and then when i receive move move 2022 and it'll wait one second show glide one second to a new position should be about the same oh and it won't broadcast this time because that's the last one so this is our project let's just hide the variables real quick and let's get let's try it so yeah we just have to hide speed so let's uh open this and let's see so you click on the firecracker you light it you throw it and it explodes so you have to do that uh sometimes new year 2022 and they're all in different colors so yeah here we have it make speed for this sprite only instead of making a public variable so please just do that and yeah i'll see you guys next please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below and see you guys next time you
