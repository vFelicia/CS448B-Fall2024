hey guys it's kids from playground here welcome and we're in the second part of um the christmas decorator so if you don't have any of this code you can totally copy it out right now um feel free to pause the video so we have this we have this we have this we have all of this so if you don't have any of this i'm gonna go here so you can guys can copy this down feel free to pause so these are these three parts you can copy off of these three parts right now feel free to pause the video if if you don't have time to um copy off that quickly and candy cane it should be really simple just like that same with the stocking we're still in the um backdrop we didn't do yet so let's work on the music cuz i like music so uh let's get on the music so so when the green flag is clicked for music so we gotta add the extension so there's music pen video sensing blah blah blah text the speech maki makey i've used most of all of these so um uh the music should be really simple it's not it takes a lot of time to do it but it will it's pretty simple and it's easy to code do it in the backdrop because it can play sounds so um go forever play note play note 64. so when you click on this so when you click on this it will find a whole entire piano keyboard and um let's see so if i have a whole entire piano so i i know how to play piano because i do play piano so this is the c this is d this is e this is f this is g this is um a this is b and this is c again so um so we're not going to use i think we're not going to use a c or any of this stuff so we're going to use 64 which is e so e and then we could just duplicate this because it's our jingle bell so we can duplicate this again what it keeps on playing so i think it's so it's here for uh seven times and the third one you gotta make it point seven five a little bit longer like that if you ever heard jingle bells it's like the third beat it has that so let's duplicate so you can already hear the uh um thing this is 0.7 as well so let's hear this so let's see it so we need another of these 0.25 oh yeah 0.25 soon so it's a 0.25 another 0.25 and uh 0.75 a 0.25 a 0.25 and another 0.75 so we need six of those and another of those put this right on the bottom and we have to play a different note so let's go let's see so to play 67 which is it's uh g so 67 then back to and then 60 we do you see i actually think we do yeah and then the 62 i think 62 is is d so uh for 0.25 beats and then play note 64 64 for zero for one b just one b and let's do this so we're gonna play note 65 for 0.25 beats and duplicate this again because we're playing this again and then we're going to add this on and then play note 65 4.5 which is larger than 0.25 which is 0.50 which is 0.50 so 0.5 and then we have 65 again right over here so i think we should hear it first because yeah this is good yeah okay and then um duplicate this is 64. 4.25 um six four and then another one another six four so a six five another six five two more six fours another six four and so i'm missing two six four so let's put this on uh and then we need a six two which is possibly d and another six two four point five instead of uh uh uh 0.25 and then let's do 64 again or 0.25 beats and then we play 62 for 0.75 uh and play 67 67 40.5 piece so we did not finish the whole entire jingle bells because it's just like a part of it is just so much so you guys can um definitely watch a tutorial how to play on a piano and then um and then do it on your own and finish the jingle bells if you want and then we're gonna work on the snow so i'm gonna show you how it works so right now we have the santa the jingle bells are playing stocking candy cane gift box gift tree so we put on the forever so make it go on forever so let's work on the snow now so this has a lot of code so let's start on our variables so we're going to make a variable called wind so when the green flag is clicked it'll go forever let's zoom in a little bit and it'll set wind to pick random one negative one to one so make like the wind go like the snow go around here so let's see so when the when when the green flag is clicked we'll set ghost effect to a hundred and it'll go to the position i already have it and the y240 change this and forever it'll create a clone of myself and i'll wait a pic random of seconds so it'll wait pick random one two zero zero point zero zero five to zero point zero and it still will start falling so when i start as a clone go set size to pick random 60 to 90 so it'll be 60 to 100 you can do that if you want so some snow will be bigger some snow will be smaller and it'll go to oh go to pick random let's just duplicate this pick random uh negative 240 to 240 and the y is 220. it's gonna be all around here because this is x and this is y so it'll be all around here i'll repeat four times no change ghost effect by net minus 20 so yeah change ghost effect by minus 20 negative 20. so this will make it more dimmer which is um yeah which is good so i'll repeat two times you know change y by negative five so fall down and then we'll change x by wind so go around in a round and round yeah so so i got below to the right so that's basically what the wind is and a little bit to the left so and i'll repeat until so there's a lot of hunka code here so i'll repeat until so actually this is not needed what i just coded is not needed this part so we can just move into here and then delete the repeat two times and put this back up so um you know or and uh another or and another or and an another or and another or which is the fourth form so four wars five things so if it's touching the gift box or it's touching so i'm just gonna duplicate this we're touching the the tree which is the christmas tree i don't know if it's touching the same time then the santa and or the candy cane or the sock which is the stocking or the oopsies you need this ore to be inside or this sock or the edge um you'll disappear so let's do this do it where is it where's edge right there so a bunch of words so and let's work on some other things so let's repeat until re i mean repeat 10 times in an if then statement if then it's not touching color white where's this white uh then it will change y by minus negative two minus two change y and then you'll change x by a divide by the wind divided by 2.5 you know else else go to the ghost effect and we'll change the ghost effect let's change ghost effect by 10 outside of here so i'm in the delete the clone right afterwards so delete outside so let's try sorry about this guys but we do actually need to repeat two times um i thought we that was not needed but it actually is so um so we have to do the touching edge so because um if it doesn't that means it uh it will get on the it will touch the edge which is on the top so it will disappear in the top so you need to repeat two times change y by minus five and i just duplicate it now let's try it see look it's working yay so so um look it's it's not it's not touching the um the when it touches the candy cane it goes away yeah but we didn't do the tree because the tree um but when it's touching the present box the gift box or the anyways um i think that might be it for this video um please like share subscribe and yeah um let's rename this before we go uh christmas tree decorator so so let's type that so let's do this so anyways see you guys for this uh video merry christmas and see you guys next time you
