hello guys welcome back to the channel so this is part three of the duckton game so the part two uh video we did was uh we actually make the duck kind of flies around on the screen um and then now in this part we'll work on shooting the ducks and then like uh if it gets shot then the duck falls down and the dog can pick up the ducks and then if you miss then it flies away so hopefully we have enough time to do this one and now maybe after this maybe one more tutorial thing should be done okay so without further ado let's jump right in so where we left off last time was the duck we got all the uh custom block here where we're calling when the game start so now we are going to work on the shot fire so this is where we should fire the shot you see the the target when we click on it with the mouse down uh with broadcast shot fire right so now let's go to the duck okay all right so we'll go right down here so when uh i receive shot fire okay let me zoom in a little bit okay so what we're going to do is we're going to drag in the if and else okay and then we are going to go to sensing uh if it's touching the mouse pointer basically we check if the if the shot fire and then it actually touched the mouse pointer uh what we're going to do is we're going to say replace so we're going to replace the index where we were using earlier right where we have it up here right where we're using create the index with the uh the like one two three i think i explained that before basically using the 10 minus the count of the duck cow right into the first stock then it could be it will be one second that would be two and so on right okay so what we're going to do is we're going to replace this thing uh with negative with positive one so that means the gut shot okay and then we're going to set this duck shot to one so that means it got shot so they will actually stop the loop here you see how this loop only works if the duct shot is zero basically the duct will continue flying also here duck is shot is zero that means the duck is not dead or content you're moving up and down but as as soon as you get hit by the ducks uh the by the bullets we'll set it to one so it will stop these two loop from executing okay stop this guy in this guy okay all right so i hope you understand that so now let's continue so what we're going to do is put a little bit of weight here 0.2 second and then what we're going to do is we're going to switch to costume so switch the costume to duck seven so duck seven is the duck that is getting hit right before it falls down on uh dot eight so i'm gonna switch it to duct seven and then we'll broadcast a message okay say die okay so the kill okay after that so else will replace okay down here so if you miss uh we are going to replace the the index position to negative one so resetting it to negative one like we had here okay so what it's going to do is going to if it misses it will set it back to negative one when the duct is flying we're gonna set it to zero so just like how we headed up here let me zoom back out right here so when the duct is flying was set to zero so if i run this the first time you you see that it becomes zero so that means that one is active so if it gets shot then we're going to change this to one if it miss or set it to the negative one so we're using this if we can control the uh the stuck getting the shot and then those sprites okay so after that uh we are going to grab a another condition here okay put this under here we are going to use a uh a n block so basically we are going to check if the duck has if the player have enough bullets okay so if the bullet is equal to zero or n the duck shot is zero so basically you did not shoot the duck and you have no more bullets okay block shot is zero then we're going to broadcast a message say no more bullets okay all right okay so we have broadcast.die right so we're gonna coat the duct die in no more bullets okay so let's move down a little bit here okay let's do it here so when i receive the die right i guess i don't have any more space i might have to move up later okay so when that when the ducks die we're gonna say change the score by one okay so we get one point so if you want to give more point you can change it to ten okay and then we're gonna have to use a little bit of weight so that way it will try to set everything correctly so we're gonna put a half a second away here point zero five seconds okay then we are going to change the ducts to number eight costume which is the duck dying which is this one okay dying like this okay i'm gonna change it to this guy and then we are going to use a repeat until loop and then we're going to use the sensing and we want to sense until it touched ground basically touching this this sprite you see this right when i click it so basically when the duck dying is flying down we and you touch this then we are going to hide it okay so repeat until touch that so we what we want to do is make every time you know subtract uh uh subtract the change of y by minus four so slowly falling down okay and then we can play the sound start the sound drop so let's look at the sound here with duck drop and duck sound so duck drop is like this okay like boom like that okay and we are going to hide this stuff and then we have to use a stop other script and sprite okay stop our script inspired basically stop this thing and with a broadcast a message so basically we want to stop this and then we'll broadcast a message so the duck will not be moving again okay so it says dog caught so the dog catch the ducks okay all right okay so for no more bullet we also need to do something here we'll say no more bullets what we're going to do is we'll set the duct shot to negative one so he did not shoot the ducks okay go negative one we are going to do a weight uh 0.2 second and then we're gonna broadcast a message okay so it's a new message and it says fly away so basically you miss and the flight it flew away okay all right so for fly away you miss the ducks then what we want to do is we're gonna use the two broadcasts actually we're gonna have to use two of them so the first one uh fly away uh what we're going to do is we're going to animate the ducks just like how we did for the uh you know when the duck is flying like uh let me see where it is just like how we did you know up here you see this so we do something similar okay all right so let's just copy this set of code here let's just take it down here for now and let's go back to this okay so we're not using a forever loop we're gonna have to use a repeat loop repeat until loop okay so repeat until sensing will be saying touching edge okay so basically making the duck slowly fly up or to the side here and then slowly go away so whenever i touch the edge basically the left side right side or the top since it will not be in the bottom so it doesn't really matter so repeat that and then just take this out okay so we don't need this we don't need that okay but we are going to change it to dot one dot two and duck three so that one dot two and duck three are the one that's flying away you see this one and this one okay so we're gonna use those three so this is for animating it and we need another one um to move him up and down so we don't want to touch this loop let this enemy it's going and then we're gonna use another broadcast that way you know this can do his own thing and then the other code can do its own thing okay so when i receive fly away again uh we'll switch to custom one just to be safe that should be okay but let's switch into cluster one first which is the flying ducks flying up right and then we have a repeat until also but i will not use this so repeat until touching edge we are going to change the y by five change point so basically it will slowly slowly moving up like this okay change the y by five and change x oops sorry change the x okay change the x by the duct speed so wherever however the duct was flying before however fast it is it can't do that and also we want to have a if and else condition okay so if let's check the operator and we are going to check the direction so basically if the duck is flocked facing the left side will continue to face the left side and fly away if the duck let's say face the right side then we'll continue to face the right side fly away that's what we want to do so we're going to check the direction so the direction is less than zero right less than zero meaning like negative 90 or something then it will be facing to the left right this is positive 90. so if i change it to negative 90 you can see it facing to the left so negative 90. if it's positive 90 it's facing to the right so i'm checking if the direction is less than zero let's say less than negative 90 is less than zero right so that means it's facing to the left then we will say change x by what we're going to do is we're going to use the operator this is the multiply so we'll use a multiply we're gonna multiply by a negative one so it will whatever the duck speed is it will it will kind of go like kind of like moving to the left and keep going okay actually we actually don't need this sorry let's put this in here okay let's try like this i think my uh my oco has it up here as well and down here i don't think we need that i think this should be okay enough and then when it gets to the end we want to hide it so let me zoom out again you can see the whole thing so we'll say hi and then we're gonna broadcast a new event uh new message say dog so if you miss the ducks the dog's gonna laugh at you okay all right okay so we're gonna test it out a little bit what i did is i kind of moved this guy to the side here so we can see a little bit better let's test it out so as you can see the duck is flying uh shoot him let's see oh come on so we saw you see when i showed him we change that and it falls down you see this become one you see that so let's run it again so this is zero so you see that it changed these shapes so the duct is on left side kind of fall down to the left if it's right it'll fall down to the right so we only have one ducks right now okay so let's say i missed so you see the duck flew away right but what we have to do is we're going to change it to the background to make it fly away also right and the dog has to laugh at you we haven't done that yet but if you can see this is kind of working fine where we shoot the box if you're able to put the box you know it changed the costume and then fell down right just like what we coded for right we just coated this part so this is the way you have the ducts falling down right and it died okay all right let's zoom out a little bit so what we did was we did the shot okay uh when they shot the duck then then we did the duck dying and then we did the uh no more bullets and there's no mobile duck will fly away until so we see if the duck is on the left side will continue fly away on the left side the right side continue to fly the weight on the right side let's say i missed three times you see the duck is on the right side will continue to fly up so if i miss let's say the duck is on the left side let me see stuff is on the left side and this is it the duck is flying on the left side okay all right so that's what we had so far okay so now what we want to do is go to the backdrop okay so go to backdrop uh what we're going to say is if the fly away and we are going to change this to backdrop number two okay so backdrop number two is this pink backdrop fly away but uh what we're going to do is we're going to change back to the first backdrop later when we have started again so we'll call that for for now let's just keep that so if you missed it if you missed three shot so let's say when you still shot you say fly away okay okay all right so let's put him back on this one okay let's go back now let's go work on the dog catching the ducks right if you if you if the duck die we want to go where the duck fall down the dog is going to appear and pick it up so let me take out this part first for now we'll we'll show this later for you so let's take that out first so let's go to the dock so i took this out so that's faster so don't have to dock like kind of block and then jump to the back with with the green flag and start again but in reality this had to be like this okay but i just just disconnect this for now so it's faster for coding and testing okay so we uh we're here okay so when the dog when the duck uh when you shoot the duck and the duck die your dog caught duck right so we're gonna call this one first so let's go to the event stop caught the duck we are going to play a sound so called duck okay so basically it's like the sound and then something like that so when they cut the duck and we are going to say go to okay uh we are going to use the y we're going to put like negative 20. okay so the dog is somewhere there and then the x position we don't take a sensing we're gonna go to where the duck uh landed so we're gonna use sensing here use this block so be sure to select the back part first so you have to select duck and then you select the x position okay and you put that here so after that you switch it switch to costume okay switch the costume to dog number eight so number eight let's take a look so number eight is this this dog with one duck so we only have one ducks in our game right now so it shows only one ducks we don't have two ducks or three ducks so these maybe later so so for now we'll use this one duck okay and then we say go to back layer okay basically i want him to go behind the ground the ground sprite so the ground grass will cover a little bit of him and then he'll go in the back layer okay so let's go back here so after that we're gonna say show since we hide the dog right after the dog jumped in behind the dock we're gonna show it okay yeah we're gonna put a wait one second so the player can see the duck getting you know the dog pick up the ducks and we're gonna hide the ducks again i mean hide the dog again and then we're gonna broadcast a new message and this message is called start again okay start again okay so this will allow the dog the uh the game to start again so after this okay so let's test that really quick so let's see so we shoot the problem let's see so you see that the dog comes up and pick up the duck wherever you shot the duck so let's say you shot the duck over here you see he comes up over here so if i if the duck is on this side so he comes up right here okay all right so this is where we have the dog kind of pick up the ducks okay so next we are going to call the dog when you miss so the dog laughs so what we're going to do is we're going to switch the costume to 11 so 11 is where the dog laugh at you okay all right and 12 is also left so too custom so what we do the similar thing we have this duct showing so we also want to go to the back layer okay go to the back layer and then we're gonna we are going to say uh same thing so we are going to say uh similar to what this position here is so what we're going to say is put this over here and then we'll put it at negative 20 as well but uh for the position we'll just do a random so some somewhere between negative 120 to 120 so somewhere between the tree here and this bush here so all pop up and laugh at you and we still show and then start the sound okay and then this is dark left okay so if you missed the dog will laugh at you and then we need another one so when i receive knock knock again so we want to keep let this thing do its own thing and we're going to use another thing to animate the dot so i'm going to use a repeat three time and then we are going to switch the costume to dog 11 okay both dog in 11 and 12 are laughing so what we're going to do is we're going to use this and i'll say 0.2 second and we're gonna duplicate that and we're going to put dot 12 0.2 seconds after that we are going to hide the dot and then we're going to broadcast the same message here okay start again okay so this is what we have so far so let's save it so we have the dog catching the ducks dog laughing at you and dog laughing at you as well so this is the uh showing up where to show up this is what is doing the laughing animation okay all right so let's continue with this so now let's let's try it out so so let's see what i miss so you can see fly away the dog laugh at you but where to change it back also right so let's go back to the background here okay so when i say receive start again where we are telling the the doctor if you miss or you get the dog right both both scenario we start again right both if you cut the duck or if you miss still start again right so when i start again we're gonna switch it back to background number one okay all right so let's test it out so now i said this is it fly away after that just switch it back to this so let's say if i catch the duck so this is correct right okay all right so this is how it looks like so let's code this last piece and then we'll probably call this a uh end of this tutorial and then we'll have to do one uh one more probably to finish up the rest okay okay okay so let's try to finish this real quick when green flap is clicked we are gonna go to um negative 35 150 that is around this area here i think right now is behind it but uh once we code it you'll see it so what we're going to do is we're going to say hi in the beginning we don't want to show because the dog is kind of walking around and then when we say game start okay so next we have this one here when game start start game what we want to do is we're gonna do a little bit of weight first wait until the uh the hit and everything set up and then we're gonna place these guys on here okay so this is our first duck okay so we're gonna switch to dark white dark white is this costume here you can see it really well it's like kind of white here and then dark red is the red costume okay so we're gonna switch the ducks okay so we're to switch it to the duck white and what we're going to do is make it go to the front layer so that will show up and then we're going to use the shield okay after that we are going to use a repeat and we'll repeat five times uh what we want to do we want to flash it so make sure look like flashing a little bit so what we're going to do is use the set okay we're going to set the ghost effect 100 okay and then we're going to use a little bit of weight 0.25 one fourth of a second and we're gonna duplicate this and then we uh stop this thing we're gonna put it to zero okay after that we're gonna set the ghost effect back to zero okay so that will show up again okay and then so let's see how that works and then when the shot fire we have to because of this shot fire right you remember when the when the gunshot fire and we had to check if the the ducks got hit right here also right with the uh sharp fire we check if the uh the the uh the duck got hit or not it was get hit then we put one if it's not got hit with but negative one right so here we we have to check that so when the shot fire okay shot fire what we're going to do is we're going to wait one second so make sure let let let the uh let this cold finish to set everything first and then we'll we'll do this so so we'll let that wait put the wait one second there so we had to set the uh the list right remember we're using this list so we're gonna set this guy to one not zero or you know zero is when it's starting one is when it got hit negative one is if it missed or in the beginning we set it all to negative one right so basically here we need a um if and else condition okay come move this like this a little bit over so in here what we're going to do is we're going to check the operator uh here we're gonna check the item in the list so this is the item in the list so item item number one which is the first item here okay if it's equal to one that means the duck got shot then we're gonna change it to the red ducks so we're gonna say change the costume to red dogs otherwise we're gonna change it to the white ducks okay so now let's test it out real quick so you can see it's zero right now see this is the uh it blinks you so you can see right if i start you see the the dots kind of blink blink blink that means this is the duck that we are working with so let's see if i i missed it so i missed it it's still a white ducks but if i get it get the ducks then you see it becomes a better so you see that so that's how this works so we're gonna keep track of that okay so we have our first red ducks and then we can like next one we'll start again and then new ducks flies up and then shoot them so i think the video is already a little bit too long so we'll stop right here for now so the next video will completely probably complete the game i think that should be able to do for the next video and uh yeah if you enjoyed the video please uh give us a thumbs up and share with your friends and put a comment alright thank you see you guys next time bye
