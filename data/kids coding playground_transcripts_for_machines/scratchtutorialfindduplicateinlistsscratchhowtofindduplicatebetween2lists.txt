hello guys and welcome back to kids coating playground i haven't done a video in a while i'm going to do this one video recording uh list so we have a subscriber who asks us a question regarding lists after watching our first video on list and i had some questions regarding uh how to find duplicate items between the two lists as you can see um it mentioned here like the list having the first list having some number and the second list having some number and we're trying to find out what are the duplicates between the two lists so i will show you guys how to do that today i mean there might be uh there's two a couple ways to do it but i will show you some easier way to do it okay so uh what are we going to learn today we'll learn the following concept custom block loops index and different type of list blocks and for example we have a list like this we have a 2 list the user enter 12 14 6 4 11 and then second list 13 43 34 16 21 as a human we can really easy to see that six and six is duplicate right but uh we have to understand how we can make the uh you know the computer to see that so we will have to go through the list i'll find the find the duplicate so we'll show you how to do that in this scratch video all right so let me just run the uh the video once for you uh run the example so let's say we we play this let me make this bigger so let's say we we play we start this so what we have to do is we have to click on this sprite here so we'll click on her she'll ask ask enter a first list of items separated by comma so we can enter let's say i will say my example we enter 12 comma 14 comma 6 for 11 okay and then we ask for a second uh set of number so what we can do is let me open up the list object so you can see okay let's go back to variable here uh we'll open up the list okay these are the two lists that we have okay all right let's go back in here so where they enter the second sets of number so all right let's paste it here so we have 13 43 34 6 and 21. so as you can see um there's one more duplicate value in the two list and the number is six so as you can see i find the number six which in this two list so it doesn't matter it could be more right we could have a six number here and three number here doesn't matter it will still find it okay so how do we do that okay so that's a couple of ways actually to do it you can do it either breaking up the item i actually have two uh method to do that to break up the item uh if you want more information you can go to our youtube channel and go to about and then go to the uh actual uh our uh account and see so i'll there's two way to break the item i have a breakdown the first version of it and then another version of it so there's a couple way that you could break your item so i'll show you the one version if you want more information how to do it like two different version then you go to our account and there's a also a couple of ways that you could break the uh you have to find the duplicates you can have duplicates you can find by this or this so you can loop through it uh using two loops or you can use the uh first loop and then you can do a uh uh contains items also so these will to work so i'll just show you one way if you want more information how to do that you can look at that so we'll just start a new project okay okay so well okay so i have some sprite array load in my background so making things a little faster so i'll drag this into here so let me delete mine so i have this i don't need the cat i'll delete the cat so i have the this and then i have the giga so i'll put key on the front so you're gonna stand up on the wooden stool here i just created that for her okay all right so how do we do this so um all right okay so first we'll make a list block so let's make a list block we'll call it a list one which is the first list and we'll make another one called list2 which is the second list so as you can see we have two lists here okay so far so now let's go to um this um set up the sprite so for the for this gigan this uh here so we have to um go to uh event start let me zoom in a little bit so we'll start and then what we do is we're gonna go to go to front layer for now i think she's already in the front left but if not you can so you can say um go to front layer and then we're gonna delete the uh the list so we'll clear up the list so every time the uh stop uh the code start the game start will delete the list it's not really a game it's a primal but this concept so and then we are going to make one more actually temp list so this will use it we'll use it to uh find the duplicates later so this is temporary list that we'll also use to break down the uh the what user enter so we'll have three lists for now so we have a list one list two and a template this is temporary list okay all right okay so we're gonna make a uh when the sprite is clicked uh we are going to do something so let's go here when the sprite is clicked well again we'll clean this up just in case you know they didn't click on the stop button they just click on that we also want to do that and also we'll ask so enter first list of item separated by commas okay okay we'll have the first uh ask right so as we we know right there when they ask something it always goes to the answer so answer will have that uh whatever the user typed in so what we need to do is we let's say uh for now let's look at this so let's say we have um say and then we will go answer so we click on giga she'll ask right so let's say we put some number here some number here right so as you can see the answer has these numbers right so we have the number so what we have to do we're going to break it up and put them in the list so that's the little bit uh tricky part i think that's the hardest part and then the other part is just uh finding the duplicate so let's let's do that so uh what we have to do is we are going to create a custom block for this okay all right so we'll go my block let's zoom out a little bit back out we are going to say break this so this is uh when the player uh type in the the number we're gonna break it apart so um you can say uh at the uh input say list of items okay and then you can add another one uh which list meaning uh which list they want to put this ender in so we have this so far so let me move this over here a little bit so we'll i'll define block here okay and also we have to define some variable all right so we'll make some variable here index so index is for uh basically uh checking uh you know where the uh where the loop is going through so we can use that so we're gonna make another variable called word uh it can be anything i mean number right now but you can't have word also basically we're joining multiple numbers together let's say you have a number like 12 right you have to actually put them together right so we'll use the word so that we could join later and then uh we'll have to make one more variable called ready to add meaning uh we'll just know when we can add it to the list so we'll have this for now uh if you want you can also show it uh to debug right to understand how it works so let's go so we'll say the index so we'll set index to one since uh scratch user uh index the loop as one other program they use zero so uh scratch where to use one uh next we'll set the word uh so what we're going to do we're gonna just delete that zero i'm making a blank then next we will say um red to add we'll say no saying n so not ready to add and also we want to clean this list so um next time you could call multiple time we want to make sure that this temporary list is clear uh so now let's go to the let's use a repeat until loop so this repeat until loop is we're going to loop to the whatever user typed in and then we're going to break it apart so what we can do is we are going to use this index variable and we also have to use the greater than sign okay so we'll go to index so right now the index is one we're gonna put the uh the whether you some of these operator here that's something called linked off so you can drag this item so this will check how long the the user typed in whatever they typed in how long it is we'll look through that each letter at a time okay and then we have to set a um we need another variable actually one more uh this will say um current character so this is the current character of the player whatever player typed in that the loop is going to we're going to pick up each character or number or whatever for this case we're using number okay so we are going to say set we're going to set the current character to okay the letter of index right so this will be one so it will pick up let's say we have a number uh 12 right uh we'll pick up the first number will be which is one so we have to say list of item so this is picking up the first number of whatever or whatever the user typed in okay so we're gonna set that to the current character okay okay so uh so since user type in it could have uh you know uh spaces between the number uh and the comma or they don't put spaces so what we want to do we want to take out those spaces uh what you can do is um you can use the control if here okay let's zoom back out a little bit so we say if operator we are going to use the not operator here okay and then we are going to use the equal and then we're going to go to get the variable so we're going to put a space so type a spacebar here so basically it is equal to the space if it's not equal to the space then what we want to do we're going to add this to the list so we are going to add this current character into the temporary list so oh so as you can see it is keep adding into twenty thousand right two hundred thousand here because we have we have we did not increase the index right so let's keep going forever so make sure we have to increase the index right so we have to say change all right change the index by one right every time it goes up by one so we'll stop so and then what we want to do is also we want to add one more comma to the end of that list so that later on we would break it up it will be easier i'll show you what i mean so let's go over here we'll have one more here so uh we're gonna we're going to check the index okay we're going to check this index if it's at the very end so how do we know is the very end we have the length right we have the length of this right so whatever you type in it will tell you what what is at the very end so it is the index is equal to the length of this meaning at the very end what we are going to do is we are going to add add a comma so we're going to use this to break up the uh the thing uh the list later so add the comma to the temporary list okay all right okay we'll zoom back out a little bit so what we're going to do is we are going to test it out right so we're going to go to my block uh we're going to put uh somewhere else in the list of item which is user typed in and we put one so we will put into the first list but right now we haven't done anything with that so for right now just watch over here right see how this will work so let's say we click on this uh this uh this sprite here and we'll put in some numbers okay 12 14 6 4 11. so when we do this you can see that it breaks it up into 12 comma 14 comma 4 comma 11 and then extra comma at the end that's where this comma come from actually comma then so you can break it up so you can see we break it into a temporary list and then after that we are going to run a loop through this list and then pick up all the number that is uh divided by the comma and then we're gonna put it into this list so that's what we're going to do next okay so uh we already uh use the index right so we have to reset the index back to 1 because we have changed some number right we won't reuse a variable so in order to reuse your variable right you have to make sure that you reset it so we'll reset it back to 1 oops sorry so we'll put this index back to one so that we could reuse this okay now we are going to grab another uh for our repeat until loop under here uh what we're going to do is we are going to uh uh check the chat go to the loop again so what we're going to do is we are going to say the index the index is greater than if it's greater than the length of so this is the not the length of a word this is the length of the list so i'll tell you how many items are there so let's say if i say length of temporary list here you click on this you see 13 so that's 13 elements in this list right so look through 13 times so um here it will loop through 13 time and then um what we can do is say if and then we have to use this not operator not and then um uh before that i missed something here i need to get the uh characters right we need to just like we did earlier whether pick up the character here so same thing uh above here we're using the character the letter of the uh index of this right here we're gonna do a little bit different we're gonna we are going to use the index of the list so here you will say uh item okay and then you put the index so let's say one the one of this will be uh whatever zero i mean it clears it out right now because of uh that i accidentally rented code but whatever the number is it will pick up the first number on that list right so um let's say you have 11 so this will pick up one okay um so you have the current character after that we are going to check we are going to check uh check this current character okay um what we are going to do is not equal and we have say current character not equal to the comma so where we adding the comma right so we put in the comma we know how we divide the number okay if it's not equal to the comma then we have to set this variable uh what we're going to do is we're going to use this word called word so basically we're going to join something together um so we will call this join so the first time a joiner will put the word in uh first time the word doesn't have anything so that word is blank right now we reset it to blank key up here so as you can see it won't have anything the first time it runs through okay so and then we will join the current character so we'll be blank plus that whatever the current character right it will be one right and then uh okay i messed up a little bit i have i should have used if and else instead of if uh so let me change that out right now so this will go in here this goes here let's throw this away put this back in here okay else so the else part is we are going to say um set another variable so it's ready to add so uh once we we have added the number uh or not joining this another comma we know that okay we have created that word and ready to add so that that means that the number is formed before we put into the uh to the list okay and then we have to have the if statement here okay so we'll go back to here so you should have to have the if statement and now what we're going to do is we're going to check this ready to add so when it runs through multiple time it can it can it can be different right so let's say you type into a number 11. so when they pick up the first number one he will not put ready to add it will try to go to the next number which is 11 the next one so it will combine it to become 11 before it adds that's why you need this variable to check that okay we'll say if this variable ready to add is equal to y right and then we will also check which list we want to put it on uh since we don't we have we the user can have two lists right so so we can use it if and else here uh what we can do is uh we're gonna use the equal check again and then we'll grab this which lists from here okay okay i hope you guys are following up uh following it so far so i say okay which list one so basically if it's the first list uh what we're going to do is we are going to add it to the list one okay add things let's add things to this right you see that so what we're going to do is we are going to add word so where we formed that number right whatever it would and else we'll put it into list two okay all right because we only have two lists here if it's not one it has to be two okay and then what we need to do was to reset the variable word so every time it once we add it we need to reset the word back to blank okay and also we need to uh reset the uh the ready to add right to back to no okay and this has to be underneath this else here okay and one more thing we have to increase the index of the loop so we go to the next uh next uh next uh position so we say index uh hope not set sorry change change index by one so we'll put it underneath here okay so let's test this if it works correctly if it works correctly it will break up the list i'll put in this temporary list first and then we'll push it into this list one okay let's click on her it empties out everything so as we we are going to pick up the number i already typed it up and then i put it here and it's not working so when we do coding there's always some error right so never works the first time so that's why we have the debug okay so as you can see i made a mistake right here i i use this one the item to get in the index of this one this one is always empty right so that's not correct so this should be the template okay now let's try it again okay we'll click on her and we'll get the number here i have it on the side and i put it in and okay so you can see it breaks up 12 14 6 4 11 into the list one so it breaks it up you use the temporary list to go through uh whatever user typed in it first put it on this is temporary list then it will run another loop through here in the bottom picking up each item here uh separated by the comma if it's not a comma it'll add it together so opex it up picks up first one they'll pick up the one then they'll pick up the two then he see a comma he created the word and he say ready to add then he'll add 12 onto it then it'll go to the next one one and then they pick up one and then pick up four and then add the word uh four here together and then we'll put 14 and then it goes to a comma go to the six and then six has nothing to be uh to uh to uh to uh pick up so he know that okay that's that's just uh so it's not a comma so six on this it will join this so join this uh uh clear the water make sure we clear the word in the bottom right once we clear will be blank we'll join six six and then it'll say ready to add um else goes to the comma it says okay ready to add put a y and then add it so that's why we put an extra comma at the end here if we don't do that just ready to add this uh this will not get to the ready to add for y so the 11 will be missing so let's say we didn't have this um this uh ready to add right you uh you we don't have that extra comma at the end you'll see that would be a problem so let's say i didn't have this right i took this piece out right and only had this here right you'll see that if i run this loop again 11 will be missing even though 11 will be here it didn't have this comma this one will not break it up correctly so let's run this again i'll copy the same number i had here i posted here so as you can see even though i have 11 you see this it's missing 11 here because of this extra comma so that's why you need that extra comma here to to fix that got it okay all right let's put it back in okay let's try it again make sure it works fine and okay so we got it correctly so now we know how to break up the list so we have the first list now we're going to work on the second list which is really easy what we have to do is we have to call it one more time right so instead of list two we'll well this one will say list two so it will break the second list okay all right so let's try that so let's click on her we get our first list okay enter we've broken up all the lists let's say we've hit the second list we'll put more uh i'll add some more number on the side here so okay so we'll make it a little bit bigger so we'll have 13 43 34 6 21 82 92 so if i hit this so you can see 13 43 34 6 21 82 92 right we'll break it all up so now we have the two list so right now we have the two lists together now what we have to do is where to find the duplicates right so as you can see looking at this you can see six is duplicated right i mean only six right now but it could have more than one so what we're going to do is we're gonna find the duplicate okay so finding duplicate will create a new block or say fine duplicate okay so we don't need any input for this one we already have that so we'll put it down here let's do that here okay uh we are going to reuse some of our variable uh our index and all right uh that we had so we will have to reset it so make sure if you have to reuse anything you have to reset it we'll reset it back to one since scratch is uh always starts at one on the loop for for loops and indexes under array and all that other program may be different so and then we have to have something um we'll have to make another variable is their duplicates so we'll check if there's any duplicates okay so we'll say no that's in the beginning no there's no duplicate and then we are going to reuse this temporary list to store what other duplicates so if we have to reuse anything make sure you have to clean it up so let us say delete everything from templates okay and then what we're going to do is we're going to use a repeat loop again to repeat through the list right and then find out um you know what are the duplicates so first what the repeat whether you can pick either list so we can just use list one we'll go with this one then the list two it doesn't matter because we're trying to find something that's the that's the same okay so what we can do is here we're gonna use this greater than again and we are putting the index whereas the index index is here let me we don't need to we can hide this but if you are running into any trouble right and while you're doing coding make sure you open all this up so that you can see how things are okay um and then you will say the length of the list one so we're going through the first list and we have to get the item on the list so how do we get the item same thing right we have done that earlier this is how we get item on the list right oops i didn't want to do all that i just wanted that that piece of code um so what we we can make a new variable or we can reuse this let's make a new variable still a little bit more easier we'll say current item in this how about that okay so this is the current item in the list so we'll say current item in the list so we'll pick up the item in this list one so make sure we have the list one so we're going through the loop in this one make sure we're picking the item on the list one so we'll pick the first item on list one which is number 12 here okay so what we're going to do is we have this item which is 12. uh we want to see if 12 is actually in list two so what we can do is we have we don't actually need to run another loop you can to do that but there's an easier way actually in the list you'll provide something called contain so we're going to use that let me see if i can find right here okay so we will be using this uh what we can do is we're going to use the if block here okay we're gonna we are saying if list two okay we're looking at this one we pick up number 12 we want to see number 12 is in list two or not so we say if list2 contain okay we'll go back to here contain the current item right item which is 12. if list2 contain 12 if it is then what we want to do is set is that duplicate yes that is duplicate so you can say duplicate and then what we can do is we are going to add this to the temporary list and then we are going to add this item into temporary list so we're going to add it to the temporary list to store so if it's if 12 is here we'll add it here since 12 is not here or not added here if it's 6 it's here yes 6 is here it will add it here so as you can see i'll show you later okay so we'll add it to this and make sure that we have to uh increase the index all the time if you don't the loop will run forever right you'll want to do that so you say change the index by one so you have to put it after this block here and then once it's done all this is done what you can do is you can broadcast a message or you can just display here or what he has a message is a maybe saying display output so this will display output so we'll display the output so we'll create some code here on the side let's make this a little smaller and move this over here a little bit one more room okay we are displaying the output right so we'll say when i receive display output i'm going to use the if and else block here okay if using operator here i will say um if it's the the uh the is that they're duplicate or note so whether check that if is there duplicates if it's yes oops okay if it's yes then um what we're going to do is we'll have to display it right but what we have to do is rather get the item in the list again so um to get that we'll do the same thing right just how we did before right okay so we are going to reset this index and we're going to reuse the index so better reset it reset the index to one and we are going to reuse the word also so we can join them together put it back the the put it in uh put it together with comma so we'll delete that zero and we will say repeat until here let me move over a little bit and then we will use this block here so what we're going to do is we're going to run through the mt uh the temporary list where we find the duplicates okay same thing right we have to do the index again it's greater than the length of the list and you have to choose the temporary list right that's where we putting the duplicate numbers on so i mean you could have multiple items in the list so we want to join them together with a comma what we can do is we are going to use the if and else statement here put this under here we are going to use this not operator again and we are going to check the index actually so and then we'll put one here so basically what we want to say is if it's not the index is equal to one then we want to put the comma and join them together so basically if it's more than one let's say six and there's another one called four you will say six comma four right so that you can display together okay all right so what we can do is we're gonna say set the word that we're using to join right earlier we did that so we'll say joining this and then we need another join we're going to put a comma in between so we'll need another join on here and we'll put a comma here and we can put a space after that if you like uh what we can join is joining the word so the the first time you join the water will be blank uh second time it has something else it will have something else and i will join this together and form this new word so basically following a string of numbers separate by commas right okay so we'll say get the item again oops get the item so the index again and we have to get it from the temporary list so index is let's say the first time godot will be one so whatever the duplicator will come here it will have this pick up the index here okay all right so next we'll set the word again uh but we don't need this joint here uh what we only need is the item okay so basically if it's uh not the first the index is not the first one um it will it will add them up together if it's the first one or run this code will be just this first item okay and we have to change the index by one again so make sure you always do that if not it will go into the four overlooked break so change index by one and we want to put it after this else statement inside the repeat loop okay and then what we can do is uh we're going to say oops sorry so say put this here and we are going to join use the join operator here again we're using a lot of join and a lot of loops here so i hope you guys uh really get picked this up uh after you feel this lesson so say yes there are one or more duplicates value in the list right in in these two lists or something we can say two lists okay and then we'll put a colon here at the end saying what are the value that's duplicated we'll put a space and we'll put the word where we just join together right so we'll put this and we can increase this to maybe five seconds so the player can see right and then we'll take a new one here would only join for this and we'll say no are no duplicates value between these two lists all right values maybe oops sorry that's good thing that's there's a undo button okay all right so undo button you can do control z so it doesn't do okay now let's save it let's run it again okay so what i'm going to do is i'm going to add one more number here i'll say okay so what i'm going to do is i'm going to add one more number let's click on this uh sprite again so what i'm going to do is i'm going to add one more number which is 43 so we'll make it more than one so 12 14 6 4 11 43 okay we'll say enter you have 12 14 6 4 11 43 right we have this then we'll enter the second list so we have a 13 43 which is uh the same right so and then 34 6 6 is also the same so the final outcome is the uh when this sprite talks it will display that 6 43 and 6 are the duplicates so let's see if it works okay so enter so as you can see uh we haven't actually called this method so that's why it doesn't work all right so what do we need to do we need to call to find duplicates right we did our code but we did not call it okay all right so let's run it again or we can what we can do is we can just double click on this or run this method so let's double click let's see so as you can see 6 and 43 right these are the two values so make sure you join this in so now let's test it one more time right let's click on the third this is right here and now let's put in the list again let's say this time we'll add i don't know uh 202 225 at the end right so we have 225 the end and then we'll add this this one here and then let's say we want to put one more number 11 okay so if we do that we'll actually have 43 6 and 11 that's the duplicates right we have three duplicates inside so you see 6 11 43 right so you can see in this two list here i mean this has a little bit more um so this one has a little bit more one more number so let's validate see if this is correct so six right six yes we have six 11 yep 11 is there yep and 43 43 is there that's correct so these are the three duplicate number from between the two lists so i hope you guys enjoy this video it's not really a um actually um a game but it's a teach you the concept of list so uh please like uh share subscribe to our channel and you can just notify your friend if they want to learn about scratch or programming and just let them know about our channel alright thank you very much and see you guys next time bye you
