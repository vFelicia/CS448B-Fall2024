hello guys welcome back to kids calling playground so i haven't done a video uh lately so uh thought of doing one i think a lot of kids is asking how do you convert the uh scratch three project into an apk file so that you could install in the mobile device like a phone or something so i'll show you how to do that so today i'm gonna try to uh show you that i'll do that so i'm going to use my kids up project this uh scrolling platformer so what you have to do is first you save it to your computer so when you download this it will save this to your computer so once you save this to your computer you'll find where the file is at let's say in the download folder or whatever right okay so i found my file and move it over here so let's just call it like uh case code playground this is my file so i put the sp3 file here which is the scratch file that i just downloaded okay so once you downloaded uh the file uh so what you have to do you have to go to uh oracle find the oracle so just type like search for jdk download 1.8 so something like this so you say like java jdk 1.8 okay so you go to like oracle site just like this one just what i had over here so basically you click on this you come to this page here so in this page uh what you have to do is you're gonna have to scroll down okay scroll down here you see uh it's only uh looking for jdk one eight so jdk one is an older version of java right now it's like 15 so but uh i think the uh the uh that converter needs jdk 1a so that's why we use gdk1a so you can click on this link then download if you have window and if you have mac you have to download the mac one okay so you might need your parents to help you with this you need to have a google uh uh not google you have an oracle account so you have to create oracle account download this file and then when you have after you have downloaded this exe file what you do is just double click the exe file and it will install so since i already have java so i don't have to do this part so i'll show you how it looks like so i have a different version of java here i have 15 and one eight as well so it depends on where you want to save it i mean i save it into c coding c java but you can have it in your program file or something so this is how the after you install it should be somewhere in your in your project okay so something like this so as you can see if you click inside here it will show like something like this so what we're going to do is we are going to create java home to this location okay okay next uh you have to go to like pc uh right click on your pc property okay and then here you have to click on this advanced system setting uh event system setting here to go to your environment variable uh make sure that you have set up your java home where it is okay so uh something like this java home and then you have to have a path a path so when you edit it you see like java home the home location and then you have to have a path so the path is like uh java home bin whatever right the bin is added to the path so once you have all that uh what you can do is uh to test it what if it's working or not so you can say cmd open this okay in this thing you just type java version so you can see that you have the 1.8 version here installed so that's mean you're good okay okay so now that you have your java everything set up you have to go to this something called uh html uh lilifier so i'll give you the link below it's like shippedtest.github.io.htmlfire so here what you can do is this uh you can select you can even go to the scratch project and all that but you can just say choose and then you go to your apk and then i think i have it here right so just select this so once you select the file you see that jungle whatever scrolling platformer right so here you can put the name say uh jungle platformer okay and then you can put your name i guess uh what is it wrestling yeah okay okay rats okay so that automatically fill it up so once i got this one uh these like different options here compatible modes like uh two version two of scratch version three that's the turbo mode uh if you don't know how to do that don't don't check all this thing leave it like this uh it's fine you know full screen button if you want show the stop and stop button i didn't check it so we don't need it actually so we're going to convert this into a actual um apk file so leave kind of leave everything default and these are the uh the variable button if you want to change the color and all that so kind of leave things default should be okay and what you do is just click on this so what it does is downloaded a file like this okay so find this file it should be somewhere in your download folder okay okay so you find your file it should be in your download folder or something like that copy that over and drop it into your folder here okay so you see this file here so what you do is right click you have to actually rename the file so rename it to index.html okay so and then you can delete this file here actually delete this now delete and then to test it out you can double click on it so it should work so double click on this it should load so this is just like the game that you're playing right so you can select this and run send same thing right with the with the mouse or whatever i mean it jumps okay all right so this is look like this okay let's uh stop this for now so we'll close this so this looks fine uh we have the so basically we converted the scratch project to html5 then what you need to do you have to download a new software something called a website to apk so you can find that i'll leave a link description uh to do that okay okay so you have to go to this website uh website to apk android api builder and then just download the free version okay so after you download the free version install it i should be okay it doesn't have any virus or anything i checked it so once you download and install it you'll have something like this so you have something like this website to apk builder so what you have to do is i already made one earlier just to test it out so you can call it uh jungle platformer okay okay so you need to scroll down here and select the location where you want to go so you can say change and here uh just go to your apk go to the jungle platform okay so in jungle platformer i think i showed you earlier in jungle platform make sure you have something called index.html only one file in here okay and then you can change it wherever you want to go your output so this is my output so we'll create the uh file here okay so here and here i put it create output so somehow it will create a file here that's built after that you can leave these things kind of the same and then you can change the icon so the icon you need to have a a png file okay okay so i i i have to convert the svg file to png you see there's a backdrop i just i just extracted this one so i want this screen uh this is my thumbnail right so i'm going to put that as the uh application so what you have to do is you extract it it'll give you a file like this you have to go into um another website to convert this okay so you search up convert uh svg to png and select this one the cloud convert okay just go here then here you select the file that you want um that svg file right we have the svg file i think download okay select this so this is your svg file you want to convert to png just click convert oh exceed okay okay because it's free i guess they say you can only do daily limit is 10 but i only did one time but i don't know why that's kind of crazy okay so that did not allow us to convert let's just use another one we can just use this one i think it doesn't matter upload a file so let's just pick this again okay and then we're gonna convert to png download so okay we download the png file just uh you make sure that you you know where your png file is you can create you can put it in there so let's go back to this tool okay and here we'll change the icon so go back to the way you downloaded okay here uh just select this png file right so you have the icon here okay so now you have the icon ready you have this ready so make sure this one uh it goes to that folder right and then you can say landscape okay so here are the couple of options that usually uh default so i already unchecked so uncheck the zoom if you don't want to zoom like two finger zoom and then text selection you can uncheck that one and then uh here uh there's something called um show toolbar yeah uncheck that so that will help okay that's pretty much it if you want to take down this one confirmation you can but it doesn't really matter so let's see if it all works hopefully it works so let's click on generate so it will take some time to generate so let it finish so it'll take some time so once it's finished it will create the uh the file over there and then what you can do is upload that file to your google drive and then from your google drive you can just download to your phone okay and then you can install a new phone so say finish say finish so now you look into this folder you have something called jungle platformer right as well so you can upload to your google drive okay so you go to your google drive and then you can just drag this and just dump it into your google drive so it will upload this to your google drive so take some time it's going okay it'll upload that's this uh this apk file so once you upload this apk file you can try to open it from your phone uh so in your phone you have to have a google drive on okay you have google drive and you go to the google drive and then you have to select this apk file once you select apk file when you install say like do you want to install something that is a unknown source so you have to say yes then that way you will install so now i finish upload so i'll stop right here and we'll go to the phone and use the phone
