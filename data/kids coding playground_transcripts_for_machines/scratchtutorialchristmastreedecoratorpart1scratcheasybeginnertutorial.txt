welcome back guys it's kids clean playground here and today we will be working on a christmas decorator it's around christmas now um i'm pretty sure a lot of people celebrate christmas so some people don't celebrate christmas um anyways i haven't posted like 30 days you know 27 days so um yeah today we are working on this christmas decorating game this game is targeted for beginner and intermediate scratchers so that that calls for that we're about to release a um christmas platformer with the santa right here and he's running all around and he's having fun and he's dodging spikes and just like a platformer it's gonna be like the christmas platformer that we released like a few days ago so anyways let's see what we're going to learn christmas decorator we'll be learning these following concepts in scratch sprite editing broadcast messages using draggable music extension cloning key control and you can find the santa claus sprite here in the link below or you can get out from our google drive in the video description below so we'll have every single thing in our google drive in the video description so yeah you guys can check that out shout out we have plans to make the christmas decorating game in scratch so yeah we had we already had this uh plan so recently we saw six aob 5bv create a similar game and shared it in our scratch studio you guys can check out his project it is very cool as well the christmas tree decorator 6a by 6ao um so yeah you guys can check that out um oh yeah this also calls for our scratch studio you can join our scratch studio in the video um join our scratch studio you can definitely check that out you can share all of your fun projects and we'll view it sometimes and we might even give it shout outs like this one the christmas tree operator so um please join our studio and thank you so i'm in my game that i made uh a little help so so um we're gonna try playing this game so so this is not copyrighted music this is actually um music that i made from the music tool in scratch and extensions so it takes a lot of scripts to make this music 27 so uh uh so there's a change of christmas tree there's a change in gift box there's no constantly falling so i'm gonna change the gift box see if this is the first one second one third one fourth one fifth one six one seven one eight one nine one and yeah it just keeps on going all over again so let's change our christmas tree so um there's a bunch of different christmas trees so you can it starts out as this one i think so it just changes christmas trees so i can take that and then we set the candy cane to draggable so you can drag it anywhere you want you can hang the stocking that's also draggable you can also play with the santa which is um arrow keys um and you can use up arrow to do um jumping and mix a little jump sound and all stuff it was pretty a cool game like you can change the gift boxes a little bit and do whatever you want so yeah this is basically what i'm saying so yeah so um we're starting here and we have sprite one which is not needed so we have everything in our backpack and we already took out the background because i think they're jpgs and they save a background so we took out all the backgrounds from in scratch too so um if you don't know how to take out the backgrounds you can watch our new video so um yeah uh so we have a but i mean that's not a new video so we're gonna be uh that's an old video we're gonna put that in our links in the description which is the um the to tell you how to erase the backdrop for many things like anything you want and we also have the backpack video links in the description if you um want to have the backpack video if you want to learn how to use the backpack i mean like why not so uh if you guys don't know how to use a backdrop backpack you can use it so we need the winter backdrop right here and then we can erase the two trees there we go winter backdrop we don't have we don't need backdrop one okay so um we will be working on next tree and next gift box right now so we're going to start our next tree so when the green flag is clicked you go to a position since i already have in my backpack it goes to the position i want it to go into so negative 195 why 130. so you can drag it anywhere you want and then you'll have it in the in your position you just have to drag it around you can put it in your position so like over there it'll be a negative 187y 64. so it's back to negative 195 why 130 so uh yeah so let's work on this so when the agree this is just a tada code not that much when the sprite clicked broadcast change tree because christmas tree hope you guys have set up your christmas tree already we didn't yet so we're about to set it up today i think so change tree we're also going to work on our second button which is the this one the box the gift box so go to the position a1 and it will whenever when this sprite is clicked it will broadcast inside change tree change box so uh we're gonna work on the the uh christmas tree so let's work on that right now so it had a code 2 here and the costumes we have christmas tree one which is the winter tree from the backdrop in the winter um this christmas tree links in description you can download all these christmas trees this one this one this one this one this one so i already positioned them so if you didn't position them yet which you probably did not because you're downloading this from our google drive so um you have to put your thumb here obviously you can't see my thumb but it's right there so um you gotta put it right here all the christmas trees have to be around the same size and then you gotta put the christmas tree in the middle so um as you can see my thumb is uh up there and it's around the same size for all of them that's the good thing and you got to center it just like that just like that yeah for all of them you gotta center them put the thumb some can be taller than others just a tad taller sometimes some can just be a tad taller that's pretty good so anyways let's start on the christmas tree so when the green flag is clicked it'll go to 132 you 11. i already have that it'll go to the back layer because you want the gift boxes to be in front of the tree you know switch costume to christmas tree so we have seven trees and that's christmas tree zero one two one three is in front of two for some reason two three four five and six so we have basically seven costumes and it just says christmas tree zero cause it's christmas tree zero and then so this is christmas tree zero this is christmas tree six so you can change that to one and you can change this one to seven if you want but i did that zero so when i receive change tree it will go to the next costume i'm pretty sure we we're gonna work on the gift box next so let's do the gift box right now so when the green flag is clicked we'll switch costume so we're not going to give you all these costumes because i designed the costumes but we will give you like each of these presents so then you can design them on your own and put like some in front of others some on the left some on the right like um some of these some of these so i designed all of these um this one's a gigantic one i don't know why i made it that big but okay um so we're gonna be working on this now so it'll switch costume to costume zero which is um zero obviously and i'll go to the front layer and change gift box to next costume so this will be um news for the gift box it'll change the gift box when you click this button so let's test it out so this is for the christmas tree this is for the gift box so you can download these again so gift box awesome i like this one the best it's the most presents and everyone likes presents so christmas tree godly okay so it works um so we can do this so we're gonna work on the candy cane right now candy cane should be really really really really simple so just uh four scripts of code no yeah four sorts of code and uh when the green flag is clicked it will go to the position i already have it at negative 39 y 28 it'll go forever set mode draggable because you can drag it anywhere you want to drag by the draggable so you can drag this anywhere you want even in even the people are playing the game you can drag it up here you can drag it down here you can drag it uh well i'm dragging this because i'm inside the project you can drag it over here that's basically what this does and the stocking is just exactly the same code so but just a different position so let's just bring this to here but then change the go to to where it already is uh so um i'm gonna make it i have i already have a position that's fine uh because i think i should keep it there because why not um next we're gonna work on the santa i'm pretty sure i'm supposed to work on this internet so let's do this so i'm going to start over here and then when the green slide is clicked it will go forever go to the front layer so i did it the front layer because you don't want it you don't want santa to go in front of the stocking or the candy cane so because it'll go behind the candy cane and then his face is behind the candy cane you don't want his face to be behind the candy cane you want him to be in front of everything so let's do this so if then so we have all the costumes over here idle run run run run run run jump basically that's all we have so well there's more in the links in the description you can download in our google drive but you can also go to this website and download santa die like i'm dying and on stuff so you can also do that and then you need a knot and then if key any press any key is pressed you need a knot so if not any keys are pressed like the right arrow or the left arrow if they're not pressed you'll switch costumes to the idle costume just like in the mongoose platformer so we are done with that so next we're gonna do a large script of code with the green flag it'll go to this position and a set rotation style left right because you don't want it to be upside down when it's running also it's going to run with his head up upside down so i have um his head on the ground and yeah so that's why you want it to be set rotation style to left right or you can do this part we can do this and click this button it's already left right i think but just in case we can we can do this so set rotation style right um it'll go to the front later again we gotta recap this and it'll go forever if then instead the right arrow is pressed and then you can point the direction 90. point in direction 90 right over here we'll move 10 steps and next costume so i'm going to work on the left arrow next so let's duplicate this change a little bit code change this to left arrow this is negative 90 luke 10 steps next costume so that's the code for santa walking now we're gonna do the jumping code so let's do this so let's see my santa is walking frequently enough frequently he's walking um right normally so if he's not walking he's idle mode he's just smiling uh yeah so um let's change the stocking because it's at a position i don't want it to be and it's at the same position so i do have coordinates for this but i could drag this over here and then do the go to because the candy cane and the stocking are at the same position and i do not like that so let's see i think it's supposed to go over here right okay i think this is the right one yeah right there right there okay so let's just continue with our santa jumping so a jumping santa when the green flag is clicked it'll go forever if then repeat until so if then the up arrow key is pressed then it will switch costume to jump and it will broadcast jump and wait jumps will make a message jump and then the repeat until if the equal sign if the y position is equal to negative 85 it's already a negative y is already at negative 85. so i use negative 85 because sansa is on negative 85. so when it jumps it'll go down back to negative 85. so it'll change y by negative 10 so negative 85 this is where he's standing so when he jumps he'll land back right on the spine and then when i receive jump then you know it starts and jump so let's get this right there i think it's already on santa but if i think uh i added the um the sound for the jump so let's do this choose a sound jump it says in the sprite library uh so you could get it if it's not in the santa for some reason so you can get that sound and then it will repeat five times change y by 30 it'll go up and then a really small weight zero point zero two point zero two is the same thing but zero to make it uh make it so just in case if i didn't get it so let's see it's working so just like that drag the candy cane drag the stocking change the gift box we didn't add the music yet so there's a bunch of these so oh we i may take a little bit long because it's already 18 minutes and 57 seconds which is um 19 minutes now so um we're going to do the the code for the snow and the backdrop which is the sound and the jingle bell so we're gonna do that in the next part so anyways merry christmas you
