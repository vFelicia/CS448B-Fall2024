so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding playground today we'll be doing a twoplayer shootout game so in this uh game the objective is to uh shoot at each other using the spaceship to uh you can use the spaceship to move around so player one you use wasd and spacebar to shoot player two use arrow keys and zero the button the key zero to shoot and then uh these some alien bugs will fly around and try to hit uh hit the spaceships and you lose hp when they hit you and if your opponent hits you as well you also lose hp on your shield and when your shield is destroyed um you will only have the spaceship left and you'll be a one shot and each side gets 2000 hp for the shield and um the shields will rotate so in such a way so that um if you are lucky enough you can shoot a bullet through both of the shields and you can hit your opponent so in this video we'll be learning these following concepts variables repeat until loops broadcasting messages touching other sprites controlling sprites with keys and then we'll use custom blocks so without further ado let's get to the project so let's make it full screen oops so my brother is here to play with me he'll be player one which is the blue one i'll be playing which is the red one and the player one uses wasd and spacebar to shoot and player two uses arrow keys and zero to shoot ready set go oh i shot through i shot through it see i killed i i beat my brother because i shot through you want to do it one more time sure and there's music oh you shot through me oh my god okay let's try one time this is too fast and you can shoot the aliens as well you shot through me okay so that's pretty much the game so if you want to make the game a bit harder you can make the second shield rotate faster and also the raw we got this game inspired by the rock blaster game so um which has been doing really well lately so if you want to check that out you can check it out in the description below or from our channel so without further ado let's start a new project start a new project so first we want to create some variables so we'll make three global variables and one um for this sprite only variable but we'll worry about the for this sprite only variable later we'll just need to make three variables so um let's make one player oops i caps lock on player one shield so for all sprites click ok and we need to make another variable called player 2 shield player two shield and one more called alien set for player set for player one we do not need another one for player 2 since we're using if else statements but yeah that's all the variables you'll need for now and i'm just going to get a backdrop real quick from the sprite library i mean backdrop library so let me get the nebula one this one's the one i've been using you of course you can pick anything else and i'll add the sound later but just right now i'll just have the backdrop and make sure um let's get some sprites real quick delete your scratch tab we will not need that and um they do not have this um spaceship in 3.0 anymore it's from 2.0 um so i just got them from 2.0 and you notice how i rotate it to the side so in the sprite you want to rotate it to the side and this one should be point 90 in the direction of 90 so it'll be pointing to the right side and this one should be pointing to negative 90 so i'll be pointing to the left side i'm also going to get this ladybug sprite i'm not sure if they happen 3.0 but uh you can just get something i think it's i think it is but i'm not really sure but you can just get anything you want and i notice how i note rotated it as well because these spaceships are rotated as well so if these bishops are rotated let's also rotate the ladybug so it'll be pointing to the spaceship and i also colored their eyes red um you can do that if you want it's optional just to make the ladybugs look a little bit better and i have the lasers these are for the player one and player two's lasers so all i did was just get the button sprite from the sprite library and then i have the shields so for the shields i just drew a uh i just drew like a circle so i'm going to show you guys how to draw the shields for the spaceships so i'm just going to select the color so i'm the color was 54 saturation 100 and brightness 76 and the outline is 10. so what you want to do is get the circle tool and then you want to draw a circle like that hold down shift key so then you get a perfect circle and then you just center your sprite and then you use the erase tool right here and then you can just erase how ever much you want like maybe that much maybe a little bit more select that like that yeah something like that you can draw it like that so that's how you draw the shield for the game so first we will work on the alien remember told you to turn it uh for player one actually let's work on player players first can work in the alien later so let me toggle this backpack so when flank clicks i want to set my uh player one to be at negative 160 at y0 so it'll be somewhere like right here like right here near the end of the screen and then i want to set the rotation to left and right so then it won't flip upside down or you can just select it right here the default is this just click this it'll be only to left and right and i want to set the player shield to 2000 player 1 shield 2 000 i mean you can do any as much health as you want or as little health as you want it's up to you guys and let's get a forever loop forever point in direction of 90 so always face the right side we always want this to face the right side and if on edge bounce so then they can't go inside behind the screen i guess um and for the player one i'm doing it wasd so if the key d is clicked p d is clicked pressed that we can change the x by 10 let's change the x by 10 and let's just duplicate this if the key is a press then we want to change the x by negative 10. so we'll go to the left side and let's duplicate both of these if the key w is clicked it's pressed that we can change the y by 10 so it'll go up and if the key s is clicked then we can make the y change the y by negative 10. so yeah so this is the um movement code for the player so as you can see it moves around the shield has not gone to the player yet because we have not done the code for that but now you can have simple movement for the player and when it's touching this edge of the screen it cannot or just bounce off so that's what we have for the player for now and we will need uh the code for the laser let's go to the laser when flag clicked get a forever loop if the key space is pressed because this is for player one if you like you can name this to player one laser or something like that so you won't get confused and if the space bar is pressed then i'll create a clone of myself uh wait until not key space is pressed so this is to prevent them from spamming the uh space bar as you can see um so if you have this wait until not space is clicked so wait until not space key is pressed and i need to mention one more thing so if you want these sprites and you don't want to like draw them because it's a bit hard to do i guess you can go to our google drive in the link in the description to download them um and i've seen a lot of people uh trying to request for access using their school accounts your school accounts will not work since it's for school so you have to use your own personal google account so after the laser we need to when it's created a clone we have to when i start us clone we want to go to player one go to the player one go to player one and we want to point point in the direction of the direction of player one so point and direction of the direction of player one um direction pretty sure it's this one direction wait it's not this one this one right no this is distance sorry about that it's actually this one you have to select this one first so now you have direction like that so you just when you want to find the player you have to always select this one first so put that right there let's move 50 steps to like move it to the front i guess so move 50 cent steps and then we want to show so next we want to get a repeat until loop let's go here gonna repeat until so if it's touching since this is in the player ones perspective perspective we have to do everything for player two so you're just going to drag two or statements right here so repeat until touching edge touching edge touching edge or touching uh player two shield one player two shield one is the first big shield or it's touching oops or it's touching the player 2 shield 2 which is a small shield for player 2. then we can move 10 steps so move to it move 10 steps and if and then this is if touching the player 2 shield 1 or the player 2 shield 2. let me just duplicate this actually so i don't have to re do it if it's touching that then we can broadcast the message we can call broadcast and wait a message called player 2 got hit player 2 got hit player 2 got hit i'm just going to duplicate this if it's touching player 2 so as i mentioned earlier once you destroy their shield you if they're one shot so if you touch them then they're dead if touching player two if touching player two we can broadcast another message call it player player to dead and then we can delete this clone and we have to add and delete this clone right here right here we're gonna have to add that and then we have to add one at the end like that so this is for shooting so as you can see now you can shoot you can move around and you can shoot and remember i told you earlier this thing is to prevent them from spamming if you take that out you can just spam like this which you do not want and that's not that's not very good so let's so remember to put this in and and then if you want um for the uh when i received player two when i received player two got hit which is from here to got hit that we can change the player to shield by five player two shield by negative five and for the other laser it's pretty much the same thing so i'm just gonna drag and drop this into the player two so just drag and drop this into the player two except you have to change the x and y position and all that stuff so instead of negative 160 i'm gonna do 160 so it'll appear on the right side of the screen instead of player one shield you have to set the player to shield so so let's just go instead of point direction of 90 we want to go negative 90 so point to the left side and then um right here instead of d we want to do right arrow kit clicked because it's the player a 2 so if right arrow is pressed instead of a let's do left arrows pressed instead of w while the up arrow is pressed and instead of s we'll do down arrows press and and then we'll do um for the lasers for the lasers i'm just going to drag and drop this into laser 2 so drag that drag that and drag that except we'll need to change a couple broadcast messages and um uh player things these things this thing instead of player one we have to do player two and instead of go to player one we want to go to player two because it's the other laser and instead of uh and instead of oh yeah and it's supposed to be direction not x position and then um this should be player one shield one and this should be player one shield two instead of player two shield one and player two shield two and then if touching player one shield one instead oops player one shield one and player one shield two and then we wanna broadcast a new message player one got hit instead player two got him player one got hit and instead of right here we want to do player one player one dead one dead and instead right here player one got hit we want to change the player one shield by negative five okay so now we have the movement all done and now instead of spacebar oh yeah one last thing this should be zero i set it to zero so it's easier to play so now let's play oh yeah and this is supposed to be zero as well as you can see there i forgot to do that um and now as you can see you can shoot and shoot with the other character move around so yeah that's what we're gonna do in this video um thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share subscribe and bring the notification bell to see all the latest updates on this channel i'll see you guys in the
