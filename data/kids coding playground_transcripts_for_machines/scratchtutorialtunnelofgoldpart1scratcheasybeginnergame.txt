welcome back guys it's kids coding playground here and today we're back for another video called tunnel today we're working on this game in scratch the objective of the game is the player is is to control the beetle to dig a tunnel and get the goal total of gold we'll be learning these following concepts in scratch variable loops pen and broadcast message so i'm going to show you a demo it's a game for some music playing in the backwards use arrow keys to control the beetle as you can as you can see you're the other person you're you're supposed to dig with d you're just keep on digging and mix like this pink color and then you can't get inside like the dirt if you don't dig so rocks also pump you backwards so that that could be a problem for you and there's also a timer and you can also i got the gold it'll stop everything so before i start please like share subscribe and comments in the comment in the comment section below to see what videos you want next so i'm gonna be a new project we don't need the scratch cat so let's get the beetle sprite and sprite right here um so i already have some things in the backpack for me like the sprite the dig sprite you can just draw these really easy to draw um at the start area and the in the background okay so i'm also draw the gold and you just need some circles so let me do that um get the no outline that's correct um and also uh gold i'll adjust that let's make that bigger so here we are you have a piece of gold um i might adjust it a little bit so we got that piece of gold all right so we can also change the name of it to gold and we also can change this to uh the name of this thing to tunnel of gold or gold digger i'll show you how to draw the backdrop so let's just go back drop one it's easy just a gigantic square it can be any colors yes it's 96 color 60 saturation and 56 brightness yes delete it okay so i'm gonna go start on the code first let's draw the start area that's to teach you how to draw that same thing it's just a rectangle same thing it has to be sprite 96 color 42 saturation and 81 brightness you can also adjust it the starting area is bigger than the dig and we're going to make the beetle smaller so the starting area is bigger than the um beetle so i have to make these two variables timer and digging i also have to work on the backdrop backdrop's um really simple we already showed you how to draw it and we just can uh get some sounds we can use the cave sound that's what i used earlier so the cave sound i think it's up here yep place down cave until done so there we go so we also have to work on the starting area the start area is really simple we can also add the rocks so oh my gosh it's so small around this size i hope you guys can see this um i'll go to beetle beetle so we can move on to the date sprite the dig sprite so there's this new type of block right here called pen no i already have it up if not you you can just go here click on the pen and there you go i already have it so if green flag is clicked green flag is clicked it will erase all hide i'll go forever go to beetle so we can use this to take later and then go so we're going to work on the gold so when green flag is clicked um reset timer because there's a timer that we're using reset timer right there it'll go to x y whatever but it's going to be a pick random so it can be anywhere so we have to pick random 80 the 225 and negative 160 to 160. then it'll go up and down i'll generate around this area and just keep on working so then so you have to make a new broadcast called set up rocks so so you want to set up the rocks be at the gold before the rocks or else the rocks might generate on top of the gold so we can go forever and then set timer to timer this will keep track of the time so we can also work on the rocks right so when i receive set up rocks why is everything so small i receive set up rocks repeat three times i'll create a clone of myself it'll hide oh wait one second and broadcast a new message called start game starting start game and when i start as a clone yeah so this will call this oh it'll create three rocks since it has a repeat three it'll go to it's another random it'll go to pick random and another pick random pick random negative 200 to positive 200 and negative 150 to positive little show a repeat until not touching gold so won't ever touch the gold so it'll be like not you also need a ore so let me go inside there not touching gold or touching beetles it won't spawn on top of the beetle and then so you can just duplicate this one because it's literally the same thing delete this put it inside here so there we go this is the rox code that wasn't working correctly because i made a mistake so the or statement right here is not supposed to go outside it's supposed to even not going outside then you put the or you guys throw away this knot put the ore inside the knot and then put the touching gold in touching beetle so that's the correct code let's try now as you can see it's not touching the rocks like the gold or the beer okay so um we'll continue next video so thank you for watching everyone see you guys you
