hello and welcome back to kids calling playground i haven't made a video for a while i thought of making this a video for our special 1k subscriber we're going to work on this halloween memory game so basically the player will click on the orange box here it will reveal the card underneath and if you have a match then uh then you will get that uh match if you don't have a mesh then the card will cover up the uh thus again will cover up the sprite again so basically kind of like flipping the card over like a memory game i uh we used to play right i think everyone remember when that kid they have played this kind of game before so um so let me show you next okay so we're going to be learning this um we're learning a variable we'll be having a list we'll have a couple of lists on there so if you don't know about lists i would suggest you maybe watch this video here or this video here about lists before you go into this memory game because it will actually require you to have a good understanding of list and variable and we'll be working on custom block a lot of broadcasting messages uh loops and then a sprite interaction between the you know the sprite and the uh you know the orange box that's covering the sprite so there's a lot of sprite interaction between them so without further ado let me show you the game okay okay so this is the game itself so i'm gonna go on the full screen here so i'm gonna start the game and what happened is the cat once i saw the game the cat will give some instruction and all the cat all the other sprite behind here will change and then you can click on it each one of them to open it okay all right so we have some music in the background and you can click on it let's say okay this is a lollipop uh this is not matched so as you can see that was not matching it i mean you can make it longer slower so see i got a match so these will stay on so we'll try to get the other one so let's see so lollipop oh okay this one this one okay so this one i don't know nope not that one this one is okay here it is there we go okay so you get all of it so that's it so that's the end of it so as you can see um after you get all of it then just say good job you win and uh you can like and maybe like do something like hide all this bright and then show the background of this image so on all these price uh uh from the free page design by freepix so um these bright i got it from premium packs so it costs some money not sure i can share them but you guys can also download it here in like in halloween uh if you go to like i'll have the link below like a flatikon.com and then you can look for halloween costumes a lot of these price here you can click on this download pack after you log in with your google account or something like that it'll provide you like 50 different costumes here that you could use for the game so after you download it you can unzip it so it will have like all these kind of custom here as you can see different custom can just unzip it and put it in your folder and then you can load them up uh when you when you work on the game so let me go to the game itself okay so i created a new project um i will just create all the variable and uh and lists together in one in this first tutorial so that we don't have to go back and forth and find what variable and what list is needed so let's click on this you can say make a variable here so i'm just going down the list i'm going to call this a break input index so this will use for breaking the uh the the matching number uh for the different sprite so we will need that so i'm just gonna make all this variable go ahead i'm calling make another variable called broadcast one okay and make another variable called broadcast two all the variable i'm making is for all sprite right now i don't think i have anything that's for this sprite only um we need something called current character so we're gonna have to check the character and and stuff like that to match so say current character then next one you want to create one called index so index is for loop where you can look through things and check things on index where the position is on your on your loop you have another one called is game started so this is a kind of like a brooklyn flag if the game is started or not you can put like osprey as well and then we need more calling match number so this was using to match the different number on the on the sprite when you're matching the uh the uh when you're matching between the two to uh sprite underneath the card so next is match sprite so this is the sprite's name we'll use that for later and player choice one okay so this is what the player choose for the first first choice and then player choice two so this is the second choice the player choose okay so we have all these uh variable now so uh if you if you have a if you don't see it then just pause it and just look through all this variable here okay so next we're gonna create a few lists as well i'll just do everything in this um here so that we will be able to use it later on so game match number list okay we are going to use this to store the matching number on the list for the sprite game sprite nameless so this is like when the game started those choose the sprite uh what are the names that's chosen for the sprite so we're gonna create that and save it here so we have a couple of lists that we need there's a number list for all the sprite and we need something called player selected match list so this is for keeping track of the player what is selected and last but not least we have this one a sprite nameless so this is keeping track of all the sprite in the uh game all right so again we have this uh list here so um just pause the video make sure you got all this list down here okay okay so i'm going to uh i have my sprite already in my backpack which i will be using but uh if you don't have it i'll show you how to do it in a second so i just load this in and then i'll load my first sprite which covers for the to cover and i'm gonna lower in my background as well so in the backdrop i will load this right here and then i'll delete this so i have the really nice halloween style backdrop okay just kind of make sure that the scr the backdrop is like a little bit bigger than this rectangle here so that will cover everything okay so as you can see i downloaded the uh the sprite file the file i have was like custom avatar that i download from this site and then i'll extract it over here so here's all the different sprite that we had right so we can use that to load into our game so what you need to do is uh you can go like this say uh paint a sprite so you go to this sprite so after that after you say paint the new sprite you go to here and you say upload costume from here you can go to your here so you're gonna select all of it in one go and you can say open so what it does it's gonna create all these costumes for you in one uh one sprite so that's what we want just so we have just like how i created here right for mine i have all the different sprite here as you can see the pumpkin bag the broom and everything right so i also have 50 sprite it doesn't matter how many you have but uh this one also gives you 50. so it doesn't matter so you can use this here i think this is for free the one i had is premium so it's not free i'll see if i can share the project at the end of the tutorial you can download that if you like uh so so you can upload it after you upload it just change the size to 40 so you can have like a a set about the same size as this right or whatever that's able to cover so basically you want to have the the sprite that is like not too big not too small and it's able to be covered by this yellow box so this yellow box is very easy right you can just draw it with the uh with some color right we have 760 100 and then the outline border just put five and just draw the square like this right so just paint this like a paint a little sprite just hold shift when you draw on the square kind of like this center it so that's how you get the square right so let me delete that we don't really need it so i already have it so what you need to do is just draw one square we're gonna have to duplicate all this later on so once you loaded all your sprite and your your square uh you draw your squares and we'll start the code so let me delete this i don't need this anymore since i'm using my own okay so now we're gonna go to the cat okay so for the cat we're going to add some code here so when green flag is clicked let me zoom in a little bit so what we need to do we are going to reset some variable so make sure that the game start every time we get things resetted so uh this is the first variable we'll reset so set game started so we'll say no so put n then we're gonna duplicate this duplicate it again we are going to set the player's choice 1 and play as choice 2 and we are going to delete this okay so nothing there blank ok next we will get some here delete all from number list so we'll clear out the number list for now and we're going to add it back in later on so we'll make sure we clear every time and then we say delete all game matching number list so this is for the game to choose they can choose the number for the list so we delete that as well okay then what we need to do we are going to add so we are going to add to this number list so we are going to form 12 different boxes like one two three four five system in nitrogen 12 so we are going to add this number one so repeat this like 12 times kind of thing so we have four here so let me drag this down a little bit and duplicate this underneath and duplicate four more underneath here so just rename put it as one two three four five six seven 8 9 10 11 and 12. okay so we have all the number added to the list so if you run the game now you will see that all the numbers added to the list you can show that in the variable right number list we can see that one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven so every time i run this will repopulate this list here okay okay the next thing we want to do we are going to have another start event again we're gonna we are going to clean up the other things here i mean you can put it all in one but it doesn't matter so this one doesn't depend on this so i just create another one so that way we can clean them up both at the starting of the green black okay so we will say delete all so now we are going to delete the sprite name list and delete the game sprite name list and then delete one more player selected match list okay so we're cleaning up all this list we'll use this list later to match things okay what we need to do is we're going to add something to the to the sprite name list so basically this brightness is contained all the um sprite uh that you have for the name so you have to look at the costume so this first one is the witch right so what you do i i'm going to add a few in here for now so what we have to go in and you have to have this like this so which then you're the duplicate you have to look into the next one and the next one is candy corn right so we'll take that copy that name and go back to here and we'll put candy corn and so on and so forth so you have to keep going like this i mean depending on how many costumes you want to use if you're using 50 then obviously you have to do all 50 of them uh then you don't have a shortcut for this so duplicate this guy and you put in the i number three so basically you keep going and you can get all the sprite names so basically we will need this right name to match later so it's very important you get all of them and put it into your code here all right next we'll get more okay so i'm gonna i'm gonna speed this up okay since um don't want you to watch the whole video me putting in the name here so i'll speed this up so that we can get all them filled up okay so we have created all the uh all the 50 costume here all the name okay from 1 to 50 and what we're going to do next is broadcast is a game instruction okay okay we are going to change the cat a little bit i think 85 percent i think i kind of put them in here or something like that all right what we can do next is um if the cat is too big or too small you can change it later and we can probably move them around later if it's not in the right position um okay say when we start the game instruction what we want to do we can say look make this cat go to the front of everything so that it will not be covered by the car you know the sprite or the boxes right okay and then we are going to say so we are going to say this so this is a hollow matching game um click on the orange box to reveal the card underneath okay and duplicate again i have the text already typed up so then click on the another orange box to try to match the first card you just open so basically you select two card to open and then what we have to do is so with a new message say prepare okay okay now we are going to after we say prepare game we're going to go back up a little bit i'm going to call this part because our last space up here so this is our start right okay so we are going to do the event that we had broadcast below for prepared games so we are going to pick this up say prepare game we're going to use the loop here say repeat six times so uh what we want to do is we want to get six match right so we have 12 boxes that's why we repeat six times so because there's 12 boxes to match so there's only six pair right so that's why we repeat six then we are going to get this here uh what we're going to use is we're going to use the index to see what is the number we picked from the sprite nameless that way we can once we pick that uh let's once we pick let's say which we don't want the witch to show up again so what we're going to do is we'll remove from the nameless so here we will say operator pick random one two and you have to use this something called length of list so this one let's say we have a link of uh sprite nameless right we're using sprite nameless so i say this so if i run this right now if i run that because i didn't run it out last time i only have five so now if i run it we'll have 50 right so we have 50 items in here right you remember we added all 50 so all the way to 50. so when you run this it will give you the list of the linked is 50. so we are going to pick one a random one to the list of 50. next we are going to say add the item and we are going to use this index that we just picked up so we are saying the sprite name this and we are going to add this to the game match uh sprite name game sprite nameless so this is going to add it to here so what we're going to do we're going to pick it up and we're going to add it so this is going to be our six different sprite that we're using for the game next what we want to do is we want to delete this index from this sprite name list so basically once we pick this sprite let's say we pick the witch like i said i don't want to pick the witch again so they don't have the same match so always there will be six pair they will never be like a five pair you know like you have four witch or something you don't want to do that right so that's why you want to remove that so remove that then we can we are going to repeat again sixth time so this time we are going to so this time we are going to pick up six uh pair of numbers uh basically from our list right here right we have 1 through 12 right we'll pick up six pair number randomly and then trying to match them okay so what you want to do is this we're going to reuse the index again so this time instead of the uh the sprite list will do number list so this number has 12 items so if i say this so you see 12 here right so this is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 9 12 that we added then next we'll say variable so match number set set the match number so we are going to use the index again we're going to use the number list so what we want to do is we're just going to pick a random index from this number list so i know we're using a lot of lists i know a lot of scratcher you know kids they always do like really cool stuff different game but when it comes to lists i think a lot of kids have problem so basically if you guys have problem with this i would suggest you watch the other two video like understanding a list or finding duplicate in the list that will really give you a head start on this game so now we get the uh let that get out of the way so now you understand the list and you go to this game will be much easier for you to understand so we find a matching number from the list then we have to delete from the matching number basically uh the number list so basically you know we find a matching number that we want we don't want that to be showing up on the list again so we pick up number 12 number 12 should be deleted from the list right we don't want to pick number 12 again so what you want to do next is delete this first duplicate we're gonna use some of the code here okay we're gonna set the index of random number one to the length of number list so now number this actually was 12 earlier we took out one and we deleted now is what is 11 right so we will have 11 on this so again we're gonna pick a random number here so what we're going to do is we're going to add it to this matching number so i'll show you so you add it to the matching number that we assigned to it in the first place so the first time you added some number it could be one could be seven it could be nine doesn't matter right then we add the next pair number to match that what we're going to do is we're going to use the join operator okay and we gotta grab another join put it behind there so what we're going to do is go back to the variable so the matching number already have some item in there right because it got through the first here right they picked up something so matching number will have like let's say four or whatever it doesn't matter what we can do is we'll put a pipe character that will split the between the two uh matching number that we could use later to uh match so we know which one match with which one okay so next we will go the index of a number list so basically just pick one random one from here and pick that number and join it together now we are going to put this into here and we are going to delete this same thing here so okay i have an actual one here let me remove that okay all right and then i'll delete this and then i'll say add so i add this matching number that we just got we've formed the pipe between the two number and we are going to add this to the game matching numbers this is where we keep track of the uh the matching sprite okay okay next we will broadcast a message called setup so the hardest part of this game is setting up the game i mean after that it will be easier and then we will set the uh his game started to white so this will restart the game so i have not coded the setup game so self game is another thing it's gonna be really hard as well so i will have to stop here and then you know we'll continue next one but before that let me just show you the running of this code okay let me zoom back out so what we had so far is we have the uh the uh initializing the code for the game we do a set of 12 boxes and then we have loaded all of our uh sprite name into this list and then we have uh created the code for preparing the game to choose the six matching uh things for our game six matching uh basically six matching cards okay okay i will run it one time for you guys to see so i will click on the green flags so what the cat's gonna say something and then it will prepare this list for us so we'll run this so now if i show you this so as you can see the game what did they choose it choose number 49 sprite which is the toe which is one so six and eight is the matching one that we found so we can put it in the sixth position the sixth box uh sprite and the eight box for this guy and then the next one is the slime we we we picked uh two and twelve right will be random so we'll take slime we'll create a second box and then the 12 box whatever right so as you can see you have one you have two you have three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve so we have all the number that we want from the box and each of them correspond to each of them over here so one is for toe two is for slime right number three here the list is for fang and then eyeball and bat and then zombie so that we know okay at this position number six we are going to put this custom toe at position number eight this box will put custom toe as well so that you know you have to match so let me run it again you can see it will cleanse it up and then after the cat talks something it will recreate again so you see this is different different this time the eye the halo and skull and x right and then the number is also different so every time you run this it will generate a list for the game both the matching the number that match the game and the sprite for that game so this one this is how you generate the list for right now so that way you have the game prepare you know for this part and then on the next video we'll show you how to actually put the all the things together alright so we'll stop right here and then we'll continue on the next video all right thank you guys for watching please like share and subscribe to our channel that was really mean a lot to us so thank you very much and see you guys in the next video bye
