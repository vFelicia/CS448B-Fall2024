hello guys and welcome back to kids calling playground so today we'll be working on part six of our among us platformer game where we left off last time was uh we did the laser and the spike today we'll probably work on the imposter if we have enough time then we can work on the smasher if not we'll do that pick up that on the next lesson so this is what we had last time for the code i think i explained it many times so i just gonna scroll around just in case you guys miss anything so just feel free press the uh pause button and then just make sure that you get all the code okay all right so that was the main uh main character okay and what the animated character here okay for the coat all right and then where the ground the ground is pretty simple trampoline like that okay the spike pretty simple and then the laser was a little bit more cool with it yesterday um so let's move it down a little bit so that we could try to fit everything in one small screen here okay all right so that was the laser co pretty much okay so let's work on the among us um the uh we're gonna use the in parts i already have it but basically it is just the animated uh character that we had sims color stem costume you know same thing right these guys same so exactly the same so what we are going to do is we are going to make it like a move and stuff like that patrolling around and stuff like that okay all right uh what we can do is we can take some of the code from the trampoline or spike doesn't matter don't take the laser laser a little bit more complicated so let's just go with this one let's take all this over here first and then we are going to make some change to the code okay so this and then this okay all right let's kind of spread them out a little bit set up the clone and then the high okay so let's go start this i will set the rotation style to uh left and right so that it won't flip around or you can just use this here make sure you select the center okay all right and then what we're going to do is uh to delete a reset same thing that is fine okay okay so let me move this thing down take that out okay all right uh what we're going to do is we're going to create another um custom block here i'll make a new block called drawing around okay you can leave this one here you don't need to check it uh so this is not needed okay okay let's work on this move down here uh we're gonna use the forever loop here okay let's see however loop i'm gonna repeat um 25 times okay motion i'm gonna put in direction point and direction 90 basically going to the right and then we can say uh change x by five step okay and then we are going to use the look uh next costume okay and then we're gonna duplicate this but uh i'm gonna switch it back to idle in the back here after 25 steps and we are going to put a little bit of weight here so that he kind of stops and then turn around counting 0.5 and put this back here i'm gonna do like a negative 90 and we're gonna change x by minus five and then at the end we will also change that back to our idle costume and we're going to put a little weight again also after that so 0.5 so this is pretty much the patrolling around basically it's going to move around here back and forth you can do that and then go back up here or we start as a clone we can change its color so you can use this chain color effect okay and then you can pick at random and you can say like maybe uh doesn't matter 25 or two you know 175 or 200 or whatever okay and then after that we don't need this anymore um we are going to move it to another place later i mean not another play will create another clone but we just put on the side here for now okay so for this one what we're going to do is we're going to call this new block that we just created uh patrolling around okay so this patrolling around we'll call this block here okay and then we have the clone so not the trampoline okay just that's the walk one or something like that and then i'll create a clone myself that's good so this will change it later different position that we want to put this character so this is a moving the character right and then we will want to do do another uh when clone when i saw this clone remove that uh what i'm going to do is going to see kind of change the play the walking sound just like what we had for the other other sprite uh you know it has the sound right walking so we want to play that whenever we you know hit the 56 costume or something so what you can do is get this forever loop here put this under here and then i'll take this if condition put this here and then go to operator take the equal and then go back over here and look there's a costume number right just drag that here we just say six whatever and then we are going to play the sound walk until done okay so this one doesn't block these other forever loops so you don't want to put this together with this so never will do that create two different um um broadcast message and receive broadcasting session through your stuff okay that will actually be better so we need another one when i start as a clone okay uh what we want to do with this here is we're going to check if the play actually touched the main character okay so we'll put this under here we're going to broadcast die okay so basically when it starts the clone so you see this three clone so when it start as a clone we'll do this code this code and this code okay all right so let's kind of zoom out a little bit so make sure we've got o co so this is the reset on the part top okay so level one we will not have him maybe level two let's see what level two looks like um go over here maybe we'll put them like right here or something like that right so let's go to level two so let's set our main character to level two for testing okay set it over here let's go back to the imposter okay so for level two let me see i'm going to put them somewhere so let me just start first so this is level two i'm gonna put somewhere right here maybe i push the control f i mean push the letter n so give me the position uh let's just say um maybe 150 and then i don't know we can't adjust it okay just trying to adjust it and see so let's put this here oops so you say level 2 i want to put it at you know 150 97 i don't know about 97 i think 90 is actually better i think this price a little bit bigger so let's run it so you see he's a little bit further farther away right we want to make him a little closer uh you can do like maybe 140 or something so let's start again so 140 is still pretty far he run off a little bit off the screen no let's do 120 i don't know let's see so even 120 is it's still 100 let's just put in 100. oh let's just put them in 90 okay let's try 9 i think 90 will be better actually so you see a moving yeah 90 is good so it doesn't go off the screen so you see how he run all the way over there stop let's change it turn around and run the other way so we and then every time we start the yeah then it has a different color so because of this change color effect okay so let's just try it if we touch it does it die or not okay just wait here sorry that's it yeah so i die and then i come back over here so that is working fine so as you can see it's working fine okay so we'll get the other one we'll get the the smasher okay the smashers you can just draw it yourself so i drew it like with some gray and then white and then i draw the box here small box and then some spike i took it from here just flipped it around put it here i'll give you guys the sprite too uh if you want you can download it or you can just make your own okay way easy okay all right so we have the smasher here so uh let's work on this the smasher so the smasher is also similar to like you know the other clone that we've been doing so we'll try to do that so for the smasher i have a sound here like a crushing metal sound i'll provide the sound you can upload it here okay you know how to upload the samurai just click on this say upload and then select the uh your mp3 or whatever wav file okay so let's just play this so it's like kind of like the metal falling down okay all right so let's just take it from the trampoline like we're using trampoline earlier same thing let's just take this bracket here take this drag in here like this drag it here this and this okay all right let's separate them out reset here the setup here the clone here okay and then my custom block here and this is my function okay all right okay let's look at the one of the level that we have something that we can crush it down i think level four has it so what we want to do is we can put it up here and then crush it down and also if you're doing the crusher right because since this is the ground it has it on top so make sure that you don't have any sprite any blocks like these blocks shouldn't be around here if you have it here that one will not smash down so what we're gonna do is we're gonna make it smash down until we touch the ground sprite which is this part here or any of the part here on this grass right so make sure you don't have anything on this side you're making the smasher down okay all right so let's go to the number four let's start with number four here we'll change it to four so that when we start you know we have the smasher on number four okay and uh we can do the mouse here so somewhere around here you see two 200 and 150 something like that we'll adjust it okay accordingly okay let's stop this so let's go back to the smasher we just copy all the code over right okay so these two should be good um so what we're going to do is we're going to create another custom block here call smash down or whatever you like to call okay and now you can leave that unchecked that's fine so smash down basically we're gonna move the uh this uh smasher down let's put it down here okay so smash down we are going to use a forever loop and then we're going to use a repeat until let me zoom in one time and then you can use the uh sensing say touching ground so basically this ground sprite whatever sprite background here we have okay and then we are going to say change y by negative two so basically coming down okay and then when it until it touched the ground what we're going to do is we're going to broadcast a message so what we don't want to do is we don't want to put this on here because that will mess up the thing will play the sound that will move up so what we're going to do is we're going to use a broadcast message okay so we'll block the uh the event so let's say new message play smash sound okay so they'll play the smashing sound so we'll create that um so when i receive um was it play smash sound okay so you can have the sound here we can set the volume also set the volume let's say 50 we don't want to be too loud and then we can say play the sound until done okay okay over here you're gonna put like the weight one second and what we want to do will make the thing go back up okay so we say repeat let's repeat repeat and then you can use the operator greater than okay okay so i forgot um i have to add one variable so what we're going to do is we're going to take the where we're doing the clone we're going to take that and then we can pass it down so that the smash down can go back up to the position that it was started okay so let's edit this you can edit and you can add one variable called y okay y variable put that there uh you can say now go to the here you can check the y position and if it's greater than this okay repeat until this and then we are going to move change y by positive five so make it move back up okay let's stop this i don't wanna run okay so and then here where we're placing the uh the clown uh the the clone um so when i start as a clone right here right this uh there was the old one right that we have the bounce for the thing we'll trash all that okay so we'll just call this new block and we're gonna pass in this variable sorry okay so pass in that variable so this will call this one okay and then it will call this and then this will show this smasher and then we'll come down okay just make sure you open the open the smash up or you can just say when the start you know high right so when it when it when it come down set up where to fix the setup so this is not correct so let's delete this let's make this number four so number four we were looking at the position right here right so something like that uh we can say like maybe two or six i don't know two five to six and let's just go i think uh higher uh let's try 50 because snatcher is a little bit higher on here right so 150 is kind of high i think it's probably start here okay so 50 should be good and then um okay let's just test it out i don't know if i miss any code uh let's see okay let's see so you can see so the smashing sound you see go back up so go up it's a little bit faster because we're using five coming down a little bit slower we use a negative two okay so you can see the smasher right but if this hit this we also want to kill the the player so we need to do that okay so grab another one of these uh when i start as a clone here okay so you don't want to mess with this you always want to get another one so that way these can run and this also can run independently okay use a forever loop here and i think i deleted the other one i shouldn't have deleted it i can just use this right duplicate this let's put it here trash this now so here we can put it down here okay so when it when they touch it this the main character and broadcast die okay let's test it out okay so when level four okay so as you can see i got killed by the spike right so if i don't get killed by the spike then i can go to the next level right so that looks all fine looks like the spike is uh the smasher is working fine so i added some more uh some more like uh stage for this so um if you have more stage right just make sure you you change this uh code okay where we have the uh the ground so change that you know if you have five stage we have to do negative six so if you have nine stage nine different costume here right nine then you do ten here okay um also uh come back to the main character i think the main character so well we have this level set also right to increase the level so you can say uh less than nine so nine of them so that one is ten so this one if we do less than ten this one you do less than nine okay and then we can start at number one go back to one or whatever you like and now you need to do like let's say um let's say you want to get more of the this is number four right number four and let's say now if i pass four i should be able to go to five and six so earlier i cannot go to spy uh six right after i go past number five so now it should allow me to do that okay let's see yeah so as you can see i have not coated this one but you can easily put that putting the uh the laser just like how we did last time right the laser here so you just say okay it's six and you want to like put a different position um push m here let's say 50 you see negative 50 and then 120 or something like that you can do that so let's say you do here let's say this is one number six and i want it to be negative 50 120 right and then you can start the character here number six so when you're making changes to your code you can make sure that you can move it to the to the location that you want so number six see and let's say you want number six you want to have this uh guy patrol here number six then you can adjust it so here just like that we do number six right so duplicate this oops sorry put that level six okay and then here a level six you can just adjust it so let's say uh i mean i already have some of the coordinate down earlier but if you don't just mess it just put something different and then you'll see so negative 90 was here right so we wanted him to go up here so uh what i had in so let's say number six let's see how number six work now so you see he's actually running over there if you if you adjust it incorrectly just adjust the left and right and then you'll find it okay so now this six is done so number six is done number seven right you need a jump pad let's say you need a jump pad here then click on this little m mouse right this is 1 7 72 117 right so this is number seven so you can just come back over here right so you can just duplicate this and put number seven oops number seven and you can put like let's say 72 i don't know 17. it might not be exactly correct right just test it out so you can change your main character go to number seven right level seven so you see yep looks okay yeah it's okay so and then you can put like a spike here if you want let's say you want to put some spikey if they've missed if they die then you can do that right this is level seven so you say okay level seven i want to put spike at this location right ctrl them this is set um so about 110 181 or something okay sorry i'm gonna hit them over there so you put 101 i think 97 is correct uh i think all these are 97 so 101.97 let's just check it out okay let's see oops that's not correct how i move this high sorry put it back okay so you see i need to move it a little bit further actually uh 1 15. 115. see 120 130 maybe so see 130 is good so as you can see this 130 looks great so so if you want another smasher here so same thing right with this here and where we have the smasher right so move this down duplicate this this is number eight right so so here i think it's in the middle so like zero or two or whatever so let's just say two and then fifty so you can test it out number eight go back here change it to eight let's stop this and you can see oh yep that's coming down correctly so you need a jump pad here to get upgrade so you can put the jump pad so jump pad let's say uh click on this somewhere 140 right take this out duplicate this this is eight oops put um 140 uh let's say negative 97. i think that is correct so let's start here so you see the jump pads there right okay so you can jump over this so there you go that's the end so you cannot go any further and that's everything so this is pretty much the game uh so this is too high i cannot get up uh so maybe i'll move this down a little bit i think originally it's different so um anyway oh you can put a jump pad and make him jump up okay please like share and subscribe to our channel and give us a thumbs up on the video okay and share with your friend that will be great thank you very much and see you guys next time bye
