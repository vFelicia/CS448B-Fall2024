welcome back guys it's kids coming playground here and today we're back for another video second post today so if you haven't watched our rock monster 1.1 which i accidentally named 1.2 so you guys can watch that because that's our first post today the second post today um so if you didn't know we saw our first day of spring and i think the fill the punxsutawney phil whatever the heck he's called the groundhog dude said that it would be six more weeks of winter well it's like it's it's like the heat of summer now so i mean like if if you live here it's so hot so phil is wrong it's a wonderful day let's have a barbecue okay so this is my project that i made it's a spring cooking game animation because people ask for a cooking spring whatever um game animation so we decided to make this so it's a wonderful day i agree let's light the fire chat other cat a bucket here a little grill hold some fire sounds and a fire we actually drew this fire and then we put the skewer on with the different foods a little it is done let's eat yeah i'm hungry so they're eating the food right now and then yeah let me put out the fire so he kicks the bucket and it flips over and it dumps the fire let's go home so then they go home so it's a simple uh animation that you can make so we're not going to teach this animation it's just a showcase and we will show you the code and we'll provide all the sprites so um we can also draw your own sprites so we'll be teaching you how to draw your own sprites so stick in for like the next 10 minutes or so so um here we go we have uh we have all this stuff so so um i'm gonna draw the vlogs for you i'm not a good artist so i'm gonna try doing this so i'm gonna get this color real quick so yeah so this is how you draw logs so paint you need outline outline no outline and then this thing the first one should look like this so it should be as big as that i mean like it's off the screen right now so you can position it better i don't know so you can also draw another one and tilt it so make a long and skinny soap because wood is always different so you can make it like thick thicker or smaller so like this you can flip it silk a skinny one you can make a skinny one i think this one should be more bigger i think this one should be more bigger uh yeah this should be fine so in that is that and then we can also make another one so we can make a a thicker one so this we can uh you can control c ctrl v so i can make the other one thicker but i decided to make this one more less because it's it looks like the smaller logs are on top and then the bigger log is on the bottom so this is basically how the fighter log should look like but i'm gonna use this costume so you guys can copy off of that and then i'm gonna show you how to draw a skewer next actually first the grill because the grill is the easier one yeah yeah so do that so um paint so first you have to start out with the little cubes so not the cubes this so draw the other two things so there's two little things on the side of the grill and you also need the thing so so i'm gonna make one like this tall and then i'm gonna put the other one all the way on the other side so it's ctrl c ctrl v and i'm gonna put it all the way here here i think i should put it there yeah so um i'll position it later so don't worry about that outline the thickness should be six so uh let's do six and then make a long line all the way across oh no all the way across here and then okay and then a second line then we get too close i think i'm ready too close so a second line oh my god i made it too close but i think that's fine i can make multiple lines to make it not like it's that close so so you have to hold the shift key while you're doing oopsies it's always too close i because the one that was over here is really close lines and i want to make it really close so it looks like the same so it should be around here yeah so three of these this looks great in my opinion i don't know but okay so you guys can follow along or you can copy this one i thought those two yeah so i just made it a little bit close so yeah i'm going to pull that one farther and then i'm going to pull this one to make it look like the same as the other one that i have so yeah great um great so look it looks it looks like grill now so and next we're gonna work on the skewer just we need to make a plain old stick here thickness is it's loading thickness is 10 so i'm gonna make this ten and then i'm gonna make it i'm gonna make it oopsies i'm gonna make it really like this did i make it i can't even see it i think it's hiding yeah it's hiding so i think it should be longer i'm not sure so yeah we can make this longer just a little bit yeah that should be the right size so i'm gonna show it here that's a little bit too long uh like a little bit shorter it's fine in your project you can make it smaller so i'm gonna make some uh uh um the whatever the fruits the veggies whatever they're called these things i think they're vegetables they're peppers pretty sure they're peppers grilling peppers so um yeah peppers we can also use a circle because circle looks quite well so you can just make it reshape it make it big and make it small doesn't matter so you can make it different sizes and shapes you can make an onion so we made an onion on one of them you can make a fish or even put a fish on one of them so it's different things you can make a lot of different creations it's your creativity because it always looks great so i'm gonna make onion ring next because onion rings are great so i could make onion rings you can see whatever this color is it's actually a circle so outline is now this and then i can make a circle no fill yeah great and then make the onion ring see great onion ring look on earring so yeah so it's just a skewer filled with meat i don't know what meat it could be any meat if you're a vegetarian that's fine you can put it all veggies because everybody likes vegetables so great we can make it a different color like red like that's a red pepper guys so so it's a red pepper guys great uh we can also put one more i'm gonna put one more i i think it's the so it can be meat if you like meat um yeah uh so i can put another piece of meat here i don't know i'm not a good artist so make it like this i don't know it looks like a pepper kinda so uh yeah i can add a little top to that all vegan skewer guys pepper pepper pepper pepper onion great all vegan so this is how you make the roasted version so you just have to duplicate it and change the color so i'm gonna start out with the green one i'm gonna change this to a darker green because it's you know whenever you roast something it gets darker if you didn't know that probably already did but i'm gonna make this one a more darker red almost like a brown so you can make it me if you want to on your game and then i can make this i'll make the brightness lower this oh my god it's almost black like this color great um and i can make this a darker red and this yellow almost like a maroon can be less golden so probably like that yeah great look it's a roasted skewer from raw to roasted so yeah or you can use this one look at this greatness so look meat there's meat peppers onions meat pepper meat and this is the roasted version oh yeah and you can also add the fish because cat two the brown one and the gray one the green one has a fish on it so you can add a fish and this is how you get a fish under thing so i'm gonna skewer too delete that costume first i'm gonna go back to the skewer oh never mind that's the regular costume so yeah this one you make the fish you just have to upload a costume and group it and put it into there so that's how you make it no no no it's a search costume so choose a costume fish because you know cats always love to eat fish i'm pretty sure these are all tropical fish i think this one might be edible not sure i don't i'm not a fish expert so yeah so fish you can just group this ctrl c and then i'll put it like over here ctrl v and then you can delete this costume afterwards and then you can just align it on one of those things so i i gotta group it first so group it group and then you can add it anywhere you want you can add it on the bottom you can add on top you can add a big fish you gotta flip horizontal you can make it flip the other way so you can even make it really big like you caught a big tuna or something i don't know to change the color of the fish you gotta ungroup it and break it up so ungroup and then you gotta get on one of those little scales and little dots and scales so that's for the whole one you can make a brown color because you just fried a fish so um yeah this is that and we can make the meat like a darker color a darker yellow like yeah nice not coloring the whole thing because it's ungrouped so nice um make it a darker or yellow it's like almost a brown color more like a plant type color not really so yeah i like a jade color i don't know so and then um you can make the eye even more darker but that's fine and you can change the color of the spots but that's fine you can do it if you want to but we ungrouped it again so now it's one spot by one spot so so this one and this one looks very similar so you can just oh i haven't grouped it so so yeah and then we can just group it back together group so and then you can add it onto your skewer if you want to but this is the raw skewer so you can put on your cooked skewer so that's basically how you do the fish and then now we're going to teach you how to do the fire so the fire is quite hard so yeah um my dad drew all these a fire costume we spent a lot of effort drawing all this stuff reshaping squares and adding all these little particle effects it took forever believe me and then uh so do you know why so please like share subscribe right now please just do it and what while you subscribe your subscribe is gonna be blazing hot and it's gonna boost our channel thank you for your subscribe thank you so you can make this fire so i'm gonna try to make this fire so i mean like not a good artist so i might just fail the fire looks very hard to do so you just have to start out with a circle looks so bland but you just have to reshape it into life so um yeah maybe change some edges make some ridges i don't know make it like a fire type of shape takes forever we might make one or two costumes or three for you to see so looks more like a dinosaur print like when you step like one of those trexes that are stumped down and they make the little print in the mud right now but we have to add all the fire effects and it will look glorious so right now i'm reshaping all the fire and making it a paw print i don't know what this is right now um looks way different cause it looks so i'm not a good artist so yeah this looks like uh a dog like a dog can but the ring finger is kind of messed up and the pinkies are in the pinky and the middle fingers so short so yeah looks like a volcano now so but you now you have to copy paste it ctrl c ctrl v you make another set of it and then you make it smaller and make it inside and now you have to change the color just a little bit and reshape it so then it'll fit inside the fire so great then we can change the color this um blazing hot thing the inside of the fire if you ever seen a fighter like in those cartoons and stuff they always have the red layer the orange layer outside and they have like the lighter orange layer and then they have the yellow layer so that's basically what we're doing right now so yeah um yeah looks this one looks way better so we can make a third one which we have to i guess so so um this fire is looking kind of screwed so um we can add a third layer but we're not gonna do that you can add some little particle effects like just some you know i don't know uh red little lava effects coming out like in minecraft if you ever played minecraft you probably have i mean like minecraft like the lava pits they always have like lava jumping out so that's basically what we're doing and then you can also make some gas as well which is because fire emits deadly gas so yeah we can make some gas make a gray color so gray draw some little i don't know a gas particles so around the fire and then you should make them go up and then new gas particles come out so we also have this in the google drive if you don't want to make your fire and it ends up looking like a butterfly or something then you can download it feel free to download it and if you don't understand watch our entire download google drive um video uh yeah you can do that it's on our channel so yeah um we could yeah so this is basically our animation you can code whatever you want but first let me show you the code to our animation so i'm starting out the butterfly because butterfly is just useless just flies there doing nothing so this is a butterfly feel free to pause because we're almost at the 20 minute mark so we gotta speed this up grill nah this is no code basically fire logs nope this is barely any code as well skewer so first i'm going to start out with the regular cat i i can't even zoom in i gotta i i could drag this thing down here so you can see it all right yeah yeah so this is for a regular cat so you could do this and and and you can make them talk back and forth like it's like a real conversation and then you can go to cat2 this is basically all the code feel free to pause remember and um yeah this is pretty good i mean like they're having like a conversation yeah i'm hungry yeah let me put out the fire and stuff so skewer this is where the skewer jumps onto the grill and starts burning itself so yeah nice you feel free to pause and then skewer two um codes everywhere so this looks great as well and then we got skewer two and then yeah and then take out oh wait i forgot to name this take out if you use the first uh costume a takeout it looks really like a bucket so you take out a it looks so much like a bucket if you do not know chinese food yeah i was like that always looks like a bucket uh outside so great um all this stuff fire gone fire put out all this stuff and then you can also do the backdrop add some music and then we have the fire tackling i did i didn't demo the fire code yet so here's the fire code and then there fighter sand oh so i just i think i think i actually got this from a real life fighter that i made a like a while ago and i just recorded like the fire just cackling and then at the camp so i just took some sound from that so yeah that's what i did so yeah that's about it guys and you guys remember to make your own story or you can just copy our story i don't know you can if you want to but remember you can be creative make your own story and you might even get it favorited so bye guys it's the end of this video and see you guys next time
