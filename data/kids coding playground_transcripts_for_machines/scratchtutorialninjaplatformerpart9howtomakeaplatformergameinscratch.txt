notification bell to receive their latest update from this channel and if you know anyone who's interested please share our channel to them alright introductions over now let's get started okay before we can just kind of overview what we had on the last time the code so you guys can pause the video if you need to just check through the code so these are some of the custom block we define for the code I think I went through that previous lessons so just one go through slowly so you guys can check so this is the begin this is the attack and okay here we had the standing movement and just then please don't tell me anything this is what we had in the previous lesson the ninja touched the water or they'll die we'll have to have something for the if the ninja touched Iran the to sell so he'll die also we added this at next level right previous lesson I think the attack ninja or that should be the same we didn't make any change to that the throwing ninja same thing the colliding ninja same thing we didn't do anything a platform just just the level that I think we say next levels changed a different level yes the way I mean the preview lesson we had that the crate same thing here if the depending on the level will move the crater a different position so we have that okay and then the waters no change here hitbox one here and then the knife hitbox is not much go right to that making clothes effect and then the night the gym the portal and then you win okay all right so today we'll add that Medusa with the Medusa I think you don't know look at the first video I mentioned where to download so once you download it you can just say pain a new sprite in here you can upload all your costume for them the zaheer I think is under here we downloaded it last time let's see not this one maybe mmm this one I don't know wanna see here so we have this deucey so you see there a lot of different one I think I added the walk right and then death you can add flex the attack and all that also different things oh I didn't I mean you can add them like Medusa attack and all shootout but for now I just only added to death and then the walk one so thing I think on my previous game also I did not have all of him I just added depth and then I added them walk okay alright let's see just so you cannot have up stuff to the stone and stuff like that and you like to put in different things okay so we'll just upload all the Medusa here you can zoom in a little bit of me like okay so to say ya won't trash the first custom okay let's take a look okay oh we have the Medusa with us so let's go back to the first level so we have tonight so I don't think we we don't really need her for the first level we just can let the music and use to the movement of the ninja so I would say by would only reduce on the first level we can start with second levels but before we do that we need to create some variable for the Medusa so just like similar to the you know the costumes who use a ninja to move we can create same thing like Medusa I still so this will keep a keep track of the that what costume the Medusa will have right just so we can rename her okay or remember Medusa here okay so and then we'll need more variable we're gonna keep track of how them to do some wall so there's left and right so we're gonna use some position so that we couldn't find a position of the space here depending on the level and all in position the Medusa won't use that so let's create something called the right position and okay so the right position the left position will keep track of what we're moving the Medusa phone line left right here or any other Enya level okay and then now we'll create a new block my block will call it my two stop okay so this block wall you know define how them because I will start okay so the first thing what to do is we are going to show her in case you die she hides a letter show and then we have to say go to the front layer and that will clear any graphics so the tips are die we can like give you one you can make like those are flashing or whatever like oh cosa fact or whatever who can do that and then we can set up up with him one more very long look who's HP right this is like the health point of the Medusa so we can give them give her like five points or whatever done her eye water three you know I think make it new be faster when we're doing testing so the monster and then whether set the custom in next that's the walk in costume so I'm not going to use the death costume my parents which fishing one to death custom within that's good now this is for walking so we can't stop one so if we see here custom we have like walk walk one two three four eight so just look through that phone number okay and we have the use of ever loop yeah and then we'll check a bit attacked by the ninja so it'll say if condition here where the color sensing touching source they touching the ninja attack which is this ninja so they use a Madusa then you know she don't get damaged what we can do is we're gonna or cast the event and wait so wish you use the weight so that way you don't get more than one damage on her when you slice her okay what what cast got hit the middle so got hit and duplicate this as well so you can duplicate this as well or you can do or statement right so like you can say yeah gotten hit by this as well right you can say get hit or you can say the or statement so you take this out you can take this down isn't there something called all operator put this here and you can drop this inside here it's just the same thing you know so you don't need that to your statement yeah let me stop the game okay all right so we've got that so next won't make them to do some move so to say we'll keep on moving five step at the time and we will check some position so let's say yeah we can make them into saving on the first stage and maybe fine let's say yeah okay now if we use some condition here so we'll say if the exposition which is the current person where the Medusa is you know the exposition okay for her so we'll stay here exposition will take that out and what he is the operator here will use so the exposition is created then the Medusa so what the finding position for her know like here in here so before could actually get the exposition comparison what they'll come and check the Medusa so this is a pretty big platform we can put her someone the middle here what we can do is this we you remember we have a events a podcast stop set up where were you then here somewhere I that podcaster set up when the game started that's where that is thinking is on the other co okay we need look for that cell but I think I found it there's too many Co here but it's right here so when this thought of the greenback is click with podcast is set up so we can use that to set up the Medusa first so we'll say when I receive set up so now we're going to check what level it is so it is done so this level one will do something different the visible to will be something different so we'll check if equal so level if level was one which is this level right now we're using your levels one won't move so put that over here is the one here okay and then we'll put down for the next level that's a platform won't switch it to a second costume so when I say what is it box for now okay so the second customers say what matters are here don't worry about all the other things right now we just check in the position so here this is the second level so we'll just duplicate this one we kiss and we'll take this down sorry I think it clicked on it this way so what I'm like right oh wait here okay so we'll say take that so it's you can't in here like you see this like Kenna you kind of guess so you can see how this exchange so from here all the way here like this is 38 38 plus you know 75 ish you'll be on this side so what we're going to do is we're gonna add an I mean add and minus 75 for that position so that we know when we will tell them that this to turn back around one one other walk off the edge right so that's what we use that left and right position for okay so this is the the to solve the second stage right hmm think this looks better than this just take that and then now let's look at third stage and we'll use the ask them to third stage we can put her like maybe right here right so go back to the code so in this level three go move her to this position here it's four one two three so we set up for all three level okay and what we can do is we are going to set the variable so no every time to set up start we'll set the variable so we know where the left position the maximum left position she can go and right position okay so what the vision is was that the right position so we can take the x position of this unit this right here and we come and use the operator so this is x position oops 75 and the y position we then the other position the right position one use plus service is the same so x position plus 75 okay now let's run a check later watch this and then we'll this will call this my paw mittens sstop soak call this block here so let's go back to our block for the matusa start so now we know the position right now we can check so Calista so what will run this you'll see the exposition in my position of the unit so now let's see okay so the so whether compared is a exposition of the Medusa to the right okay so the exposition is greater than the right somewhere to make her to turn pointed in a 90degree okay and then we'll say would not need another condition here okay we'll say if the exposition open the operator here then less than and we'll need to variable the left position so basically we won t it was too far the Medusa walk too far greater than the right right position that wanted to turn around so so right now the 90 so this is here's negative 90 not sure whether turn her back around why so close like negative 90 so she's to father right would has turned to the left and it was too far to the left will say turn to the right this is my knee and was a 1 keep her stop her for now we also want to keep her from rotating click on this okay okay let's and then we will or check them a do some costume okay we'll say if the costume okay so check the costume because we're gonna keep on adding right if the costume is created in three then four so I have it done I'll have to change it back we'll have to set it back to one set them with there's a custom back to one okay and what we could want to do is we're gonna switch to costume over here and we're gonna use the join operator okay so you can see our custom for walk is walk one right so we need to have something walk one two and three and four so what walk I just copied it delete that and I can only use the variable so this is what one what to walk three walk for it and then we can put a weight in between and what was it 0.1 and then we'll change the variable increase it by one that way we'll walk this Medusa what the next costume okay so as you can see she found move like this right okay stop this so let's go back to the beginning so let's see so you see she walk although she kept it in Jonathan and she won't back so you can adjust this right maybe I don't know six seventy maybe also okay this is depending on the DL the how big a platform is so now not walk as far and you see all turn around just just just fix that so that you can get them with this I kind of look back and forth back and format that okay all right we'll stop here for now and we'll continue on the next lesson I don't want to keep the video too long all right thank you guys please like share and subscribe to our channel bye
