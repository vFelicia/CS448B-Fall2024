so hey guys it's kids coding playground and today we will be doing another video on like a type of space invaders game it's called wizard defense so in wizard defense the point of the game is to survive and you save the coast we'll be learning these following concepts and scratch a custom sprite repeat until clone touching sprite and broadcast message so I'll be showing you my demo on what this game is actually on so the music is actually pretty loud so if you can see and so there the music is just a shoot control so they shoot out daggers and they try to hit you to win and it says you win or you can lose and lose all your lives let's try to lose here so it says you lose so that's how the game works so let's get a new game a new project and then before we start please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section to see what you what content you want to see or to rate what we write rate how good we are or you can post things and tell us what you want to see next so let's see so the first sprites we need we need a bunch of sprites we need first we can choose a backdrop so I'll Universal Defense game so let's choose like a castle a sort of castle now there is a castle yep so I chose this one because it's like you're opening up a castle so we need also some sprites so the pros right there is actually no pro sprite so I took the parents bright and actually um the parent and just changed the color so let's just change it right now right so you can change the color if you want umm yeah so that's the pros we can make the eye red or something yeah we can make it red make it look like it's evil so we also need other sprays we need the wizards right the wizards right let's change the size to 30 yep that's small enough let's change the sizes later first let's um get our sprites oh we have to paint our sprites so we have to paint our sprites this paint a fireball sprite so it's coming out of the Wizards hands oh that's really big we can make it smaller so we got the fireball sprite yeah so we can give it an outline say black then we got to restart this thing so so I added an outline so we can change the thickness to for one was too skinny oh we can as you can see it's right oh yeah you have to Center it we can move this to the center you can have the extra details if you want but let's skip over that from now huh let's draw the details let's make it more closer to the thing and then let's draw a knife we need a draw a knife for the parent I mean the crow we can change this let's draw the knife so first we need the square first we need this square the rectangle well we can change this color a more darker color around there umm let's change that outline so let's change it to black so we can do that and that we can make it smaller later so so there's a reshape tool right here so didn't draw a she just took gray first we can do this but then there's a reshape tool you can reshape this to look like it's pointy like a knife so I just noticed this thing goes a little bit too skinny you need the pointer tool let's click that and let's change it to ten make it more thicker I think yeah that's thick enough and we always we can select this and change it to ten and then we can move this a little bit out around yeah like later we can make it so we've got adjusted a little bit oh I think that yeah that that's good that looks so as you can see I adjusted it from there and you know I think it looks a little bit better than before so let's work on the let's work on that you win sprite so we got paint another sprite so you can use any font you won but then let's use you can use sans serif yeah stick with sensory you can use marker marker looks pretty good let's type you wait let me change this color to let you win we can make it bigger it's about the size and that's about the size you wait so we gotta we can make it another costume you change the color we have to Center that and then there are you lose so you probably can't see it that well because the fireball is right as well but let's get to the code so the wizard first so we have to start always with the overall yeah we always have to start with if I clicked yeah zoom in um let's go to you can go to right here yeah let's make it go to right here we can set that set the size to 30 yeah it's already 30 but just in case if you did said it you can set it to 30 set score to zero so let's make a new variable first score you need the variable score for this part and lives so you always have to set the score to 0 and set the lives to 5 because you can do anything you want you can do 100 but I'm gonna use 5 you're gonna go forever let's use a forever blue so then so it can keep on moving left and right and left and right so we're not doing up arrow keys we're only doing on set right left so let's do sensing touching cuz we always have to know keep pressed not touching key pressed because key pressed is um the right arrow key the left arrow key those things issues left first uh we can use change X by 10 you can duplicate it change X by negative 10 because the right arrow is 10 but left overs negative 10 because the left is the opposite over right so a key press we need another key pressed you can duplicate it if you want this is the whole process change X by 2 let's change this to the right arrow key so next we'll be working on looks like how the wizard is moving well I didn't click start yet as you can see he's moving around he can move yeah so right now you can move so let's work on the fireball just pause this is sprite 1 let's rename it to fire when start always let's say let's go one more I think that's good set set size 2 that's a hundred it's really really big let's say 15 see how big this is oh wow yeah yeah that's the right side it's this big yeah that's the right size on point in Direction 90 dream direction 0 in it because it's facing up because it's facing up because if you use 90 it's so it's facing up because I mean the ball has to face up and its hind let's hide it and then you need a ifthen spaceclick because you have to click a spacebar to shoot bullet you use a or whatever you want but create clone of myself of myself so it'll keep on creating it's a clone of itself and then let's start sounding the pot when it comes out wait zero point five seconds and then when I started as a clone that's when he's when he awakens and when you can see him oh go to the wizard so then it follows the Wizards lead I'll go to the wizard it will smooth this I'll go to the wizard um it'll show let's make it show so see it you can see it I'll repeat until it's touching the edge or the crow edge or so change Y by 10 so keep on going up until it touches the edge or touching the crow and then I'll delete this clone when it touches the edge in the end I don't like this code so the last thing we're gonna work on on part one is the music so you can take a if flag clicked pick green flag clicked this says it really this doesn't really have that much code so we can zoom in this and then we always have to have a forever loop we gotta get it sound you can use any sound you want but I'm gonna use a medieval too cause it's more of a medieval Lord medieval ish for this type of situation cuz it's like a medieval and that's the code for medieval I'm gonna show you how this works so let's hide the crow it's all so hot that you lose sprite and the knife as you can see you can move with the wizard wizard we're WASD the music is working Nixon next pops out and that is the end for part 1 thank you for listening and have a good day
