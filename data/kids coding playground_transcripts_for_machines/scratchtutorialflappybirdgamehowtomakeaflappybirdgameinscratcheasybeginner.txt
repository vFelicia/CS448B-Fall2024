so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding playground today we'll be making a flappy bird game so we're going to be making a simple flappy bird engine and i'll be trying to do this as fast as i can it i can probably do it in under 10 minutes this is a really simple flappy bird game um so we'll be learning these following concepts in scratch we're going to be using keys to control the sprites uh custom block broadcasting messages and sensing blocks so we're gonna move on to the um demo so i'm gonna zoom in so you can either use a space bar clicking or up arrow to like you just dodge them and every three pipes you dodge you get three points i'm doing this because we have all three pipes in one costume and if you touch the top you lose if you touch the bottom you lose and if you touch a pipe you lose so yeah um so if you touch the top you lose you touch a pipe you lose and let's just fall and you lose so that's three ways to lose so yeah let's go so let's go um let's start a new project okay new projects okay so let's delete the scratch that will not need it so we're gonna um also rename this thing to flappy bird and i have i have uh every sprite uh in the backpack so if you want to download the sprites um just go to the link in the description in the google drive and you can just download it there um and we're still seeing a lot of messages on people of people um asking us for requests on the access for the game you actually do not need requests you just have to um use your own personal account to get into the google drive to download these sprites so we have the pipes flappy bird ground and loose so you lose you can just draw yourself so right now we're gonna do a backdrop i have it uploaded right here so let's go to backdrops boom okay so let's delete this one okay so now let's go on to the code for the flappy bird so right now we're gonna make a new block let's name it fly so we're gonna name the new block fly and if we're gonna need two ores put an ore right there put an order right there if key space is being pressed oops if key space is pressed and or key up arrows press or mouse down then we're going to set we're going to make a new variable we're going to make a variable called speed y so let's set the speed y to 10 and then we're going to make this and then after that we're gonna set the speed wide and negative two so like it will just keep on going down after we go up so oh change not sorry not set change the speed y under here speed y by negative two so that's the fall speed and then we're going to change the y by the speed y so just change the y by 10 basically so change the y by speed y and then we're going to get a one green flag clicks let's put that under here and zoom in a little bit um also i set it wrong so you're supposed to actually change it by negative two right here i actually accidentally said ten so so now let's get a one green flag clicked we're gonna go to negative 180 y zero that's what we're going to do like somewhere right here and then we're going to wait 0.5 seconds just half a second before the game starts so like all the flappy bird will just be in place for like half a second and after that we're going to get a forever loop and call this function black and then after that we're going to get a one green flag clicked get a forever loop if if the touching edge uh touching right there if touching edge which means if it's touching the top edge then we're gonna broadcast a new message let's name it game over so this is an infinite game so you can't win so you can only lose um now let's go on to the pipes so for the pipes we're gonna get a one green flag clicked and in the costumes for the pipes i just um took this thing and then i just downloaded from online and i made three different things like here three different sets and i made them different elevations and then it's like a different difficulty so make it a little bit more variety in the game so after this we're gonna get make making new variables needed score and then we're going to set the score to zero in the beginning and then we're going to go to the back layer with the pipes go to back layer with the pipes and then we're going to get a go to go to 240 so like somewhere in here x is 240 and then we're going to pick random for the y position maybe pick random negative 20. negative 22 40. and then we're going to repeat until let's get it repeat until and then it's touching the flappy bird so this is a pipe it'll just repeat until it's touching the flappy board and then i'll move negative three steps so just move to the left and then if the x position is less than of the x position is less than the negative 450 so we're doing negative 450 because the end of this thing right here the last um um doesn't oh it's like if you end it at 2 4 negative 240 it would just randomly glitch all the way right here so we don't want that we want all the pipes to finish at the end before moving so we're going to do negative 450 and then after that we're going to get a go to so we're going to go to go to 450 so the reset position after it's done will be like right here 450 uh pick random negative 20 to 40. so you just duplicate that and then um we're gonna change the score by three every three uh every three pipes you pass because it's one sprite we can't just do one for each so that's why we do three um and then after this we're gonna broadcast game over here and then for the ground let's go to the ground one green flag clicked we're gonna go to let's zoom in a little let's go to zero negative 210 wait one second and then forever if the uh if touching flappy bird so if the ground is touching the flappy bird then we're gonna broadcast a message called game over uh and then after that we're gonna go to the lose so for the costumes is what i did i just got um two of these things i got from online and put them together so like there's one right here one right here so we put the link in the description and the google drive to download these so remember you can download these from the google drive so after that this is that this is the end so we're gonna get a one green flag clicked go to zero zero go to the front layer oh yeah i forgot to zoom in so you guys can see it better go to front layer and we're gonna hide and then after that we're gonna get a when i receive game over show and stop all alright so now we're finished let's demo the game okay so now let's go full screen so i'm just going to use the spacebar so as you can see the flappy bird is jumping and every three pipes you pass you'll get three points as you can see and you can even use the clicking you can even click with this you can even use the clicking settings oops accidentally clicked off the screen so it's glitching now let me refresh the page and we'll come back okay so now we refresh the page let's see so sometimes it will fall too fast and glitch a little bit um so you can add a little bit more wait time if you'd like right here so stop this you can add a little more wait time maybe let's add one second instead of 0.5 so then now you have a little bit more wait time so yeah as you can see it's fully functioning and as you can see every time the pipes will change its position the y position so yeah that's pretty much the game flappy bird so thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share and subscribe and i'll see you guys in the next tutorial bye
