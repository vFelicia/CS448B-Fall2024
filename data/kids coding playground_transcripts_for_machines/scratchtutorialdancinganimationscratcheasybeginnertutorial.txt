welcome back guys this kid coding playground here and today we're back for another video and today we're doing something different it's a dancing animation this is a dancing animation of ballerinas and bets dancing animation today tutorial we will be learning these concepts in scratch clothing loops and color effect so I'm going to show your demo let's open the screen these you can bats or dancing in the ballerinas are also in they're all different color its refuse close to this yes as you can see there's also music playing in the background so we can create a new project looking it look first things first let's name it dance so we can delete this the regular cat sprites we can get the ballerina sprite and also the that's bright okay so you can change the backdrop to anything you want I'm gonna stick with the blue sky cuz there's bats in the background so move them right here so let's work on the backdrop first so you can use any song you want you can you collect them through the sounds thing so it's really simple you see it forever you can pick two the sound you want so you can go I mean you can search them up or you can click loops or this long song um so next I'll take X so let's work on the ballerina so the ballerina bat have fairly the same code but the bachelors on top of the ballerina so you gotta change it to go to so you just move it evenly there so you got to put a hide so in the beginning don't hide and then oh go to here we can drag it more in yes put this back in you can do so I mean also we have to put the repeat 6 times because you can make 6 clones or 5 clones or whatever you want but I'm gonna stick with the six clothes so you can create the clone of myself move 75 steps so the 75 steps is for the valeriy not to move and create a clone and move and create a clone and move and create clothes so you can also change the colour effect if you want that's optional and when I start us a clone it will show each clone will show go forever wait 0.5 seconds 0.5 0.5 same as 0.5 and then I'll go the neck costume so keep on dancing so the bat is the same code but you're gonna move on top I'm gonna go adjust the bat down a little bit because I think it's a little bit too high so we can move the ballerina code but remember they change the the go to so just take out this go to go to move in and take this code so so I'm just gonna try out the game so let's make it fullscreen as you can see I made duplicates that's and then ballerinas too and they're all different color well that only changes the color of its nose so yeah that's it for today please like share and subscribe before you go and please bring the notification spell in common to see what you want later for us to code next thank you
