hello and welcome back to kids coding playground and today we will be doing another tutorial in scratch so today we'll be making a rock paper scissors game inside scratch so first i'm gonna show you how the game works so let's go full screen so the player can select either the paper rock or scissors rock paper scissors to say select rock um as you can see it said player wins because rock beats scissors and see if i paper i win again computer pick rock when i get scissors i win again because the computer uh played a paper so it's like a simple rock paper scissors yeah and if they both pick the same thing it's a tie and computer wins because they picked paper and i picked rock so yeah it's a simple rock paper scissors game it's like the one where i do a python tutorial on rock paper scissors it's like the same thing so all right so let's get started by creating a new account so i'm new new project so it's a new project we're gonna name it rock paper scissors game that's good okay let's delete the scratch cat let's import some sprites first i have the let me put this one first so this is a player and this is the um enemy uh computer so inside i have three costumes of rock costume paper costume and scissors same the computer i have the rock costume papers costume and the scissors costume so we will put these into google drive so you guys can download them i just got these images from online so yeah and then we also have the um button where you click the rock the paper button and the scissors button and also we have the result button yeah so this is just like the computer wins or the player wins thing and then finally we have a backdrop to put in here like that so the backdrop kind of looks like this we actually got this backdrop from like some other old scratch project i don't know what it's called but like i got this from somewhere all right so inside the player we are going to start coding actually now let's start coding in the backdrop so inside the backdrop we're going to code like all the results and all that stuff so first we're going to start off by making a new custom block we're going to name the custom block called check results so we're going to make a custom block called check result all right after we have created the custom block check results we will get back to that later first we will have to go to the buttons so in the button we are going to uh make a variable in the variable called choice one which is the choice for the player and inside the rock i'm just going to make it go to whatever this position is so there's a group like let's go to whatever negative 175 y 80 and we're going to show and when we click on the sprite we're going to set this choice 1 to rock so the player click picks brock we're gonna broadcast a message and we're gonna name it start game start game alright now let's go to the paper button inside the paper button we're also going to make it go to whatever this position is one green one clicked go to negative 109.80 and we're going to show when this sprite is clicked we're going to set the choice one variable to paper and then we're gonna broadcast start after start game after you uh click this all right so and then finally we have the scissors which is also the same thing the button scissors we're going to get it when green fly clicks go to whatever this position is negative 45 y80 and we're going to show and whenever when the sprite is clicked we're going to set the variable choice 1 to scissors scissors and we're going to broadcast the message start start game so basically these sprites are basically the small mini version of these and we just drew a black uh box that covers it all right now let's go to the backdrop so inside the backdrop we are going to when i receive the start game bro broadcast message we are going to broadcast we have to broadcast and wait actually so then wait for the action to finish so we're gonna broadcast new game new game and we're going to uh broadcast and wait show result show result this is these uh broadcasts are for later but i will just uh put them right now and after that after showing the result we want to broadcast game over so obviously it does not do anything yet because we have not broadcasted the message so now we're going to work on the custom block so we're going to define whatever this custom block means so now we are going to um make the custom block define the check result so before we begin coding we're going to make a few variables so we're going to do choice 2 and choice 2 is the computer um like the your opponent the computer we're also going to make another variable called winners so you know who's going to win all right and we're going to get if elsington first so in this define we're going to get if the choice 1 is equal to choice 2 meaning the if the player is equal to the computer so if they're both equal then that means it would be a tie right so we're going to set the variable winner to time and then um next we're going to get another if else statement so if else inside here so if choice one is equal to rock so let's say the player chooses rock so the player doesn't change you have to remember that so the players uses rock and then we're gonna get another if l statement put it right here and if the um computer chooses paper which is choice 2 paper then we're going to set the winner to computer because paper beats rock so we're going to set choice 2 i mean winner wrong variables winner we're going to set winner to computer and next we will get and just duplicate this we're going to set else we're going to set it to player so the player will win because the computer will pick scissors and the player is rock all right and then we're just going to duplicate this right here put this in the else um just take this out so if choice one we're gonna need if else another if else in here so we can just remove that for now so if the choice one player is equal to paper get another if else and if the choice two let's duplicate this choice two is equal to oops choice two is equal to scissors well scissors beats paper and player uses paper and the computer chooses scissors so we're going to set the winner to computer set the winner to computer else right here we're going to set the winner to player player because the player will win because the computer picks rock and the player has chosen paper all right and then one last if else condition right here inside here we're going to get an if else statement so right here we're gonna get if else if this thing is equal to rock choice 2 is equal to rock rock so if the computer chooses rock then we will set the winner to computer because the player would have chosen scissors and we don't need to check like this if else condition on top because the player will pick scissors and then else we're going to set the winner to the player because the computer would have picked uh paper and the player would have chosen scissors so right this thing is basically the same thing as this thing but this isn't necessary so you can also do this if you want that is basically the same thing but we don't need to check the condition because the player will have picked scissors all right and after we're done defining this thing the check results we are going to go to my blocks and put this right there all right all right now let's go to the computer we're gonna start coding on the computer first so right here we broadcast a new game right so inside the computer we're going to receive a message when i receive new game new game let's zoom in then we're going to repeat five times next costume so when a new game starts like when the player chooses something we're going to like make it change costumes a little bit so it'll look a little bit cooler i guess i guess i don't know and we're going to set we're going to make a list actually so this we're going to make a list called computer choice so this is like a list for whatever the computer chooses so first we're gonna set the variable uh choice two um and we have to do one green five clicks first we have to code the list and then we can work on this one so first we're gonna have to delete everything of the list delete all of computer choice and we're gonna add three things we're gonna add rock paper and scissors so we're going to add these three things to the list scissor spell it wrong seriously and then we're going to get the item thing item one of computer choice we're going to uh set the choice to pick random one to three item of the computer choice like that now okay if else statement if if uh the choice two is equal to rock so let's say the computer picks rock if choice two is equal to rock then we will switch the costume to rock which is obviously the rock costume and then we can just duplicate this if l statement they're not common oops duplicate uh put that in here and the else and if choice two is equal to paper and the else then we're gonna search costing the paper else we're gonna switch it to scissors like that so yeah so this is just switching the costume okay now let's go to the player the player sprite we're gonna when i receive new game okay let's zoom in hello understand new game we are going to we can honestly just like drag and drop this into here just change a few things up obviously we are taking this out we can keep all this instead we're going to do choice one and choice one right here with new rock paper and scissors so yeah obviously you'll switch to the corresponding uh costumes like that all right the player was pretty simple now let's go back to the buttons we'll have to code a little bit more in here so it's just really simple when i receive new game we're going to hide hide and when i receive game over we're also going to hide just drag and drop this for each one like that all right we're not quite done yet because we have it's also the result code that one's pretty simple honestly um let's go to the results this thing so inside the result we will be uh when green fly clicks for us we have to like set the position now whatever this position is we're gonna hide and when i receive new game new game we are going to hide and when i receive game over just duplicate this let's receive game over we're also going to hide and then when i receive show result we're going to show so basically in the backdrop um we broadcast show results so like once the player and computer are done then it will show the results of who wins so right here we have two costumes i mean three costumes we have player wins computer wins and a tie and three costumes we're gonna show it and we're gonna do if else if the winner is equal to the tie so if they both tie we winner is equal to time then we are going to switch costume to the thai costume duplicate this if the winner is um player switch costume to player wins else is going to switch the costume to computer wins all right and then right here we're just going to make it look better by changing some graphic effects so we're going to uh bro repeat two times uh and then we're going to set the color effect to 50 just make it turn purple that means turn purple i'm gonna wait 0.25 seconds and clear graphic effects and now we're going to wait another 0.25 seconds so boom like that all right so now let's save the project let's run the game so let's go full screen as you can see i lost because i had rock and the computer had the uh paper and one thing we could do is let's go back to the button inside the button right here this actually is supposed to be show sorry about that so then you can continuously play you don't have to stop like you don't even clicking the green flag to restart so you have to actually you can actually put show if you would like right here if you don't want the game to stop so you can put show like that all right the results pretty sure you also put show no you don't need i don't think you do so let's save it again let's try it again so all right as you can see i won as you can see you don't have to keep on clicking the green flag to get these things come back again so it's pretty good i win again hi uh computer wins so yeah it's pretty cool pretty simple rock paper scissors game on scratch um well thank you guys for watching and don't forget to leave a like and
