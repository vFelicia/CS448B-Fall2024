welcome back guys it's kidsgirlplayground here and today we're back for another video and today we're back for another video in scratch and today we'll be drawing pikachu on scratch and it was suggested by somebody named coding with srihas and uh they wanted us to draw a pokemon pikachu so we have tried to attempt that so i'm going to close this now and yeah let's just close this and then um so there's i'm going to be drawing this pikachu today and in the costumes as you can see i made all these new costumes like red pikachu relic pikachu checkerboard uh whatever this thing is rose rose uh futuristic and a lot more okay so yeah let's start so we'll be trying to attempt to draw a pikachu so i'm painting a new sprite well let's get started so first you draw a line to for the top portion of the head so just draw a straight line and now we'll do some insane reshaping move that thing up move this thing up and like make it kind of round and kind of look like a hexagon or octagon and move that out and yeah you can make these yeah move it out move it out yeah and then so we have that so we have the top portion of it said so now we color it so actually we get the mouse and we click on it and then there's this fill button so you like go around 14 100 same thing whatever it doesn't matter doesn't matter so 14 yep we have the right color and now we make the body so the body has it's just a complex of lines so line up line down kinda down so line up line down line up line to the side kinda down and line down downish right and we keep on going so lying down straight line line to the side line up lines at the side line up line to the left line up and line to the left so now we have its body finished and done so yeah uh one one arm is more fatter than the other arm so it might need some tuning so get the right shape so we're going to change this to the color oh first we have to reshape it to make it look more round because like you know it looks better and we have to make it curve in the side curve so we just have to curve this a little bit turn it down curve it down and a little bit to the side and then yeah we have right curved pikachu's body so now we have to work on the fill for this thing so pointer and then you get the fill color so there we have it and then you have that and then move it a little bit yeah make the head a little bit larger so then it'll fit on so yep now we've done it and now we have to do the nose the mouth the cheek and the eyes so yeah i have to round this back out it's too round a little bit down yeah that looks fine so now we're going to do the legs actually because it seems more easier it looks like you're more done with the project when you do that ctrl c ctrl v and then we move it to the other side and make it go backwards and make the other one go backwards as well so now we're focusing on the ears so let's do that oval shape kind of like a lips like how yeah a black oval and a yellow oval on top of the black oval so let's get that i no color put that on top like that and we have an ear just like that and now we move that and we have the ear we group them and then we rotate and place it on control c control v and then put it on the other side and rotate make it go back make the other ones go back there we have it we have the two little ears and now we're gonna work on the eyes the nose the mouth the cheekbones and the tongue so first we start out the eyes which is just hold shift down when you're making a circle move it to the other side we oh yeah we make this smaller circle in first make the pupil so zoom in make the pupil and then put that near them kind of the side and then you do that ctrl c group ctrl v and then we move it on the other side of the head and we move this one on this side of the head so now we can make the nose which is just a four thickness line that's really small and we just curve it up a little bit it's really easy to make the nose and just click right click reshape done and then we put it on so we have that and now we're going to make the mouth which is just a straight line make him say stay neutral but we curve it so curve down curve up double click curve down and we are done so it's like a squiggly line like up and down and up ah so it's like a w kind of so i place down the mouth now i might have yeah so i placed on the mouse now so yeah we have that and we make it like that and now we have the mouse so now we make a black part of the tongue which is just pure black and it's circle and we have a circle and now we have a red circle on top of a black circle so we have a red circle and then the outline no outline and then we have that and we reshape it move it down a little bit just a little bit and then we have our tongue so and then we place it on with the pointer tool and and yeah make it a little bit out yeah and we're basically done with the tongue here and then we have to group it and then move it on and we have our tongue now it's time to draw the cheekbones uh which is just red circle on uh the side uh and we have that place it on ctrl c ctrl v and we have the other cheaper and now we just have to draw a complex of lines to make the uh tail so it's just one line oh that's thickness one four so we got four and here we have up upright up up right down left down left and we and down up so we have that and we make the fill inside and we have the tail first we must make the fill size pretty sizable here so have that paint that in move it to the back and we're done with our pikachu that accidentally ate too much so uh um you can make many variants of your pikachu here like what i did when i showed you in the beginning so like duplicate be creative you know red you know bam bam bam bam bam so you can just make many evil pikachu i don't know you can do anything you want it and it's gonna be you can have some fun with this like make yellow cheeks uh so yeah uh this pikachu game i mean not pikachu game this
