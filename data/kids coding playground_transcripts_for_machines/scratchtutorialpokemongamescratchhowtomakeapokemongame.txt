welcome back guys it's kids coding playground here today we're back for another video of scratch so if um so i uh this is this is um the suggestion for us to make this pokemon game it's just called pokemon game and it was by swati pandy and aryan uggarwal said broke please can you provide a link where i can get pokemon sprites so we did do some pokemon sprites and swati pandy had such a good um uh suggestion for us to make a pokemon game so we decided to make a pokemon game today so um so this is basically our pokemon game i'm gonna demo it but first before i demo it i'm gonna show you the sprites by um by community and so so these are basically the sprites and what they are so there's like i don't know all the pokemon but i'm pretty sure this is venusaur this is like the exploding bomb coconut dude this is like blastroid i forgot his name i don't know uh so there's a bunch of sprites you can choose from the rat great shoe so and that we have um our this link and the link in the description you can douse or download how we made it and there's like gig bat and they have like wiggly puff and jigglypuff so and they also have a low end so to get one of these dudes you have to right click like psyduck you can just right click on psyduck and then save as a gif so i'm gonna do that so save images this will paris right there so i'm gonna do this the gif there's the gif so uh you can write whatever that is i i don't know how to spell psyduck i think it's spelled like this if i'm not mistaken and um just like that you click save and then you have your new psyduck so as you can see i can upload it into this game so i'm going to show you how to upload it i'm not going to use psyduck because i didn't code it at all yet so let's go slide up right here so psyducks yo you got all these cool costumes with them so you can use any pokemon you actually want from this link so this is basically how you get the pokemon at this i'll link in the description so you can just take that link and get like if you don't want pikachu well pikachu is the most known so if you don't want pikachu you don't have to use pikachu you can use psyduck if you want squirtle you could use paris if you don't if you yeah that's basically um what it is so i'm gonna demo the game so um uh so you have a little pointer and it follows your mouse so um so as you can see there's a bunch i have 20 pokeballs if i if i i think that's not what they're called it's there's like a bird i don't know if this is called i think it's called pigeon i don't know how to pronounce it okay uh and there's like charizard here squirtle pikachu and the pig joy so they pick a random position around here you got 20 pokeballs and there's pokemon pokemon caught so you can just do this and then catch one by clicking the up arrow key it says got it and if you don't get any it says mist and it makes a sound so you can catch some of these you catch charizard so some appear faster than others like pig joint he appears he goes away really quickly so you have to be on the lookout for you just catch these people without trying to run out of pokeballs so i'm gonna see we need 15 to win so if i make oh my god i only have exactly enough to win so i won you won and if you lose i'll just speed up the process for you guys so i sped up the process a little bit my three pokeballs left just throw it over here so obviously and if you run out of it it says you awesome simple game cool it's really it's really good it's similar to some other our games that we made earlier so all of these are links in the description the pokeball the bullseye the banner everything though backdrop the pokemon the pokemon and um let's start a new project i haven't played pokemon in a while so i mean like it's still a pretty fun game so pokemon game so the first thing you should do is just name this so before i start please like share subscribe um and comment um if you play pokemon in the comments below so yeah please comment if you play pokemon i'm pretty sure some kids still play pokemon so um let's just keep on going so first we have to delete the scratch cat and i do have some things in my backpack because i'm very bad artist in scratch so the bullseye because i mean like you can download this links in the description or you can draw yourself just um a circle you just erase you just don't have the middle and then you have another circle like that and then you just put the four lines that's basically how you draw it and um we have it in the description so don't worry you guys can always download that so i'm also gonna drag the pokeball in and the banner so i do have the banner so and i have the backdrop links in the description so i have it here so there we go the forest pokemon forest link's in the description too and that's all i have so let's get going so i also have my pokemon drag all my pokemon inside so links in the description again so i have pidgeoi pikachu the most wellknown squirtle are really wellknown as well venusaur is pretty well known but we don't have in this project because we already have pigeon we just wanted a flying one charizard is i think 289 costumes near 300 this might take a while to load oh wow that was actually really quick for something that has like 300 something costumes so um let's start coding so the first thing i'm going to code is the bullseye so i'm just gonna get to the bullseye right here so i'm trying to get this quick quick quick quick quick because um it's already seven minutes and 31 seconds so i'm going to try to get this really quick done so you can feel free to pause it whenever you need to so when the green flag is clicked you'll set size to a hundred percent you'll go to the front layer because you always wanted to be at the front layer in front of like everything and show so i'm going to do go to so i i already have coordinates so go to 6 45 feel free to deposit i know this might i might try to go this in one go so i'm trying to be slow and quick at the same time so it'll go forever and go to mouse pointer so follow your mouse anywhere you go so next close next script so we need to make a variable x and y so x and y so um we go x exit y when the green flag is clicked they'll go clear all right graphic effects because yeah and then it'll go forever set x because you because you want it to follow your mouse so set x to x position and then set y to y position so y to y position actually might need a second part so i think so so it'll change color effect by 20 to show you where it is so we're done with the bullseye that was very quick quick two minutes so now we're gonna work on the pokeball we probably can do the pokeball next but not all of it has a bunch of code so when the green flag is clicked he'll set the pokeball we don't have the pokeball yet so make pokemon caught and then to zero so you have no score and go to the front layer and set size to 50. and i'll go to the position i have it already at and show it's been oh so i can do this one first so when the green flag is clicked go forever and turn 15 degrees so let's make it go back one layer because it'll be behind the bullseye i think it's actually over here go backward one layer and it will next we have to work on shoot so when the up arrow is pressed it will shoot it so if then pokey ball so you need to end so if the pokeball is more than zero and not not the pokemon is caught zero 15 i meant so it'll broadcast shoot and wait and then i'm gonna work on the sounds for shoot which is high whoosh if yeah so i think i already have it no i don't and then i was right here yeah i already have high wish so so we do have high whoosh inside this sprite library i mean the sound library so right there and this means that if you have not have more pokeballs then you still have pokeballs in your hand and you cannot win you don't win yet so that means you can still throw them so that's basically what it means and i also have a little cool effect oh so when i receive shoot repeat 12 times um change size minus two and then and so when you throw it it gets smaller and smaller next of the code is really really really really big so we have to work on that quick so in this whenever you shoot it'll change poke ball by minus one negative one now glide zero point five to x and y and then you need it if then else after if then else after if thanos so first if that mouse is touching pikachu so i already have pikachu inside here so picture and then we have to do broadcast hit pikachu we have to make that broadcast and then we have to duplicate this again but no no actually we need to wait so we gotta do hit pokemon and then we have to work on the um elsewhere to set the set mist so we're going to make the variable missed missed this is going to be the confusing part you put it in here to y or else you because you either hit it or you miss it so it's an else missed no broadcast miss and wait so this is so big this is when it gets really confusing so broadcast miss so we have it here i'm gonna go work on the pikachu so next we have to do uh when i receive hit pika no hit pokemon so any type of pokemon then it will uh start some coins or you can get that in this sprite library right here a coin so coin right here so you can get the sound coin and then next we have to do missing sound it's not it's i mean it is um high like a lug so glug is like a drinking sound but this sounds more like a defeat sound see it sounds like sad so so when i receive this it'll start sound plug and then when i receive hit pikachu i mean pokemon then it will change pokemon caught by one so we have it right here change pokemon caught by one so you get one score basically you know set i was saying got it for 0.3 seconds also hide because you're done and then i'll wait 0.5 seconds and i'll set size to 50. it'll go to the position i already have it at i think no i don't so we'll go to zero negative 104 it'll show so this is the position of the beginning so uh when i receive miss it's already happened i'm pretty sure i did that no i didn't when i received miss it'll wait 0.5 seconds it'll if then the pokeball if the pokeball equals zero equals zero then it will broadcast and wait lose so this we're almost done with this just a few more scripts of code so when i receive hit pokemon it will wait 0.5 seconds and it will you need if then if then the pokemon caught equals 15. equals 15 then you broadcast win and wait broadcast win and wait so i'm make that win and wait and then if then you need to and if then the pokeball equals zero equals zero and and the pokeball equals zero and not not the pokemon caught so i'm gonna move this around first and then if it's not the pokemon card equals 15. then you lose because you didn't catch um 15 pokemon with the balls so and then i'll broadcast lose and wait we already have that i think if yeah sorry guys uh and i'm gonna move that here and the last thing we have to do is finish this script the code which still has a lot i think so i have to set the pokeball to 20 and forgot to do that so let's try it this has got it well we didn't code the pikachu yet so we have to code the pikachu next and then we code the squirtle the charizard and the pigeon so pikachu is very simple code when the green flag is clicked it will go forever and ever and next costume and when i receive hit pikachu it'll hide and then when the green flag is clicked it'll hide because it always hides in the beginning it'll go forever and wait for seconds and go to the position we want it to go so we have it so go to most of this is going to be the same except the page weight because it can fly in the air so go to a pick random of negative 200. top 200 and pick random for this one for y is negative 75 to positive 70 35 and no show so i did this to make sure um the pokemon except pigeon will go over here picture it will be in the air so it'll be around here so that's why i did that and show and then when i receive hit pikachu that's it so i'm gonna try out pikachu i can't seem to find pikachu oh he's behind charizard so i got him so yeah so same thing let's work on squirtle and the pokeball so we have to do this duplicate this so i'm gonna do this and put this in here so this is a big piece of code let's put this over here we still need it and move this over here we actually do not need that because we have another one instead of pikachu squirtle instead hit squirtle and then hit pokemon and wait yeah that's correct and then we can do this and then we if then else this again and then i have to do this and put it into the if then else instead change this to charizard instead hit charizard and then you have to duplicate this again to do page load and then instead hit pitch rate and then put this finally inside here so that's a bunch of loops and this is the overall code a bunch of if i mean if else statements so let's work on squirtle because yeah basically the same code as pikachu slightly different so instead of hit pikachu you have to make this hit squirtle and then you can do any seconds you want to buy them do three and you can put that over here that's it's literally the same thing and it's the same code for charizard no not the same you do hit and you gotta change the times up a little bit it's slightly different for all three so instead of hit squirtle hit charizard and then this part i'm doing eight if i'm no six six six and then i'm going to do pigeon but pijoy is just a little bit different from the others because if you notice pidgeot has wings so it's going to be flying so if then hit pedroite then and then change this i'm pretty sure it's two and then instead uh it's a same same x but different y so it'll be different vertical so the vertical is negative 20 to positive 150. we now have to code the banner so be somewhere up here first i'm just going to hide the the variables for now uh we don't need this it's just pokeball and pokemon caught and then we can work on the banner so the banner should be very simple so when i receive i mean when i receive you still need this i mean uh so when the green flag is clicked it will go to zero zero middle and it will i mean zero sixty see i mean zero zero and then they'll go to front layer it will switch costumes to start and so the start costume is the start costume is this costume catch 15 pokemon to win you won and you lost so start costume switch costume to start show or inches away from finishing wait one second and it will show again and i'll hide so i'm gonna make a hide and then when i receive win so when it wins i receive win i'm just gonna minimize and maximize a little bit so when i receive win it will um switch costume to win and it will show and stop all basically the same code as lose but you just change this to lose and then switch costume to lose so let's test out the game now so let's try it so i'm gonna show you the thing just let's start so i'm gonna get these pikachus and charizards and pigeots see what they're missing and so i got this dude some missed so i'm i i have one last set of code and two sets of code caps to put in the music so when i receive miss this on the pokeball it will say missed you'll see missed for 0.3 seconds it'll hide and wait 0.5 seconds and do basically the same thing just put this all put the set size of 50 right back here so that's the code for this and we're going to code the music so when the green flag is clicked they'll go forever now i have to go to the sounds um i used i'm pretty sure i did use drum jam so drum jam drum until done let's try the game so i got a pikachu that's on the miss so it's missing and then try losing so i'm about to lose right here there we go we lost so it says you lose the win works uh so now we are done so please like share subscribe and also please like share and subscribe my gaming channel which is gamer territory so please get into that and please please please sub and plus um yeah that's it i mean uh please give us a thumb up thumbs up so comment in the comment section below if you play pokemon so i'm pretty sure some people still play it so anyways bye you
