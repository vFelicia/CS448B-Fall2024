welcome back guys to the kids coding playground here and today we'll be doing the part two of the sonic series so this is the sonic game we've been working on in the last tutorial so we have all the running walking down arrow up air jumping all the like movement done in the last video so here's our second part of this tutorial so first i forgot to rename this project actually so my name is sonic runner game i guess runner runner game so here we're gonna name it and then this is what we had from last time so if you missed anything or something's not working here's the time to do it you can pause the video if you want and then next let's work on the backdrops so we have the background one two so we're going to make it start scrolling so courtesy to scratch team for showing how to do this it's really simple so i'll just show you guys right now so when we fly clicked we're just gonna go to the back layer go to back layer and then we're gonna go to zero zero uh go to the x zero y zero so this is the first backdrop so we're gonna make it go to the middle and then we're gonna get a forever loop forever we're gonna change the x my name before so we're gonna make the backdrop move to the left because it'll simulate as the player is moving so see the background will move to the left that means the player is moving to the right so we're going to change the x by negative four negative four okay put that right there and then we're gonna if if uh the exposition is less than negative one 460 sorry so basically we're going to make it scroll all the way to negative 460 which is somewhere on the far left so if the x position is less than that then we're gonna move the backdrop back to its position so we're gonna move it to 460 zero which is all the way in the far right so we want to make it in like a continuous pattern where this one gets here this other backdrop will get here so it's kind of like scrolling in a pattern so and then we're going to go to the exposition of 460 to and y0 and then we're going to do the next costume so then it will switch the costume to the other costume so we'll have some more variety to the background so here's our first part of code and then we're just going to drag and drop this into the second backdrop it's not completely the same so we're going to have to change some of the code so right here we have the x is going to be 460 so we're going to make this first backdrop start in the middle and this one's going to start on the far right so when this one is finished scrolling all the way to the far left this one will be in the middle so it's kind of in a pattern and then right here x is negative 4 x matrix is less than negative 40. 460 goes to this position so that's all that is except for this just change the x position to 460. so now we have the two backdrops they can scroll so let's save the project as you can see the backdrop was scrolling it actually looks like sonic is moving now so yeah there we have our simple scrolling backdrop it's uh much more simple than other scrolling backdrop tutorials i've seen like from griff patch but this is just a simple one just keep it simple next let's hop into our trap sprites so here we have the trap sprite we're gonna do a when i receive the message reset um so what we're gonna do is make it easier as the player progresses usually it's supposed to be the other way around we're doing it like that because we want it to be easier to get higher score in this game so we're going to make it like so spikes and traps will appear less often as you go further into the game so we're going to go to so the player will have more playing time obviously so we'll go to s 200 y negative 110 and then we're going to go hide so in the beginnings that hide and then forever forever loop we are going to if else so this is the part where we show the spikes so if the score is greater than 100 so basically after it's past 100 the spikes and traps will start showing less often so score is greater than 100 then we'll wait i'm gonna wait five to eight seconds five to eight seconds and then else we're gonna wait one to three seconds so in the early game you will have to face a lot of spikes and we're going to create clone of myself so we're going to be using clones create clone myself and then when i receive reset we're going to delete this clone so we're going to delete this clone so we're going to delete all the previous clones before creating new ones and then when i start as a clone right here then we're going to show and then we're going to switch costume to pick random one to three as you can see we have three costumes let me like put this code in i'll show you so one two three so inside here you can see we have the spike saw and the spike head three costumes we're gonna pick random which one show up and then we're gonna repeat uh repeat until x position is less than negative 220 which is near the left so we're gonna do uh repeat until what x position is less than negative 220. if it is then we're going to change the oops man and we're going to change that x by negative 6 and then we're going to delete this clone when it gets to the edge so we're doing negative 6 because you see the backdrop is scrolling by negative four so we have to do negative six or else the spikes and traps will not appear to move so as you can see if we put negative two it will not move at all it'll look like it's not moving at all so you see it's actually moving at oh like towards you but like really slow so it doesn't look good at all so we're gonna have to do negative six which is more than what the backdrop is scrolling at the backdrop is scrolling at negative four so we want to make it negative six so i'll show you guys now so as you can see the spikes are scrolling at much faster rate and it looks much better okay so now let's work on our bullet bill so our bullet bill the code is quite similar except it's higher in the error and it'll probably move quicker so uh we're just going to drag this code in and then i'll switch it up a little so we have the reset code so right here instead we're going to go to the x 214 wide negative 25 so we're going to get 214 and the y is negative 25. so uh you can adjust your bullet bill accordingly to however high your sonic is because we want it to make the bullet bill he had sonic if he's not ducking so only if he's ducking he'll avoid bullet bill so here this this is the coordinate i got and then right here forever we're going to get an if then statement so if um score is greater than 100 we're going gonna wait pick a random let's do two to five um i'm just gonna do this number i don't this i don't think i had this in my old game but i think we'll just do two to five that sounds pretty reasonable and then we're gonna create a clone of myself and then we're going to do when i receive reset we're going to delete all the previous clips as well so we're going to do that and next we're going to do a when i start us clone we are going to show show the bullet bill and then repeat until the exposition is less than negative 220 same as the other one so we're going to repeat until x is less than negative 220 so x position less than negative 220 then we're going to change the x by negative eight so as you can see the drops are negative six this one is going to be negative eight because we want to make the bullets go faster so we're going to change the x by negative eight and then next we're going to delete this clone and there we have all our code with the bullet build so let's save it i'll show you so right here we have the traps just wait for the bullet bill yeah sometimes like you see the uh trap and the bullet bill come at the same time there's not really any way you can like prevent that from happening besides making the traps show less and the bulls show more um there probably is a way but like we'll just have to think about it so this game definitely needs like some fine tuning but if you can do that this game would work really well so i'll show you guys the bullet bill so jump over this show you guys a duck under oh no i died from it but like basically the point is that you're supposed to duck under the bulkhead let's see as you can see you don't get killed by the bullet bill if you duck but in theory if you just stay like this a bullet bill should be able to kill you and sometimes another bug in this game is like when you die um you know how you spawn you'll instantly be able to jump up there that's not really much of a problem but you can fix it by maybe putting a little delay okay so i guess that's pretty much it for the bullet bill i just want to show you guys that to make sure that you die if you don't duck so yes you die you lose all your score so your score like goes back to zero if you die in this game okay so next let's go to the ring so inside our ring we're going to when i receive the message reset we can just drag and drop this code in and in here we're just going to change some of the positions x is going to be 200 y 185 we're going to hide it forever we're not even going to do the score thing we're just going to put this in and then we'll be five to eight how does that five to eight seconds it's not as common but these will give you 500 scores if you're able to collect them then wait until when i receive reset we're going to delete this clone and then we're going to get i want to receive a star music one when i start as a clone sorry we're going to show and then we're going to switch costume to pick around one to two so you know we have the heart and the um ring both in the same costume so one to two and then we're just going to repeat until x position is great uh less than negative 220 sorry or we're gonna have an or or if it's touching the sonic so we're going to do 2 negative 220 so if the x position is less than negative 220 or it's touching sonic so if it's touching sonic as well then we will change the x by negative 10. so basically the rings are going to move the quickest they can move at negative 10. so we're going to repeat until it's touching either of those and then if it does if it's touching sonic then we are going to uh if it's touching the sonic let me get that touching sonic then we're going to change the score by 500 so it's going to give them this a score boost the wrong one score and then we'll do 500 and then we're going to delete this clone once it has been collected or it touches the edge so here we have our heart and ring code so one last thing we can go back to our sonic and then we can add a high score tracker thing so here inside this code right here when green fly clicked we can add a high score tracker thing so this is gonna like show the high score and stuff so we're gonna have to make a cloud variable so it'll save on the cloud so we're gonna make it cloud variables it's stored i'm gonna name it high score high score and then we have a high score variable right here so we're going to do a forever loop you have it right there this is really simple code if the score is greater than high score so if the score you have is greater than the high score then we will set the high score variable to the scores variable so here we have a simple high score script and there you go there's our project so let's hide the fall speed sprite on variable and then let's put the high scores one like right here i guess i don't know like that okay so let's save the project i'll just demonstrate it so jump you can jump over the obstacles duh it works you see the score scores increasing with the high score this is the only score we have tucking it under the bullet bills we're pretty lucky with the amount of spawns we're having we're not having too much oh there so now we're dead so see as you can see our high score is set to 561 which i believe is what i got so that's it for today's tutorial this is the second part for our sonic runner game so don't forget to like share and subscribe and ring the notification bell and i will see you guys in the next video
