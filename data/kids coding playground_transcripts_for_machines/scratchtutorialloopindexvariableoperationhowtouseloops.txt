hello and welcome back to the channel two kids calling playground so today we're actually walking on a not really a game but uh working on a project that actually teach you some of the basic programming concept regarding loops index variable and operation in scratch with a minute variable so basically this game is this project is that you click on this sprite here nano and then you ask you what's your name and you can put in your name let's say we put in kids coding playground and we'll tell you like how many letters it has comment vowel and how many consonant it has so it looks pretty easy right because let's say we are looking at the name we can count it up right but how would the computer know right so we have to get each letter and in this world and actually combine compare it so it's not that easy I mean it looks quite easy but I know that many kids struggling with this loop index and variable concept in scratch so let's take a look so we'll be actually learning these things today loops index operators so what are some of the operators we will be learning join letter off linked off and something containing something so this is the loud I know a lot of game doesn't really require us to use these but if you're doing some kind of manipulation with word another what game then you definitely need to use this ok all right so let's dive into it I will show you guys how it actually what I'm not there yeah here the one of this game I created so this is nano so when you click on him it will ask you what is your name let's say for instance put something uneasy let's say to say kids coding there for instance so if I put in kids coding you can you can tell that if I'm asking something I answer something it will go to the answer variable right so if I enter it will tell me okay I have ten letters there's three bow and seven consonant let's count this up okay so now let's count the letter we just typed in kids coding right so let's kill the letter one two three four not counting the space five six seven eight nine 10 so we have 10 measures and how many about we have one two and three how many constant we have and we have seven right so how do we actually know how to do this using the program how does the computer know I would rather go to a loop and would it get each letter out from the answer and whether check it so before we dive right into the coding please like share subscribe to our Channel and give us some feedback if you like on the comment below alright so now let's get started so how do we actually do this so with the understand them let's say I click on the ice sprite and you know let's say I add this right what is your name I add it to my sprite so this sprite will start talking asking what's your name so will you if you put some weight on right so as you can see in this answer here if we're going to show this answer so you can see that Tom goes to the answer so this is how you ask a question right from the sprite I think everybody might already know this okay all right so what do we need to do first we did two in order to get the the the going through this variable here we need to create some variable that will help us so let's go to variable so we need to know each letters right so we can do is we're gonna create something called each letter I'm using a camel case here so it's easy to see so you can see each letter okay and what I also need is something called index index is a position in the in the in the world so in scratch they always started one so on so remember for that so they to try program they start at zero I got for scratch at the index doesn't one so the index is the position in the loop if we go into a loop let's say we're looking for the word Tom so index one will be T right index two will be O and index three will be M we're going through our loop okay so we have created these two variable what else do we need we need to know the number of consonant and we also want to know and we also need to know number of spaces there you know in case they put a first name and last name we don't want to count the spaces right okay and also number so this is how many wow they have the ABCDEF I mean so how many bow it has like a e i o ye right the bow okay we have these variable that will help us to keep track of the loop and looking at each I'm letters in the loop and we can compare them okay what I'm going to do is I'm gonna give him port my sprite I already created this Nano before for my other games I was just going to reuse him okay so this Nano I will also put a wooden stump tree stump I had it before so let me move it in the center and this way no I want to put him in the front so what we need to do is worth his 8 green black is click one to move into the front so that you know the Nano is standing on the tree so oh I put on the tree I'm sorry I meant to put on Nano okay I think they copy it over let me try it again okay we'll go back to look okay all right so we can see nano cities spending on the trees okay we know a background like this so for one class okay class troll okay all right so we have nano here what we want to do is we are going to a starting it to ask a question for him right so what we want to do is when we click on the sprite someone to ask a question okay what this prize clicked right what do we want to do so before we asked asked the question we want to set the bear for each other variable sort of for the index we are going to set at one so remember scratch the indexes with one right I mentioned earlier a number of consonant so the number of consonant is zero so we want to just initialize it making sure that you know in the beginning everything is set to zero number better I'm just going through the year here number of spaces right so we have numbers number of consonant letters number of spaces and okay so we have everything set reset when we click on this sprite so every time we click on it it will reset all this so what do we want to ask so I want to go back to this or saying what is your name right so click on this sprite we will ask you what's your name as you can see right every time the user type something the name wash equal to this variable called answer which is a default in scratch okay to take the input from the user on the keyboard so what we need to do is we have to go through the letter that the user typed in write is fine now so we will actually have to use some of these variable this operation here so let's take a look at some of the operation we'll be using today so let's look at this and this and this so let's try to understand some of these things what is actually meaning so let's say bye to click on this link of an app of what do you think will happen what would look like I will let you guys kiss you see this five so the length of Apple is 5 y is 5 that's five letters like a PP five so what happened to my click this one what do you think we'll say I'll let you guys guess ok ready ok click on it it says a what is a mean this is the first letter of this board so a as an apple first letter is a if I put 2 here what do you think will happen actually I have what PAP because that's the second letter of this word ok so now you understand the length in the scent of the word right we can control using the index right we have index using this index we can go through this world and we can find out each letter what the user typed in and let's check the last one something called contain so I click on this what you think will happen it will ask if this a is inside Apple it will return one true so a is inside Apple if I put B here what happened B is not inside Apple right so it will return false meaning B is not inside this what Apple so now you have a little bit understanding of these three operations here for these very book we will be playing around with so you can actually do this project so let me throw this all away for now ok so we click on this what is your name what do you think we have to do so what we need to do is we have a call to the name write whatever the user typed in I said I've been Tom weather go through how many time three time right because Tom has three letter right so unless a time so I need to go through the three time so we can use this we'll go to this and there's something called repeat right repeat number of times right here okay this is ten times so what do we have to do we have to get three times so how do we get three time so remember we were using this operator the length right the length of Apple is Phi right so now what happened if I say that Duff answered way then you have will have three right penis comes three so what you do is you put in here so that means it will repeat three times so what I need next okay that I have okay each letter so what I'm going to do is now pick up each letter from this word Tom and I'm going to check it okay so if I say yeah very is a bow or is a consonant or whatever our space right so what we need to do is we set each letter so it's going through a loop one at a time so the first letter of T right so what happened so we want to get the first letter of this one so what do we have to do we'll go back to this why you remember this is the letter of a right so what we want to do is we're gonna use the index so we can increase the index two one two and three so since the indexes start up one we know that one Apple is giving us a so one of answer is going to give us what Tom right tom okay this and put it here so as you can see 71 of answers theory 13 first letter okay so what we want to do is we do not want to put one thing that we want to change this right so what we want to do it we're gonna use this index or this index here so now we understand that the matter in deck which is one right now and of the answer which is T Tom right T the first letter Tom okay so what we want to do after that we want to change what change the index by one so we'll go to the second position which is all right so next time with a loop runs or pickup always the second index okay so let's let me put this up here so when you guys do the buggy you can always put something in here that will help you to debug the code right so that's for instance I want to say each letter here so as you can see we can actually say it each time so let's best go on again we'll click on him and we are going to say Tom so what do you see it you can say t om right so going through each letter in this loop is getting the first letter which is T then it increase the index by 1 which is 2 so the next time it comes around will pick up oh then the last time it comes around will pick up and which is M which is the last letter right so let's run it again so if I click on this let's say I put John right so we'll go through all fine J oh and a J okay chin right so let's enter so john117 so now understand how the loop is walking correct okay so what we need to do is we have to check if this actually if this letter is belong to the a bow right so what we're gonna do is simply make it simple it's like it was not about Google count it as a consonant okay okay so so what we need to do is we're gonna go to the if condition here okay so we are going to use something called contain you remember we're using something contained so what we can do is we're gonna put in the bow a capital a lowercase a in case they put capital hello Neil okay see right ayeee I know his i/o couple o his own you okay so what we want to say is if a e i o you so this one this is containing this what each letter right so we'll drag each letter in here so if a eio you contain this letter then what we know we know that it is a a bow number one or number bow won't be creased by one so now if we run this again and when it go through it we'll check each letter and you can see the index moving and you'll see each letter moving and then you can see that number of bow will increase so let's try again I'll put Tommy right short name so as you can see they say okay it's moving through the index he found that there's none of out in one vowel because pause in the middle right so we need one Wow okay so now we have when bow also we don't want to count the spaces right let's say you got some spaces in between the word data Tom and then they say yeah let's say Tom Sawyer or Tom whatever right he's laughing then we don't need to count the spaces in between the player put in the spaces right so we will also do this if condition again right what we're going to check this time we are going to put a one space here and if that sorry not the same same condition sorry I was incorrect so will they use this condition so we'll put one space and we can say each letter so if it's a space equal to the letter there was a number of space it changed by one so increasing the space so let's try kids coded so you can see that okay he says number of space is one right number vow is three so I owe and I write plus three so now we have number of Bao and number of spaces right so he knows that space is one so what we can do is this we were going to set that number of letters how do we know number of letter so we will say set after we do all the loop right we know everything now right so what we say is a number of letters is equal to what you go to do you remember we have something called linked off right so what we can do is a link of the answer right so looking at the answers what if we click on this you see is 11 right this is because it's K it's this is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 you know and including the space in the middle right so what we want to do is we're gonna subtract the space right so then we'll know how many letters they are right so we'll say using this operator with a subtract here so number of letter is equal to the length of this answer number of spaces right so number spaces yeah so now you know how many letters they are so I run this again I'm going to put in let's say right so he'll know that okay that's six letter say Tom t om t lamb tongue comma six letter on my space is one space is how many about to wait so we already know that number of letter number Wow and how do we find the number of consonant when you guys think that you guys take a moment to think about that so number of letter is number consonant is so the number of letter all right okay so we can do that so we're I know right so say go back over here we'll select so number of letter the number of Wow right then we know the number of consonant so let's try it again so okay so as you can see the so these are the loop that's going through right there look don't worry about that so where I can do that but it'll print going through each time so now you can see the number of consonant yes one two three four one number better one two three four five six number of spaces one number two right so this is for us for making simple was just we just think that okay the users not put it in the name but they could put in a number right the numbers it's not a alphabet letter i we didn't have that check here so if you want to do that you could put it you know check with a number but for simplicity sake no we're gonna just assume that the user don't put in the first name last name we're gonna check how many letter and how many bow and how many consonants out there so this is pretty much it so now we'll finish up the project by adding something for the Nano to say like your name has a number of letter number of Wow and number of consonant okay so let's go back to look here and you can track this in we also need to use something so you join because we actually have to join more than one thing where you have to use to join are we going to do enough for the first one as your name and and we'll put a little space here because we want to put a number here right okay we'll go back to the variable you'll say number of letter or start with that and then open this little space here yet one space and then said letter okay all right what we're going to do that duplicate this one time and then another time so this one will remove this and the last one consumer okay so this is a consonant okay that's the last part I will remove this will add the number of consonant here okay all right so what we need to do is should actually have done the other way but that okay we have everything ready we'll drop it in here and drop it in here then drop it in here okay you know let's test our game one time will save it will stop it will start again okay well click on him Oh ask what's your name let's say we'll put John okay it has seven letter three valve and four consonant as you can see right one two three four not including the space fall are five six seven seven letter one two three four or consonant and one two three three file that's correct right so that's pretty much everything the game is so please like share and subscribe to our channel thank you very much see you guys next time bye bye
