thank you welcome back guys to kids coding playground today we'll be making a snow effects project in scratch so in a lot of our past tutorials we have uh games where we use the snow effects like our Christmas platformer uh snow effect will probably make your game look a lot better and cleaner and you can use it for your Christmas themed projects so let's get right into it okay so first thing what you want to do is create a new Sprite paint and then we're going to use the fill no outline we're going to use white fill no outline I'm gonna hold down shift so we're going to zoom in hold down shift so you can get a perfect circle uh we're gonna try to make this 11 by 11. okay so here you have our uh snow so we can we can rename the Sprite just now I'm sorry so and then for the code for the snow we're going to start off with a white refly clicks we're gonna set the ghost effects we're going to set the ghost effects set ghost effects and to 100 so we're going to make it hide in the beginning and then we're going to go to this position we're going to go to zero uh y220 so it's going to be somewhere up here so then we let us know to start like up here and we've got a forever Loop forever uh and then we make a variable for the Sprite only so we're going to make a variable uh for the Sprite only we're going to name it uh wind and notice how I put in lowercase because for the spray only we're going to set the variable wind to pick random negative one to one so what this wind thing is this does is to make the snow kind of sway around like it shifts around like in real life how there's wind it makes the snow move around in the air so we can hide the verb and then we're going to get a create a clone of myself come over here and then we're going to put a weight a little delay before we uh spawn in the Clones I'm gonna wait pick random let's do 0.05 0.005 to 0.01 seconds so like it won't look like there's too much snow but it's just enough and we can just add a black backdrop so you can see this no better so actually just paint a backdrop let's just get the black black color it's going to draw a box cut Dropbox all right good enough so now you can actually see the uh snow okay so next what we want to do is when we start as a clone when I start as a clone we're going to set the size so we're going to make some snowflakes a little bigger some smooth like smaller so we're gonna just kind of pick random so we're going to set the size I'm sorry not this one said size percent right here sorry I didn't see that uh we're gonna do pick random 60 to 100 so some circuits are bigger than others and then we're gonna get a goto so we're gonna go to we're gonna go to x negative random 240 negative 240 to 240 so the snow will spawn from this corner to this quarter and we're going to keep the Y at 220. okay next we want to get a repeat so we're going to hit repeat four times and then we're gonna change this ghost effect by negative 20. so it's just to make it more clear so we're going to change ghost effects by negative 20. and then next we're going to repeat so I'll show you in a second why we need this repeat two right here so we're going to put a repeat two change y by negative 5. since the actually making it come down and I'm going to change the X by the wind so change X by the wind and then we're going to get a repeat until so repeat until touching Edge touching Edge and then we're going to change the Y we just duplicate this part and then repeat 10 times and repeat repeat 10 times we're gonna change the ghost effect by 10. so this is going to make it slowly Fade Out as it goes down so we're going to change the ghost effect when it touches the edge it's going to make it slowly Fade Out change the ghost effect by 10. and then we're going to delete the Clone with that okay so now when we run it you have a snow effect so why do we need this repeat I'll show you what happens when you don't have it because the snow is already touching the edge we have to put this or else this happens all the snow is just disappearing up there because there is no it's already touching the edge so we just want to put this repeat two times just to get it off the edge before we start off this part so when you put this back in you can see as you can see the snow comes down and disappears and touches the bottom or the edge and one last thing if you want to make it uh disappear when it touches another Sprite we can do four so we're going to do either touching the edge or touching the cap so this could be useful in your projects where you want to touch another Sprite and disappear so we run it as you can see there's no disappears when it touches the cat all right so that's it for today's tutorial on the snow effects thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share and subscribe ring the notification Bell and I'll see you guys in the next video
