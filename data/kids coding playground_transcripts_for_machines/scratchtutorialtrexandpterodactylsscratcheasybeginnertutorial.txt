so welcome back to another video on kids go to playground today we'll be making game called trex and peridot pterodactyls so we have another game similar to this which is cat getting the apples but this one is a trex getting the pterodactyls this is how the game looks like so I'll be explaining how to play the game so use the arrow keys to move and the objective is just score as much points as you can press the spacebar to jump with the trex to eat the pterodactyls to get points this video is like the Apple cat one cat video except this one has added stuff so the cat one is more of a beginner's video if you're a beginner I suggest you to watch the other one this one is more of an intermediate video so in this game we'll be learning these following concepts such as broadcasting messages using the random operator touching sprites one key press and the joint function so I'll be demoing the game first before we start so when we make this full screen so as you can see this music in the background when you move around the dinosaur switches costumes when you press the spacebar it jumps and as you can see when you the kind of geeks the pterodactyls right they switch costume so yeah without further ado get a new project ready so new first we can rename it to trexes and pterodactyls think that's how you spell it but you can change it later so we we want to delete this cat then we'll want to get backdrop so let's get a background to this project we want the dress background because it's kind of like a dinosaur themed game so we can get the trex Dino dinosaur 4 and you'll need the pterodactyl type of Dino turn I wonder need some trees tree tree and just duplicate these right click duplicate right we'll need three trees okay first of all let's go to the backdrop so we'll need a one clicked forever play sound jungle will get a sound oh I prefer to pick the jungle I just search so this kind of a sounds drastic so before I can continue I would like you guys to please like share subscribe to this video and subscribe to our channel thank you so now let's continue so I code for the trex okay so as you guys in the first video we used like the key space key is pressed this is less smooth than the ifthen statement and then you use the sensing key left arrow or right arrow press this is more smoother so we want the trex to go to the front layer in the beginning then go to somewhere like right here we want it to go to like a zero Center zero I'm just gonna put a random coordinate that might fit it zero negative 50 see that's pretty much in the center so now when you forever Lee if I'm edge bounce so it can't go off the map if then statement if then the left arrow is pressed take this left arrows press then point direction of negative 90 because he has eternal life he'll look to the left side so negative 90 move 10 steps so move this is like the movement for it and then switch costume to pick random one two three we want this because it can switch costume when it's moving we don't want it to switch costume next costume because we don't want it to switch to this costume because we don't want it when it's moving we don't want it to open its mouth randomly so we can just duplicate this code instead of left we can do right instead of one direction just put it to 90 move ten steps and pick random it's um one two three yeah we don't want to do it too wonderful put this under here so this is a movement of the Dino dinosaur so next we'll need to do the jumping up so when the key space is pressed repeat 15 times so this will make it jump up and then get back down change Y my 10 so go up change Y by 10 next costume so they'll open its mouth now change costume 1 2 4 when you jump up then we can just duplicate this 15 times and then you have to make it negative time because you want it to go back down and you want to switch the dinosaur for this costume because you want it to open its mouth when it's jumping so as you can see now we've got the movement done oh yeah and I forgot you have to do this direction you to put it to this so it will rotate upside down now the dinosaur can jump up and down and move left and right I know the music center mode okay so next we'll move on some more code for the trex so we'll need to get it when clicked and flat clicked when they make a variable called score so score we want to set the score 20 in the beginning four to zero forever loop so in the forever loop we want to put it at the end statement if then touching the Dino 3 which is the pterodactyl or ever dinosaur 3 then broadcast when you broadcast and played a message called gap give this I spell it so next we move on to the pterodactyl code so when it receives got pterodactyl we can switch costume to the Dino 3d which is the one that's screaming I guess and then we wait 3.5 seconds to give it a slight pause 2.5 then we hide because it's eaten switch costume Dino 3e which is this one they want it to start on this one so when clicked we need a one click this bigger thank us when the flag is clicked we want to switch costume to the Dyna 3e this one hide okay so we need a forever loop so wait pick random one two three seconds every single time it spawns so pick a random one two three seconds before spawning one two three go to it go to we're in a position but instead we'll take a join join function and a pick random so what this basically means is we need to add tree in a tree pick random 1 2 3 so you know we have 3 trees right so when you click on this tree 3 see when you click on it it will join the tree plus the number so I'll actually go to the sprite tree 1 2 3 either one of those see so we just put this right here so that's that code and then we want to change X change the X change the x pick random negative 50 to 50 so over you somewhere from the end of the tree to the other under the tree so pick random negative 50 to 50 okay we wanna change Y to 75 so be somewhere up here instead because if you say go to tree it would be in the center of the tree so we wanted to be up here so change Y by 75 change by 75 okay so now you want to show show the pterodactyl wait two seconds and then hot okay now we just need to set up all the things we can put the tree one right here three two right here entry 3 let's move it a little bit more like this okay we also have to make the dinosaur go to the front so go to the front layer go to front layer when you bite it the dinosaur disappears oh yeah you can make the score change by one when you get the parameter doctorate so when you receive the message got to Rin Jarrod after you change the score by one yeah so now you can see the scores changing up using position the trees and different place if you want so yeah that pretty much
