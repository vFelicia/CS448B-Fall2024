welcome back guys this kids coding playground here and today we're back for another video called destroy the virus today we'll be working on a coronavirus themed game the cat is supposed to fly around the city destroying the viruses don't forget don't forget to wear your mask to show the virus we will be learning these following concepts in scratch variables loops touching sprite color effect and clone okay so we'll go demo the game as you can see i'm the um cat wearing the mask and then wherever i click it flies and it punches wherever it's like and i get to collect the coronavirus or the viruses and kill them and kill them so right now it's score five i might change that you can make it like 30. so you make it any any anything you want but let's go you go fly around catching the viruses protecting the city it says you win okay let's get started okay so this is a new project you can delete the original sprite i already have things in my backpack for me so i can drag in the cat you don't the mask is optional i mean like you don't really have to draw it but i'll show you how to draw it so let's go to the costumes so as you can see i drew a mask right here wrong button and go paint so we can take the circle change the color and the outline it can be any color it can be any color but so got the circle the outside is blue the inside is white so you can draw it like that and then you can also use the reshape tool to reshape it make a little shorter and also make some lines like in the middle you can change the thickness i'ma draw a line across you can also use the reshape tool for lines too so i can reshape that so let's hear some lines okay so i can uh reshape like all of this all the lines can be reshaped i mean this a demonstration isn't as good as the original mask but you can take it as you can see that's another mask i just drew it you like adjust it and bring like the lines so it looks more like a mask so so something like this so let's just go delete the sprite now let's go working let's go work on the code so let's just and you can also you also have to copy it onto them you have to group it by using the pointer tool called or you can use the group button and then you can do ctrl c for that mask ctrl c then ctrl v and you can paste the mask and you can like adjust it there's adjust button so there you go it can rotate yeah you can adjust it size so there you go a mask all right let's just start the code so first we have to make a variable called score and we also have to make the cat we also need um i also have a uwind thing already made and i can also make a virus so i'm going to teach you how to make a virus you can use a puffer fish it looks similar to a virus i was using and then you can go to the costumes so you can delete all these other ones and then this one we can use this tool delete this who's wrong wrong one it's that one the face and then we can also delete the fins to make it look more like a virus as you can see you can also rename it the virus and the name if you want and um you can start coding so the cat flying when a green flag is clicked the green flag is clicked i'll go forever it'll go wherever you click so it's if then mouse down it'll switch costume to cat flying a wait 0.1 seconds it's actually it's an else statement i just noticed take this out so that we can reuse this one if then else statement the mouse down cat flying a and you see in the costumes a b a b and then wait 0.1 seconds so it goes there in 0.1 seconds and and else it'll switch the costume to cat blind p so we can also work on the cat so when the green flag is clicked it can go to anywhere but i'm gonna make it yeah let's make it let's move a little bit to the here um so around here you can move it around and then point in direction 90 because it has to punch punch it and then switch switch costume to cat cat flying b um the set rotation style to left right so it won't rotate or also start flipping over and stuff forever if then the mouse is down that means it'll point towards mouse pointer so i'll point wherever you go it'll glide to it oh to mouse x mouse y because that's where you want your mouse so virus we're going to work on the virus code so let's go test it out it's flying as you can see it's flying to wherever you click so it's also let's work on the virus so when green flag clicked it'll clear all the graphic effects because as you can see um when i demoed the game it was different colors so in the beginning you got to clear all the graphic effects it'll set the score to zero set size to 50 you can use any size you want you can make it big or small this is medium sized repeat until repeat five actually repeat five times we'll spawn five viruses create clone with myself then hide so also i'm going to work on more on the virus so when i start as a clone it'll change color effect by 25 but that's not it also has to buy pick random one to 300 so it'll be different colors each virus is a different color i'll go to a random position a show forever if then statement is touching the cat which catches the virus that means i'll hide and it'll change score change score by one um you also have to make a broadcast message kill kill right wait one second it'll go to a random position no show again cat and and the virus so we'll be working on these two so first so he's we're still working on the virus so when i receive kill when i receive kill virus it will if then statement if then let's put it right there or so it's like if it's more than or less than so you need this and this so if the score is greater than zero thirty thirty i meant thirty um or it equals thirty so that's when you win so when the score is greater than thirty or equals thirty and broadcast you win you win and then when i receive you win stop other scripts in this sprite also the cat also has us this one as well and we're also going to work on the you win sprite so it's really simple when i receive when green flag is clicked it will hide and then when i receive you win it'll go to the middle so let's go to x0 0 show then eventually eventually stopping and then so we can change a background to um a city with waters that's what i was using um and we can also make the music it's really zoomed in the music is really simple just forever loop you just get a sound i think i used um dance funky yeah i used funky so let's go to the sound section so i'm gonna go demo the game as you can see wherever you click is where the map of a cat goes and you can see he's punching the virus and then let's see if i can you can see they're all different colors so it says you win before i go please like share and subscribe and comment in the comment section below to see what projects you want featured or um what projects you want us to make so anyway thank you all bye you
