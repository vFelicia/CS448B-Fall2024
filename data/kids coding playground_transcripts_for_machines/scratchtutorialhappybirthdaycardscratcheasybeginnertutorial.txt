welcome back guys in today's another kids covered in playground video and today we will be doing another special one of the special series videos so today we will be working on a project called the happy birthday card it's featuring projects for kids like you you can send projects to us and then we can teach you a tutorial in our channel we will also give you details on how to submit your project later so then you can give it to us and we can make a small tutorial today we will be featuring a project my little cousin did named jaylen he he started scratch following our channel last week so that we so he made a happy birthday card for me I am very proud of him so he did a really good job so let's jump into the video so we will be learning these following concepts in the this is our first video of patience projects from the kids IQ series so this is the birthday card my cousin jaylen made for me we are learning these concepts in scratch repeat until hi special place out it should be really easy for beginners and yes so it's like about this so I put it under score for whatever name you could put there and the birthday sound and there's a party background so the balloons will pop when they get up there you have to learn the song ends candles will be blown out so let's jump right into it let's start with the cake so if the flag is clicked it'll switch the costume to cake a place our birthday that's making the sound switch costume to cake because there's two costumes for the cake the one with the candles and one without the candles now let's move on to sprite one which is basically happy birthday spray will repeat eight times change color effect by 25 and I'll wait one second and the balloon code so if flag clicked oh sure that means you can see it it'll set X so negative 186 set Y to negative 38 yeah Oh show from the beginning so repeat 90 times change Y by 2 if Y position is more than 130 then we'll start the sound plot and no hot so the repeat 90 is for like if it's like right here that means they'll keep on moving up so let's repeat 90 times that's 90 times so if it's lower if it's lower it will repeat more if it's higher it will repeat less so that's what I basically means so there's a lot of ways you can do this and there's another way that's easier than repeating 90 times in the Y position things yes awesome we will work on that when we get to our project so let's make a new project let's start so i zoomed in a little bit let's get the cake sprite let's get the sprites first and then let's get the background so let's get the cake sprite and let's get the the balloons right we need three balloon three right there so we need three balloons we need to make a sprite when you paint the sprite so we can do this text okay happy so let's check increase the size of this cell a little bit too big so I think we can some underscores so it isn't that big I think a little bigger will do it so that's about the middle let's get our backdrop the party backdrop and let's start coding so we gotta set the size to 200 before we start so then the cake is or bigger and then if start when the green flag is clicked those switch costume to cake a cuz that's the one with the candle so if you can see it better that's the one with the candles and then it will then it was good so we'll be learning sounds so there's a birthday sound right here right here so let's take the sound play sound birthday until done and then switch costume to cake because that's when it lights out the candles that's when someone blows out the candles so the happy birthday name this thing so we can rename it to birthday lame yeah and then we can flag clicked it will repeat eight times eight is a fine number because and it'll change color effect so change color if I eight times basically and we'll keep on blinking so wait one second so you'll have a recoil before it goes again or else it'll blink way too quickly just move on to the blue we're almost there so the balloon so we can change the costumes of some balloons so let's work on this one so let's if like licked its to mount one see if you can still see that so there's another way to do this we can show so when I set the set X the set X and the set Y thing you can use a goto it's basically the same thing in two and then so let's try this a little bit down because the go to a little bit too up you can change the size let's say about 60 it's about the right size so there's a the other way that I was telling you you can repeat until instead of using repeat 90 times because you didn't you can always s you always have to estimate numbers but you can do a repeat until touching edge and then don't change Y by 2 so slowly go up and then know start the sound pump because it will make the sound when it touches the edge and then it will hide so this is the same code for all of them so we can another way you you don't have to duplicate this you can just drag it and then it can go up to here too and here so let let's change the size to 60 again you can also change the color as well not around 90 size is 60 so we can you change the costumes you should adjust to the purple one this one to the yellow one we can move this one a little bit up this one a little bit like right here you can also do that you can take out this one and bring that one in and then you can take out this one and bring this one let's see how it goes as you can see the happy birthday thing is changing and then the dingoes won't light out and the song ended and then the balloons popped so that's the end of
