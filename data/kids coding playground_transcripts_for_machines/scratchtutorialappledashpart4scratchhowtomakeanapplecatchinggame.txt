welcome back guys it's kids coding playground here today we'll be doing the fourth part for the apple dash game we've been working on so before we begin i'm just going to review some of the code so right here we have the player this is the movement for the player and this is the setting up for the player and then here we have the bomb so right here is the if the bomb hits the player it will play the sound effects and do this and this is the bombs falling down to the ground if it's the basket then it will broadcast this and this will happen then we have the health which is the each piece so every time you hit a bomb this will one will get red so once you get all three of them filled with red then you lose and then we have the basket which is basically just to follow the player and then we have the fruit so right here's the setting up for fruit and then right here we have the fruit falling down and if it hits the hitbox on the bottom then it will disappear and go back to the top then we have the begin button so this just to click it it'll start the game so this is just the spin button to make it spin if you click on it this will happen it'll broadcast a message okay um and then next we have the coin and in the coin we have um the falling speed and all that and we have a wait time so only every few seconds a new coin will spawn and then if a coin hits basket this is what will happen so this is the coin code another with the hitbox really simple just ghost effect 100 and goes to that position over the shop button so what this does is if you hover your mouse over it it will appear to be bigger and smaller and then yeah and then down here if you click on the shop it will lead you to the shop and then there's shop backgrounds just when you click on the shop it will show this backdrop instead of this spectrum and there's the exit button so if you want to leave the shop just click the exit and same concept here when you hover your mouse it will go bigger and smaller and when you click it and you're not hitting a bomb then it will let you start game again so that's what the exit button is okay so first we want to let go to the shop button and we need to add one small script right here to um allow the player to access the shop whenever they want so um let's say s okay so when the s key is pressed because s for shop so when key s is pressed then we are going to broadcast end game so then when a broadcast end game then it will show the shop and then you can click it so i'll show you real quick right here so let's play it let's begin yes as you can see when you click s the shop icon shows up you can click it and it will lead you to the shop immediately and you can exit and play again so so this thing um lets the player access shop whenever they want all right so now we can work on the shop upgrades and stuff for your shop okay you can make different upgrades but we um just have these for now so i have the um the wings is 25 coins so what it does is make the player move faster so what i did inside the costumes we'll put this in the link in the description inside the google drive so you don't have to worry about making it but if you would like to make your own then sure you can make your own so we just got some png wings from online attached it to a circle with filled and then we put 25 as the cost and once you purchase the thing we want it to be grayed out so you can't purchase any more so it'll switch to this costume and then we also have the basket bigger basket 50 uh 50 coins or whatever so it just makes a basket bigger so you can catch more fruit but it also increases the chances of catching a bomb but 50 coins and same concept here when you buy it you can't buy it anymore so we gray it out and then we have the skin pigskin so for a hundred points you can get a pig skin so this is from our channel banner if you've seen it we have that pig in the banner um 100 coins and same here but instead right in the pig you can switch between the pig and the ghost so we have let's say you buy the pig but you want to switch it back to the ghost skin then we'll allow it to switch as well so this is not so if you purchase the pig you'll not permanently be able to place a pig you can still switch back to the ghost okay so we got all our costumes it'll be in the google drive and link description so be sure to download that okay all right so now let's go to our first sprite the wing sprite the purchase wings purchase speed so in here first we want to do make a variable okay let's pick the smaller and we're gonna call the variable wing status okay wing wing status so this is to check if the wing is like locked or unlocked so that's what it does and for all sprites waiting status so first in this in this sprite the purchase wings make you more faster first when i receive start game we're going to hide this of course so when it's in play we're going to hide this sprite because you're not in the shop yet and when i receive a start screen then we're going to hide and we're going to set the wing status to locked because it has not been bought yet so we are going to set it to locked wing status to locked and once you can unlock it we'll say it's unlocked and then we're going to switch the costume to costume one which is the locked one like the one that you the purchase one this is the one you already purchased this means you already purchased this the wings this means you have not so we're going to switch it to the first one first and then when i receive shot we're going to show this shot we're going to go to the front layer with it so it's going to go to the front and after that we want to make it go to position so since i import this from my other thing from the sprites i already have the coordinates but this is the coordinate i use negative 175.85 so this is where it is somewhere in this corner area so that's where it is and then we're going to set the size to 100 so in the beginning i want to do that because we're also going to do the mouse hover thing so it will um so then it will get bigger and smaller so in the beginning we want to make it back to normal size and we're going to show okay so then we can go to our exit button i believe we can just drag and drop this forever thing this entire script into here and you see this attach it to the bottom but we'll have to make changes obviously so up here this is fine actually no you have to switch this like that so it has to be 100 um 100 minus size and the size has to be in here like that it's kind of confusing and we're going to divide by three instead so it's going to be a different um amount of big and small because this is a smaller this is a different sized sprite so we're going to do that and plug that in here same thing for this thing i'm going to take this out 150 minus the size we're going to put the size in the first in the division put that in here like that all right and drag that in here and we're going to take this out and if touching mouse pointer so if the uh this thing's touching the mouse pointer then we're going to oh wait we already have done that sorry we have to do this now so mouse down so when mouse down so if mouse down then we're going to set the brightness to the w10 if mouse down then we're going to take this out because this is different so if wait until mouse down we are going to broadcast another message so we're going to broadcast a message called check wins purchase so it's to check if the wings are purchased or not check wins um and then we're going to set the brightness here over here okay and this right here and one more thing you have to put this if else statement inside this if then statement if touching mouse pointer okay so i'm gonna start from the beginning this is setting it up forever change size by this if touching mouse pointer then we're gonna change size for this and we're gonna have an if else right here so if mouse down then set brightness negative 10 wait until mouse down and then we're going to broadcast the check wings purchase and then we're going to set the brightness to zero so this is the scripts for the wings so get that into your code okay um and this should be three as well not i don't know why i put five right there um so these these both should be three and then up here we're going to receive the check wings purchase so when i receive check wins purchase and we're going to get an if done statement so if else i mean if l statement so if wings status is equal to unlocked so if it's not locked so status is equal to unlock then we are going to stop the script stop this script and we're going to in the l statement we're going to put in if else another if else in here so if the money okay so this is to check if the player has enough money to purchase it so if we're gonna use an ore okay so if money is equal to 25 so we're gonna get the money the money variable we had so if the money is equal to 25 or the money is greater than 25 so this is to check if the player has 25 coins or over so they can purchase it money is greater than 25 then we're going to change the money by negative 25 change money by negative 25 so you'll lose your money after you buy this and we're going to set the wing status to unlocked so what this appears if it's already purchased then we will not need the script that's why we're gonna stop it unlocked so the reason why we have this up here if the wing status is already unlocked then we would not need the script so set that and then all right so right here in the player our run is only eight right so we're going to make the player even quicker by setting the run to 20 okay one to twenty and put that under here and we're gonna switch the costume to costume two to know that tell the player that you've already bought this okay and then else if the player cannot afford it or let's not buy it then we're going to set the wing status to locked locked locked and we're going to switch the costume to costume one so it'll stay on the first costume right here and costume one okay okay so now after we finish the script we want to receive a message the check wings purchase so we're going to check wings purchase so we're going to get an ifthen statement so if the wing status is unlocked we can just duplicate that we're going to get it forever forever we're going to switch the costume to costume so you can't purchase it ever again all right so why not let's try this out so first we need enough money actually we can check on it right now yes okay click here so as you can see i cannot purchase it when i click on it nothing happens because i do not have enough money first let's get enough money okay money right there so the money gives you pick random money so it depends close okay now we can buy so let's click s for the shop and as you can see we can purchase it and minuses are money and you can't purchase it again and as you can see the player is much quicker now and you can move much quicker but yeah so now the speed will work the speed will work now so that's the demonstration of the speed now we can work in a bigger basket i think we will not have enough time to work on the skin though but let's work on the bigger basket okay so let's go into our bigger basket um thing or whatever upgrade you have so since i have not released the like i don't think we'll have enough time to the skins you guys can try to do it it's pretty much the same concept as these um if you can do it that's great you will not need our last tutorial so um i guess you guys can try to do it but first right now we're going to work in a bigger basket you guys can make your own upgrades as well you don't have to just copy mine so in the bigger basket um in the beginning when i receive start game we are going to hide hide the basket when i receive a start screen start loops start screen you're going to hide and we're going to make a new variable okay so for each one we're going to make a status so we're going to name this basket status to see if it's locked or unlocked okay so for the basket status we're gonna set it to locked in the beginning oops not bomb speed basket status we're gonna set it to locked and then we're going to switch the costume to costume one which is then one that's not has not been purchased yet this one okay okay now let's work on the um the so you can be able to purchase it okay so when i receive shop we are going to go to front layer and then after that we are going to go to this position i had negative 685 i put them all in the same y position so i'm going to go to this position negative 60 85 set the y and the size to 100 and we're gonna show and then after this we're going to get the same script from here so we can just drag and drop this forever loop script we have to change some stuff still but almost the same thing so this up here is the same so don't this can be unchanged and the only thing that needs to be changed is right here and we're going to broadcast another mask a message called check basket purchase okay so this is the code for this pretty simple and then we are going to when i receive the check basket status when i receive check basket purchase then we're going to get an if else statement so pretty much the same thing as this one so drag and drop this into here except we're going to change some stuff up oops what if okay so instead of wing status we are going to do basket status obviously and instead of 25 we're doing 50 so big basket is 50. you guys can make it any cost you want but i'm making 50. so we're gonna and after this we're going to change it by negative 50 the money and then we're going gonna set the um basket status to unlocked and um instead of the run we are going to broadcast a message called bigger basket this can be still here so we're gonna broadcast a message in between here called bigger basket so we'll make a new costume to make the basket bigger i'll also show you how to do it and then right here instead of wing status we're gonna do basket status a lot okay and then right here um we have to add one more thing when i receive check basket purchase we're going to get an if then statement if the basket status is equal to unlock we can just duplicate this then we're going to forever switch the costume to two so you can't ever buy it again unbuy it i mean you can't ever unbox again so that's it this the bigger basket so obviously we the the basket's not gonna get bigger so we have to make a costume for the basket so let's go to the basket okay so inside the basket um i have a bigger basket costume so what i did so i got the normal basket and i basically just enlarged it on the sides i just made it longer and wider so that's what i did that's the bigger basket it's really simple to do um and after this i'm going to receive we're going to receive the message when i receive bigger basket we are going to switch the costume to basket 2 which is the bigger one all right let's see i need the coins um and i don't want to just give myself 50 coins because i want to also play with this well we're really close maybe one more point if we're lucky okay we need one more we only got six from that oh no now we have enough so we're gonna click s for the shop select the basket and boom all the money's gone but now your basket is bigger as you can see it's easier to catch the coins as you can see and the fruits and bombs but now i'm also gonna get the speed show it all now i have enough let's go shop speed and boom now we got speed and bigger basket all right so that's it for today's tutorial on the apple dash so today just recap we finished the purchasing for the wings and the bigger basket and next week we'll next time i make a video we'll be working on the skin so thank you guys for watching um please leave a like and subscribe if you enjoy learning today's lesson and i'll see you guys in the next video
