i'm pretty sure many of you are familiar with the game google snake today we're going to be making your own inside scratch if you're not familiar with the game i will show you a quick demonstration of what it is it's basically a simple snake game you know you're the snake the more you eat the longer you are and if you hit the edge obviously you lose so without further ado let's hop right into the video okay so now we're in scratch i'll show you my own game of google snake so let's click play so basically it's about the same thing so when you collect some oops i just died already so see you collect an apple you get bigger as you can see it was like pulsating in the beginning like as you can see like when you start you'll see like the other the sprites like pulsating a little bit it's because it's too big if you wanted to not do that then you can set the sprite as a smaller but since i already said it like that i'll show you guys so basically as you eat more um oops the more you eat the longer your length is and the goal is to survive as long as you possibly can so yeah that's basically my version of google snape yeah i just died right there so that's my version of google snake so without further ado let's create a new project so we're gonna create a new project you guys have noticed that we've hit 8k subscribers recently and currently 89.3 percent of you guys are not subscribed watching our channel so please help us get to 9k subscribers quicker by clicking the subscribe button that would really help and support our channel all right and then first i'm going to rename the project to google snake i already have all the sprites inside my backpack the um head and stuff i also get the background as well so yeah i just got the backdrop i actually forgot to get it so here it is um so all the sprites will be in the google drive remember so first i'm going to put in the backdrop it's just like the google snake backdrop you know it looks like this it's like a grid and then we'll delete the scratch cat and let's put in our sprite so right here we have the body and the head and like i said earlier sometimes you see it's like pulsating a little bit you can obviously just decrease the size of it there we go so now we have the two sprites uh two costumes one is the head one is the body and we're gonna get the apple so like the snake's gonna eat the apple right so first we're going to set the apple to maybe 50 not too big yeah that's perfect size so apple we're going to get that spray and we'll make it we need one more sprite but i will add that later on so let's go to the snake again let's go to the head so inside the head we are going to get when green flag is clicked i'm going to rename the head actually so it's easier no i'll name it player okay so that's the snake um i want to zoom in level okay so when green flight clicked then we're gonna switch the costume of head switch head and switch cost me to the head costume you see and we're going to make a new variable this is called length we're going to name it length for all sprites length um and then we're going to make another variable we're going to name it high score and we're going to make a cloud variable so it's stored um on the cloud so then you can see who has the highest score and then right here in the beginning we're going to set both of the variables to zero so we're gonna set uh the length and we're gonna set the high score variable to zero also we're after this we're going to set the position of the player to zero zero which is the middle of the screen and we're going to get a forever loop we're going to make him forever go three steps in three steps so it will move no matter what move three steps and we're going to if uh touching the edge touching edge so if the player is touching the edge then we're going to broadcast a message and we're going to name it game over game over then we're going to broadcast a message called stop all and we're going to make a new variable called score we'll also need this later for all sprites as well all right and then after this we are going to um when greenfly clicked another one when you're clicked we're going to forever wait 0.25 seconds seconds and create a clone of myself and then right here we're going to make the movement of the snake so remember you got to look at this from the snake's perspective so let's say he's pointing downwards right it's pointing downwards um it's going to left is going to be this way forward and right is going to be this way so now we're going to create the movement for it so i'm going to when this key is pressed when key left is pressed when key left is pressed we're going to use an if else so if the direction is greater than zero so direction zero is point like pointing up right so if it's greater than zero meaning that means it's somewhere on this side that means so if uh direction is greater than zero if it's greater than zero then we're going to turn 90 degrees so that means it will turn to the right turn 90 degrees to the right so let's say it's going up direction is zero then we're going to turn to the right 90 degrees else it's going to go to the left so you have to look at this from the snake's perspective not yours right has to be left like that then we're just going to duplicate this okay so right here when the key right arrow is pressed the direction is greater than zero we're going to turn left instead of right so so it's going to turn left instead of right also in the beginning you might want to set this direction to zero i mean 180 180 180 is point pointing the bottom so i'm gonna set it to 180 in the beginning and we're just going to duplicate this again we're new bottom so if the down arrow key is pressed and direction is greater than zero we're going to yeah we're just going to keep this same thing it's going down and if the direction is greater than zero we're going to turn right so we're going to this way if it's greater than zero obviously you're going to turn this way basis size greater than zero else we're going to turn to the left all right typically this one last time right left down up now if the up so up arrow so if the direction is greater than zero we're going to turn left 90 degrees else we're going to turn right 90 degrees it's going up zero is going to be uh greater than zero is going to be this way right so it was greater than zero we're going to make it turn left else it's going to turn right so that means if it's facing to the right then it's going to going to turn left so yeah it's kind of hard to understand because you have to look from the snake's perspective not yours um right now obviously it is not working yet because we have this thing we will need it later i'll show you how it will work all right and then next we're going to under apply clicked uh we are going to reset the timer and forever set the score to timer timer all right so if you unplug this from the code and play it it's going to move normally right yeah so the snake can move around pretty well so yeah it's pretty cool we'll now make the length and we also added the score right the timer so and then next we are going to attach this back on so when i start as a clone when i start as a clone we are going to switch the costume to body which is the second costume so when it's getting cloned we're going to switch it to this one instead of the first one as you can see right here if you ran it if you if you took this out it would be like this yeah and we do not want that so that's why you have to do squish costume to body when it starts as a clone and we're going to set the size of 75 so it isn't too big and we're going to wait till i'm 11 seconds so we're going to wait whatever the length is so length is 5.5 seconds so we're going to wait length seconds however long the player is and then we're going to delete this clone all right save it obviously it won't work because you have to eat something in order to grow so now we are going to make it so that you can eat something and you will grow also when you play it you can see that it's pulsating a little bit if i like zoom in you probably can see it but yeah it's like little pulsate effect right there and we don't want that so you can make it even smaller if you want so there let's see if it has any more it still has a bit yeah as you can see now it's pretty much invisible it's not it's not visible anymore all right let's stop the project save it let's go to the apple so inside our apple we're going to go to the code one green flag clicked make it bigger so we're going to go to a pick random negative 200 to 200 place for the x and then for the y i'm gonna do one negative 150 to 150. so the apples will spawn from here to here from here to here so it's going to spawn like pretty much all around here all right and then we can get a forever loop forever we're going to so we're going to make it so if the head of the snake touches the apple then it will get eaten so we're going to get a touching color so we're going to get if forever if touching the color let's look at the tip of the snake like right there if it's touching that color now we're going to change the length by one change the length by one and we're going to go to just duplicate this again and put this right here all right so now let's run the game as you can see you will get bigger every time you eat it and i think i made the body too small so let me go ahead and increase the size a bit okay let's see how good it is now let's eat an apple yeah so that's more like it that's more like it yeah all right so now let's make it play some music i guess so let's go to the backdrop code um we can move the variables around a little let's put high score and score over here and length so let's make it play some music uh we're going to just pick a random sound i don't know let's go to loops classical piano whatever uh actually no this this does not fit the theme of the game what did i have last time i think i had like dance magic or something let's get that yeah whatever this is yeah all right so one group like clicked forever they're going to play them sound against magic until done okay now let's go back to the player real quick so inside the player we are going to put the high score mechanic into the game so let's move out of the way move this stuff out of the way and then we're going to get an effects event so if putting the forever loop we're going to do if a high score is less than the score or what score is greater than high score then we're going to set the variable high score to score all right there you go okay actually i don't know why i'm sending the high score to zero should be score sorry about that i don't i think i looked at the wrong thing except something so you want the high scores okay so that's more likely let's run the game as you can see the high score is going up with the score because this is a high score so far yeah as you can see the snake is growing big the length is in the right top hand top right hand corner you can see that it's also getting bigger yeah so that's basically it now we can add a game over and then our game will be finished so let's make a red text because usually game over is bread i guess i don't know let's make it big about that big uh maybe a little smaller actually that's a bit too big all right that's all right so then we go when green flag clicks gonna uh sorry go to front layer make sure it's in the front and we're going to hide and we're going to go to zero zero and then when i receive game over then we will be showing this thing and we will stop all okay so now let's run the game as you can see it's bigger so the length is growing getting bigger as well so in our game you can't actually uh lose by hitting your tail because the thing is you're always touching the body so if you want to make it so that you die when you touch your tail then you're going to have to make it a separate sprite so it's just a simple version of google snape so yeah that's pretty much for this tutorial thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share and subscribe and
