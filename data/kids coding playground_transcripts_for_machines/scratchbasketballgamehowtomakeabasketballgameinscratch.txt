welcome back guys the kids coding playroom here today we're doing a new project in scratch we're working on the basketball game or scratch so basically the point of the game is you move around using the arrow keys and then you click the space bar to throw the basketball and you try to get into the hoop and then when you get into the hoop you'll get score as you can see so i'm going to play the project and show you guys how it works so we also have some music in the background so you move around using the cat you can also jump using the cat so you jump as you can see you make a score and as you can see if you shoot under the nets you cannot make a score like that so you can see that as you can see you can't make a score from under the nets one more there you go so it's pretty simple for a basketball game so yeah that's pretty much it for the game so now let's get on to the coding so let's start a new project so new projects okay so in our new project we're going to be using the cat so we're going to rename it to cap and then we rename the project to basketball basketball and then right here we can get some sprites so right here we have the net sprite so the hoop we actually drew this and we have to get our basketball sprite so we're gonna get a basketball right here basketball right here we'll take the basketball and then we'll resize it to 125 because it's a little bit too small and then we'll draw our hit box so hit box it's just going to be a small uh square so we take out the outline as well so no outline and then we're just going to zoom in hold down shift so then get a perfect square oops didn't have the tool selected hold down shift so about that big that should be good enough so the hitbox is going to be like on top of the basketball hoop so then it will be able to uh detect if the basketball is going through and you'll score and then next week go into her hoop as you can see her hoop is under the center thing because we want to put our hitbox about at this position so then it will look like it's actually going through the hoop and scoring and then for a basketball hoop it's pretty simple to draw we just have a outline of red and then we use the 20 thickness of the line and then we draw a line right there and then right here we have three lines down and then two lines across and they're all whites to make it look like a net so here we have our basketball hoop so yes if you want to draw it you can draw but it's also going to be in our google drive in the description below and then next we can rename this let's rename it to a box so there's right it's going to be hitbox and then we can get our backdrop so we got the brick wall background i think wall so we have the wall one we're gonna use this backdrop okay so now we have all our assets into our game let's get on to the coding so inside our cat we're going to first start with the movement of the cat so when green flag is clicked we are going to set the y velocity set y velocity we're going to make a new variable so we're going to make a new variable y velocity it's for this cat only for the sprite only by y velocity for this right only so we have y velocity we're going to set the y velocity to zero and then we're gonna forever here forever loop we're going to get change y velocity by the y y position by the y velocity so we're going to change the y by the y velocity that and then forever uh we have that forever so next we're going to get if then statement so if so if the position is greater than negative 130 so negative 130 is about down here somewhere so we want the cat to be somewhere down here so we're going to get if the position is greater than negative 130 so we're gonna get the y position oops accidentally checked it in the y position and then if it's greater than negative 130 meaning it's in the air so i'm gonna get if it's greater than position negative 130 over here that means it's in the air then we're going to change the y velocity by negative two meaning it will come back down so we're going to change the variable y velocity by negative two and then next we're going to get an if then statement if y velocity y position is less than negative negative 130 meaning it's on the ground so we're going to get y position if it's less than negative 130. if it's like that then we're going to set the y back to negative 130 set y back to 130 negative 130 and then we're gonna set the y y velocity to zero next we're going to do with the left and right movement so we're going to when green flag clicks we're going to do this when we fly click we're going to get to forever we're going to forever if if then so if the left arrow key is pressed so if key left is pressed left arrow key is pressed then we're going to point direction of negative 90 in direction negative 90. and then next we're gonna move eight steps so we're gonna make the cat move eight steps duplicate this and then we're gonna get a if right arrows key is pressed then we're gonna change the direction to 90 point version 90 and move eight steps we'll keep that okay so now we have all this code we're gonna get onto the left and right we're going to make it look like he's walking so we're going to hit the one group like clicked go down here we're going to get one group like clicked forever if uh left or right arrow key is pressed so we can use the or so or if key left is being pressed or right so we're going to get the key left arrow or duplicate let's get it right so if either one of those are pressed then we're going to do next costume.1 seconds just so it'll look like it's walking so we have the 8.1 and then next we have one more last bit of code so we're going to go over here uh we're going to do if up arrow key is pressed when up is pressed then we're going to if the y position is equal to negative 130 meaning the cat is going to be at negative 130 so we want the cat to be negative 130 we're going to set it right here 30 so so negative 130 so if the up arrow uh if the up arrow is pressed and if y position is equal to 1 negative 130 so 5 position my position is equal to negative 130 we're going to uh set the y velocity our variable y velocity we're going to set that to uh just said it's 20 so he's going to have like jump 20 up in the air so we're gonna next see up here we can change the y by y velocity that means it'll be changing by 20. so let's play our code so right here we can see the cat is moving and of course it's upside down uh really simple to fix this just click this button and then it'll just right be right side up so where you can use the set rotation styles of left and right so as you can see our cat is moving jump as you can see now the cat can jump because we have our code in for the jumping physics as well okay so now our cat is jumping we can on to our basketball so on to our basketball go into our basketball we're going to get in a oneyear flight clicked when we're on flick we're going to make a new variable and the name is score for all sprites so we're going to set the score to zero and then we're going to hide and hide the basketball beginning and then only when the spacebar is pressed then we'll show the basketball so when spacebar is pressed so when space keys press we're gonna do space then we're gonna make a new variable and then we're gonna name it made basket so this is to detect if the uh basketball has been made inside the basket made basket for this sprite only so meat basket for this right only i'm gonna set made basket to note so it's not gonna be in the basket obviously in the beginning and then we're gonna set the direction of the cat which is a new variable so we make a new variable we're gonna name it direction of cat so direction of cats it's for all sprites so we're gonna set direction of cats and then work as soon as the game starts as soon as you press the space bar we're going to get the position of where the ball is the direction of it so then it will go in a certain direction if you don't do this the ball will only shoot towards one side so we want to make it make sure the ball can shoot towards the left and right so we're going to get the this one this blocker here in sensing so we're going to get the cat and the direction so that's what we have to do and then we're gonna make it play the sound uh pop or you can do basketball bounce whatever uh we're gonna do pop whenever you shoot the ball and then we're gonna make the sprite go to the cat so the ball will always go to the cat and after that we're gonna set the y velocity to 24 so that's going to be the y velocity of the ball set y velocity y velocity all right we have to make a new variable oh yeah i forgot we have to make a new variable called y velocity for the sprite only it's also for the sprite only so we have y velocity i don't know why but is sometimes laggy or glitchy sometimes it doesn't show up when i made the variable i have to leave and come back so here we have the y velocity variable um again it's for the sprite only so we're going to set our y velocity y velocity and then we're going to set it to 24. that's gonna be it from this uh for the basketball and then we're going to point direction of the direction of the cat so it's going to point in the direction of the direction of the cat right here you see and see me set the variable to that um sensing block so best sensing direction of the cat is now the variable so we're going to just put the variable right there and then we're going to show the ball and then next we're going to repeat until so repeat until gonna repeat until and then we're gonna get if the y position is less than negative 130 so if the y position y position is less than negative 130 meaning it's on the ground then we're going to repeat until so if it's like that then we're going to get if else statement so if so basically we're going to repeat the ball until it's on the ground so we're going to repeat this code in here until it's on the ground so we're going to do if direction of the cat is greater than zero so the direction of the cat the direction of the cat's greater than zero we're gonna change the x by ten so this is basically making the ball move in a certain direction so we're gonna change the uh x by 10 else we're going to change the x by negative 10 because it'll be going towards the other way so if the direction of the cat is towards the right side meaning it's greater than zero ball is going to shoot towards this side if it's pointing towards this way the ball will shoot this way so that's the code for which way the ball has to shoot according to wherever the cat is pointing towards and the next we're gonna obviously have to do set make the ball shoot so we're gonna have to change the y position change y we're going to change the y by the y y velocity so y velocity and then we're going to change the y velocity by negative 2. so this is the code to make it come back down and then if else we're getting it if else uh inside here inside the repeat loop so the repeat until uh so if it's the direction of the cat is greater than zero we're also going to make the ball like turn so it's kind of like in like real life when you throw a basketball it goes up and then comes back down in like a parabola pattern so kind of like that so we're gonna have to make it turn so we're gonna do if it's greater than zero so let's say the cat's pointing towards this way then we're going to turn six degrees towards the right side else if it's facing this way the cat's facing towards the left kind of turn six degrees towards the left like that and then next we're gonna get if then statement so if so this is like for the hitbox if um touching so any two and statements so and and so if the ball is touching the hitbox so this is to detect if the ball should make a shot or not so if it's touching the hitbox for one oops for the first one hitbox and then the second one if the y velocity is less than zero meaning it's negative two which means it's falling so we want the ball to only be able to shoot if it's coming over the hoop so we're gonna do if it's less than zero so zero y velocity is less than zero and we're going to make it made basket equal to no because we want to make sure the basket the ball is not in the basket before we can make another one so we're going to make it no so made baskets go to no because if it is then that means it'll score multiple times and then we're going to change the score by one right here okay score by one and then we're going to set made basket to yes because it's being made into the basket so we're going to ask yes and then next we're going to broadcast a message called made shot so you know new message made shot so made shot and then we're going to hide all this so that's a lot of code so here i'll show you guys the top and then go back to the bottom make sure you guys didn't mess up anything so that's basically it for the ball now let's hop into the hoop so let's go into our hoop code oh yeah let me show you guys the ball should be able to shoot as you can see the ball is shooting so now we're going to make the code for the hoop to fly all around so we're going to get a link green flight clicked and we're going to forever and then we're going to glide one second glide one second to pick random negative 240. so negative 240 for the x to 240 240 and then for the why we can do pick random negative 50 to 180 so so it's going to be something like this so it's going to glide from somewhere pick random right here to here for the x and then for the y negative 50 is probably like right here the somewhere up here 180s like up here so it's just going to glide somewhere randomly like randomly all around here and then next we're going to receive the message made shot when i receive made shot we're gonna uh play a sound so we're gonna start sound here and inside the cats right here um we're going to when i receive the mage shot we're gonna make the cat say score for one second so score exclamation mark for one second and then next let's go to our hitbox this is our last piece of code we need it's pretty simple it's for the hitbox when we fly clicked we just need to set the ghost effect set ghost effect to 100 so then it's not visible but it's still uh you can still like so the ball touches it it'll still detect stuff but if you hide it it will not so that's why you use the ghost effect and then we're going to use forever loop and then we're going to go to the hoop so this hitbox will go to the hoop go to loop so forever always follow the hoop okay so here we have it uh we can also add some music uh what music let's just let's just get a forever loop go to sounds let's just find some random music i don't know whatever sound let's go to loops yeah these are all the music let's just use uh k by yes sure let's use that and then start sounding so long save your project and let's play our project so you see the cat is moving around the basket also moves around you shoot see as you can see when i shoot it it's a score oh yeah also let me show you the variable sport about to do that score okay as you can see the score is two yeah so as you can see the game is working a pretty simple basketball game so yeah that's pretty much it for this tutorial don't forget to like share and subscribe and ring the notification bell i think guys all for watching and i will see you guys in the next tutorial
