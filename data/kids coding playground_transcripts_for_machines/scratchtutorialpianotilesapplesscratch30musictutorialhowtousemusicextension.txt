so welcome back guys it's kids coming playground here today we'll be doing another video on our channel so we'll be working on a catching the apples game with the piano sound of course so um so what so like when you play it so uh you have five lives and if you don't catch any apples and then you'll lose all your lives and it'll be game over and um so the tune is supposed to be um jingle bells it's like jingle bells so i'll just let you guys see it okay yeah so we just added a little um sound right here it's like it'll play jingle bells um and for each apple you touch you will get um one point and it will play the sound corresponding to the note so if you guys play any instrument you will know what these notes are so we got this idea from my cousin so our cousin made a similar game but um his is a little different because doesn't play a specific sound okay so this is our cousin's game he's not using the sound he's not using the sounds from the scratch but he's using prerecorded tunes so if you like let's say if you guys don't have a piano then this would not work so using the sounds and you can you just use the sounds in this sprite library in the library okay so now we have our new project so we just start a new project let's rename it to um catch the apple the apple with piano i don't know you guys can name it whatever you want i'm going to name it like this and then we're going to delete the scratch hat we'll not need that and let me make it new backdrop okay now let's import some sprites into here so we already have the apple sprite which is basically just the apple from the scratch library and we just put a b c e f g so in in any instrument um the notes are denoted as a b c d e f g all the way up to g so i just changed the colors and added the letter of each one into here and change the color and rename each one so yeah so this is the sprite and the apple so next we have to get the bowl so this is the bowl it's for like catching the apples bowl and use that okay and we need a backdrop we gotta get the blue sky blue sky this one okay so for the bowl we're gonna start coding in here first so we have to code the movement let's get it one green flag clicked i'm zooming i'm gonna go to let's go to zero negative 135 so this is the position i used it's like somewhere down here and i'm going to set the rotation style to left and right so then the bulb will not flip over when it's moving around okay and then we're going to add for our blue and then we're going to set the x to the mouse x so it will follow the mouse on the xaxis so like that and then if on edge bounce so then the ball cannot go off the screen so after this you want to get an if then statement so this is for detecting the score so i i made it go up to 100 for testing purposes we're only going to do up to 30. so you need like um 30 score to win so this is just a detect um score we'll use that later so we're gonna make a variable let's name it score okay score and then we're going to do if score is greater than um let's say 30 or equal to 30 then we can um then we will broadcast a message okay so now let's make a new message so we're going to broadcast a message if the score is greater than 30 or equal to 30 then we're going to write you in so you win okay and then have one thing here so this is for the jingle bell song so this is all the notes for the jingle bells song so what i did was i made a list called jingle bell song and after that i also made a new custom block and jingle bells so these two and then i had to manually write out each letter of the whole song so if you didn't know this is the letter in order you can pause the video and put it down if you want okay so now we're gonna have to put this all into the apple sprite okay let's delete the sprite and then now we have the apple sprite we've duplicated all this code into the apple so now in the apple we're going to code here so this is the the stuff you need the notes so after this we're going to get one green flag clicked and then we're going to get i'm going to zoom in and we're going to i'll play the jingle bell thing so that so run this custom block and then we're going to hide with the apple in the beginning and we're gonna set the score to zero score to zero and then we're gonna set the lives to five i mean you guys can do any so we're making a variable in lives you guys can set how many lives you want but i'm just gonna do five now let's do five and then we're gonna make a new variable let's name it song index song index so what's on song index this is just to detect the the jingle bells song so we'll use this later i'll show you guys how to use it and then we're gonna set why do i have two of these and take out one of them we only set score to zero set lives and then song index to zero and then i set the size to the apple so 75 in the beginning just to be a little bit smaller and forever loop forever create a clone of myself so we're going to create a clone of the apple and wait 0.5 seconds so this is creating clones of the apple okay and then after that we're going to when i started clone okay and one last thing i forgot to mention is you can make any song you want i'm just doing jingle bells because i've already um we've already done it for another video so in the santa decorating um project we already used it so we're just going to use it again so yeah now when i start as a clone it's going to want to start as a clone okay when i start as a clone if the song index is greater than jingle bell so the whole list of the jingle bells right here the length of it is 75 i'm 25 and um so the land length of this list is 25 so so this length is 25 so if we're gonna get an ifelse statement if the song index is greater than the length of this list so this is to detect all right so if the song index is greater than the length then i'll restart it again and if it's not it'll continue playing it so we're going to get a song index the song index is greater than the jingle bell um not this one um length of the song a jingle bell song then we're gonna set the song index to one so go back to the beginning and else will change it up by one so it will keep on going down the list on which which um you'll get the next note to play the song index by one i'm gonna switch the costume corresponding to which note it is so switch costume to item so in here we have the item item song index of the jingle bells list and then we're gonna show okay and then we're gonna make it go to a pick random area in the beginning so we're going to make it go to pick random negative 210 to 210. so if you've ever played this game called uh piano tiles this game is kind of like it it's kind of like the same thing and then we're gonna get a forever loop and then change y by negative five so it'll keep on going down change y by negative five and after that we're gonna get if then if so if it's touching the brown we're gonna like make it lose a life let the player lose a life so if touching color touching color brown beneath the select tool select this brown color and we're going to broadcast a message called lose a life lose a life oops so lose a life and then we're going to delete this clone if it's touching the brown and then right now we're going to do the playing the notes so um we noticed something when we were doing this if you put the play note inside the in if that statement it'll have a little pause because it has to play the note so we're gonna use broadcast messages so it won't get stuck so we're going to get an if then statement put that right under here so if it's touching the bowl the apple touching the bowl bowl and put another if if the costume name is equal to a so i named all my costumes corresponding to what um note it is so if the costume number is equal to a as you can see right here i named abcdefg so the costume number is a which is the first costume and we're going to broadcast a broadcast a a okay i'm gonna just duplicate this if the costume number is equal to b i mean not costume number name we have to change it to name okay so to change it just click the little triangle and become name so costume name or number if you would like you can just number instead so instead of if you were to do number if cost of number is equal to one let me broadcast a but i just named it so it's easier to understand and then so if the cost numbers equal to b they're in broadcast b and then duplicate this do it all the way up until g so costume name is equal to c then we're gonna broadcast c keep on doing this costume number is d name i mean name is equal to d then we're going to make a new one called d and then just copy all this duplicate put it under here costume name is equal to e then we'll broadcast e and then if costume name is equal to f then broadcast f and finally if costume name is equal to g broadcast g so then we won't need the last one right here so just take this out okay now we have all this a b c d e f g and then one last part is to change the score by one so once touching it i'll change the score by one change score by one and delete this clone delete it okay i'm gonna zoom out show you guys how it's like so this is the code for the thing and now we're gonna have to broadcast a little messages for to make some sound okay so now we're going to go back in and when i receive a we're going to have to do this a lot it's a bit tedious so to get this music extension click here and there should be a music right here so you just click this thing and you'll get all of this so we're going to play the note um a so a is this one if you guys play piano then you'll know so one two three four five this is a so i play piano so i know this is a this a and if you want it to be and then the b and also if you want it to be lower or higher you can do this you have some low notes right here but i just keep it right here so b just in the middle area of the piano so in b i'm going to play b play this b 71 for 0.5 beats duplicate again so in c uh we're going to play middle c this one and then d we're going to play this one and e you're going to play this one and then f you'll play this one and then finally you got g so i will not if you guys don't play piano i will tell you guys what the numbers are so then you guys can copy it down easier so 67 right here okay so i'll do okay so the first one's 69 second 171 third one is 60 d is 62 e is 64. f is 65 and g is 67. okay now we can try it out okay let's try it out now let's play let me hide the list hide song index as well save it so as you can see it's playing at the jingle bell somewhere it might sound a little off too because this is scratch and it's not like real life you can't play each note for a certain amount of length so it kinda sounds like jingle bells not completely but like um i think it should do okay so it looks like we are finished with this we can go to the bowl so in the bowl we have to add one more script and right here in the apple we broadcast lose a life for here when it's touching the brown color so we're gonna have to receive it so when i receive the lose a life then i will change the lives by negative one and i will do this if lives is equal to zero lives is equal to zero then we can broadcast game over signifying that the player has lost game over game over so we're going to make a new sprite let's paint the new sprite so we're going to use the text so for the text we are going to write one for you in and one for you lose so usually for winning i usually do green and losing i usually do red so you win so you win you can make this bigger right here and then for the you lose just copy paste this and we can just do this you lose and then make this red so we're gonna make this red and then we're gonna just drag this to the center center all your sprites remember that now we have the two you win and you lose so now we're going to code for that when green flight clicks you want to go to zero zero with the sprite and then hide and after that when i receive um game over so right here in the apple um we have the you lose lose a life right here so broadcasting the bull and then right here we have to lose a life if lives are equal to zero then we broadcast game over and right here we have the you win if the score is greater than or equal to 30. for testing purpose we're going to keep it at 30. so next we're going to switch costume to costume one which is i mean so if you win if we switch the costume to costume one which is winning and we're gonna go to the front layer and stop all like this and show i forgot the show put the show before the stop all and then duplicate this when you lose game over then we're going to switch cosmic costume 2 which is the losing one and go to front layer show and stop all so we're going to play it so i'm gonna lose first so so as you can see when you get less than that then you lose so when you get more than 30 score so as you can see we got 30 score and we win so yeah that's it for this video and before we end the video we would like to tell you one more thing if you do not like the apple you can just make it a piano key or something like that and then our song jingle bells is only a section of the song so if you would like to make it even longer you may and um you can play whatever song you would like like i said earlier so yeah please like share and subscribe and ring the notification bell and we'll see you in the next tutorial you
