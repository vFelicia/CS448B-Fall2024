welcome back guys in today's another kids coding playground video and today we will be making a new game called underwater pong so an underwater pong we will be learning these following concepts and scratch understanding broadcast message you know we still have to learn these type of things because it's really important to make animations as well using variables it's like gamelike scores using random operator like pick random touching sprite if there's a sprite and you can touch it with like a ghost in like a thing you know move loops like forever loops and ifthen loops and random position like it goes anywhere like something somewhere random so here we are in the project in the untitled project so we're gonna rename this first top underwater pong then we're gonna start and delete the cat we're gonna take the backdrop go to the backdrops you can pick a backdrop let's pick on somewhere under water because it's under water pong let's take underwater one so first lets me get there are sprites so we have the beach ball sprite we have the paddles paddles right we have the diver sprite you take any one you want but I'll take one we have the don't cry and these are all our sprites so we always have to start with the events we always have to start so first we're gonna work on the paddle sprite so I'm gonna go along it closer I think that's the next so let's take the if when clicked flag the flag right here you'll do a command let's make it go to around here around here it's got a motion go to negative to negative 140 then forever loop this will make it go on and on forever then set X the set X so it'll stay there you know now we'll make my paddle pole follow my mouse so let's go to sensing and drag the mouse X book so let's see if it's working as you can see it's following my mouse so so let's work on the dive learn next the diver is just diving around so let's put him around like here and let's get the wooden start then let's take the forever loop so I'll do it forever no so let's zoom in a little bit more so let's take the go to so it'll stay there and then let's make it point in direction 90 so I'll point the way where it's pointing and I'm gonna make it glide around like here let's take glide or let's say three seconds and that point in direction negative 90 so you can also do that negative 90 so you got to click that so then it won't flip over so make sure make sure you click on this right here so it won't flip over so let's go negative 90 that's it then let's glide three seconds back okay so that's the divert code oh yeah yeah yeah so let's make it like a good number one is too quick so let's make it three again okay so let's move on to the beach ball let's see what code so first let's drag the when start let's zoom out a little bit that's a little bit to help let's go like around here yeah okay so let's make a variable let's make the variable oh okay variable school so that's how this gonna say how much score has so let's make its score 20 in the beginning go to go to X let's say around here because it's around the middle turn 15 degrees this way let's make it go forever so then it won't keep up it will keep on bouncing move 15 steps if I'm edge bounce so we might so we're going to take if on edge bounce then let's make another events another start so forever we need to go forever again you need an ifthen statement so then if then it's touching the paddle so if it's touching the paddle that means it will bounce and turn 180 degrees so let's get that one turn a hundred okay and it's gonna move fifteen steps you have to put it in the ifthen statement if you got you've got put in the ifthen statement loop and and wait 0.5 seconds let's make it wait a little bit then you need another ifthen statement make sure not to overlap it like this make it like right here so then it also won't work out so let's if then touching the star touching the star so we gotta make a message called and a variable called run again let's make a variable run again this variable is to make it so if you hit the star it'll wait a few seconds before it shows up or else it won't or else if you hit it it will just keep on showing up so yeah so you got to make this one so let's set set the run again to zero if it's touching the store then broadcast hit star let's make a new message hit stop so if you receive hit star that means it would change the score by one so then you got one piece of score like one score that's good by one and you have to wait pick random seconds for it to run again so wait pick random so this is where we learned pick random let's do one two five yeah so and set run again to one run again to one so pick one to five seconds before the star shows up again okay let's move on to the star guys so you always have to start out with the if flag clicked and yeah let's zoom in a little bit so then you can see it more better so set run again let's get here set one again to one forever let's put the four upper loop this is a loop mmhmm and then you take the ifthen statement and use to run again run again equals you got to use this one right here you wanna run again equals one then it goes to a random position go to random position anywhere it can be anywhere and show it'll show so then you can see it go wait three seconds let's make it wait three seconds and make it high so it won't come that often okay so so the star those wait three seconds it will appear for three seconds and you could hit it go hide so if you hit it so remember that hit hit star thing we had and then it makes it go it makes it hide so let's go in and let's run the game as you can see the paddle you hit the diver swimming around you can get the star it gives you three seconds to hit it and as you can see my score is going up see it's to score oh yeah and you also have to you might have to hide the run again the run again variable so you cannot see so let's save the project don't forget to save the project or else it won't be saved and let's play it so the ball can bounce off the bottom as well so the ball it's just like forever and then you just get score okay so that's the end of our video thank you for watching please
