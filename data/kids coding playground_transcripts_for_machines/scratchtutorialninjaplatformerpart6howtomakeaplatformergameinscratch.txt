hello and welcome back to kids calling playground today we'll be working on the video number six for this ninja platform again today we'll try to work on the ninja throwing the kunai knife out at the enemy so walk on that before we can place the light share subscribe to our Channel and comment down below for the video see what you guys like to see more all right okay let's begin okay so the ninja that throws the knife out is really similar similar to the attack ninja so what we can do is we can kind of duplicate this guy or now and we cannot hold him here we're gonna call this a ninja throw flowers right and now what we're going to do is we come and change it out a little bit so we'll delete all this costume here okay and we cannot delete the last one but uh there's a matter wall upload new one so upload costume we'll go back to the menu and we are called up along with the throwing knife so that's before that see if we have the name kunai knife here this is jump that is attack by run throw okay we'll have Pro here zero the nine we can get this sprite okay so we have all of them we can delete this a nine now and then we can rename it to t01 there's too quick for fiveyear just calculate these you know six seven eight and last one another nine okay so we have our sprite ready so 0 9 0 1 0 t0 to say nine okay Wow what we will do is will not change out this a little bit so this would be the same will keep it the same this is also the same what we're going to do is without change yourself in sup attack will change the ninja to us send out the bright command for them we have it here right in the bottom here and we pull this in here come up rockin the way so we can duplicate this will buy a Babel going faster this time whether Lancome already so we can say so when number t2 is press we can or cast a new message with our throw and ok so this is the message that will throw the knife out so we'll go back to the ninja so it's up the attack right or say throw when I received roll and then it's not dying then we want to set the action here same we did for the real attack and in sup show to just show one warship to show okay and then we'll go back to I'm enjoy again so here similar to that so was show to when I receive show it's a call didn't you attack hokodan in Jethro this time okay what we also need is the knife because when you when you throw the knife out right you'll have the knife right or what a tonight for that okay you can click on this say roll and we can find a knife here okay that's the knife okay we will have to still change the knife a little bit we won't come back to back we are going to rotate the knife so track you see this little like a little round thing track this we're gonna rotate a knife to you know okay like this so you can hold the shift key it kind of you're doing the track you can hold the shift key come to get straight it's no easier what we're gonna do is we'll change the sides at 25 okay really simple call to what greenback is quite well come on zoom in here so you can see better you can say set side as we already did that right you can also do like this si 25 and then we can say I did we don't want to show it when the green flag is clicked and when we would continues yeah the control here when I receive message hmm when I receive a prolife so what a podcast from my first phone this guy actually so here at the coal floors I forgot so we don't want to put it down here we'll create another block so that it doesn't block anything while they're doing this changing a costume so when I say receive throw to that's when the user click on the click on this button here number two right the keyboard number two and we do the costume change here and also on what we want to do is we want that same condition check we can say what casts this new message okay so throw knife okay so we have this broadcast message so when we receive this to do the custom change and also we wanna throw the knife out so when we receive from knife go to ninja that throw so it's the ninja troll costume or say 20 direction now we've got a sensing my tractor's in here so we gonna choose that ninjatroll you can select direction and then we will say move what's the move Oh 25 step just can't move the knife out in front when it's throwing because when you say go to the ninja I can't go into that Center here than in your so we got more than I have a little bit so a move on if I step and then we'll all say show and then have to use the repeat loop here so we'll do you use a repeat until so making sure that when it hit the edge okay won't repeat until it hit the edge okay use this and select edge okay and then we'll say move ten step everyone it condition here also so if it hit that done hit the hitbox it'll disappear also need that sensing for that come back here get that select hitbox stop graded and we are going to hide it now you can use like this so you can use clone I think chrome will be a little bit more difficult with the coal but uh just there's things simple I mean is pretty much works almost the same okay so we got that so far so right now if it's hitting the knife if you touch the edge it'll go away or it gets to the end so let's test it out real quick so let's push number two you see it kind of gonna hit the hitbox it went way or else it goes the end noble cause so you can come up and you hit it so one thing I was talking earlier right why we need the weight and weight or kasev weight so that's actually some difference here so let's try this you see this up watch has a tap one and then throw to I wish is the other day so if I run in this game you see that this is a tap 1 this is throwing so let's say if I'm doing 2 button at the same time you see how it it's like attack and also throwing night right which is not good that's not what we want so when in order to fix that you actually need this so it's a what cast attack Russia say what cast attack 1 and wait when that condition is finished so that you not allowed to do that the second and then the same thing for here or casts and wait the throne so now let's stop this again let's try it again so we'll do it hack 1 still walk to their works if I do two but two button at the same time you can see if you can't only does one thing at a time so you cannot do okay so only attack all this so there you go so you're not allowed to hit two things at the same time okay so this is the attack for the ninja okay so what we can do is let's see okay now we have both the attack of the sword and draw a knife what we can do is we are going to make something that he can throw it or break it right so let's look at our crate here here on this okay we don't have much go here so what we can do is this so as you can see the ninja in the beginning it does some kind of a podcast with the crate set up so this set up message what cast has the platform rain see the platform so when is set up you know you can say okay move through a certain level or change level so once the setup or the platform is done or let's say you have different problem you can broadcast another message here and then the cray can take that message and then it will set up this its position so what we can do is we can broadcast a message here so after they cut the platform is set we can boy a new message saying create crate okay this will create a crate for placing in the right location so you can go back here and you say when I receive create great that's no bit so make sure go to the front layer okay and then you can check the level depending on which level you want you you know maybe it's the different position right so let's say we ended up with one right now right so we'll say go to the year here scrap this and save as level one and we're gonna make this position so that's already there so you just wrapped that yeah and then you say show me okay alright okay and then we have another loop to check if it get hit so you can say forever and then you can say like one touching and then you can use an if statement here and then use a hole operator actually so there's touching a ninja attack or it is touching the can leave call me so we can play a sound maybe with a blowing sound here select a sim okay so like like that's wake up pokin I mean you can use any sound I just thought that sound sound good so you can say start sound you don't have to say until done and I mean you can you can use either one that is fine it's really short and you can say hi and you can podcast another message and then you can say in a message pretty broken so the prey is broken so you can replace a crate after the crates broken you can replace with a gym or something like that later that's how we did on the original game so for now so let's test it out so we throw a knife so you see I broke the crate and it disappeared and let me try it with a sword so we chopped the sword it disappeared so that's how you kind of get the crate looking with the weapon so we can test it out you know later we can walk with the monster you know and you're gonna attack the monsters well so you can see the knight can't break the crane and sword also able to break it okay so we'll stop here we'll continue this next time alright thank you have a good day
