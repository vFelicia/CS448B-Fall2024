welcome back guys it's kids going playground here and today we're back for another video scratch and today we will be working on a july 4th game because that is coming up tomorrow is july 4th so happy july 4th everyone and the reason we haven't been posting lately is because we have we went on a vacation for a really long time and after that we got sick after that so um it took a while for us to recover so now we're back and we have created a july 4th the game so i'm going to demo it for you guys so if you can hear that music just a little bit music and you see the scratch cap with the firework launcher and you can launch fireworks so yeah it just shoots these fireworks with music this is an easy beginner tutorial scratch so yeah let's get started so create my new project and we're actually going to select a backdrop so we're going to select our backdrop here i think it's called like night sky yep night city so yeah we have that and we also have our scratch cow we're actually not going to delete the scratch cat so now we're going to drag in our firework launcher so we have that over here and now we're also going to ctrl c ctrl v onto our scratch cap now i'm going to group it and we're going to shrink it and put it on the scratch cap so now we have our firework launcher on our scratch cap so you see the lines are a little bit thick over here so now we're gonna group the scratch cap and we're gonna make him a little bit bigger so yeah so we're gonna put the rocket launcher back uh the firework launcher back on him make it go to the front oh now we're gonna make the firework launcher bigger so like that and we put it on the scratch cat so yeah now we're gonna maybe decrease the size to 50 because it's a little bit big and now we have our scratch cap so we have a few more sprites to make so we're going to show you how to draw the firework launcher so first we need a green rectangle so with just green rectangle and outline is five and we're gonna just draw this green rectangle over here like that like so and we're going to draw another rectangle like that but it's a little bit square so we might have to reshape it a little bit so kind of like that if you don't know how to draw it come to my project i'm gumball gumball098 and you can come and export the sprite from my project so yeah we have the a little trapezoid for our little launcher and we just have to do a little bit reshaping oopsies so and we can duplicate that to make the back so we just flip this horizontally and we make the back so that's where like the back of the launcher and we have a little handle grip so uh just a color green color and then just a rectangle oopsies it'll just make a little rectangle like that and place it under the launcher and the red a little trigger is just red color and another rectangle like that and so right now it just looks like a button so we can reshape it to make it the size like that so we have our rocket launcher our firework launcher if you want to add extra design you can add a little um triggers or like something like a little rectangle in the middle yeah so let's delete this so now we're going to create a new sprite so we're going to paint a purple dot so uh purple to make a small oh there's outline i'm gonna have no outline i'm gonna make a six by six dot so it's kind of 11 by 10 so we're going to hold shift so we can make that 7x7 okay drag that over here to the middle so now we have our dot for the little angle so now we're going to create the ball where he shoots it out so all over here and we're going to duplicate this and we're going to make this completely white it's completely white and we're going to make us this one so this is just for design we're going to do this make about this big no maybe a little bit and then on top of the yeah white dot now we're gonna duplicate this from this ball we're going to do we're going to minimize a little bit smaller and put it inside so now we have our dot where he shoots out so we're going to work on the scratch cat so so we're going to make actually one more sprite it's just five work and we don't have to draw anything we're gonna rename this and then this can be called dot and this can be called the rocket the rocket cap so now we're going to work on our scratch guide here so start out with the when the green flag is clicked it'll go to a certain position but i guess this position is fine so and we're going to make a new variable shoot and we're going to do this and set shoot to zero and then we have a forever it'll point towards mouse pointer so it'll always point wherever your mouse is and we need if then if then you need and if then the mouse is down which is if you click then it will shoot equals zero shoot i have any equals shoot equals zero and then we're gonna set shoot to one and now we're going to create the clone of the ball so set shoot to 1 and we're going to create a clone so now we're going to do the dot so the green flag is clicked a little bit when the green flag is clicked it will set ghost effect by 100 and now it will erase all because this release relates to pen so oh yeah by the way if you didn't know how to get pen you click on this little extra block thing and you click on pen so yeah um all these other things too so we have our pen so we go erase all and then forever go back to our pen set pen color to what so we set pen color to white and then we erase all and then we have to make a my block so we're going to call it draw dotted line and this is very important click on run without screen refresh over here and then click ok so now we have our draw dotted line and we're going to play it over here and then we define draw dotted line we'll set pen size to five so pin size to five and then set dot to zero which is another variable so we're going to set dot which is for all rights so set dot to zero and then we'll go to firework plaster which is the cat i mean rocket cat so go to rocket cat and then it would change y by five change y by five and then pen down and then it'll show so it's very important please do not skip this part so we're about to make our variable make a variable and we're going to make it grab it so set and then please click for this sprite only now we have that and then we'll set gravity to zero point towards mass pointer repeat until just touching the edge and we need it if then so if then the dot equals two so we need equal sign dot equals two then it'll set dot to zero i'll show you guys what this means later when the code is all finished so after that we will have pen down and then pen up so and then after that we will have a move 15 steps change gravity so we made that variable earlier by negative 0.38 and then change y by gravity after that you'll change dot by one and then pen up so i'll show you how it's working right now so we have our little angle of our little shoot angle so yeah we have that and i said that i'd explain to you later so now it's later so we're going to change if this was one it would have less space in between each dot so it's more closer and you want to give them a little bit space so choose the correct a good number for that but if you did something like six they'll be very far apart from each other and that will not look good so we're going to change the two so now we're going to work on the ball so let's go to the ball and then when the green flag is clicked so now we're going to make a list so we're going to make a list i'm going to change the name to so we're going to make a list so we can keep track of where the ball is at so we can send our firework there so we're going to change this to x position oh spelled it wrong and then we have okay so we have x position and we're going to make another one y position that's about oh my i spelled it wrong again all right whatever all right so now we have x position and y position so now we have our green flag so we're gonna make another gravity but it's for this sprite only so we have that gravity and then when this green flag is clicked it will delete all of x position and then it will delete all of y position and then it will hide and then when i start as this clone when i start as a clone it'll set gravity so this is the gravity that's inside the ball to zero and then set size to 50 so just make a little small and after that we go to firework blaster go to firework blaster which is rocket cat and we'll point towards mouse pointer so now we're gonna change y by five and then go to back layer and now show and repeat until touching edge so the ball will be until touching edge i'll move 15 steps 3 15 steps and now we have change gravity so this has to be the same number as earlier so change gravity by negative 0.38 and it will change y by graphing and then delete this one so now we get a when i start as a clone we wait 0.2 seconds and we'll set shoot to zero and then we wait so we have our weight here wait i'll pick random 0.5 which is 0.5 to 1 second and now we're going to go back to our variables and go back to our lists here so we're going to add a thing so it's everything we replace that with x position sorry motion x position to x position and then we add guessed it y position to y position and then we're gonna broadcast explode and then we're gonna delete this one so now i'm going to show you how it adds to the list so we're going to go and you see whenever we shoot a ball it'll add to the list so and it'll mark where we shot it so see here add so yeah we have that all added here and now i'm going to hide the list so we got variable and then we hide these two lists so yeah and now we're gonna work on the firework so now we have the firework so when i receive explode over here it'll go pen up over here like this and it'll set pen brightness to 100 so pretty sure it's in here yep brightness 200 and then it'll set pen color it doesn't matter what color it is so i set it to green and then we're going to change pen color by pick random 10 to 100 so it can be any color so just that's why it doesn't matter what color you selected default on because i'll pick random 10 to 100 and i'll set pen size set pin size to 10. and now we have that so now we have go to go to and we go to our variable here go to item one of x position that's the first thing that's inside the list and that's the shot that you're gonna have and then item one of y position and now we mark that down and then now we're going to delete it so there's only going to be one at a time so delete one of x position we're going to delete one of y position just like that and then we'll point in direction point direction pick random negative five two five and then pen down and now we have to make some variables here so we have to have make new variable number of clones and don't worry this is for all sprites so just make it all sprites and the other one ready to explode so yeah we have two new variables here and we're gonna set number of clones to zero and then we're gonna set ready to explode to zero and now we repeat until and uh repeat until then we have what are these less than signs repeat until 20 is less than number of clones so after when we have that it will create clone of myself now we have that so now we have to make a new variable explosion speed and this is for this sprite only so click on for the sprite only and we will set explosion speed to 20 and set ready to explode to one so now we have that all done now we're gonna have when i start as a clone uh change number of clones by one and we'll wait until ready to explode is equal to one and after that we have to have a point in direction point direction pick random negative 180 to positive 180 and after when we have that done we have to have a repeat 15 uh move explosion speed so we're gonna move explosion speed steps and after that change pen brightness by minus one i'll change explosion speed by minus one as well then after that we will delete this club so let's see if it works or not so first we're gonna hide all the variables because that's blocking everything so yeah we have all of that now we're gonna go to dot hide the gravity here ball on the gravity and now we have this so so it's gonna shoot you see as you can see it is shooting fireworks so the list is helping keep track of where it last was and the firework explosion happens on it so now let's add some music to liven it up so we have our backdrop and then when our green flag is clicked as always and i decided i wanted to use dance magic so let's use dance match okay this one so and then i'm gonna zoom in you might not be able to see and then forever we're gonna change play sound dance magic until dot and i forgot to change set volume set volume 25 percent so you might be able to hear me i'm turned down the volume a little bit just went off okay so yeah we have our music um so yeah this is our game here you see the fireworks you can hear the music turn down the volume a little bit so um yeah we have over here we have our backdrop our scratch cat our dots are making the alignment correct and the ball so yeah so this is i and also renamed your game to i just decided to name it july 4th 2022 because that's 2022 this year so yeah so anyways please like share subscribe comment the comment section below what you might do for july 4th and anyways see you guys next time you
