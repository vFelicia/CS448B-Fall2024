hello guys welcome back to kids calling playground so today will be the first video of us introducing uh python so uh in python you can either use like a pycharm like a editor ide to do it or you can go to this website trinket.io uh basically it's like you know scratch you do it online where you know you can call everything on the browser so this is what uh trinket io is so it's a similar thing uh you can sign up for a free account just use your google account and connect to it and uh it's pretty easy all right so so once you get there to the to the site you can just click on sign in with google so after you click on that it will create an account for you and then you can edit your code there so uh let's go there for now okay this is a trinket.io if you go over here you can say uh login uh and then you can click on this like here they have like a google account that you have um you know your personal google account just click on this it'll create the account for you okay so once you get on to here you'll see like uh you know coding uh it has like a total in space this is like a example project they had and the bird box and some other snowflakes so basically you can use you can look into this cold and try to you know do the project it'll show you how it works these are using turtle so basically turtle is a graphic uh tool library that you can use with a python where you can create you know graphics uh putting like pictures and stuff like that like a pen kind of like in scratch you use pen to draw so in python you use the turtle library okay so once you get into here okay once you log in here you can click home here after you click home you can see this new trinket so you can click that down these ones are locked so you have to actually pay for them so for now we're going to use python the the basic one um you know maybe later we can go into like using pycharm ideas and i'll show you at the end of the video so uh for now we'll go to here okay once you go in here um you know all the uh project usually you start with is the hello world project uh so that's what we're going to do uh so this is our hello world project so in python um you can um you can just type in like print or something like let's say you want to print something on the screen right just say print and then you put hello world so let's say this is the uh this is your your code here on this side and this is kind of like the stage like imagine if you're doing scratch right this will be the left side will be the block right where you do the block and this is the stage on the right so you click on this run button so when you run it it will say hello world so whatever you type here the code here it will execute the code will be on this side okay so let's say we want to print you know let's say kids coding playground so we do that so the hello world will no longer be there right because we just replaced it right so if you run this again you'll see kids calling playground one here on the side here okay so let's say you know we want to try to learn like let's say we draw a little figure right so you can copy and paste right ctrl c ctrl v just highlighted let's say we draw the little dog okay okay so you can use a single quote or double quote in in here that's fine so we use single quote and you have to using code on this side okay and you can have a semicolon also at the end if you like um you know like java another one a little kind of language you always have semicolon in in python you know you might not need it that's fine but you can put it either way that's fine so in here let's say we want to make the little dog with the legs um we're going to put a space let's say oops i want to pipe down okay something like this right so if i run this i will see like kids calling playground and then like a little dog figure right so let's try that so as you can see you can draw the little dog figure let's say we want to draw something like you know let's say we want to print a space right let's see okay let's say we print this and then we do something else at the bottom right let's say testing and we'll run this you see you can put a gap here right if you want to put a gap in between you can do that okay so let's say we want to draw something else like a little man so for this one okay let's say put an o here right i'm still putting a double chord i guess that because i'm uh i work in java so that's my background so we usually use double quote so um but either way it will work so let's say you do the little man so for this since uh this on this one is this escape character so if you want to print something called escape character like a slash here it's forward slash you have to have actually two slash in the in the front okay and then let's say we do one and then we do a back slash here okay so this is like we're trying to make the hand right for the uh for the low man so we're gonna put one more here we'll put the feet okay i'm gonna delete this we'll put a space and then we have to use the slash again here okay so when we run this actually you will only see one okay and then here you only see one as well so let's say we run this right oh you see i haven't lined up my main the head let me do that one space one space okay and run it again so if you can see kind of like a little man right also uh it's pretty cool uh in scratch okay so uh let's say you want to do some kind of uh like numbers you can add numbers but also it's one cool thing in python you can actually uh like let's say you have a symbol and you want to like create a bunch of symbol you can actually do this like print and then let's say we want to put the uh the ascent right the send is all you remember then we did one of the video with the uh with the coin matching game so you say oh zero one six two so it actually creates a send symbol let's say we want the cent we want like five of these then you can say multiply with a star and then you say five so when you actually run this so the semicolon at the end is optional you can put it or not it doesn't matter uh so in python you just have to indent if you want to be like in the loop or something we'll go into that next time so let's let's run this so you see actually create five of the cents so actually pretty cool so uh even though it's like you thought it would be a multiplication but uh somehow he actually understand that so if you're using this symbol with this five you're actually trying to create five of these guys so let's say we want print let's do one right one let's say one plus four let's see what happened so you see you can add it up and if you actually do a multiply with the let's say five times two right let's make one here let's run this so we actually put 10 you see that so this is multiplication right addition and then this actually creates five of the symbols so this is like your little uh introduction to python but you can do a lot of stuff like like using the turtle library we can go into like you can put like a stem i like similar to scratch you can stamp icon on the screen and uh in pycharm also like i have a pycharm also loaded so this is like taichung i'll run this program for you this is like using turtle with the color and you can actually make some shapes here so you could run let's run the app i actually have it on the other side how to bring it over so as you can see uh actually uh i had to bring this uh window over it's actually on the other side so as you can see uh using this turtle library you can actually mix color and then you can look to this color um different color here and then you have uh keep on drawing this other little hexagon you know with the color so it's pretty cool i mean this is like one of the things that you could do and then you can draw some turtle and other little things all right so we'll stop here for now and um okay so we'll stop here for now and uh thanks for um you guys for watching and please like share and subscribe to our channel and i will create more uh you know a python video later on okay all right guys see you guys next time you
