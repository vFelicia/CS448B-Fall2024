welcome back guys to kids coding playground today we'll be doing another tutorial on scratch we're doing the easter egg hunt part two so we just recently bought a new mic um to go with their setup so we can make higher quality videos so if you can tell difference um from the mic from before and now please let us know in the comment section below if it's better or worse we really want some feedback so we're right now using the hyperx quadcast it's a pretty good mic i think so without further ado let's get started on our project so right from where we left off last time we're doing the player right so right here instead change ghost effect i'm going to set ghost effect um it doesn't really matter after i delete it but i'm just still gonna you can change that if you want and then next we have our uh broadcast so we're gonna broadcast a few messages from here so basically what we want is when you click the right or left arrow keys error a little arrow will come out um pointing to the direction and like flashing telling that which direction you're going to so we're going basically we're just going to get a broadcast we're going to broadcast right here we're gonna broadcast a message we're gonna name it move right and then the next one we're gonna do this is left arrow so we're gonna do broadcast move left we'll use these broadcasts later once we work on the arrows and then right here we have the hide arrow if you're not pressing down any button then we have to hide the arrow height arrow so here we have the broadcast we're going to be using them after now let's go into our ground sprite so this is the like the scrolling background scrolling around so we're going to get coding in here so first we're going to get a one green fly clicked let me zoom in so we're going to make it go to the middle at first so the first background is going to go to 0 0 and then we're going to do a when i receive setup so when i receive setup uh we are going to wait 0.1 seconds so then basically we want the eggs to show up in the front so we're going to wait a little bit then we're going to go to the front layer after go to front and then right after that we're gonna have to make two variables for the sprite so uh we're going to have to name them uh we're gonna make them for the sprite only so we're gonna do x for the sprite only and then we'll also make a variable called y and for the spray only okay and then next we're going to set x and y set x to zero y to zero and then after that we're gonna switch the costume to one one so this is the first one all right and then next we're gonna define two custom blocks so we're gonna make a custom block so remember in our group patch tutorial on the scrolling platformer like how he taught that you can place the clones in a certain direction a certain place like in our scrolling platformer tutorial um we basically we put the bat like the scrolling background in a certain spaces it's like we're going to use this custom block to place the backgrounds so we're basically going to write make a one custom block we're going to place clone at okay and then we're going to make two inputs so one is gonna be x and one is gonna be y so here we have it and then we're gonna click okay so here we have defined this so we're gonna set the x right here so we're gonna set the x to x so this we're going to get a multiplication so we're going to set the x to this x times 480 because the width of each ground right here on each costume is 480 pixels so we're going to do 480. and then next we're going to set the y to the y so we're going to drag this right here we have the y and then we're going to get a go to so basically we're going to make this ground go to the x and y all right and then next we're going to create a clone of myself so basically this is going to create a clone in this place so we're going to create a clone so this is just drawing the ground like cloning the grounds so we're going to create clone of myself and then we're going to go next costume so we're going to go next costume because we want to go down the costume list so make the ground look different and then next we have another custom block this is the position of it so we're going to make a block we're going to position and then we're going to make two inputs x and y so we have two of those and then click ok we're going to define it so to find it we're going to start off by saying go to the x and y x and y and then so basically if the x is we're gonna do if else so it's if it's equal to if the x is equal to the x position if x is equal to the x position then we're gonna show it else we're gonna hide it show else we're gonna hide so what this code basically means in simple terms is it's basically adjusting the ground to where the player is so they can continue scrolling and then so next we're going to get a when i receive resets so i receive reset we're going to delete this clone so when you reset the thing it's going to delete all the clones and one more thing we're going to get a this is the scrolling of the thing so we're going to get a when i receive move ground um when i receive move ground we are going to get the position and then we're going to do x minus the scroll x so we're gonna get minus so we can hear the variables x minus square x g square x and then zero for the y okay and here we're going to place the clones so basically we're just going to place them x1 apart because the width is 480 so we just want to make them all attached to one thing so unlike the scrolling platformer we made like separate platforms so they're not attached we want to make them all attached together so we're going to get a place clone at and then we're just going to do 0 0 for the first one and then we're just going to increase the x by 1 every single time so we're going to put this over here and then we're gonna just duplicate this so we're gonna make it one and then we can just duplicate this two three duplicate all that four five six seven i believe we have uh eight costumes which is basically yeah so you have eight so we have to clone eight times so and then next we're gonna hide the sprites after we're gonna hide the sprite after it's done cloning and then we're gonna set the x of it to negative 9999 because we want it off the screen basically so we're gonna set it to looks like something like that okay so now we have our scripts for our ground let's run the game let's start it okay so as you can see the scrolling is working we're using the arrow keys to move around and as you can see the background is scrolling along so let's get to the end so yes basically it for the background so i mean the ground so that's what it is now let's get a backdrop so we're gonna go to the backdrop and we're gonna draw it okay so to draw our backdrop we're going to draw like a blue sky and then we're going to have a sun in the top corner and then it's going to shoot a shine like a ray down here so it looks bright so we're going to make the background look a bit better so what we're going to do is basically just get a square so we're gonna get a light blue color about like this bright and then we're gonna get this shade and then here we're gonna get white so it's gonna look something like this oh no no outline uh so we're gonna hide the outline actually let's adjust it a little bit maybe let's not make the whites uh maybe let's turn up let's make it a little bit let's make it a really light blue maybe that will make it look a little bit better this one let's make it darker okay so i think this should make it look better now let's draw our rectangle okay so it looks pretty good so here we have it and then we're gonna get import a sprite so we're going to go into the sprite library i think there is a sun in here yes this one so what we're going to do is just copy this uh that group it ctrl c and then we're going to go in the background ctrl v we're just going to put it in the top right about like right here yeah about right here and then we're just going to delete the sun sprite and then one last thing we're going to draw a circle basically with the middle like yellow and the outside is no nothing so we're gonna get this thing and then we're gonna swap this we're gonna make it really light yellow a light yellow no outline and then right here we're gonna uh this one we can just swap it and then this one we just put nothing so here we have like a really light yellow so we can just draw a circle kind of like that hold down shift so we get perfect circle so something like that maybe move right here so as you can see it looks like the sun is actually kind of shining down so it basically just makes your game look a much better so here we have our background so there let's play it yeah as you can see it makes the game look much better with that backdrop okay let's save the project let's do the uh background scrolling now so this is like the scrolling background so like this is the ground right and then behind this will have another background that scrolls a bit slower so it makes the game look much better so some of this code is similar so we're just gonna drag and drop some of this code inside so inside the ground so we're just going to zoom out one time so i can show you guys all the code if you've missed anything then you can put it down now all right so i'm just going to drag in some of this code that we need so we're going to use this one please clone at the position we're gonna have to obviously change some of this stuff but it will work when i uh change some of it up and then we're gonna get the reset when green flag is clicked and then we'll get this entire chunk as well but obviously i have to change some of it up so let's get started on that right here on the position we're just going to get x y go to x y and then we're just going to show um because you're not going to be scrolling with the player it's just going to be scrolling when you're moving to the right or left it will just scroll with the other ground so place clones x y we can keep all of this except for the next costume because there is only one costume and then next right here 125 clicks we'll just go like this and then we'll hide reset delete this clip and then here in the setup we take out the weight 1.1 seconds so we're gonna go to the front layer right uh no go to back layer sorry so we have to go to the back layer because this is like the background behind everything so we're gonna go we're gonna put this after so set x y and then we're gonna hide and then i'm just gonna switch the costume to bg scrolling and then we're gonna make it go to the back layer and some of it is gonna be different so basically what we're gonna do is we're going to make a clone like this and then maybe we're going to flip it 90 degrees so then the rock is on this side and the tree is on this side um so it will make me make the game look a little bit more variation so basically it's going to be reversed everything is just going to be flipped over 90 degrees or negative 90 degrees so it just makes the game look a little bit better have more variety in your background so by doing this we're just going to do a point direction of 90. place a clone at zero zero and then we're going to point direction of negative 90. and then after that we're gonna place a clone at one zero so basically we're only gonna have two of them so we're gonna make the background scroll much slower than everything else i forgot to zoom in so here is it all zoomed in and then right here we're going to get the hide i don't know why i deleted that we actually still need that and after that after that we're going to set the x to negative 9999 so we can move this backdrop off the screen once it's done okay we can delete all this and then next we're going to get a when i receive move ground so remember the broadcast and receive move run we're going to use that right now so basically we're going to get the position of it we're going to get the position so we're going to the x minus the round of scroll x divided by 10. so basically this means that it's going to be scrolling onetenth of the speed as the ground so we're going to get this so we're going to get a minus sign so subtract so we're going to get round as well so then we want uh whole integers so we're going to get an x minus the round of g scroll x divided by 10 so it's going to scroll one tenth of the speed as the ground so we want to make the background just scroll a bit slower so we're going to get a g scroll x divide by 10 and then we're just going to get the y and put that in here so i think that should be it let me zoom out let me put everything together and let's zoom out okay let's save the project and let's run it so as you can see you're moving right as you can see the backdrop right there you can see it is moving in the backdrop there's like a backdrop behind this backdrop as you can see it's kind of flipped right here see the two rocks uh you see there's like a rock right here there's a rocket there it's because we flipped it 90 degrees to give the game a little bit more variation so you only need two clones for this one so yeah that's pretty much for this part two of this series we worked on the ground and the background scrolling for this uh tutorial this is part two of the easter egg hunt um we're gonna make one more parts for the eggs and you win so and the arrows i almost forgot about that so thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share and
