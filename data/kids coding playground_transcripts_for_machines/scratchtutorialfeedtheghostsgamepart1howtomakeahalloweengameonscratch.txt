welcome back guys it's kingston playground here and today we're back for another video called be feed the ghost game so we are making another halloween game because it's almost halloween this time you're the player who tries to throw candies and feed the ghosts if you are able to feed 10 ghosts with 20 candies that you have then you win the game else you will lose feed the ghost game we'll be learning these following concepts in scratch variables broadcast messages loops switch costume learn to get x and y position for sprite and touching sprite so i'll be demoing this game let's full screen it so i play some music in the background and as you can see there's like a little um bullseye thing that moves around and that glides around and there's ghosts always flying around and you try to feed the ghost and it says got it if you feed a ghost and says got it and then makes like a chomp noise and then if you miss it says it laughs at you like it's um laughing at you because you missed and and you just keep on feeding them until you get ten and then you win or you lose yeah so i'm gonna try to lose here i actually might win i see it when you get 10 um it says you won so yeah if you run out of candies and you don't score 10 points you lose obviously so let's start a new project so before i start please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below for what else videos you want so i do have some things in my backpack let's just first delete this scratch cap i have some things in my backpack so there's um backdrop i got online so it's called halloween bg3 and it's from free pick so links in the description you can definitely check that out this is a really cool website where you can get backdrops and sprites for things so yeah it's really cool it's called free pick so you can go there so i already have the backdrop done for myself so i'll actually show you how to do it so you just have to um put hover your mouse here gotta upload backdrop then you gotta click this and it'll open as you can see it's not big enough so you gotta convert to vector and you can make it larger how large you want it to be so so we can make this larger as you can see that's basically how you do it but i'm just going to delete this so anyways um let's get to the code so we will have the candy and bullseye it's in the links in the description so i'm gonna drag the candy and i'm gonna drag the bullseye and let's get coding so first i'm just gonna go to the backdrop and do the sounds that's simple enough and green flag is clicked forever loop and you gotta choose your sound so sound and i use dance snare beat so you can use any sound you want if i use dance snare beat i think it's called dancing beat yep and um play sound dance snare beat until done so the sound is done so i'm going to work on the bullseye next so i'm going to work on the bullseye next um so when the green flag is clicked so i'm gonna zoom in a little bit when the green flag is clicked it will set size to a hundred percent it already is a hundred but it will go to the front layer so you can see it in the front it'll show and it'll go to a position so let's just make it go to maybe let's keep it here but let's go forever glide one second two have to glide somewhere so let's say around here so um the bullseye sprite you could just make the bullseye sprite around the moon like here here here here and the ghost is always flying around so you can like glide to wherever you want your bull's eye like up here all the way here so i already have the written coordinates for myself so it's glide one second to x 110 and y eighty i also have another one glide one second to negative 110 and positive 45 and then glide one second to 110 45 so you can you don't have to follow the exact coordinates it'll just zigzag around like around here you'll keep on zigzagging and then i also have glide one second to negative 110 and positive 10 y also i also have glide one second to x 110 y 10 and also um last one glide the x negative 110 and you can change this one to 0.5 0.5 seconds and eighty so those are my written coordinates so yeah so i'm just gonna close down the backpack right here and i'm gonna show it to you as you can see there's like the bullseye zigzagging all around the moon and yeah so when i'm gonna make some variables so i have to make variable candy the variable mist so it will tell if you missed one of the ghosts a variable another variable x and the last variable y so the x and y variables are for when i fire my candy it'll go to that position x and y so of the bullseye so yeah um and we also need to code a little bit so when the green flag is clicked clear graphic effects i'll go forever set x set x to x position so it's in sensing x position right here that's actually in motion sorry x position and um set y to y position and also change color effect by 20. it's actually optional but if you want to make it change color it'll flash and flash and flash so change color effect by 20. so i'll just show it to you as you can see it's moving and it's changing to beautiful colors so yeah so in my backpack i also have the cloud so there's actually um some details in the background if you did not see earlier there's actually some clouds going around up and down around the place so yeah so we're going to coat the clouds next so it has a hunk of code so we can code that so when the green flag is clicked i have a go to negative 50 y 129 so and i have written coordinates so so it is precise so forever repeat twice and wait 0.4 seconds and i can also change this 130 because i have written coordinates so and it's also even so and wait 0.4 seconds change y by negative one and also you need to repeat duplicate this but it's just a little bit different so you gotta put this under not inside or also will not work under that thing but still in the forever loop so it's two 0.4 seconds and it's positive one instead so it'll just go up and down so i'll show you see it's going up and down it's a really good detail so yeah and also we can also code the ghost so i think we do have time for the ghost so ghost is actually in the sprite library ghost and when the green flag is clicked so i'm going to set his rotation style to left right right here click on this and when the green flag is clicked set size to 45 because i think he's a little bit too big so it's too easy to get the score and then switch costume to ghost d so i'm pretty sure ghost d is this costume of him running around so yeah and it'll go to i do have coordinates so i'll go to 0 20. it really doesn't matter actually but i do have coordinates so i was using them so anyways it will repeat 5 times so it'll create five ghosts so there's a create clone of myself oh repeat it five times so there's gonna be five different ghosts and then oh hi they'll hide the original ghost because the original one will be still there and the clones will be moving around so when i start as a clone it will go to random position so right here oh show because it is probably hidden it might be hidden and it will go forever if then and you hit and operator touching candy candy so the end so i'm gonna move a little bit to the right and then and me equals operator and then do miss so misses for later use and then ready to end because when you throw a candy and it actually misses a ghost and a ghost just passes by the candy and it will still count points so this is how you control it and it will not count points so and then no switch costume to go see so the ghostie is going to be like eating the candy let's see go see silk eating the candy and wait one second it'll hide and do not put it here and put it inside here it'll wait another second and i'll switch costume to the running ghost so ghosty it'll show so you remember it's hiding your show so not inside the block you need a point in direction so the next script of code we're doing is making um the ghost fly around so then it'll point to the left or point to the right and it'll fly around in that direction so point in direction pick random negative 90 to 90. it will also glide so this next script of code is to make the ghost and so it won't fly everywhere and only fly around the moon so pick random 0.5 and one second to x pick random negative 125 to 125 okay so and also you also need another pick random 110 to negative 110 i know if if it's on edge if it's on the edge go about i don't think we actually need the if on edge bounce because it's not even gonna be on the edge so i'm gonna show you the game so i'm gonna show you the game as you can see there's uh the bulls eyes flying everywhere the ghosts are flying everywhere that's really cool so we will be doing the candies later so in part two so there will be a part two so yeah please like share subscribe again and comment in the comment section below and also see you guys next time
