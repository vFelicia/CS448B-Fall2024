welcome back guys it's kids coding playground here and today we're back for another video so this is a space invader game so i'll show you in a minute but first i have to ask you about easter so easter i know um people still do easter hunting i'm pretty sure i don't know i haven't done easter hunting in six years so i don't really know um so easter hunting yeah i'm pretty sure some people still do that so come in the comment section below if you did easter hunting so it's great if you did so anyways let's get started so this is going to be the demo look there's scrolling stars on the background it's just a really cool thing for some stars and then there's a start button and there's arrows for switching so first you can click on this just to change the skin to this this this plenty of skins you can even use previous so you might go back there's a bunch of skins to choose from you guys can be creative i tried to go creative and color them random so it's a lot of skins i made so yeah so you just toggle these arrows to change to have your skin and click the start button so use the arrow keys to move you go up and down so i'm going so you see my shield in the top right i'm losing shield whenever i touch something it says you lost and oh yeah so whenever they touch something if you haven't noticed they change the color effect to make some extra detail like if you ever play minecraft and you hit something they have they turn the mob red so that's basically what we're doing so so here look you can shoot the lasers in the space key and then we'll kill the monsters so as you can see my score is going up right now so this is great uh and you can just go in the comments of my video or in my scratch project and comment what your high score was so you can go up down side right left up down so there's a lot of functions so anyways let's get started so first things first is to start out strong so first byebye second open backpack so i'm known for opening my backpack because that's how i am because i can't draw all of these in one video or else you'll be watching a time lapse of me drawing random spaceships so there's a bunch of costumes on this one so i already have all that you don't have to copy our costumes completely like this and this i just made up so so um you can get this one from the sprite library this one's from scratch too so we've been doing scratch for quite a while these are from scratch too this one we just downloaded from online so i'm gonna show you how to do it so i'm gonna go rocket ship so you need to go to costumes i bet all of you guys know how to do this you guys are great coders so you just have to do this bam bam bam bam just color it like the amount you want like what's your favorite color you can just color your spaceship that so it can be red it can be blue it doesn't matter what it would be because it depends on what your favorite color is so you could make this tip no block anymore because there's a starry background like i'm not red people like pink pinkish so look we made a spaceship this is alien activity so yeah so guys let's work on getting the rest of the sprites in so we have the alien we have the space oh we already got that we have the background which is the scroll and we have to get the right and left arrow keys so you just need one one of these and a start button which is just this button and we just write star on it so do that white text start put in the middle and then there you go a star button and then now we have to work on the start button first because that's how it codes everything and that's how you start everything okay so um i'm gonna put one arrow over here one arrow over here so they're both turning to the right just change the direction like that 90 is great so yeah really simple just make one pointing right and one pointing left and then move the start button to the middle i just like it up there looks cool so i'm going to go in the backdrop make a black backdrop so just this and black so just drag this and then it will fit in so now we have a black backdrop this is when all the stuff starts but first we gotta make the start button so don't get too excited on what we're gonna do oh that's gonna upgrade the laser laser so a lot of you wasn't asking me in rock blaster how do you get the laser where is the laser so where is the laser oh my god where's the laser so and so people are asking for where is the laser so you actually have to listen really really closely you see this right here it's button two so button two you should do the button two b and this is how you make the laser and you rename it the laser okay so that's how you guys make the laser but first we're gonna start on arrow one which is the one pointing to the left um so arrow one pointing to the left i mean yeah yeah running to the left so this one's gonna be pointing to the left so i'm gonna code this up so the green clock is clicked it will show so uh it'll switch this sprite sprite collect no broadcast go to previous previous costume so this will make it go back a costume so this is really tricky i didn't get this on my first try either so i'm pretty sure some of you guys are great coders out there and you guys can probably get there because oh wow put two o's go to previous costume and then then you also yeah start button right to start on the start button so sorry about that guys as you do it then this it'll go to zero zero which is just the middle i don't know i dragged it over there you just do that and then you go show and then when this right click this is the most important script that all this code so do not skip this part so when this right clicked broadcast new message start okay so start is going to be our key block here broadcast here so you have to have this because this is where it starts everything so some people sometimes skip the video so then they can get the parts for the code but this is really important hide and start it'll hide that's all you have and then i'm gonna go back to arrow one so when i receive so when i receive start hide so hide so that's for arrow one and then arrow two is pointing to this side so i'm gonna make a row two like this so when i receive start then it will hide once you're done selecting your skin and then when this is clicked it'll go to next costume so we gotta make a new message called go to next costume and then we're gonna do when the green vlog is clicked it will show so we're done with the arrows and the start button so now we gotta work on the spaceship for the skins and then we gotta work on the backdrop about the um scrolling so so when the green flag is clicked for the spaceship then it'll switch costume to space invaders because i honestly like this costume the best because it's from the internet yeah remember watch our google drive video because some people don't know how to download their google drive and we yeah just go to our channel and then get it and remember don't use your school account so basically we'll have everything on the google drive if you don't know how just go to my shared project export all the images and that's great that's that's also uh also a pretty good strategy as well so i'm going to switch this to space invaders because honestly the my favorite you know clear graphic effects because whenever you get hit it will change the color so so i want to clear all graphic effects set size to 40 percent set rotation style left right so it will not turn around when it moves up down right left whatever no goes hill zero never oh no here's already have another position and i gotta make variables but first i gotta yeah make variables so score of course uh and shield so shield i'm gonna drag shield to this side because that's how i even out my variables all the time so when i receive start oh so it says shield to something i didn't even put it here yet so set score to zero shield to 100 you can make a thousand if you want to a billion it depends on you so next we're gonna make the skins so whenever when i receive go to next costume then it'll go to next costume that's obvious and then so this is the tricky part for the previous costumes so please do not skip this part as well they got a previous costume and then said switch costume to costume number minus one costume number minus one because you have to go to the previous costume because if i'm on space invaders you'll go to this blue rocket and if you click the previous button again it'll go to this rocket and then this rocket so so you got to do when i received go to previous costume so yeah so i'm going to do the when i start here so when i start oh my god still in that forever loop so when i start it will go forever why is it always highlighted for some reason it doesn't matter it's not doing anything to affect me so if an edge bounce and then you need it if then key right arrow clicked press same thing then it will change x by 10 and you just duplicate that to make the left arrow which is 10 and then and then after that you're going to put the up arrow the thing the thing that you gotta change the y instead of x so so up arrow it will change y and then down arrow will be negative y negative 10 y and then that's down arrow so and then now we have to work on the background so this is about the scroll on the stars so i'm going to show you how it works first so so as you can see you can select your skin so i'm going to select the skin you can previous buttons also working so i'm going to suck this skin and then you can click the start button nothing happens yet but you can move around and then we haven't fixed the galaxy things yet so yeah this is basically what we have right now and now we're going to work on the background the background so i'm going to change the name of this from untitled 13 to um space ship add spaceship i think this is it okay so this adventure game okay so same sorry game um so now let's do the backdrop so this is how you do the backdrop so you just do a black screen and you got to make star so are obviously not going to use this one because that's how it is you make a circle and use the reshape tool to shape this thing up see how this looks like a star right so great we just have to duplicate these and then make a lot of them around so ctrl c ctrl v but do not put them up too close or else you'll cut a star in half because if you put them up there a new a new clone is coming down already so if you put one up there one of the stars will probably be cut off so just scatter them around the place so try to put it around there don't put it up okay well you can if you want to but chances are they will get cut off so let's talk about the coding for background so let's just delete sprite one and then i'm gonna go to the background and it'll work on the code so when the green flag is clicked it will go to back layer uh where's that go to back layer yeah this one so go to back layer it'll go to x00 i'll create clone of myself i'll go forever taking the laggy forever again and then you need if then else so if then uh the y position is greater than negative 340 then it will change y by minus three so it will go down slowly so change y by and then it will go to x three fifty and then now we have to do what i start as a clone so when i start as a clone go to x350 just this and then go to back layer this right here back layer and i'll go forever to laggy forever but i can just take that from here again so it's basically the same code it is the same code never mind and then that's how it is so look a scrolling background is coming down this looks nice right and there's the start button you can switch your skins around previous button let's select this skin i don't know why let's start you can move around so we haven't coded much yet but i'll see you guys in the second part because we're obviously having a second part of this already 18 minutes and 32 seconds 33 now 34 now 35 now so same thing yeah seconds past really quickly so anyways please like share subscribe and comment what you had did for easter and april fool's day what funny pranks you did we obviously did not do a prank we we faced revealed on april fools it was a real face reveal guys it was a real it was real my brother just tripped that's it we're gonna make another one next april so
