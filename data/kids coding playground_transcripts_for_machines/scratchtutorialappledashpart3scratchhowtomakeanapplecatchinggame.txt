hello and welcome back to kids coding playground today we'll be finishing up the third part for the apple dash game i think we'll have another part or so maybe two more parts for this game today we'll be working on the shop button and other stuff and so yeah so we're going to review from last time we did this game so this is the code for the player for the last time and this is the bomb that's the bomb this is the hp move this here and we have the basket fruit this one is the fruit and feel free to pause the video to put anything you missed from the last video so and then this is the begin button coin the coin yeah so that's the coin and hit box okay all right so today we're gonna be working on the shop all right so i got my shop button from my um backpack from here so i got the shop buttons really simple so all i did is just draw a circle and put the money symbol in it um so yeah that's what we're going to do the money button so in the money button we're going to start with a win grid flight clicked one more okay so when profile clicks we want to hide the button so in the beginning let's hide that uh and after that uh when i receive end game so i'm gonna receive end game so we're going to go to the front layer so once they lose we want to show the shop button to let them have opportunity to go to the shop so when i save end game we're going to go to the front layer and i'm gonna show yeah i think this should be a good place for the button to stay so i'm gonna get this x 115 y negative one one one and then i'm gonna show and i'm going to make it so when you hover your mouse over it it'll make it bigger and smaller so in the beginning we're going to set the size to 100 all right and after that we're going to get a forever loop so forever uh forever we're gonna change the size as you can see change the size we're gonna change the size by 100 minus the size which is 500 of this thing divided by five so 500 divided by five is 100 so 100 minus 100 is zero so in the beginning i'm just going to change it by that so we're gonna get the subtract and division so put the subtract uh like put the division into the second one and do that and through that we're going to put 100 in the first one we're going to subtract the size this block size so you can show it it's going to show the size of the shot button and we're going to divide it by five and after that if touching mouse pointer so we're gonna make it get bigger when it touches the mouse pointer so we're gonna get if touching mouse pointer uh then we're going to change i'm going to duplicate this we're going to change the size by 150 instead of 100 right and we're going to get another if then segment if uh we're going to touching mouse pointer and mouse down so if you're clicking on the shot button so if touching mouse pointer and mouse down to make sure that the player is actually clicking on it so we're going to mess down as well and then we're going to set the brightness to negative 10 so make it let's add a little effect to it so make it less bright effects brightness effect to negative 10 with that and then we're going to wait until the mouse is down before continuing into the next step wait until mouse down and after that we're going to broadcast a message called shop to let a script know that they're entering the shop so let's name it shop and we're going to show the variable money in case it's hidden oh actually i hit i showed it right there and actually this should be an if i'll statement i forgot to put this in if else because if else we're gonna set the brightness is zero so if else like that so if it's doing the if you click on it then it'll happen to this if you're not clicking on it we're going to set the brightness back to normal which is zero set the brightness back to zero okay like that and right here when i receive start screen when oops when i receive start screen uh start screen then we are going to hide and stop other scripts in the sprite so we want it to only show when you come up okay stop other scripts in this sprite other and when i receive start game start game we're going to hide and when i receive shop we're going to hide because you're entering the shop and you want to hide it okay so we're basically finished with the coding in the shop and now let's go back to the begin button so in the begin button we have to add something so i'm going to get a when i receive shop shop and we're going to duplicate this hide and stop other scripts in the sprite so yeah that's what we're going to do and let's try it out so i'm gonna lose on purpose right now so in my original game i duplicated the bomb so more bombs would fall down as you can see it shows up and when you hover your mouse it goes over it and as you can see when you click on it nothing happens because we didn't do anything with it yet so we're gonna make a new backdrop called the um shop backdrop so it's just a backdrop i got from the sprite library but i just uh i mean the um backdrop library but i made it into a sprite so we're actually going to choose a new backdrop i think i yeah jurassic this is the one i used okay i'm gonna use jurassic so what we want to do is go to the backdrop select the entire thing group it and copy paste ctrl c paint a new sprite and ctrl v then this will go into here and we can delete that i'm going to hide this for now i'm going to name it the shop background shop backdrop shot back drop let's move your name in so in the shop backdrop so once you click it it will switch to this backdrop because i want to make it different than the original one so when i receive shop in the shop backdrop we're coding here we're gonna go to zero zero which is the middle zero zero and we're going to show it and we're gonna make it go to front layer and then go backwards 10 layers go backwards i'm not really sure what this is necessary for but i put this in my original game so let's see what happens with it so this is the code i had so when i receive shop we're gonna activate all of this and then in the beginning we're also gonna when we go in the shop i'm gonna hide the variable score and then we're also gonna hide the variable high score my cloud variable and i also not want to hide the variable force field which we don't have i'm pretty sure but i put it there because um later when we can buy force fields we're going to have to do that okay and then i'm going to get a one green flag clicked when i when i collect we're going to hide the variable money so we only want to show the money in the shop and hide in the beginning and um when i receive start game then we're going to show the variable money and hide some start game money and hide so we're going to hide after this and when i receive endgame we're going to show them as well we're going to show the variable bunny show variable money okay so there we have our shop background money uh thing so i'm gonna lose on purpose and show you that it switches the bathroom to this once you get to the shop okay hopefully so now the shop appears click on it switches the shop backdrop and shows you the money of how much money you have left as you can see so the reason we hide the money in the beginning is to hide it in here so the beginning a starting screen looks a bit more fresh and then when you start this will happen up again then there will show so yes that's what we want we also want an exit button okay so exit button so when you get to the shop we probably want to exit button so you can go back to the game the home page so in the exit button i am going to get it for my backpack okay so i just got my exit button for my backdrop so for this one i just got an image from online like this exit thing and inserted it into a circle with color to make it look better um you guys can make this yourself it's pretty simple or you can even just draw an arrow with a circle or something like that but i just got this image png from online and threw a circle around it's really simple um so this is the exit button let's go to the code for the exit button let's go to 100 clicks in the beginning and hide so we'll hide the exit button and when i receive start game we want to hide this as well and then i want to receive shop so when you're in the shop then we want this to go to the front layer where is it that looks like a perfect spot for the thing as well probably because i got in the backpack it automatically positions it for me so this is the spot i had it originally so i'm just gonna make it go to this position it looks like a good spot to me i'm gonna show set the size to 100 because i'm going to make it big and small so remember this code right here from this thing drag and drop this right here yeah that okay you might have to change some code okay so this can be kept as normal this can be kept except we can have to take out this shop thing and then in this script and the if statement right here we're going to set the hit bomb to no so you can't get hit by bombs to make sure that the player is not getting hit by a bomb inside the shop so i'm going to set it to no and i'm going to show the variable money pretty sure we showed it in the other one but i'm going to do it again just in case and i'm going to start broadcast start game because you're going back so when they click on you you want it to go back to the home page so that's what this thing does all right see this is the code pretty simple okay so we have finished our exits right so now let's try it out something got messed up and this thing got really big because i have to set this to 100. okay so i found the mistake i did on the button that made it really big as you can see so what you have to do is actually in the shop i did it like this but in the button it has to be like this so as you can see it has to be like holds up okay yeah so let's go back to exit so you want to make it this subtract here you want to make this into the first section of the divide as you can see there's a difference this one is subtracting this divided by this but this is the opposite this is subtracting and then dividing like that so we're going to do that so we want to reverse it put this into the first and then you got that so now let's show you let me hide the size okay chop as you can see it goes to the backdrop and as you can see the button works now you click it you go back to the beginning right here so yeah that's what we want so it's little things like this that can actually make a difference inside the game so yeah that's basically today's tutorial on apple dash part 3 so today we worked in the shop backdrop the actual shop button and the exit button so yes that's what we have for today thank you guys for watching don't forget to like
