welcome back guys and welcome back to another video and today we're doing another video it's called tower Smasher today we will be making this game the objective of this game is to launch the ball to hit the blocks that are stacked together the less launches you use the more points you will get tower Smasher you can find this game idea and the books called code your own games 20 games to create with scratch it's a very cool book that you can use so you can absolutely check out the book so we will be learning these following concepts in scratch there is variables loops touching color pen and broadcasting messages so before I start please like share and subscribe to our channel to support us if you did thank you for your support so I mean and you can also share it with your friends that'd be awesome so I'll just demo the game right now let's put a full screen as you can see when I started has some music and then you have a ball and an arrow and like the arrow there's like a pen surrounding it and then you supposed to shoot the ball and collects 19 score Nobi for the next shot and Sabatini and so on obviously as you can see I was 18 and if you run out of watches which I'm 20 so much I'd get all these so as you can see I scored 116 let's stop the project and let's create a new project so I already have things built for me like the blocks in the backdrop and stuff so it's right in the backpack I can load the sprite I just forgot something a block block and then we can also load the backdrop in so there you go we can also delete the cat before we go on so I'll demonstrate how you throw the backdrop so um we can check this one out I'm gonna try to draw it for you guys so first we got to make the square I mean the rectangle you can drop whatever you want I'm gonna enlarge it and Center it so we can also change the feel of it to fade in or out whatever you call it and then the green spots can be white that look pretty well so as you can see all you can look at the backdrop it's white on the bottom and blue on the top so you can also add the grass and the dirt third so I had the dark green color so I'm gonna draw the earth next the dirt mound so we can duplicate it ctrlc and ctrlv like a normal copy paste and then we can also put it down then we can just change the color so I just zoomed in for better so you can see it better we can take the fill or we just use whatever that color is the brown color so I just did that we don't need the fade in and out for this one we can just do the normal deal then we can just take that so as you can see there's two colors green and brown so if there aren't that I'm good looking you can also use the group tool it's all the way up here and you can group these two together as you can see it moves both of them but normally it would not let's delete on this one because we already have this one already out and uh you I didn't teach you how to draw the block it's just easy it's just two rectangles basically you can just group them and you can make them more closer to each other that's basically how you do it also I'm gonna get my sprites you know so paint and you paint a new one i'ma show you take the eyedropper see if you did not know that you can actually think eyedropper type of thing then I can make like a small block well it's really small right now to make it larger and as we did we can do control C and control V to make the other shulk you just put this on the bottom or top doesn't matter and then change the color of the top one you use the arrow keys to move adjust it you can change the color of that as you can see it's pretty even gonna change it to a lighter green it's around the same color yeah so as you can see there's two blocks and then you can also group them together and make them more easier to it can group them to make it easier to move since I already have one I can delete this one okay so let's get our sprites you need the arrow arrow and we're gonna make eight variables Bob we can make the variable block count all speed each gap HP launches score V that and V speed but we can just rename this one these so these are all the things we can hide all of them except or we don't have to hide them right now but we can hide them later um those and these are all our variables so as you can see this sprites at a hundred percent I might turn it to fifty if that's too big s key so let's work on the grass block or the block we have to put the wall make a block create so let's zoom in set block count to zero in the beginning but we'll repeat 10 times create clone of myself I think it's actually in this one so I'll make up duplicates of itself and I'll change the block out by one for each one and then I'll hide and then when you start one flag is when the green flag is clicked that will show you know create the pile around this code so we're still in this code so when I start as a clone I'm that one can't move so let's move that up there that's right here so you can see it better it will set a little set fall speed to zero it'll go you need this one go and then pick random to pick randoms pick random 180200 and negative a hundred seventy and you need the vision so I'm sorry oh it's actually not pick random it's actually an ad negative 170 and this is actually a multiplied and multiplied not divided and then block count 35 so this pick random 188 200 is for like if it stacks like here and here and here and here announcer and then this is for making the bottom one is negative 170 and each other creates a block it will add 35 so we need a repeat until people sign a block out equals zero that's when basically win Locka equals zero they also needed if and then statement it's touching the ball because that's where the light used to person launch the ball at it and then hide Oh change the score by lunches so that's why you're supposed to you get more points if you get less lunches so lunches and then change the block count to minus one we'd also start the sound pop it you can is optional the binos is set the horizontal speed which is basically H speed horizontal speed a horizontal speed to multiply multiply negative zero point eight to eight speed horizontal speed and we need another ifthen statement if not you need or touching no I mean no I mean no you also need I'm not in front of that it's not and you also you're watching color so you actually have to select the bottom and the top color so let's use this one to talk to color and touching color I think this one's the same color I'm pretty sure she's a double check okay touching both of them and then it will change the full speed by zero negative Xue also change the why by all speed change Y by fall speed makes the blocks drop on top of each other and then we need a broadcast message all the way in the back okay assess it let's see what we got as you can see the blocks are falling on each other correctly but if they aren't falling on each other correctly it's probably because of the size or or the besides being adjust the size or the Y position because it's like 35 basically so if you turn it to 40 some light gets stuck in on tops let's see what happens see as you can see some got stuck on top so we can change that back to 35 depending on the block you either have to change the size or this in this so anyways thanks well we were working on the ball and the arrow on the next part so thanks for watching everyone and see you guys next time
