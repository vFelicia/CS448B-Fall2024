so welcome back guys to another tutorial on kids coding playground so today we'll be working on a tutorial on how to do the among us animation since we have many requests but before we get started we would like to share something with everyone so someone actually tried to copy one of our projects so videos so the first among us video got copied right here so you just don't so this person i think they downloaded it and then reuploaded it as their own which is against the youtube policy so i do not want any account and you can get banned you can get banned after like three strikes or something like that and we do not want anyone to get their youtube account banned so so just please don't copy anyone's videos at all so without further ado let's continue on to the video hand it over to my dad hello guys welcome back to the channel so we'll be working on the among us animation story um animated story so i think we have a lot of requests saying that they want to know how to do the tutorial so we'll kind of teach you guys step by step how to do this and then we will also upload our uh sprite that we can share with you on our google drive you can download and make your own among us animation story game okay so let's begin so for the among us animation animated story we'll be learning these following concepts in scratch variable loops podcast message custom sprite uh you can control the the uh science sprite uh with your with your key also and also animated animation with like player interactions so basically like you know when you when the story goes on you know you're able to uh control the science right where you could like do different special moves that will take out the crew so that's what we're going to do on this uh tutorial it might be multiple parts so i think it might take a while so i'll i'll try to do uh as much as i can to uh share you guys share with you guys how to do the uh animation okay all right let's get started okay so we're here the project so as my kid said regarding the copyright in youtube make sure you don't copy other people's uh video and reupload you can get in trouble for that so we do not want to see you like getting banned for that so yeah please don't take other people's work and then trying to upload as your create as your own so we should not do that okay other than that let's go on to the uh the game uh so what we are going to do is uh i'm going to share all these uh sprites with you uh we have drawn all these sprites uh some of them i got it online uh uh some of them we drew so um like that the door we drew that among us and sprite we did that the box we do that and then this one we drew that and then some other one we drew the cape and then these are recap from online and this is where they drop so there is a lot of different sprite here that to where to make so it took us a lot of time to to make this game uh so we do want to share to you guys so that all the kids can also learn right uh so once you get the sprite that you have with your game you can make a different story but for now we'll try to just um go with what we have so far and then um you know when you're watching the uh tutorial once you get a hang of it how to do animation then you can change your story as much as you like okay all right before we begin um please like share and subscribe to our channel that means a lot to us and give us a thumbs up and comment on the video below if you have any questions or whatever you'd like to say thanks okay so let me uh run the game once for you guys to see uh from the start to be in i think uh some of you guys already have seen the video of our game from you know the first episode second and third but uh at that time it's not completely done so now it's actually completely done i've fixed some of the code so that you're not able to you know perform certain action if you have not waited until the sprite finished talking so all those things have been fixed so let me run the game one time for you guys to see so this is kind of the among us uh like a band like a scratch firm page that you see before the game begin so when you start the game so you get to display this screen for a couple seconds and then they go into this so we added this ability so that you know the people know how to play the game so you have control of this uh uh science sprite you can move them around with left and right and then to open door you have to push the up arrow but uh since right now you cannot go in the door because you have not take out the red crew member here so you can use any of this ability here you don't have to use one right you can use two whatever it is it's fine and also we do we don't actually disable after you hit the first time you know you can actually uh you know you cannot kill me anymore right but we have not done that uh just so that you can play around with this uh you know you can actually hit it more than once so but you can actually do that if you like but um i will require a little bit more change to go but for now we actually don't have that so um if you want to let's say you want to take him out with the club you can just hit the one right or if you want to hit him with a laser you can hit two so anything you like let's say you get two and you get the laser and as you can see he kind of died the crew member here so at this point you can actually go into the door you can push the up arrow key and the door will open that little animation showing the door open and you go in so here same thing will show this uh kind of the ability for like the first three stage and after that we'll take it out so for here you can you know do anything you like you can use six as well so six is the whole so you hit that then you actually change into this costume here with the phone okay so you can go into the portal push up so once you go into the portal you see another crew member here he's doing something he's not really looking at you so let's say you want to do the doctor strange portal number five this one the big portal is only activated at the end of the game so actually this one doesn't you cannot activate seven so you can activate five if you use five then it will open a portal up on his head and pull more so for now we'll use four let's say use a lightsaber here so that change him into pixelated and then you can move on to the next stage so here let's say it doesn't show anymore so as you you remember you remember all the moves so number five is the portal let's try that so we change number five will actually change the customer for the cyan and then it kind of make him disappear okay so once you go into here so this is the first initially we actually have the voltage like this and later on we actually change it so for right now we are just going to always pick the gray one because the stories for the gray are getting kicked out the first time so we kind of put a great but you can do it randomized on the list so as you can see after finish this it goes to another kind of cutscene then go in back into the game here so where you can control the the cyan guy again but you will not be able to do any kind of move here like you cannot destroy the uh the other crew member here so you kind of have to wait until the uh dialogue is finished and you cannot really leave the room so you kind of wait so once the dialogue is finished then you can read through okay so they're kind of trying to figure out who was the bad guy and then you know they're like oh okay the science guy said okay see you we're leaving having a nice time kind of thing so when cyan move out here you see the brown was talking to him so the cyan cannot attack the brown yet until you finish talking now we can attack so here you know you can smash him with a hulk hand or you can just use the pole to set him away or you can use the daniel's hand until the gun will disappear so here um this whole uh you can uh so we have the decoration here uh you can break so if you use the whole can you can break this decoration so as you can see um just switch the costume that is broken and fall down so after that you can you can go into the door pushing up again so when you go into up you see the green guy here he's doing some kind of mixing costume so this this also we can break later so cyan right so this time is i want to see some magic and this is busy so here you can use the dr strange so as you can see cyan kind of i mean a purple can pop up here on the top here so here you can use the whole pan again to kind of smash things how you you can hear it oh sound right that's in the back because the even though the sprite is not showing the hulk hands actually hidden because he's right here it's not shown i mean we can make it in such a way that you know you cannot kill more than once but but we haven't done that uh you can we can we might do it when we actually do this game here later on so now you can actually move in push the up key so when you move up key here there's another cutscene again that was the episode three that when we were doing the among us where you know the purple thing that is getting our pen so he went the meeting where he pressed the button so we kind of have that sound right and then we call everybody in for reading and then they were just talking saying that you know they think the cyan guy is the bad guy so science is like just the orange guys kind of really doesn't really think he's the bad guy so they were just kind of fighting back and forth and he's asking him do you see him you know what happens you know they see the bodies they know it kind of move away and this guy says kind of cheat chatting with cyan we got another costume for him putting the little alien head on him you can put like a cheese or whatever doesn't matter and then this guy would just give him a party hat so they're gonna do the bolting so this time i actually made a change to the voting i think in the beginning i didn't do it i just use a list and then later on you know i kind of put more effort into it making like a uh kind of like this similar to like the among us voting right and then they try to fall and see they want to kick somebody out and then this guy he will come to vote and then the orange guy is gonna vote for the purple so we're gonna get a tie here so you can still control the green i'm inside and guy you see how you can move and back and forth and then science got talking so you say ha ha we have a tie then you know he this this is the kind of like thinking like he said he can use the doctor strange ability and hulkabil let's just give you a hint that you could smash the tables or the table you can be smashed by hope's um ability so you can smash that and then kind of these guys can run away here you can cast the final spell which is a seven so if you push seven there's a bigger portal that comes up and then you can suck everything out into space so that's what happened so once they went to the space you know you can still control him and he'll have and then these the queen guys still with the space seeing this guy you know uh he got kicked out earlier right so and then you see he's laughing at the end that's it so that is the end of the the animation so how do we do this so so there's a lot of code here uh what we're going to do is i'm going to give you all this code here so what we trying to do is kind of explain some of the code here okay okay all right so i have cleaned up all my all my code so there's no more code between each of the the sprite here so um if you look into the sprite for cyan i have different costumes so we have first costume for him second custom we have a gun we just put it on him and then third costume is a cape okay we drew the cape here so i just kind of draw a cave and then paint it and then copy it and then play play on cyan guy and then this one is just a costume hit for the cyan okay and then the um the this one so the red uh so red when we kill the red or kill anybody that the little bone comes out so uh when we do the hulk smash right so for those you actually have to have a matching uh icon so here's red dead right so there's a pink so pink dead so we can use that to switch the icon when the hulks actually smash down right there's the orange and whatever right these are all the colors here so ideally any color you can pick and it will still go but for our story we kind of use the going from one custom to the next costume so we'll start with the red and pink or yellow you know uh gray whatever okay so i hope you guys understand that so uh if you actually want to make a new costume or something like that then you can just say right click just say duplicate so for here you just change it right any color you want let's say you want i don't know teal we have teal right i don't know what else we don't have uh let's say we want to have this color or you can't even use a two color kind of thing right doesn't matter so what you can do is you can have like a like this is a lighter color then you can maybe do a darker color right darker color like this and the darker color you can color the outside so this is not dark enough let's say make it a little more dark so you see like these so so these this is not a good color so because we're using two color right so dark is not really helping so probably use one color is better that's why i used before just one color so i think that will be probably better let's try one color so let's color first color and then you can use a darker color here and then oh i should i should do both of them at the same time so that's actually another piece here so you fill the first two top ones so this one and this one then you can choose a darker color here and then you can feel the other part so you kind of have a red reddish orange kind of color right so that's how you create the uh icon i mean these guys you can paint them if you want but i already paint them for you so you don't really need to paint his eyes or anything just paint the the body the first part and the second part that's it so i don't think we have orange here right so if you want to paint orange you can so let me trash this so but if you make sure that you make one of these and you want to make a another custom just copy the other guy and then just color his body the bottom part right the bottom part and then the stomach part and leave everything the same all right so this is just a bone that i drew okay so i guess i hope you guys understand this part so the second part is the um you know the door the door is just a different costume i drew so this is like the different like draw the costume and then the layout just different layer you can see right this is like a layer here this is a box here just kind of bend them bend some shape and put it in and then use a water digger border so this one i drew one here then i drew another one here for the door opening so that you can have a door closed and then you know you can switch costume for a door opening okay so if you guys want to draw something else you can right and then the box i just drew the box here right that's two box so just kind of draw it like a cube uh this one is the uh you know just the like three rings you know you kind of shoot out like a you know sonic power or something doesn't matter and the table i just kind of i download the table online and the button just put it there and what i did was i just kind of draw the paper break the table in half just draw it so what you do is you can just cut them right so let's say you want to do this and you wanna okay so the table you can draw like this so what you can do is you can convert it to a bitmap and then you can like kind of you know select the uh you know the eraser kind of thing and you can kind of erase like this right so now you have kind of two table so what you can do is duplicate this guy again and then you can use the eraser to kind of erase everything else on this side right so here you can just kind of erase all that stuff here let's see so i'm gonna make it bigger so we erase all this thing and then do the same thing for this side but you're going to erase this side of the table right so and then you kind of draw your black marker back in but what you can do is convert back to the vector this guy convert back to vector and you can select him and you can tell rotate him like this kind of thing right and you can get this guy you can convert back to uh it's alright vector yeah select him copy ctrl c just move it away and put them like this kind of rotate like that or whatever and then you can just use the black color just filming like let's say 10 or whatever just kind of draw it in or something like that right something like that you see what i'm saying so something like that right so you just draw in so it's just trying to make it look like this you know something like this right something like what we have as a table so that will be good enough all right got it okay so i actually then deleted my table so i have to get it back so this is the broken table i had and then this this is just some text text nothing here this is just the uh you know i can't draw it and then trying to reshape it using the reshape to reshape the uh you know the the look like a cape and then just paint the black stuff and then color with red okay and then this is the emergency same thing you know just kind of you see i have all the uh you know the um this reshape and then kind of reshape it and then put another color on top so that's actually two different colors so if i kind of duplicate this you see if i move this guy so you see red and then you have this color on top you see that and then you can move like let's say this word can go in front and you click on the front so that will go in the front and these white white lines are just you know you can just draw like white line here using white 20 just draw a line using the line tool and then different size so just for these two i just draw and then create another one and then just put on top of it okay so you got that thing and then this one i think this one is a little bit tough so what you do is you kind of draw a big uh costume kind of bait so what you do is you just gonna take the table put it here take the cyan guy like the science right here take him put it here and then draw a hand or something like that you know to push the button so that you know when you look at him so well let's say i show this one so you see how let me move this guy this guy's actually in the front let me make this guy go away so you can see right now so you go back here you can see the cyan like this right with this guy right imagine here is not there right so something like this okay so next is the spy box that one is uh you know you just kind of draw the square squiggly line and then what you do is you can just kind of cut the sprite from the purple cut that head put it in here okay cut that and then this one this is just the uh like a banner kind of thing in the beginning so that we could show different banner so this is the first one uh what we're saying is the animation right and then the second one we just took a screenshot put it here put some text and then the third one is where you know you just put stuff together just take the background you know take one of the background take the door put it there take the take one of the decor put it here take the box guy put it here and then just kind of do some editing right so you can have a screen like this that you can demonstrate later you know in between the scenes right and then the decor you know you can just have this on top of the box which through the box here right just download this online and then i just made this fall down and then draw some squiggly line on it okay and then this one the same thing um i think there's another project that they provided some flask so i just took that and i just kind of dropped them over here draw the squiggly line on it so make sure you group you know when you're moving object make sure you group all the object in one one one place if you don't group all the object then when you move it sometimes you know these things goes away so i can show it to you right so let's say i did this and i ungroup this right so if i ungroup it i try to move right you're going to move color like this so which is no good so make sure you that you group all your objects so that you can move them all together if not you're gonna miss something like this and it's totally messed up okay so to group the object just highlight them and then click on the group button here okay so the voting thing same thing so what we did uh we can't draw a different sprite uh so the first one is kind of like the the just the plane so where they have not both then we draw the second one where one person voted the one the person voted so as you can see it takes a lot of time to do all these kind of animation special animation takes a long time than game where the draw comes it seems right kind of like that and you can put it in so you get these just the little head that i drew and then i put them in so some of the head you cannot just take it from here and put it there because this is thicker so you see how thick this is 10 right so make sure that when you draw this little head you have to change the size outline you know maybe instead of 10 i don't group it for you so instead of 10 you know draw five or something right because if not then you know it all messed up it looks ugly okay so last this one is just same thing just draw i took it from the other custom here right this guy took it from here then i won't get a background put it here and then i draw the little theme circle and then put this little guy here okay and then there's the same thing this is just the uh ability just put them together here and then just kind of take each item put it here and then kind of line them up okay i hope you guys understand how to get all the sprite in if you need to do that uh or you have to do any kind of custom sprite so what we have to do is we are going to have to work on each of these guys okay so what we're going to do is we are going to start with this one first the story continues sprite so the story continues let me hide this one so the story continues this one so what we're going to do is we are going to use the first one first so what we're going to do is we're going to use the um let's flat click right uh what you want to do is make it go to 0 0 in the center then go here say make it go to front layer so that will cover other stuff in the back and then say show what i did was i kind of wait for four seconds you can wait three seconds doesn't matter so how many seconds you want kind of wait for four seconds then i say hi and from here after that i say broadcast so what you want to do is uh you can let the other sprite know that the kind of the uh the game begins so start episode one so this is the broadcast i call so um what we're going to do is we're gonna create the variable of already happens and i copied the other one so make sure you create this uh allow to open door uh current among us dialog in progress i will rename this without the space in between so i think all the no space dialogue and progress so all these all these uh variable uh global variable basically when you make the variable just leave it as for all sprite okay uh enable final spell and then imposter so these are all the variables we need we don't need a lot and then we have a name list so make a list called nameless so make a list here for sprite called nameless okay nameless okay so we have all the variables done okay so what we're going to do is we have this spot episode one right so what we're going to do is we'll go to the backdrop uh here we're going to do a start when start screen flashes click what we can do is lower music i already loaded the video game too i think it's actually in the loop somewhere uh video yeah so this is a video so video came to us here so in the um in the loop music so you just load it in here so once you load it in here you can just play the music so you can say control forever and then you go to sound okay so we'll have this uh music going on so what we want to do is uh we saw the um here right when the striking areas start episode one right so what we want to go back to the backdrop you have to find somewhere that you could always uh kind of go from one scene to another so we're gonna use the backdrop since backdrop has different scenes my backdrop one two you know three four different scenes right so as you can see there's different scenes here right so we're gonna go with the first one so when when i receive start episode one so what you want to do is um so switch to backdrop you say back drop one so that will begin the first backdrop okay so test it so when we run this right so we can run for four seconds you're gonna switch it will hide this and you'll see the first backdrop so that's kind of what we are right now so now let's go to our cyan uh we can call it different way we can just say you know when the green flag is clicked so we want to make the cyan to be able to move right but and then you say there's a something called a variable something called dialog in progress so what we want to do is you know we don't want to allow the assignment to do certain moves certain time like when the dialogue is in progress so we have to set it to yes so for right now we are going to set it to no there's no doubt in progress right now so i'll set it to no uh what we want to do is we're gonna switch it to costume one for now which is the regular costume of this guy right here okay and then we're gonna throw in a forever loop that we can control the sprite for this and then we need the if statement okay here you go sensing and then there's a key press so let's say right arrow key press uh you want him to point in direction 90 so pointing to the right and then motion move 10 step duplicate this block put in the bottom uh changes to the left arrow and then you say point to negative 90 and then move 10 steps so when you point the direction then you actually have to change it to negative okay if you change it to negative it's going to be incorrect because we're already pointing to that other direction so all right so what we want to do is uh let's run the game again so after the element story uh screen goes away so you see this right it's not showing up so make sure you have the show okay so put it in the show after after the dialogue after this backdrop switch to backdrop one right this is controlling the backdrop one so what you can do is this so you say event so you don't want to show them all the time right so you don't want this guy to show up when actually the animation haven't begun yet so what you do is you can say something like this when i switch to backdrop one i'm going to make him go to front layer and then i'm gonna put him at some position doesn't matter let's say we put it at this position here and then we say okay switch to costume uh in case it you know it switched to a different costume let's just switch it to custom one again just in case you know when you're doing doing testing and all you can be a different costume and then you want to test certain thing you know you're going to go back to this backdrop one one swinging back to custom one so here we have custom one so now when we run the game again so after this goes away you can see oh you have this guy you kinda can control him left and right as you can see the yellow thing is moving that's how you know your clothes running right all right so here after that we have the kodi among us uh sprite so i think we're gonna finish this red sprite i mean they are the among us uh sprite here the first one and then we'll stop uh okay so here you can call the event green flag is click okay let me zoom in so what you want to do is you say point in direction nine it doesn't matter i mean wherever you want to face him let's say you want to face it to the right and you point to 90 31 face the left point of negative 90. so what i want to do is this now we want to start off with some um some kind of uh sprite costume so let's say so the current among us we're gonna call it red so which is the first costume right so red is his name make sure that matches the name so we can use that to switch when he's getting hit he can switch into red dead right so make sure that name is matching exactly okay so first we set it to red then what we can do is this say custom switch costume and then you can use a variable okay so that way if this one runs you will get the red class 2 okay and then you can say go to front layer and then i'm going to clean the graphics effect because when you when when you kill the sprite right they turn to pixelated or fish eye we want to clear that effect every time okay and then you want to hide it in the beginning first we don't want to show same thing when we're switching back drop right this is switching the backdrop of the episode one stop uh we want to do the same thing like what we had for this guy right so let's drag it here and put it here for now we're gonna change it up a little bit so when the backdrop starts what i want to do is i'm going to go into a different position okay i'm going to put him at negative 95. and then negative 99 doesn't matter 100 doesn't matter 100 okay and you can put them the other way i think we had it initially you had it like this right oh you can turn them around someday so this one doesn't really matter you can throw it away also which doesn't matter or you can keep it either way it's fine so but backdrop one we're gonna turn them around and now we're gonna do the click graphics effect as well just in case and we're gonna show so we already have the costume we know what the costume is is red right so let's try it again so when we start the game you know wait a little bit we're gonna switch the costume let me switch the backdrop here the backdrop will come back over here and letting these two diagonally appear so the red will kind of stand there you cannot control the red and then you can only control the science where you're moving this guy right right so just like the animated story we had the cyan can like hit it with a club or something so next time we'll work on the attack with the club and all the different things so for right now this is what we had so far i will upload this uh all the sprites and all the costumes on the how google drive uh make sure when you go to the google drive right you need to download each of the items down and then you can upload if you don't know how to do that let me just show you real quick so for example we have the google drive here in this video you can click more right so you can go to this click on this or open up a new screen like this um you know you can just right click let's say you want download power up or laser the tree doesn't matter so right click say download so you don't need to request for any access so when you download right it'll come over here like this just kind of save it and then in your in your in your game just go back to your game here here you can just say click on this little cat say upload and then you can just you know that tree that we just download and downloading some some kids was confused on how to upload the sprite you don't actually open any uh file this sp the sprite 3 file you cannot open that either down to your computer and from here you can use this button upload sprite and then from there you can choose the uh go to the folder choose the file and open okay all right i hope that's uh not confusing for you guys okay we'll stop right here we'll see you guys next time be sure to like share and subscribe and give us a thumbs up on the video if you can that will really help us alright see you guys next time bye you
