thank you welcome back guys it's kitchen playground here and today we're back from the beginning of scratch and today we'll be making us game called skeleton Blaster where you kill skeletons which is the objective and then um you fight a skeleton boss in the end so I'm gonna download the game for you so basically there's some music that plays and then the skeletons chase after you and when you get hit you lose a life and then um you see uh the lives up here uh they're losing so if you die then your tank could just break it says you lose so that's basically um the game and uh you have to kill something so uh if you kill this you you shoot the um explosive balls that just destroy the skeletons and then um once you get more than 175 score which I'll be there in soon um the skeleton boss will come out so each shelter gives five and then the Skeleton thing is out you can see his health bar up here and he's chasing after me and then um make your click rate a little quicker at this point because uh you will not survive if he hits you uh so the objective is basically to kill him and then you win in the end but if you die by him that means you um if you get hit by him then if you lose so yeah basically that's it you win and then you have your score up here great so we're gonna be making this project today okay so first off we're gonna name this skeleton blaster oh skeleton blaster and we're gonna add some uh stuff in the backpack to our project so first we have the tank we also have I'll show you how to draw this um and then we also have the Blaster we also have the ball the explosion the Skeleton King and the you and you lose right so um we have the whole entire thing over here so for the tank to draw it um I'm gonna give you a little tutorial so um here's the tank so you have to draw the small sector first which you use as um rectangle and you can just reshape it so it looks like some sort of trapezoid and then you also have to do for the secondary layer so we're also going to draw another rectangle right like that and then reshape it to look like a trapezoid so I will have all of these Sprites on a no code project in my uh profile that you can copy off so my profile is Gumball 098 so and then over here you just put the wheels so you just make a rectangle and use reshape tool this reshape tool to kind of just turn that into some sort of uh ellipse slash Circle and yeah we're just going to turn that into um the wheel thing yeah and then you just draw circles in the middle to the wheels so Circle and then uh hold shift down to make uh like a perfect circle and then uh you can just use Ctrl C Ctrl V to make the other two wheels on the wheel so yeah and also we do have a scratch cat that scratch head that we're gonna put in so you just take like Sprite one just a scratch cat Ctrl C that and then go to the tank and then Ctrl V just maybe reshape it a little bit oops she's gonna group those two together yeah there we go take that one just shrink it a little bit put it on so it's just a scratch cat with the thing with the head so I'm gonna uh show you how the Blaster looks like so basically it's just a rectangle where you reshape it and you have like a little trapezoid on top and you have um sort of a reshaped rectangle over there it's just like a rectangle over here to for some shadow look so uh this is a blaster that we use from our July 4th game so you can go check that out in our channel so I'm just gonna delete this tank real quick and we'll just use this one and then there's also this tank which is so this is just basically like without the Blaster because the blasters are spread of its own which has basically like the um so it can move not like this one say stationary this is just for positioning so we're going to copy the tank over the cat tank so it can control C and then you move it to the Blaster you may you paint and just by Ctrl V so to get the right size and positioning you just delete this part and then now you're left with the Blaster and that we don't we're gonna delete that and then you just left hit the Blaster here for usage and now you have the blaster and basically the ball is just three circles it's not that hard just to research them yeah and then you just like position it and that's just the three balls over there oh I just did it for three colors because it looks better so now moving on to the explosion it's basically three costumes so we have uh zoom out so we have the uh second one and the first one second and third one so this one this grows up to the large ones so basically you just use like a really thick yellow line to draw extra like explosion effect so it's great and yeah so the Skeleton King we just made a skeleton and we got a crown and a sword from the internet and we just put it on here's the crown cartoons and then here's the sword cartoons so yeah we have that and we added it onto the skeleton and we used remove BG to remove the um background for the the internet like the swords and the crown okay and then we're just gonna move on to you and you lose it's just some simple writing you and use so uh we're going to delete the splash cat we do not need that and yeah so we have all our Sprites here except for the skeleton which I'm gonna put in right now so skeleton there it's okay so great so now we're gonna start coding so first we're going to make some variables for the project so the first one that we're making is lives we also have the king HP variable we also have score um and X position and Y position so let's get that X position I can't delete this variable quickly and then y position y position position so yeah we have all our variables King HP Livescore Expedition black position so now we're gonna start coding so for the tank let's go to the tank sees so when the green flag is clicked it will set lives to 10. you can of course alter this in any way you would like and then uh and set scores to zero and it will go to I already have the position here but you can just go around around here so around just here and then it'll switch costume to tank one because we do have three things we have three costumes this one and then the broken one and then this one so of course take one and then clear graphic effects um so we're going to start with okay so we're trying to finish the tank first so when the green flag is clicked it will wait one second and then forever um you need to if then so if then right here if then it touches the skeleton touching skeleton then you'll change lives by minus one of course you can alter how much life you want it to change but for right now it's negative one and then it'll start sound bite so you can tell if they have hit you or not and then you'll broadcast hit cat podcast hit cat so we have hit cut and then you need if then so you need if then right here under not over here under no actually no in here like that so if then over here or the lives are equal to zero let's get the lives potential equals zero or lives are less than zero so if you have died or Taken um less than zero lives then they'll broadcast game over thank you came over so now we're going to move on to here so when I receive hit cat this is just for uh visual effect repeat five and it'll change the color by 25 change color effect of course and then clear graphic effects after that and then you put um when I receive game over it will stop off so yeah we have this over here for now we might come back to the tank later for some extra cook so let's move on to the blaster so when the green flag is clicked um you'll point in Direction 90 which is this way and point that Rush 90. you know go to this position of course you can put it uh next to the tank somewhere near it just right here and then for forever it will Point towards Mouse pointer Point towards Mouse pointer so it'll follow your mouse if you didn't see in the demo it'll follow your mouse like that and then you have to have an if then statement if then the mouse is down so that means if you click then it will wait until not Mouse down so you can't just Spam click because spam clicking is a little broken so but until not messed down and then create clone of fall but create a clone of the ball so uh no spam clicking and then after that when the green flick is when the green flag is clicked it will switch costume to costume one which is this one uh clear graphic effects because when it receives hit cat it will also change color effect so we're gonna put that to repeat five times change color effect and clear graphic effects so I think we are done with the Blaster feel free to pause right here and now we're gonna move on to the ball since we have increased I mean um yeah made a clone of the ball so when I started as a clone oh yeah and first of all when the green fog is clicked it'll hide and oh then when the when I started to clone they'll set gravity to zero which is gonna be a new um variable here which is a part of the ball so gravity is going to be gravity gravity and is for this Spy only so click on this and it will set gravity to zero and then to a set size by 50 percent and it'll go to the Blaster so it'll start the blaster and after that it'll Point towards Mouse pointer just like the Blaster and then it will go to the back layer as well as it will show then repeat until soon you repeat until right now repeat until touching Edge so this is until the ball touches the edge it will move 12 steps so it's pretty quick we have 12 steps and then change gravity by negative 0.3 so negative 2.3 so it will slowly fall back down and then it will change y 'all by gravity no no no all right change y by gravity yep and then it will delete this clip so when I start as a clone it will set a new variable called wait which is a part of the ball so ball there's gonna be a variable weight so this is also a very important task for this right only and then we have that so and it'll set weight 2.5 so I'll explain this after so set weight to 1.5 and then it'll reset timer and after that it will wait until you need three ores so stick with me on this one or or or so wait until touching skeleton so the ball will stop you know so it'll just keep on flying until it touches the skeleton or it touches the Skeleton King Skeleton King well I I added actual word by bad so throw that away and then or and then you put this so greater than symbol timer is greater than wait like that and then you set the X position to X position so set X position to X position and then you duplicate that set y position oops y position to Y position just like that and then broadcast explode broadcast explode and after that it'll delete this call so this is all for the all Sprite um so let's see feel free to pause and uh this is basically showing uh so this weight is 1.5 seconds so it will the ball will fly for 1.5 seconds and if it doesn't hit the skeleton or the Skeleton King it'll just explode on the spot and then it'll um so if the timer is greater than the weight which is 1.5 um it'll just explode right there if it doesn't hit anything so yeah have the ball finished now we're going to move on to the skeleton so the skeleton first of all the size is 75 so oopsies that's the ball my back it was 100 right but it's going to be 50 anyway so it doesn't really matter and then um the skeleton I'm gonna go over here and the skeleton is 75 so 75. and then after that uh we're gonna have oops when the green flag is clicked and the green fog is clicked it'll set the rotation Style by left right so it doesn't like flip over does some weird jumbo Mumbo to no hide like this and then forever it will create a clone of itself and it'll wait wait I'll pick random uh 0.25 0.25 seconds to 0.75 so it'll wait how long for the next skeleton to spawn and then after that okay so we have a lot of when I started to clone stuff so when I start as a club right here it'll repeat until it touches the tank so repeat until touching tank and then it'll go next costume and then wait 0.5 seconds so it's just um just the animation of it walking and then delete this clone it will go to go to x 175 so I calculated this it's around here x 175 and then pick random the Y from negative 120 to 0. basically here to like here and then after that it'll show and then it will repeat until touching the tank so repeat until touching the tank and then it'll Point towards the tank so just follow the tank try to knock it down and then it'll move two steps and then delete this clone so and then you have another one I started to clone so when I start as a clone wait until wait until uh touching tank so just keep on going until it touches the tank and then it'll wait 0.1 seconds so the damage can register correctly if you do not have this weight is very important and then it'll delete this cloud just like that and then we have another one I started to clone it's a lot you can put it over here when I started to clone forever it will if then if it's touching the explosion so if it hits the the thing that the tank shoots out the explosion then it will start to sound rattle because it passed away and then it will change score by five and also delete this club and also uh another one I started as a clone I know it's a lot but hold on we're gonna start just a clone you need an if then statement if then the score is greater than 175 so we can put this score is greater than 975 then it was broadcast show Skeleton King so basically if your score is higher than 175 it will show The Skeleton Key so this is all the code maybe we can know okay so um this is all the code so feel free to pause at this moment I'm gonna give you like three seconds so just feel free to pause so yeah um we're gonna move on to the explosion so explosion when the green flag is clicked the green flag is clicked it will hide and then it will go forever and next costume so basically see it has three costumes like I showed earlier and it'll just be all three and it looks cool so yeah and also when I receive explode then it will go to go to x so we're gonna add a put an ad over here operator um X position plus 100 and then y position y position so basically this is showing um uh where the explosion will be uh from terms of a ball so it will be 100 um oh off from the ball but the same y position so that's pretty cool and then it'll show and repeat 15 times it'll rotate turn 15 degrees and then hide and after that we're going to move on to the Skeleton King and let's take a look at the Skeleton King so when the green flag is clicked and the green flag is clicked it'll hide variable King HB so since the king is not out no hide King HP and then it'll go to on a certain position you can put it like somewhere over here or if you want to make a challenge and put us some more over here but just put it somewhere over here and then it will go hide and then you'll set King HP to 5000. oops two thousand no five thousand and then when I receive show Skeleton King it will repeat until touching tank so it just tried to destroy that tank and then next costume uh it'll wait 0.25 seconds between each rotation of the costume and then we're gonna move on to this part so when I receive show the Skeleton King it will show the variable King HP and then it will show he'll try to destroy that tank he'll repeat until repeat until touching tank project touching tank and then we'll move two steps so of course you can make them like quicker if you want it more challenging or slower if you want it to be more easier and then wait 0.5 seconds okay and then when I receive came over it will stop other Scripts in this Spike now we're going to move on to um this part which is a really big bunch so hang tight when I receive show Skeleton King it will forever so far right here um if then if any statement if then if then it's touching the explosion then it will change King HP by minus 10 and if you notice that um why it changed by so much per shot it's because it stays on the king for a little while and then splash registers pretty quickly so it does more than 10 damage and then after that you need an if then statement right here under if then the king HP so or so if then the king HP is equal to zero or the king HP is less than zero then it will stop other scripts in the Sprite because you have defeated the king and then it will hide your looking HP and then it will hide then broadcast you win and then after the broadcast you win you have to have another if then if then touching tank so if it touches the tank it will broadcast game over because it's a one hit construct but I guess game over you know set lives to zero as well as stop the script so I won't continue walking or whatever it does and then after that we move on to the you win you lose Sprite so let's take a look at this so the green flag is clicked it will go to x00 as x0 y zero hide it'll hide and then when I receive game over then it will switch costume to costume two which is to you lose one so switch costume costume two and then show and then duplicate when I receive you win and no switch costume the costume of one and then show so when is this one yay and then the backdrop we will use Woods woods and then the music for this save it so the music for this is going to be so when the green flag is clicked it will change a set volume to 25 this is completely optional it's just because you can hear me while I'm demoing the game again and then um it'll forever play the medieval one sound effect it's kind of loud and then so let's put that in place on medieval one until done so now we have that finished we can hide the variables to our liking so X position y position can be hot hidden scores and lies will keep in King HP can be hidden for now and then we go to the ball ball gravity is going to be closed same with weight and then I guess you can put the lives up here and then the score all the way up here so now we can save the project Uno it should work yeah great so let's see we still do have two more scripts in the scratch chat that we might have forgotten or I have forgotten um about game over and you win so when I receive you win it will stop all and then after that when I receive when I receive game over it will switch costume to tank two and now if you need to if then so if then you need a or if the lives are equal to zero or lives are less than zero then it will um switch costume to costume two just take two so now we have all the code for everything here so right now we have this is the tank Sprite feel free to pause it give me like two seconds blaster feel free to pause ball it should work skeleton and then explosion yeah and then Skeleton King pass right here oh and we have one more thing before I just noticed when I receive um you win it will also stop other scripts in the Sprite so stop other scripts in this right so this should be the right code and then you lose you win and then the background so great now let's demo the game it just always does that so it does seem to be working I'll demo the game one last time so the live score and then the skeletons and then if I get hit I'm gonna get hit so um we're gonna win try to win so uh let's get to 175 score activate the king King is out oh no let's try to kill him he's not that hard if you just um click really quickly and then I should win if I get yeah it does work so and also um we do want to move the king HP here for just better look it's completely fine though and then if I lose let's see if it works so the you lose does work and I pointed this out so there's the Blaster is actually in front which um is doesn't look that good so we're gonna go to the tank and make it go to the front layer so it's now behind I guess we can also add that so yeah now we have the tank and the the skeleton Blaster and it still says Untold 55 here for some reason so let's delete that foreign this is what we have made today so um please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below what else uh projects you would like us to make because there's a bunch of possibilities and we might probably use yours in the next video so yeah and you guys anyway see you guys next time
