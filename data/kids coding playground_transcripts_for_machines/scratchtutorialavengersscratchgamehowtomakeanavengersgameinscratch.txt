welcome back guys it's kids coding playground here and today we're back for another video and it's a captain america game some people have been asking for adventure games so i'm gonna show you because people all a lot of people like avengers so here i got him uh so the first one i have is hassan khan so he said can you make um a simple avengers game please this is actually pretty simple and pretty cool at the same time please make a game on the avengers at all thomas ali says a h i one seven freestyles freestyler said can you do a tutorial of making avengers end game animation on scratch he said animation but um we'll do uh a game so this dude has come this five months ago so that was pretty long so anyways um i'm gonna get to the video uh demo so um yeah so sentinel i don't i think he's a bad guy and you have to throw space and throw his shield and dash and kill all um there's no score so you can counter because it's a simple adventures game and um you don't die so that's pretty cool and you can also dash with the um right arrow key uh throw shields of space and whatever they touch you would die as well like that oh my god i feel all of it great okay so uh let's get right into the game but oh yeah i have to tell you guys about um what you have i don't have time to um check all my comments and uh or in youtube as well so uh i'm so we have a lot of i have a lot of comments here so i really appreciate um you you guys uh uh loving my comments i'm loving my video my games on scratch and also commenting uh so there's a lot of people so yeah so i really really really really really um appreciate that so i i can only reply to around three comments i don't have much time so uh anyways let's get right into the video so um let's make a new project all the sprites are the links in description if you're doing something wrong you can watch our google drive video so we have cap captain america sentinel and the shield that captain america throws so we have all of these things you can download links in description google drive yeah you can get that so um yeah and on if you're doing something wrong watch our video it's on it's on our channel how to access google drive and do not use your school account use your main account since sentinel was already in my backpack it was already done all this stuff so remember guys put on rotation left right so i'm gonna show this it was pointing to the right side instead of the left side so turn on that and make it negative 90 degrees so yeah um let's get let's get to it so uh let's start on sentinel so i actually can get the backdrop first that's the most easiest that's a task that needs to be done um i think this is called stars not sure yeah yeah it's called stars so i'm also going to name this project i named it captain america game so yeah a captain america game captain america okay so yeah i'm gonna do captain america not sentinel so when the green flag is clicked uh hide forever it'll create clone of myself which is sentinel well not me and it'll wait i'll pick random seconds before spawns another one so i'm going to pick random of 0.5 to one side sentinel so yeah and then we have cap we have sentinel uh so we have to make the code for sentinel so when i start as a clone because we always need that and it will switch costume to costume sentinel one because that's the first costume when it not dies there's one two three that's when he's dying and it'll go to a random position set x to 175 so let's drag that block in for school so 176 right now so 175 same thing but whatever um show um repeat until touching edge uh move one step and you need to if then so if then the it's touching the shield or cap because of the dash so shield or cap shield or cat so yeah capper shield i did capper ship so let's put that in there and switch costume to sentinel 2 so when he gets attacked by the shield or cap and i'll wait 0.2 seconds and then there's also delete this clone and delete this clone and then next we're going to work on cap so cat we have so um demo the game for you right now oh we got sentinels they're coming in hot so yeah that's basically what we have right now no we have cap so we have to code someone cap and then we have to code some of the shield so it'll be like a part of cat part of shield part of cap so that's basically what we're gonna do and it'll go to the position i already have it at because that's what it always does no no no actually the y is different but whatever it doesn't matter i'm gonna switch costume to cat one and then so one two three yeah you basically cap dash one you basically get the point and there's like throw shield so yeah that's basically what we have let's switch costume to one cat cat one and then go forever that you know if you need it if then you need an up arrow key press then it will change y by five duplicate that let's do the down arrow key which is negative five so minus five and then duplicate again but we gotta change the y to x instead but oh actually we have the right arrow we don't we have the right arrow for um the dash so we actually don't need that we just need to broadcast dash and wait dash and we also have to do uh when the space arrow key is pressed no wait until space t not space arrow key and then we gotta wait until not key press so not not a key space press so that will wait until it won't click oh yeah we knew we didn't wait until sorry guys sorry guys not a wait just to wait until um yeah wait until not key space press so let's put that in not key space pressed over here and then instead of broadcast dash you'll be broadcast throw so let's work on the shield now so the shield so when the green slack is clicked it always has to hide because you didn't do anything with the shield yet so you always have to make it hide so yeah and when i receive throw then i'll go to cap go to cap and then it'll show and it'll repeat until touching sentinel so repeat until you know or sentinel signal or touching edge so repeat until it'll move 10 steps hi didn't go to cap so go back to the captain america after when you're done throwing the shield so yeah um put a cap right there cap and there we go so we're gonna work on the captain america again so i'm gonna work on the throw up her cap so um zoom one out i think that's gonna be better uh so when i received throw a switch costing me cap five well it's always 14 cap not cap dash it's just cat five let's get five i thinks and then repeat ten next costume weight 0.05 the reason why we have to repeat 10 but i'm gonna finish this real quick switch costume back to cap one so finish this block so the reason why we have to do repeat 10 and be between 5 cap 5 to cap 20 cap 14 there's 10 costumes so one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven ten yeah ten just ten so that's why um and yeah so we have to do when i receive dash and demo this real quick to show you so the throw is with the bam bam with the the space key so um yeah i'm moving around and like okay yeah so let's work on the dash next um yeah i i noticed that the captain america shields only single target so the dash is all targets so then when i receive dash repeat until touching edge touching edge so keep on going until on the captain america touches the edge and then i'll move ten steps and go back to the position i already have a mat and then when i receive dash i receive dash let's switch costume to cap dash one cap dash not cat one cat dash so um a repeat ten so you can make it nine for y for if you want to do it on the center but i i already have them at this spot so why not um but we also have to change the this is negative six so you gotta match it together so that also has to be negative 16. uh or this can be negative 36 so let's make this negative 16 i mean 36. so get that now let's do when i receive switch cost me the cap dash repeat 10 times i already have that uh next costume and weight zero 0.05 seconds i um and switch costume to cap dash just cap one not cap dash switch costume to cat one and we also have to add the music and then we'll that'll be the done we'll be done with this so when the green flag is clicked so the reason why i decided to always use this set a volume to 25 is because i don't want it to that loud then you can hear me so um we also have to have a forever loop and ever and ever and i'll play sound this sound i have movie two i already memorized it i think at least i think it's movie one uh yeah so this is the cool music so please sound movie too until done oh um
