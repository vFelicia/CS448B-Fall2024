welcome back guys it's kids coding playground here today we'll be working on our second part for apple dash game so for apple dash game i will go over the code we had last video so this is the movement of the player right here and this is setting up the player and then for the basket right here we have the setting of the basket switch the costume and right here we have it to go to the player at all times and then for the fruit this is what we have from the last time when we fly click we want to hide it um we're going to set this fruit speed to negative six and this is the code for the fruit going down and if it touches the basket or hitbox it'll go back up and go to a random position again and then we got the begin button okay and it's just spinning the button and this is starting it up and then we've got the hit box which is the bottom when the fruit hits the bottom they don't go back up okay all right so today we'll be working on the bomb and lives and we'll also probably get into the coins so right now for our bomb we have the bomb so we'll probably put this into the description below um okay sorry um this is a bomb we'll probably put this in the description below into the google drive or you can download one if you want yourself or you can draw your own it's pretty simple just draw a black circle and you can draw some flare on the top so that's how you draw a bomb i guess we're also going to bring our um lives health so all we did is just draw three crosses one it's like a fruit ninja how you have three of these so if they have three hp left then they'll have this two hp they'll have this one hp they'll have this and zero hp it'll be like that so we used some shade a different shade of color so to make it look better um and every time you hit a bomb you will lose one light so that's what it does so let's get coating inside the bomb so okay so for the bomb boy green fly clicked okay so yes let's do this big all right so for the bomb and when we clicked we want to hide and then when i receive start game when i receive start game start game we want to set the bomb speed to negative 8 which is a new variable i believe bomb bomb speed bomb speed to negative 8 so that's gonna be like that fruits falling it's gonna be bomb speed it's gonna be for the bombs instead so negative eight and then we're gonna go to a random position and we're going to set the y to 180 which is the top and we're going to get a forever loop so let's go control forever if um hit bomb is equal to no so that means if a player has not touched the bomb so you know so if hit bomb the variable is equal to no then we are going to change the y by the bomb speed so if it's not being hit then it will keep on going down so the bomb speed no not like that change the y by bombsie change y by the bomb speed inside the variables so just put that in here and after that we're going to go to control if um touching the hitbox the bottom hit box then we are going to hide hide the bomb and we're going to go to a random position again and set the y to 180 set y to 180 and then we're gonna wait pick random one to three seconds so we have two different costumes one is the explosion and one is just the bomb so we're gonna pick random one to three seconds we're gonna wait so it's gonna wait a little bit time before switching um putting another bomb so we're gonna wait and pick random one to three and then we're gonna obviously switch to the first costume first because it has not contacted with the player and will not explode and then we're gonna show after that all right and after that we're going to get another if that statement go to control if put that in here if touching the basket so if the bomb is touching the basket we're gonna set the hit bomb to yes yes and we're gonna broadcast another message and let's name it um bomb hit player bomb hit hit uh player bomb hit players so that's what i'm gonna do and then right here when i receive bomb hit player then we are going to let's find the sound oh yeah boom cloud this is the one i had boom clown just sounds like this um so that's the one we're going to use and then we're going to switch the costume costume 2 which is the exploding bomb over here and then we are going to wait 0.5 seconds and then hide so it's gonna explode and then wait a little bit before hiding so and then we're gonna hide it and we're gonna switch the costume back to the first costume which is bomb and after that we're going to make it go back to a random position go to random position and set the y to 180. okay now let's go to the fruit catcher i mean not for cash let's go to the basket actually i think we should go to the health first let's work on the health first so for the health we're going to if a bomb comes in contact with the player then it'll lose a life oh yeah and i forgot let me go through this code real quick so yeah so this is the code make sure you didn't miss anything let's go to health so the hp we're going to do one green flight clicked hide and hide the hp and we're gonna set the variable hit bomb to node and then after that we're going to when i receive start game when i receive start game we're gonna switch costume to three health which is the first costume switch costume to three health so it still has max hp we're gonna show and after that we're going to when i receive bomb hit player and we're going to next costume we're going to do next costume because the next costume is the second one so basically every single time it gets hit it will switch to the next costume that's what it's for and then we're going to get an if ben state so if uh costume number is equal to four that means the player has no more lies because the fourth one is zero lives so costume number let's go here you can also use costume name but we're gonna be using custom number if that's equal to four then we're going to get an if then statement if okay so this is for later so this is if the score is greater than high score then we're going to set the high score to score um i'm just going to put this in any way so for later you can sense for the high score so we're going to get a greater than symbol so on the score is greater than high score then we're going to set the variable high score to score all right so after this we're going to broadcast the message so once the player loses we're going to broadcast a message called end and again so that's gonna end the game and then we're gonna wait two seconds and we're gonna set the hit bomb back to note after this we're gonna set back to no hit bomb to no all right so this is the lives so i'm gonna play so let's click begin so i'm gonna catch some fruit and hopefully a bomb will fall i think i have to show the bomb yeah i show it i think i did so as you can see when you play it bombs will start falling if you hit one then you'll lose a life as you can see in the top right corner so bombs will drop randomly and as you can see the fruit will always give you more i give you points so run at the end so bomb you dodge it you'll disappear as you can see it's working the bombs are falling if you hit one then you'll lose a life and in the future we're going to add more bombs so we're going to duplicate this bomb so that you get more bombs in your game so that's what we're going to do as well to make it like more bombs because right now there isn't that much so it's only going one at a time so we want multiple at once so that's why we're going to duplicate it later so as you can see this is the code for the bomb and this is the code for the health and when you get hit by a bomb and you'll lose one health as you can see let's find a bomb see as you can see you'll lose a life so yeah that's basically the health and bomb code and now we can go work on coins so coins will give you uh what's it called money so with the money you can buy stuff in the shop i'm gonna hide these variables okay so for the coin you can either draw your own like just a yellow circle with like a money symbol in the middle so we actually have our own so um i'm gonna import that in real quick okay as you can see i have imported my coin so we downloaded this from online i think so it's just a coin with the star in the center you can draw your own if you wanted to make more simple so for the coin let's get coding on here so i'm just gonna um work on the coin so um we might put this in the comment section below as well so you guys can download it so for the coin when green flag clicked we want to hide the coin and one thing we want to do with all the sprites is want to receive end game as you can see when you lose all your lives a broadcast end game right here so one thing we need to do for all like the player and all the stuff when it's end game we want to hide them i think so why didn't i see if end game we're going to hide and stuff like that so i'm going to do that real quick so i'm going to see end game we want to hide and stop other scripts in the sprite stop by the description spray and we can just drag and drop that to every single sprite we have right here so drag and drop it to duplicate it drag all right i don't think we need it for the hitbox because the hitbox has nothing it's just hiding pretty much most of the time okay so for the coin let's go back to the coin okay so in the coin we are going to oh when i receive start game we can make a variable new variable i'm going to name it wait time so it's basically the time you wait until a new coin falls so we're going to set the wait time to 3 wait time i already have another one i'm gonna delete this one i don't know why i have it um i think it's because i import the coin so wait time to three and we're going to set the coin speed a new variable we're going to make pulling the reason we're doing um all these variables to control their falling speed and stuff like that is because um when armageddons come we want to increase the speeds that's why so when the coin speed we're gonna set the coin speed to negative nine so we're going to make it fall a little bit faster than the normal apples fruits and bomb so queen's b's a bit faster and then we're gonna make a new variable so we're gonna call it coin falling so in the beginning we're going to set coin falling to no because the coin has not dropped yet so coin falling to node and then we're going to make it go to a random position and set the y to 180 and then next we're going to get a forever loop forever if we're going to get an if that statement so if uh the coin falling is equal to no equal to no so coin falling coin falling is equal to no then we're going to show and we're going to turn 5 degrees left so that's we're going to make the coin turn rotate and we're going to change the y by the coin speed change the y by coin speed all right and then next we're going to get an if that statement so if it's touching right here in the coin falling inside this statement we're going to put another if then so if it's touching the coin is touching the hit box then we're going to go to a random position we just basically duplicate this part of the code and put this in and then for that we're going to get an if that seaman so if it's touching so if touching basket let me take this out if touching basket uh where's that over here so the coin's touching the basket then we're gonna start with sound called kuching i got this sounds like this uh i got this from online i think or they have it in here i don't remember i made this a very long time ago so do they have it in here let's see uh looks like they don't have it so i think we got that from online so you can just play any sound you want maybe a pop coaching we have we will um you can probably download your own from online so after this we're gonna make it give a pick random money so we're gonna change the money money by pick random one to ten and after that we're going to duplicate this go to random position set wide 180 and then we're going to set the coin falling to yes because the coin is now falling set coin falling to yes so i have another coin following variable probably because i imported it so let me delete this other coin speed so sorry about that uh so yeah coin falling to yes and then we're gonna broadcast a message and we're gonna call it coin hit basket coin hit basket and then up here when i receive coin hit basket coin basket we're going to hide and hide the coin and then we're going to use the go to random position set y to 180 and then we're gonna wait wait time before spotting another coin wait time and after that we're gonna set the coin falling back to no coin falling to note okay so this is the code for it now save it run it in full screen so we're going to click begin the coins are falling when you catch a coin as you can see you get a random amount of money as you can see apparently um the touching hit box for the bomb doesn't work apparently i think it's because the bomb does not touch the hitbox um at first so we're gonna have to use the chain uh this script right here so instead of this hitbox thing touching hitbox for the bomb we're going to put this into there so i made a small mistake right there so it should be changed uh if y position is less than negative 170. so i think that's how it works so now we can go full screen and i can show you guys so now the bombs will start spawning periodically as before it did not so you'll lose one life another spot as you can see so you're gonna have to change that out remember and once i'll try to find another bomb okay as you can see when you hit three bombs then you lose so yes that's basically this tutorial remember to change this sorry about that um i didn't realize that wouldn't work so you have to use y positions less than negative 170 so yeah that's what you want to do so thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share and subscribe for part three and i'll see you guys in the next video
