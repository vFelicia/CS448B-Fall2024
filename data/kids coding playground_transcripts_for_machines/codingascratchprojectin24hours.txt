welcome back guys in case you're included right here um today I'll be showing you guys our project we made at a coding camp in 24 hours um I know I haven't been uploading recently but here's just a nontutorial video you guys can watch for entertainment of me and my friend and my brother and we were working on this coding project for a coding competition we were given 24 hours to work at it but we only used like eight hours because we had to go home we didn't stay overnight um and also sounds better at the title so sorry if I click baited you into watching this video yeah without further Ado enjoy the video we arrived at the coding place around 12 o'clock noon and we immediately started to get to work we spent the first hour kind of brainstorming what ideas of what game we should do and then we finally settled on making a shooter game where we shoot like aliens or zombies we decided to go through some projects um on scratch some popular projects on Scratch and we found a pretty cool shooter game so we decided to make a similar concept to it so thanks to the people who made the project um for giving us the inspiration of our projects I'll link their project in the description below by hour two we were already working on a project with the code the movement the jumping uh with the shooting so I was working on the movement while my friend was working on the shooting of the character and then my brother was also drawing the Sprites and for the character and for the enemies and everything seemed to go really well we had a system where on Google Drive we would um upload each of our projects when we got to a good stopping point and then we reupload each of the projects into each of our computers and we will start working from there so we can work on multiple Parts um all at the same time so that worked out pretty well that definitely saved us some time instead of all working on one computer which would take a while by the end of the second hour we already had our shooting and our movement finished at R2 I also wanted to change the movement um I had from the beginning um I wanted to make and have some friction when you're like walking like you know having platforms when you walk there's like a little friction so I instead of keeping how it was before I just like kind of strapped that and redid the scripts I made it so now there's some friction so the game looks a little bit better I also ended up adding jumping and crouching together with the basic movement so this clip right here was from around hour three and it's just a video of us working together around the three hour mark we decided to start working on the enemies that follow you and attack you and we added some extra like touches onto our movement and stuff we added double jump and we added some new weapons and stuff um my brother was drawing all the costumes for the characters and the enemies and also the skins for the guns um so yeah in this next clip you will see us uh finishing up movement and we were working on the enemies um and some of the code was done on my friend's computer like the um different guns and stuff like switching guns and I don't have a recording of that but I'll show you the final product after this section of the video also if you haven't subscribed to our Channel right now it'd be a great time to subscribe to our Channel thank you guys for all your support remember when I was saying how we had a system on Google Drive where we were like uploading our projects there and like um downloading each one so then we can work at different parts while my friend finished up a gun part and I downloaded his project so in this next part you can see that I already have the gun script in my projects foreign you can see that I'm working on the script for the enemies to follow the player foreign so this part's around the forearm work uh you had the Skins my brother imported them in and we have the basic gameplay of the game and here I just showed you a quick demo of How It's like um it's not completely finished yet but you're about halfway done right now it's hour four I've been working for like four hours already I've had my bid spray here's our video in Productions that's what we're working on right now okay yeah so that's it hour four guys see you in another hour in this next part I'm working on the double jump for the player let us know in the comment section below if you would like to see a scratch tutorial on this project so after hour four I kind of forgot to record some clips and stuff so we're just going to skip to hour seven where the last clip was foreign like seven right now and we've been working on this game for like seven hours now I'm on Geometry Dash because I'm bored right now so yeah see what my brother's up to he's watching some okay um so around our eights we have to go home because we didn't stay overnight so we worked on it a little bit the next day but I didn't really record anything but I'll see you guys tomorrow morning it is now hour eight of the challenge and we will be going home and we will be going tomorrow morning and finishing up the project I'll see you guys tomorrow the next day so the next day we just added some finishing touches to our project so here in this next clip I'll show you our final product of our projects here we have the final products for our project after we were finished so here let's start our project so you have the pistol you can it's just a basic pistol um and then we have the machine gun and the laser gun so the laser is like a one shot and machine gun is the weakest gun but it attacks the quickest and as you kill more enemies uh the enemies will respond faster move quicker and have more health and um and when you kill an enemy you gain Health but I haven't lost any health yet so we'll see about that and you can double jump I forgot if you did a double jump so you can double jump oh no they're going pretty fast now okay heels see how long it survive for oh see I killed one up I died so when you die you can have the option to respawn and we respawn you just basically just start again so yeah that is pretty much our game our alien shooter game we made so the next day around noon we we had to present our projects in front of judges uh they asked us questions on like how you made the project uh what ideas did you come up while making the project who did what part of the project stuff like that we answer the questions and they actually surprised me we won a certificate for like Best in Show or something uh for our projects so that was pretty cool this code day was overall a pretty fun experience we got to learn a lot and we learned how to work together on making a project anyway that's the end of this video thank you guys for watching if you did enjoy this video don't forget to like share and subscribe to kidscoding playground and you can check out our other tutorial videos too this was not really a tutorial video but more of a you know creating a game in 24 hours kind of like a entertainment video but yeah that's pretty much it thank you guys for watching um you can tell us in the comments section below if you want to see this as a tutorial and I'll see you guys in the next video
