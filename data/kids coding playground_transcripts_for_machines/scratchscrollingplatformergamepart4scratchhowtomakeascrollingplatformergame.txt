so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding playground today we'll be working on the fourth part for the scrolling platformer and once again uh we have gone through this tutorial on griff patch's uh series to learn how to do it so a lot of this code comes from the project group patch made so please check out his platformer gaming series as well our channel focus is to learn the code ourselves share knowledge and resources to other kids who are interested to also learn i am sure you guys have heard this phrase once see one do and teach one so in order to fully understand everything we will we will have to do this don't be afraid to reteach something you have already learned other people you might you other people might want to learn and you can teach them that's how we all learn and finally we'll give a shout out to carrot cake99 he told us to maybe make different skins for like different characters with different stats like number one is neutral number two is a bad runner but a good jumper and number three is a bad jumper but good runner we might add that in our future videos but for now let's get on to the project and also please check out his channel if you want to watch some funny animations okay so let's go here so i'm just gonna scroll around for a little just to show what we've done from last time so this is just like the x and y code the setup code position just to position the sprites and finally the tick custom block and then let's go to the platforms so we have all of this scroll down okay and also one more thing we only have one level that's why it only has one script right here so when we make more levels we will add more to this scripture here so now let's go to the player so let's start off with this script the define change player y by the speed y so we have all of this but we're going to add an if then statement in here so this is the player won't teleport through the top so from the last video i mentioned that when you jump the player can teleport through the bottom of the platform and you can go through platforms and you can like teleport to the top of our platform so to fix that we need to get it greater than simple so if the speed y is greater than zero then we can change the y by negative one actually you have to get an if else sorry if else statement if the sy is greater than zero change the y by negative one so this is um this is so it will go back down so if it's in the air then i'll go back down else it will push it back up one pixel so it will not glitch through the platform and we want to set the in air back to zero because it's not inside the air anymore just take this one because when it touches the ground we we have to set the in air back to zero then we put the position right here oops under here so yeah add this to your change player y by speed y script next we're going to be working on the speed x code so we don't have much code so we're going to add some more to this so we want to change the in air by one so what this script is for um this whole script in there so get an if then statement if touching platforms platforms then this is just to reposition the sprite as it moves along the platforms so if it touching the platforms then repeat 12 times change the y by one change y by one position reposition it so our position block right here i'll just position it to that scroll x and scroll y of the platforms so this is for the player reposition it if it's not touching the platform so if it's like in the air then we can stop the script stop the script we don't want to stop all because it stops the whole program stop the script if you have any confusion on this code then you should watch griff patch's tutorials because he's way better at explaining code than i am so if you have any confusion on this code please check out his videos on his youtube channel so next we want to change the y position by negative 12 change y position by negative 12 repeat until um oops i forgot to put this inside so drag the if then statement into the repeat accidentally put it in the wrong one and then you drag this under right here so now you want to get a repeat until repeat until not touching the platforms not touching platforms touching the platforms so get an if else statement so this is uh to prevent it from going into a wall so if it touches a wall this will make it go back so it will not go through the wall so before when we worked on this why this was to prevent it from jumping um glitching through uh ceiling this is for the walls so if the sx the speed x is greater than zero then we wanna change the x change the x by negative one else we want to change it by positive one so if it's touching if it's bumped into a wall on the right side it'll change it by negative one else it'll change it by positive one and you want to reposition it always so be same position this will result in the player not moving through a wall and now let's go to the tick script right here so we're gonna get at an if then statement if the speed y if the variable speed y is greater than negative 20 then we want to change the sy by negative two so this is um in the beginning when the player starts it will drop from the middle down to the platform so this is what the script is for so adding this script will make it drop onto the platform next you'll want to get uh change player y by and change the player y by the speed y so set this custom block to the speed y it'll call the custom block and you want to set the scroll x to x so this is the x scrolling x and if okay so this is to prevent the scrolling to go too far so when the player gets past zero then we'll stop scrolling we can simply do this by adding an if then statement if the scroll x is less than zero so it's like in the negative numbers so if the scroll x is less than negative zero at less than zero so i want to set the scroll x set the scroll x to zero set the scroll x back to zero and reposition it if okay so this is for the depth so if the y position is less than the negative 180 so if it falls like somewhere down here if the y position then we can set the exit to dead to tell that the player is dead so obviously this variable won't exit won't do anything because we have not scripted that part yet so we will get onto that now let's make a new custom block we should call it player die player die click okay so we're going to define the player die real quick so this is just just like um blink make it blink when it dies so you want in the beginning want to set the exit to blank repeat five times this is just to make it blink and show again repeat five times hide wait 0.1 seconds and then we want to show again and then wait another 0.1 seconds add that right under here and then we want to hide again wait 0.5 seconds and then it will respawn again like that and then now you want to call this so in the play game script right here we want to add an if then statement so once we get the like the portal we'll need to change this to an if else for now we can just put an ifthen statement if exit is equal to die if it's equal to dead if the exit is equal to dead then we can call the player die just make it blink all right so now save our project make it bigger so and remember um i messed up because of this i forgot to take out this take this out and throw in the trash put this back in so now it works and i also um added some extra code right here so your code might be different from mine so if you have not uh if this is not the same then you should copy all this down and now i will like scroll through to show you guys the whole tick script because i missed something right here okay so now let's run it we'll make it big so now earlier um it was glitching through the top it's because of that extra script there and now there's scrolling and you'll die if you fall into the bottom and it will stop scrolling after you pass zero like the negative numbers so we can add one more platform as well let's go to the platform scripts so we can just create another clone at 360. so now let's run it there you go now you have three of them um so now go to costumes so i just have these three and of course this game is not possible yet because i have not added wall jumping we might get onto wall jumping in the next video so you want to space them 360 apart and this y position would be the same so yeah that concludes our fourth part for the scrolling platformer thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share and subscribe and i'll see you guys in part 5 of the scrolling platformer thank you you
