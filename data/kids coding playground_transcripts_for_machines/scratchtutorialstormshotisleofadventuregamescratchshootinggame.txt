thank you welcome back guys it's kids going to playground here today we're back another video in scratch today we will making a video on a game called stormshot Isle of Adventure it's actually a game on the Play Store and I'll show you it right now and if you've ever seen like ads on these games this is like what we will be making today but on scratch so let's go and I'll just demo the video so let's play so we have some music going but it's really quiet so so we're trying to shoot the dancer with uh like a ball so let's see so we're gonna have like a little um where we're shooting Mark with the dots and this is the level current level and these are the amount of lives I have you can as you can see if I shoot upwards it will come back down and hit me which makes me lose a life hey and if I shoot him that means I get to the next level and now I'm on level two and it's basically a strategy and it shows you at the right angle I try to hit him without losing the game or losing all your lives so we're gonna try to find the perfect angle oh I just hit myself that's not good can we find a different angle there we go and um basically we're trying to get to the last level well it's it's forever so once you beat the game it will um hey reloop around and continue with the next level so I'll try to beat the game real quick hey maybe I'll just try to go down here yeah there we go uh hey this one might be a little tricky so um let's go hey I'm trying to beat this uh game uh yeah we got him hey now we're on the 10th stage and it just Loops back to the first stage it says it's level 11. so let's see how far you can get on with the level so right now I'm on level 11 and it basically loops around and around until you lose all your lives which means it's over and it says game over and that's just basically the end of the game so let's get started so now we're just gonna name the project dorm shot aisles of ad Adventure okay and we don't need the cat well we do have the cat inside the game but um I haven't actually with the gun so here we have him and we're gonna drag in our stuff so we're gonna drag in our backdrop for our project our ball our um stage and our DOT and our game over so you can just download some uh for the backdrop you can just download some photos to put as you can see we have an island and a pirate ship over here we downloaded from the internet and it's really easy to make this backdrop you just have to download the things and if they have background just go to a background remover site and all we did was just get a blue sky background and change the color of the grass to the ocean colors so yeah you just have to click on this and go like that so you can color it and yeah just change it over here and yeah just do that for all the outlines and basically you've got your ocean and yeah just go like that and we have clouds on the other one so we can also add some clouds with some white and no outline and make the clouds White and just add some extra details to our game that's basically our background and yeah and the ground you might want to delete so then yeah and you can just move everything down and basically yeah that's what we have that's basically our background and then you just put on the stage for the level you have and you can duplicate some accessories like the island and the pirate ship you can find these stuff online so I'm just gonna duplicate these and now you have a pretty good setup background to use okay so yeah we're gonna delete that backdrop too and for the cat you can draw your own uh gun it's just really simple some rectangles and then or you can just export it from my project I have the Sprites that you can take I'm gumballs098 and you come over here right click export the thing so then you can use and the balls is just false and then all you have to do is just draw the circles and the dot you can just oh it's by six by six it says six by six so it says six by six over here and that's basically how large you want the dot to beat and the stage you can just design your own stages but we always all we have to do here is make some rectangles and draw some lines to make like the boardwalk type of texture and yeah just make the lines thickness whatever and we just use thickness 10 and we just use Brown so that's basically our backdrop so let's get coding so we're going to start with the cat and then okay so we're gonna show the green flag go to the variables and then we're going to make a new variable called Shoot and I will be creating all the variables we need for this project right now so we also have to make the dot variable the level variable the lives variable um the random variable the random variable and the shoot variable I think we already have the shoot variable my bad we should have five variables green so now we have we start at the green flag and then we're gonna go set set shoot to zero and we're now going to set lives to ten you can really vary the lives if you want to to like 11 12 if you want it to make easier or harder and then set level two one which is the first stage and it'll go to X so this is we're on the cat right now and it'll just go to a position around here so then you could do your shooting it'll make a block called start game and now we're gonna code a little piece and we're gonna put start game under here now we're gonna get start game and we're gonna start with clear graphic effects because whenever you get hit you can you might have noticed that you have like a ghost effect so you might want to clear all of those before you start take a forever Loot and then make your point towards Mouse pointer so you can get the amount cap pointing your way and then you need an if and then and if then the mouse unit and so if then the mouse is down and shoot equals zero which means you can shoot again shoot equals zero so shoot equals zero means that you can shoot again because you can only shoot one shot at a time and if you shoot something that means it will set your shoot to one so we might we have to do that set shoot to one and then create the clone of the oddball and now we're gonna go to the ball and when the green flag is clicked and the green flag is clicked it'll hide in the beginning of course because you do not want it like pointing up and then when I started the Clone as you can see we already created a clone over here so all we can do we can jump straight to when I start as a club it will set size to 50 percent might be a little large real and it will go to the cat because that's where it is coming out of and then it'll Point towards Mouse pointer since it will go whatever way you want to go and then it will go to the front layer so let's just put that in and then show and then a point in Direction and we're going to go to sensing take this block and change this one point in Direction cat and then change this one to Direction you always have to change the back one first and not this one first so always change this one then that one so you have point and direction of cat and then you put a repeating a repeat until touching champ 99 which is the dancing oh I haven't got the person that's dancing so you might have seen that the person was dancing so I'm gonna go after the ball touching champ 99 they'll move 25 steps and if it touches the edge it will bounce and if you could see in our My Demo earlier in this video when you click on it when it touches the edge it'll bounces from the top or bottom and you have a change level by one every single time you win a level so let's put that in level by one broadcast next level and it'll set Shoot To Zero and then it'll delete this click so let's start on another part of the thing so when I start as a clone it'll wait 0.2 seconds this weight is necessary I'll explain to you in a minute and then wait until touching cat okay and I'll broadcast an event called Hit cat so that's if you accidentally shoot yourself then you'll have to use this broadcast and then it will change your life lives by minus one as you can see you have 10 lives so it will change by minus one and it will set Shoot To Zero so you have an opportunity to shoot again and then I'll delete this clone the reason we have this weight over here is because if you don't have this weight then if you set it to like no weight that means oh you'll automatically get hit because the ball spawns right over here so if you don't have the 0.2 weight the ball will just keep on hitting the cat because it will spawn right here and if you that that's why you need to wait because you have 0.2 seconds for the ball to come out of the gun and then now we have an little when I start as a clone it will repeat three wait one second and I'll set Shoot To Zero and we're gonna set Shoot To Zero so get that over here and then delete this clip so now we're going to move on to a large chunk of code so this is to make a randomized outcome every single time you shoot a ball it have probably has a random chance of going to a different direction so so you need this so the ball will delete after three seconds of not hitting anyone because if it just keeps on bouncing between two barriers it gets very annoying and um you'll never hit someone so you have three seconds and the ball will disappear so let's continue to this next piece of code so when I start as a clone go forever you need a if then statement over here so we have if then if it's touching stage then it will set random so this really randomizes the outcomes about where your ball will go so a set random to pick random one to ten this is kind of like a probability type of thing that we're doing here so if we put it if then else under this set like just like that and then if then else and we put an or if we put random equals one or random equals two so this is just like probability foreign and right now we have to put another if then else right into here so if then so if then your random equals one so if you end up drawing a one from the random chance then it will point in Direction negative 60. else It'll point in Direction 60. so if you want a higher chance or a more biased chance of getting like random like getting appointed down to negative 60 you can just decrease this number to a lower number than 10 if you want it to make be more biased and less representative so if you want to do that and right now we have to put it put something in this else over here so else if it's neither one nor two then it will point in Direction Direction where is it you need to multiply so direct put first point multiply so point and direction oh my goodness point and Direction times negative one which means when you shoot it it'll come back to the cat so let's type of the code that we're doing here and I'm gonna try to Clump up this code so you can have a good view on all of this so yeah this is basically our code so feel free to pause right now to check over any of your code okay so let's move back to the cat we are not completely done with the cat because we have to take some other things and account so when I receive hit cat I mean next level if you remember it the broadcast from the ball then it will stop other scripts so we're going to stop all stop other scripts in this Sprite it'll wait 0.2 seconds and it will start game so you can continue to shoot and all that good stuff and then when I receive hit cat then it will stop other scripts in the Sprite put that up here top of the description the Sprite drop P10 it'll change ghost effect by 10 so you can have a little visual effect to look at so change effect change ghost effect by 10. and then you need it if then else right under do not put it in here so right here so if then else if the lives is greater than zero basically you get to rerun the game which is start the game or else it will broadcast game over awesome so now we're just going to go to the stage to do some coding so you go over here when I well I mean when the green flag is clicked it'll go to the back layer and I'll switch costume to costume one and then it'll go to just x 0 y 0. and then when I receive next level it was switch costume to all right so I'll explain to you in a minute what this means joins which caused him to join costume join costume mod so take this one put it into the banana section join costume level mod 10. so right now we have 10 levels so the mod is 10 which is basically the remainder of something so I'll show you in a second what that means so if I put over 10 over here and I put 100 over here the mod is zero because a hundred is divisible by 10. but if I put something else like maybe a seven it's seven because a seven cannot be divisible by ten unless and this cannot calculate decimals so the remainder is seven but what if I wanted to put 11 the remainder is one because eleven um I mean 10 divided by 10 is 1 and there's one remaining because it's 11. and we have 10 levels and you can see it starts with level zero which is basically level 10 and this is level one level two level three level four all the way up to level nine and then this is level ten so that's why we have to have mod 10. and it'll join the costume which is any of these costumes so that's what we have for the stage okay so now we're gonna code champ 99. so when the green flag is clicked it'll go to so first we're going to change the size it's a little I think it's 50. so yeah and I have some exact coordinates for level uh one so I'm just gonna write down this and then and now we're gonna go forever weight 0.2 seconds yep which are one two seconds and next costume so it is dancing so let's start and you see our champ 99 is in the right place for our level one so this is level one and so now we're gonna go to level two and we're gonna put him in a general place so we're probably gonna put them here so let's now go so when I receive next level so if this might be a little tricky so if that so you need it equals first so if then you need a mod again once again because after when you finish the game it repeats back to level one so you want to keep that remainder into account so you can use this for the money and if you use level mod 10 equals one so basically ah there's 10 levels and the level is equal to one it has to be divisible so and this will find the remainder and then we're going to make it go to this position so let's just put that on and we're just going to dupe no we do not want to add a comment so I'm just going to duplicate this so that if then mod is 10 and then it equals 2 this time that it will go to the general position of where level two is so you see you go to level two drag them to a position where you would want him to be so that would be in this case whatever this position is then you duplicate it again and this time we have to check where level three is so where's level three it I should I would want to put him maybe here so let's just now go to here and put in our stuff and just repeat this process oh yeah I'm gonna change this to three every single time just repeat this process over and over again until you find until you find a place where you want to put champ 99 on different places on the map so that's basically the general understanding so I'm gonna go quickly finish this up off camera so yeah okay so I'm on the last part of the level thing so I'm gonna show you and it's for the 10th level which is basically the zeroth level as you can see over here so that's exactly where we're gonna put him so we're gonna write zero instead of ten and we're gonna change him to where we would like him to be yeah so that's basically I have all the code over here um you can if you want to make different maps you can choose wherever you want to put um our character so that's basically for champ 99. so let's move on to the DOT so when the green flag is clicked set ghost effect ghost effect to 100 this is purple we want it red and then you go to this button and then you click pen so you have a whole entire different set of blocks over here so you click drag and erase all if you do not see pen you can click it over here click on this little button over here and you can find all of them there's a lot of new different blocks you can use over here so you can go try those out and we're gonna put in a forever over here and then we're gonna set pen color to let's go about reddish so let's go look yeah maybe that red and then erase all and then make a block called draw dotted line perfect it's called dotted line and then we drag and draw dotted line under there so now Define drawdate so we're gonna set pen size by oh not by two five and then set dot so this is where we have use the DOT and to zero and then go to cat so this is where we because the thing starts on the cat so go to and then pen down so you start drawing and then show and then point towards Mouse pointer because the line if you saw in the demo it follows wherever your mouse goes and then we're gonna have a pretty big repeat until Loop over here so repeat until touching unit workers so repeat until touching Edge so that's when the line stops the dotted line stops or touching stage so that's basically so it doesn't like phase through the stage which would look really weird and then we have the if then statement over here and here and then if then the dot is equal to two so I'm going to put this dot is equal to two so this piece of code just really makes the dotted line become a dotted line and if you do not want this code um it would be just like a laser line and now we have the dot equals two I'm going to set dot to zero and then pen down start drawing process then pen off and then under here I'm gonna get a motion block move 20 steps just like that and change Dot by one and then pen up perfect so now we have our DOT done we're going to go to the backdrops for some coding so when the green flag is clicked I'm gonna set the volume well this is pretty much optional but just so you can hear me better it's a 25 and then forever play sound get the little music up and going dance celebrate this is the song play sound dance celebrate until done so now we're gonna hide up the variables maybe move some around so we're gonna hide this this oh Lies We want to show tied dot then what level down here well it's optional where you put the level and put the lives up here so so I just found out something my line is constantly moving like this and that is not great unless if you really want to keep that we can just go to our you see it's just constantly doing that we can just go like that click edit and then click this little button down here so it's going to be a stationary line and our game should be pretty much finished now yep let's try to win hey can maybe ouch hey so yeah the music should be going yep you guys can probably hear the music and yeah uh this is basically the game that I have made today so please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below so um yeah comment in the comment section below what else video ideas you would like to see on this channel one day and also Christmas is coming up so have a merry Christmas
