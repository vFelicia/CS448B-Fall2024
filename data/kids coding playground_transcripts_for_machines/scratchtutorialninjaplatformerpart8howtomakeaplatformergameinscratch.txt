hello guys welcome back to the channel today we will walk on the Ninja changing the platform after he get into the portal and hopefully will also look into you know what the ninja dying and then restarting him at the platform original platform so look into that and then maybe one more lesson will be the monster welcome okay before we get started please like share and subscribe to our Channel and that anyone who's interested no apology no greatly appreciate alright if you have any question please comment below how aliens other questions okay before we start let's just go over some of the cola we had on each of the sprite so you in case you miss anything you can cannot pause the video and just check it up okay so these are the coal for the my block okay alright so in the bottom here Marco for some of the custom block okay and then here is the kinda the main story of that code and not these two are the Junko which is calling this chunk control here is the action where we are switching between like the different costume for the ninja that he could like to attack with a sword throw a night out or flying on there okay and here is the code that make the ninja a change back to the Oregon the stemming form it is not doing any we're not pressing any button so like if the ninja is moving right so if he's not moving or anything we want to make sure that he come a stay this standing so this is what this call is worn and this is if we hit on the hitbox be trying to push him back out a 101 the direction and then just facing so you see a pushing back up so that's what's that for all right and the this is the ninja for the attack let me zoom in a little bit so this is the start this is the gravity for it this is the attack on back from uh switching to the attack ninja back to the regular ninja this is the throwing up for the ninja that throws the your knife out it's very similar to the attack engine okay and this is the gliding ninja so also similar we have to grab the thing defined for this and on the side here we have the collide okay and then the platform this is the platform coat okay the sign we don't have any code for that the crate this is the code for the crate you can break in with the ninja attacking or the knife okay the water not much there the hitbox not much going there depending on the level is set up a different costume for the hitbox matching the level this is the knife that brawls when we broadcast this message to ninjas throw this knife this is the gym when it's broken well what what's what what happened you know when they after you broke the correct crate it'll had the gym of the you get the gym you get up gym obtain that's when the porno show up when the gym obtain depending on the location so we can kind of set different on location for the portal I only sent two of them we can put one more obviously for level three okay alright so let's get on with the hoe now okay so first thing we are going to do is we're gonna I don't think we have one broadcast you win so let's just upload that I already I was right I just exported from my original game so this is really simple so just have some text here you know use it whatever fun you like I think I have like marker or something the marker front so so here this guy and then the coaster looks simple when this thought in the beginning will hide it when is we get the UN message will show and then will stop everything okay but it's important okay let's move on to the platform so when the so when we portal after we put our oral touch the portal will broadcast next level by me with a fix this rate so the platform when we get next level where to do something right so what we're going to do is we can call the event when I receive next level what the platform is going to do is it gonna switch okay so change this variable we'll see if we need to put some way in between but that's just put no we don't need it right now let's see what happened so we'll change this next level level to by one oh set or gotta grab the wrong one okay this way says no change level by one going to the next level 10 war switch to the custom of the level then what we do is we are going to broadcast the same message on the setup message okay updates and the switch to the next customer what Casa setup setup all kind of make the yeah everything's set up again for the ninja ins and stuff like that so let's go back to the ninja that's channel zoom out for a minute so you see right here I set up what a setup is doing it's gonna call other sprite to set up the location of the platform and everything else right okay let's take a look at this okay we met miss thank you we don't actually need to switch costume because we're gonna call setup setup will actually do the switch costume for us already and we'll podcast the crater create the Cree is actually in the wrong location right now it didn't maybe our platform is move or something let me see what's going on okay I think I stopped in between that hitbox is coming okay the crate is in the right position okay so let's finish this level and see what happened okay let's see okay so we got the gym so as you can see it kind of go to a go to the next level right but we had to stop the ninja back on this side so where to do that and also the crius in the wrong position we also have to change that as well okay so for a crate to be in the right position we can Jenna put the co here if it's level two we are going to whoops we are going to put it in a different location so it is level two which is a tower level right now right let me take out this for speed here okay so let's go back to the platform look at the cream so it is level two we want to put it at let's say this location here okay so go back to the motion what they actually stopped it so you see that dozens change right so with it actually gonna stop this game so you can move it so you move in now no change its wanna go to this location okay so the crate will go to that location and what is thought the ninja man also uh for easier testing right we cannot assay that stage when we're done we want to just focus on stage two we can always say okay start with stage two right and then we can we can do that so the ninja we started moving back for the next level right so what to do that okay so we'll try it again um let me put it back on one now show them try something so let's go to the ninja first let's fix this so when we receive the next level so we will podcast in next level right so we'll say when I receive next level then what I'm going to do is I'm gonna hide the ninja I'll wait for a little bit and then a Highland don't wait for maybe 0.5 after he wins that stage and then I'll say hi I mean you can adjust this later and see and then what we're going to do is we're gonna call this start again which is kind of resetting the game so let's save it now let's test again so we on one so as you can see the ninja kind of pop back over here so let's say we got the gym we'll go into the portal so you see the ninja coming back here if you don't put this weight and he will be immediately coming back maybe we can do that we want let's see if this works better let's try again so the ninjas here let's get the gym we'll go into the portal you see okay and then just back on this side so this kind of reset so what next we want to do is if the ninja should fall off little water we also want to kind of sort of see you get this and if off the water right so all the wonders we want even in your back on this platform so what we need to do is we have some something that we can do like podcast that he's dying do that actually okay let's look for alcohol while we have it look at and we can do it here with this hitbox what we're going to do is we're going to yeah some come here go to control let's add another if statement here let's put this under here and put it back in okay if instead of touching hitbox for say touching water which is our sprite water here right then what we're going to do is we're gonna or Cass message something call time okay you match this video if you don't have one so then just dying is not dead yet but if by slowly dying so if we touch the water which won't change the costume you know are dying can you reuse that for the medusa if he's attacking I don't know too sir so so for now so we'll go back to the ninja weather at the coast or once the podcast time but to say when I receive dying here okay so what we're going to do is we're gonna set some variable I think we have this variable right dying yes no so what we gonna do is we're gonna set this variable right now so go back here we'll say Sept 9 why he's dying okay then we will what we can do is that this of some custom for the ninja that's dying you see have like dying 0 its Bob died it's gonna fall down to the ground campaign right so we're gonna use this costume here from 0 to nine number nine so this is running okay so we'll do what we can do is we can have like a P so we have a run custom index where were Chum right we'll make one more maybe called dyeing custom index okay so this is for the time custom index so what we can do is accept guess that the dyeing custom index to zero that's where the first one start right and what we're going to do is we're gonna repeat 10 times we have ten eleven one and what we're going to do is with the say switch costume right and we are going to use the join condition because we have a name like a letter and then the number right so that we're going to use this joint here so dyeing it B and we want to use the variable so this is the dyeing customer start at zero so T 0 T 1 T 2 like that right and I want to say change the dyeing custom index by one so it's going up by one and what we're going to do is we're gonna duplicate this and we tell it to call the start again so after he died he gonna start over here again let's just try it real quick uh we'll start in the beginning so he kind of dropped down from from the top here and then he'll go up the portal was open he goes in so now let's see if he died so do you see how he died after he died he found four we see he's falling down and then he come backs to this platform here okay so that works well let's see so we have to go to platform three right so we have not coded that so make sure we coded that let's change the platform to three and see how it looks first and we can check walk on it so what changed I mean I didn't run the code right so that's why thing is not right so as I change it to this okay so platform 3 where do we want to go let's see so the crate we can put this box maybe here up here doesn't matter I may be ok if you put them up here let's try with this crate all the way up here so so we just drag this down duplicate this over here make it a level 3 right and go back to motion here this the location that we want check this over here ok so when it level 3 comes this is what a box comes with being up here right and what else ok and what they change the level as well right so we're to go back over here next level right by one then I'll switch to costume this one I think would be okay and then this is also correct switching the custom based on the setup looks ok what double check everything ok um I think I see we'll fix the portal I think we will move the portal to this location for the third and final stage ok so we'll have to do something similar to this very move this down a little bit what ok this looks I think the text will just sound of it mr. bleakie this so a third stage we want to keep the portal on this side and put this back in put this over here ok now let's see let's just test everything so let's see the whoops so let's jump up over here Jim portal open up go back here we jump across Jim or I'll open up and over here when there's so here we can jump down climb down a little bit oops okay so let's touch this and see where so do you win so yeah you CSS you win so the last point is to win right so claim we got pretty much here less at the time that we can use to check how fast I run and then the next video we can walk on the Medusa which is the enemy okay let's go over here this background what we can do is I can use a sound plus uh use mystery I think that sounds pretty good okay so that's how it sounds like okay and we'll go to the Koch event here so we say start and then you can go to sound you can set the volume let's say 50 we don't want to be too loud on the on the music on the background and we can use a forever loop here and we'll say play until done Sothis done okay again and also we are going to make a new variable to keep track of the time but how long the player clean the stage and here in the in the event will start set the timer to zero timer to zero and then we'll have a forever loop okay and will reset the timer reset timer with this timer variable sensing okay okay so this will keep track of how long the become clear the stage so we have two wearable here one is level one is the timer let's save it and let's test it out one more time okay let's try it again okay so you can see up then when it cannot stop the timer we can see how fast it clear next video will walk on the monster the Medusa will try to attack that Medusa and after that I think that's pretty much it with the game and we do have some issue with the platform arm you know some time they need to get stuck in the middle of level three so I mean if you are if you I think best way is not to make too complex of the now with this vignette and it is three couple box here that's a little problem maybe just make it so the stage doesn't have too much of this box that's a little bit easier so that in between box of the probably a big box is fine but if you have something in the air that may seem to get up because of the hitbox or the thing that we put in here alright okay that's it for the video thanks for watching guys have a nice day see
