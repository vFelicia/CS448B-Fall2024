so welcome back guys to the another video on the scrolling platformer so today we'll be covering a lot of stuff today so we uh first do the backdrop change so this is optional you can do it if you want but it'll certainly make your game look much better and then next we will do the play play button and um like the scrolling platformer word up here to let the player know it's a scrolling platformer i guess and then we will do the icons for selection like we did in our twoplayer fighting game um we did icons you can select whichever person you want um this one we made skins to select and then after that we will do the you win and after that we'll do the drop down screen which is the thumbnail so first let's start out with the change backdrop so you can do this if you want it's optional so i will uh get a broadcast and wait uh so you want to broadcast and wait a new message called change backdrop oops change backdrop and then um for here in the um player win after that you want to also broadcast the change backdrop so after each level it will change the backdrop and wait and wait you need to make it change backdrop and wait so now we want to work onto the backdrop so let's go into our backdrop so right now we don't we only have the mouse code well we will add the change backdrop so when i receive the change backdrop uh get an if then statement if the level is equal to one level is equal to one then we can switch the backdrop to backdrop one the first backdrop this one and then i'm gonna duplicate this if it's equal to level two then we'll switch to backdrop two if the level is level three then i guess we can switch uh to backdrop three so our backdrop one two this is two and backdrop three the one we drew so uh let's duplicate this one last time if the level is equal to four i'm just going to do a backdrop to backdrop one again at the end you can do any actually so i'm going to get one flight clicked you want to switch back up to the first backdrop in the beginning and then you get a forever loop and next we want to play some music so i already have some music downloaded so i got like the horizon bound music from the uh uh two player fighting game so i'm just gonna get a forever loop um place that horizon down until done and then next you can do any music but i'm just doing this maybe you can get a sound from the library or you can download it from online i'm just doing this music so as you can see when you play it now the backdrop will change let me collect these collectibles when i get to the next level the backdrop should change as you can see the backdrop changed so um when we go to the third backdrop it should change the backdrop three so next let's work on the play button so i already have it in here just going to drag it i already have a play button and these are words i guess let's just say scrolling platformer so let's work on the play button first so let's go to our play button so uh we're going to make it so when the play button touches the mouse pointer it'll get bigger and then you'll grow smaller again so when flat clicked um you want you want to set set the size to zero percent so it'll grow big it'll like it's kind of like uh when like it sets the size to zero percent but then it gets it bigger again so then it'll look like it's growing the beginning i guess makes your game look much better of course so i set my thing at x zero y negative ninety so next you want to get a show in the beginning you always want to show forever if touching mouse pointer then um you want to change this oh if else sorry it's an if else get the if else so this is um if it's touching mouse pointer then you want to change the size change size by um you need division sign so change 120 120 minus 120 minus the size of the play button which is 100 so 20 size and then you divide it by three and then we want to set ghost effect set ghost to 30 so when it's touching the mouse pointer it can like ghost a little bit and then you can do just duplicate this code but instead we'll do 100 here so this is just making it so if it the um if it's not touching the mouse pointer then it will shrink back down so instead we'll just make it go back into negative 10. okay and now you want to get a uh if when the sprite is clicked so you can play this on pop you can just do this if you want it's optional um you want to hide broadcast um start game to let every other sprites know to start the game once this button is clicked so let's broadcast a new message start game so we have start game so now let's broadcast it to all the other sprites so we want to stop the script after that stopped the script now let's go to the player so for here it said when flag clicked let's take it the one fly clicked and instead when i receive start game it will run everything under it so game right here and next let's work on the words so i have them right here i just wrote scrolling platformer you can just write that and then next first words it's the code for the shrinking and growing is the same so just drag and drop that in here like that and then when i receive a start game you want to hide because you don't want it to show anymore after the play button is clicked so you can hide it um and next let's work on the icons so in the um um what is that the two player fighting game i taught you guys how to make these buttons um so if you have not watched that video be sure to watch that first or so what we did was just draw a circle so let me do like this so we just drew a circle with outline um copy pasted the costume for the um square thing the player and then duplicated it and then we just made it a different color and shrink the eyes eyes as well and we grouped it and then for the second one we just made a wording with selected and changed the border and the color so now let's work on the buttons so let's go to the code so when flag clicks i'm gonna go to this x and y position um negative one second five y zero let's go to the front layer switch costume to the first costume in the beginning so it won't be selected and then you want to show in the beginning um and then when i receive start game uh starting then on hide so when the game starts you want of course you want to hide the buttons and we'll need a new variable let's name it player color and don't forget to make it in all caps because uh because um it's global variable like rich patch said i am still doing that same rule as you can see all the global variables are all in caps so when the sprite is clicked so the code is similar here with the two player fighting game so when the sprite is clicked then we want to set the player color to red because this is the um this is the um a red button so when you click this it'll set it to red and then after that we want to broadcast a new message called selected color selected color and then we want to switch costume to the second costume so then it'll appear as selected and then when i receive selected color and i receive selected color then get an if else statement if the player color is equal to red the variable player color is equal to red red then switch costume to the second costume to make it selected else we wanted to switch costume to the first costume so all the code for the characters are all the same just drag and drop it except for the x and y position so i have to remember to add that drag and drop it here and okay so we have all the code right here um in x and y position for the green i did it at zero zero um and the costumes um let me delete this real quick it's the same thing i just made it a different color green of course you can do any color you want and then instead of player color is red we set it to green and then um instead of player color right here we have to do green as well so there you have it now let's um drag and drop it to the character three okay so now we have all the code in character three um let's change the colors instead of green we have to do blue and instead of playing color here we have to do blue blue and there we have it that's it and one last thing i forgot to change the x and y position where here i did 175 and the y position is zero okay so back at the player we have to make it switch costumes of course so zoom in so right now we don't have any costumes right here so i already have it in my backpack so what you would do is um go in here and copy paste it into here or duplicate this and then make it the same color as this so i already have it right here okay so i have three costumes costume one costume two costume three so right here right before this we want to add ifthen statements if the player color is equal to red player color is equal to red then we'll switch the costume to one so it will become the red costume instead and just duplicate this if the player color oops is equal to green and we'll switch the costume to the second costume and let's duplicate this one last time if the player costume is equal to blue then we'll switch the costume to the third costume so we have all the costume switching now and let's play it i guess and one last thing we had to change the x and y position for the words so let's change it to um negative 15 this is what i had before so negative 15 and y is 120. so now let's try it out so let's play the game so as you can see when you put your mouse hover on top of it it'll get bigger and i'm going to select the blue one so as you can see it selects to the corresponding color everything still works so i'm just going to go to the next level to show you guys if the change backdrop still works as you can see it worked so now we shall continue to our uh you win let's work on the winning so i already have it my backpack i think yeah you win right here and let me drag this no that's not it um so the un and um that's it for now so and also i forgot thumbnail yeah it's where you win we're gonna add some code so we're gonna make a new variable called stop timer make it in all caps because it's global variable stop timer so this is for the drop down screen we'll need a variable so unlike the in another video i taught you guys how to make a drop down screen i use the reset timer but this time we will have to use a variable called stop timer because um it it keeps on um for the drop down screen because we are also using the timer to um calculate how long it takes the player to get to the end so right now let's work on the uin and when i receive start game then you want to show the variable timer we'll deal with the stop we'll deal with the stop timer later we want it to go to zero zero though you win wait until level is equal to four level is equal to four and then when the level is equal to four then we wait one second just to give it a little bit pause just give it a little bit time then we will show it or also show a little bit too early then we want to hide the variable level level and then we broadcast another message we can brought call it a stop timer stop timer stop timer and then next we'll do a um when i receive start game um forever set the timer timer of the um how long it takes to finish to that actual timer right here um and when i receive start stop timer stop timer you want to stop other scripts in the sprite stop other scripts in the sprite and when flag clicked um you want to hide and hide the variable timer hide variable timer and set the timer to zero oops number one set timer to zero okay now we have the wind down we can work on the thumbnail finally this will be our last one to do so um like i mentioned earlier the reset timer will not work since the timer that calculates how long it takes the player to complete the game will interfere with the thumbnail thing so let's get one flight clicked um we'll go to zero zero and let's go to the front layer and hide in the beginning gonna hide um and next you to get the set stop timer to 0.1 we'll set the timer to 0.1 set the stop timer to 0.1 so what this does is detect if the stop sign is getting clicked so forever uh set the stop timer to timer the variable timer i mean not the variable timer the sensing block timer plus oops plus 0.1 so it will always make the stop timer a little bit of 0.1 seconds faster than the timer so always be faster than timer so when the timer when timer is greater than the stop timer hide the variable level and hide the variable timer um i want it to go to zero y is 300 so it'll be off the screen show after that you want to show when the timer is greater than stop timer glide maybe 0.5 seconds oops 0.5 seconds to zero zero okay um so i just got this uh thumbnail from one of our video thumbnails so you you can make your own i guess just draw it so now let's try out the game let me save my project so let's play it and when you press the stop button this thing comes down and we can make these hide when um when it at the end so to do that to make these hide uh we simply just get the timer thing if it's greater than the stop timer then hide and just drag and drop that to all three of the button selector selections um i'll see okay and right here so now let's play the game they're all hide so let's let's play this one time i'll demonstrate it i will now demonstrate the game so you you cannot select two of them i would select the blue one so it's easier to see it and there's all these selected blue ones so um collect so i'm pretty sure it's working so that's it for this video guys and oh yeah and to fix that you can instead of um for this instead of doing front layer if you don't want that sometimes it will not go in front of it so you can make it go for 99 layers instead this will work so as you can see when you play it it'll go to the front because this is in the front layer so to fix that we will have to add the um same code right here just drag and drop it to the player it's going to be somewhere here right here so that's it for the video guys as you can see when you click the stop covers everything so thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share and subscribe and uh see you guys in the next video you
