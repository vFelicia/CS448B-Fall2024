welcome back guys it's kids going playground here and today we're back for another video in scratch and today we're making a game called hero War but this is just the demo we'll post parts for of this game later as you can see it's a pretty complicated game so it it's probably the most complicated game I've ever made so let's just show you the demo so in the beginning there's some music if you can hear that and there's three Heroes that you can choose from and you can see they're live so it default is the elf Warrior but the elf Warrior and then the Grand Master Mage and then the fairy queen so you can shoot choose either three Heroes and then I'll choose Al Warrior to show you so all of them have three powerups and then the zombies will be chasing you so there's the armored zombie the Speedy zombie and the regular zombie and um You probably to you have to shoot them down with your basic attack see I'm shooting down the arrows and then each character has three um three powerups as you can see over here so the elf Warrior powerups are the spectral Arrow which will go through all the enemies and do massive damage to everything just just like that and as you can see it keeps a counter over there and you'll get it over time so the death arrow is the second ability it can has the capability to oneshot any like low class peon it cannot onshot any boss or anything it'll just do a lot of damage to the bosses and then we have the Griffin which is a third ability so it'll flap its wings just like that and drop a bomb which will kill everything which is a really strong ability and these will just come over time there's also three bosses in this game well I'm going to demonstrate all the hero abilities first and all the heroes so the grandmas Mage he shoots um stars which do a lot of damage and this uh so his first ability is to teleport so you see over here he'll teleport all things back just like that I'm going try to get another one so wait let's wait um and then you teleport them back just like that and then the second ability gives it the capability to dismantle all armor and it's really strong it's armored enemies as you can see right there he dismantled the armor and it's just really easy to kill right after that look I dismantle all their armor and it's really strong against um uh armored enemies and the third ability is The Apprentice he shoots Stars at the enemies that do massive damage to armored enemy so the Mage basically is really good against armored enemy so it's a turret and just it'll just shoot a certain amount and certain rounds at the enemies that and it just shoots wherever your mouse is so that's basically the powerups of the Mage and let's demonstrate the fairy queen so she is one of the strongest Heroes although her base attack is really weak as you can see like that she's not that strong but she has really strong Powers so her first ability has the capability to heal her back to Max health so that that is really strong that's one of the strongest abilities and then we also have the arrow which is a Teleport Arrow I'll demonstrate that if I got another one see if you shoot it it justes it teleports you to wherever that Arrow lands and it does a lot of damage wait I'll show I'll try to show you let's heal back so oh see it does a lot of damage against enemies and then the third ability is a shield it'll come up and it block enemies and teleport them back while you can shoot them safely from a far distance which is why fairy queen is a really good hero but that's basically all the three Heroes and then after that uh there's going to be three bosses in this game so let's uh let's do that I'm going to try to get to the bosses so this might be a time lapse so let's just go so as you can see the first boss after 250 score he'll come out and he has 10,000 Health he's The Siege monster and then he does a lot of damage if you get into him and he summons these baby blue peons have lots of health actually um and they'll follow you and do a lot of damage so I'm going to use the Griffin here to try to clear some of those peons out just like that and then I'll use the arrows to lower its HP uh so then the siege monster can die so as you can see the second boss comes at 1,250 score and it's the old one so he summons poison vines that poison you if you touch them as you can see and they'll do damage over time and he doesn't move but he does shoot these large projectiles that do 30 damage and try to hit you so see I got poisoned there oh gosh let's try to kill him let's try to kill him I have a griffin real quick oh gosh I'm poison as you can see the old one is dead so time for the last boss and then the mysterious man comes up and gives us some heals as you can see our lives are back up he gives us 1,000 health so as you can see the last boss the final and last boss after 2,000 score the zombie King will come up he's really strong he has 15,000 health and he steals your lives so he does 50 damage to you and heals 500 health every single time and he can also summon peons which makes him the hardest boss by far as you can see he just stole my hearts and healed himself which is really annoying so let's just try to beat him oh yeah he's stealing my health right now this is not funny the death Arrow are really strong though and you see if I don't have the item it'll say wait before using this item cuz I'm clicking two right now to activate the death Arrow oh gosh I'm about to lose oh no I lost wait I'll I'll pause it and I'll get there real quick as you can see I just beat the old one again and then the mysterious man just healed me again so I'm close to this time I'm going to beat him bro okay the zombie King's out second attempt let's see I got Griffin out it's really strong I have all my death arrows I'm spamming him right now oh no he's stealing my health it's all right I have oh I'm out of death arrows oh no still 18,000 I'm going to use all my spal arrows right now okay all right we won this time there's no way there's no way his peons aren't strong enough Griffin come down let's go you stealing my lives aren't going to do anything sir okay let's go let's go let's go this guy's low Griffin all right this should be my last Griffin oh gosh one more oh and I killed him just like that so so there's the you win and that's when you beat the zombie King and of course there's also a game over once you lose and uh you can't use two third abilities at the same time or else uh it it won't work cuz there's an in progress function so yeah so those are the three Heroes and the ending so that's the three Heroes and of course um it's probably beable it's it's beatable by every single hero because I've beat it before but uh fairy queen just takes a lot more skill but it's really good so that's basically it for this video it's just the demo part one is going to come out soon as well as the other parts so stay tuned for that anyway see you guys next time
