welcome back guys it's kidscreamplayfront here and today we're back for another video um and it's a baseball game so if any of you guys play baseball please comment in the comment sections below so then you can say i know that you guys love playing baseball i don't play baseball but i know how it works so there's the picture here and there's the battery here so i'm gonna demo the game so there's a countdown two one so my brother is here to play with me hello so it's a two player game in the top right corner we have the strike so let's say you don't hit a shot you'll get a strike and once you get three strikes you're out and the score every time you hit a shot use the one arrow key to pitch and left arrow key to hit and every single shot you hit you'll get one score um it's just like an infinite game so unless if the battery loses i'm just gonna um lose right now so just pitch one to pitch and left arrow key to remember and it says game over for the batter so um let's start coding so yeah so it's game over and it all ended the batter lost and the pitcher basically won so i'm gonna make a new project and let's stop so um before i start please like share and subscribe and bring that notification spell and i do have a gaming channel now we have a gaming channel um videos might be going up every week on saturdays or sundays uh sometimes i might post twice a week on the gaming channel so you guys can watch that please subscribe to it please like the video we only have one right now and please share it to friends and ring the notifications bell so um we can play any game that you want and we can try out what game you want and but the the thing is that um our gaming channel right now has currently only three subscribers so and the video i have it has 15 views so please help me get that um uh channel up so anyways before we start let's name this baseball game and the first thing we're going to work on is the countdown i have this in my sprite i'm in my backpack so it's very simple i just decided this to make it um much much uh faster so it has three two one and play ball so when you start it will show let's show this it will show and it'll go to the middle i think i already have out the middle but just put it and then we'll wait one second uh nevermind it's gonna change the costume to costume three after the godu and then put the weight one second over there and then we're gonna duplicate this two and this is one and then we're gonna do play ball play ball click one second hide and broadcast pitch oh you see put this on capital letters i think i have caps lock on yeah there we go um and as you can see it's working frequent alright oh oh it's working correctly so play ball look three two one turbo so second thing we're gonna work on is the picture and oh yeah i have to get the background first so let's get the background real quick this one baseball two and the pitcher stands on this one i'm pretty sure the pitcher stands on this one but that's too close to the batter so we're gonna make him stand on this place so yeah so let's work on the picture so let's just set the size to 40 real quick we have to move them on to here so we're gonna put the when the green flag is clicked i'll switch costume to picture a and i'll go to the position i have and then you'll set size to 40 percent so um we're gonna work on this next script when i receive pitch switch costume to picture a it'll go forever and ever and ever and ever and you need an if then statement and we're going to make a variable real quick and it's called ball moving so then if you get and first so if the the key key one press so that's the that is uh supposed to be what the um picture you need one to um throw the ball so uh if the key one is pressed then ball moving equals n so n is no um so you don't want the ball in the pitcher to keep on spamming the ball so it'll repeat four times next costume oh wait 0.1 seconds and a broadcast move ball oops i i have it running i'm gonna turn that off so and so um we are gonna work on the baseball next so next thing we're gonna work on is the baseball definitely get that so when the green flag is clicked you have to set the ball moving to n it'll go to x so you need the x position the the tricky block the x position of the picture and just get one of these the y position of the pitcher plus 30 because you want the ball to be a little bit higher because when he throws it it'll be like up here so then the battery can hit it so that's why we need that it'll set size to the size that we want it to be 30. and it'll hide and when i receive move ball it will set ball moving to y which stands for yes so when the ball is moving we don't want the pitcher to throw another ball so that's why we need ball moving to y now point in direction 90 now turn 0 degrees your show so we need to repeat until we're here touching the edge go move a pick random of steps which is a move pick random of steps eight to twelve so oh so pick the speed of the ball so sometimes it's quick sometimes it's slow so yeah we need that and we did if then and and then you're going to touch the edge right here and then it's touching the edge and the ball is at a certain position which is the ball is the ball is greater than 220 the x position then it will um it will broadcast strike so let's put in a strike and then strike so i'm gonna i'm gonna um i'll work on this next script so this basically means the picture the um baller the the the batter she'll be right here so when the ball passes it it'll go back to the dude so so if then it's touching the edge it'll go to set ball moving to end hide and it will go to the position where the picture is so so it will go to back the position it will go back to the position from here so we just have to duplicate this and hide the uh enter and throw away the set size to 30 and the hide let's put that in there first and then we need a stop this script so stop the script so yeah um we'll also have to work on this next um piece of code which is which is from the batter so there we go the batter so the batter when the green flag is clicked it will set score to zero when this variable switch costume to batter a which is the first costume of this of course because it's better a and it's the one that's looking like this right now you go to this position so um i'm just gonna rename this first so um and then i'll set size to 40. so 40. so i'm going to make the y5 so i have that coordinate so it'll be down there so that's why and then um when i receive pitch it will go forever and ever and ever and if the if then the left the key the left arrow is clicked which is to offer the pi the hit to the ball um it will repeat four times four costumes next costume next costume wait 0.1 seconds and there i forgot to do something so we can do this duplicate this and i forgot to put this over there so next thing we have to do is when i receive pitch again it will go forever if then the and you need to end if the you need one of these two if if oh put this in here put this in here so if the costume number is greater than two so c and d two three and four then it will it is touching the baseball then it will broadcast home run so there we go and then uh we're gonna go back to the picture so i mean back to the baseball and then we're gonna work on the home run and yeah so home run so when i receive home run it will stop other scripts in this sprite it'll place start sound tennis hit so before i keep on going we need to make this a little bit louder four times that sounds really good and um so we're going to start the sound and then point in direction 90. so it's point negative 90. so the baseball's flying the left way and then it'll turn uh pick random of 20 20 negative 20 to 45 degrees you know repeat until touching the edge and then it will be moving 15 steps oh change score by one so let's put that right there and i'll set ball moving to n so reset and i'll hide and then i'm just gonna duplicate this because it's the same thing so reset all of that and so next thing we have to work on is the um the x outs the strikes so let's test this out countdown throw hit playing by myself so as you can see it's working but we still have to make the strikes next and the game over so i do have the strikes in my backpack so she's gonna draw three big x's and one of them like this one isn't like this so when the green flag is clipped so we're gonna be switching the costumes of costume two costume three and costume four three x's one x two x three x's no x so that's what we're going to be changing through so when the green flag is clicked i have it at the right position go to 169 y 145 and then it will switch costume to costume one and then when i receive strike then i'll go next costume and if if then the costume number is equal to four then i'll broadcast game over because um the the pitcher can win too so basically the costumes there's four costumes so when it gets to the the fourth one with the three axis it'll lose so we have to make the game over sprite let's write it turn it into red and then let's get the text so i'm gonna choose the regular font sans serif so let's change this to san serif and then write it so game over so let's write this game over so i'm going to put the exclamatory the exclamation mark over here so it's very small right now let's make it bigger i think you have to move it a little bit more over there oh we're actually going to use the position to position it so when the green flag is clicked it will go to zero zero so zero it'll hide and then when i receive game over don't show no stop ball okay um we also have to add something on the baseball so we're gonna make it high when the game is over so when i receive game over hide so let's test it out so before we um we show you um let's hide the ball moving and we also have to get the music so uh let's get the music so i'll set volume to 30 because we want to hear the sharp loud tennis the tennis hit with the baseball hit and then so let's change the volume set volume to 30. and then we're gonna go forever and we're going to play sound drive around so you can use any sound you want of course but i'm using drive around so let's test it out so i do not have anyone to play with me right now so this is the countdown and then the um baseball person throws the baseball one x for the picture which is also me both of them and then let's see if it works it works very directly so um that's it for this video and we'll also show you the gaming game over before we end this so that's it for this video so i'm gonna show you all the costumes before i go so this is the costume for this is all the code and they're not costumes for the countdown this is all the code or the picture so feel free to pause whenever you need it the the um the the baseball has a lot of code so let's review it one by one so feel free to pause and then we got uh all these other ones so we can let's put them near each other so then you guys can see them all so that's basically it all the code you can also zoom into the the youtube you know to zoom in so you can also see the code more closer and better not much code and that's it for the batter strikes that's it and game over that's it backdrop oh yeah backdrop backdrop that's it that's really zoomed in so anyways i think that's it for this video please like share subscribe and ring that notification bell and also don't forget to comment if you play baseball and don't forget to subscribe uh
