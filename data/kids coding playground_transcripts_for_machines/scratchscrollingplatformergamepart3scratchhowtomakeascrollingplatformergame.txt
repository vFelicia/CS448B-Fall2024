so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding playground today we're doing the third part for this uh scrolling platformer so i'll just go through what we'll be doing today so today we'll be just doing the jumping moving around now the um platform actually stops you and we will be doing the x scrolling and however there are a couple bugs when you go to the bottom you're not dead we will do that in future videos and you can glitch to the top like that even though you're not jumping so we will do that later so now let's go to our previous project so let's go to our project go to my stuff so i will scroll through the code just to let you guys look at it if you missed anything so just get anything you missed scroll a little slow okay so now let's go to the platforms that's all the code for the platforms pretty simple not too much so now we will be adding the scrolling so let's go to your play game when i receive play game script okay so you want to get the set scroll x to the x position set scroll x to x position so now you have scrolling x scrolling so now we have x scrolling that's cool now we have the scrolling physics down let's go on to the um player so for the player um i believe we have to make a new block let's make a new block so we already have the change player x by now we're going to make the change player y by change player y by change player y by add one input and put s y in there like that press ok so we're going to define this block real quick so we will change the y to whatever parameter is in here so just drag that into here and then we want to call the position so that's just to const position is just to constantly shift it to the scroll so it'll scroll with it go to the position of the scrolling so after that you want to get a repeat until repeat until not touching platforms so repeat until not touching platforms platforms and you want to change the y by one so this is just to make it go back up a little bit so it won't fall through the platform just trying to make it even out on the platform so you want to change the y by one recall the position so it'll keep on positioning it and you want to go to the tick script and you want to change the y player y by negative 8. so now i will show you guys as you can see it doesn't look good it's just falling through the like a little bit and it's keep on bouncing up and down up and down and when you move it's moving very slow and we don't want that so what you want to do is go to the tick click right click click edit and run screen without refresh so now it will not fall through because it's running the screen without refreshing it so you cannot see the movement because it's super fast so now you have the scrolling and now it doesn't keep up bouncing up and down on the platform so let's go to the player y position so in the tick custom block uh we change the instead of this we can change the player s so we can change the s y the speed y by negative two and we can change the player y by the s y speed y so that if you to or to fall to the ground from a higher ground you'll fall faster so like in real life you would fall faster if you fell from a building rather than a house so it's basically saying that if you fall from a higher place like up here then you would go fall faster then we need to change the player y to the sy and then we would need to set the sy back to zero up here in the y position if not if the sprite will not fall through the platform to make the sprite not fall through the platform we want to put the set s y back to zero right here all right so now let's go on to the player position so and right before i continue i would like to show you if you take out the zero what would happen it will fall through as you can see when you move you'll fall through but if you reset the speed y back to zero everything is perfectly fine all right now we have all that down let's go to the uh tick custom block let's get and let's move all this down wait so let's put this under here oops so let's put this up here get an if then statement if the key up arrow i'm just going to duplicate this if the key up arrow up or the w key is pressed so we can also do wsd then we will set the sy the speed y to 16 that's the normal default 16 and then you can just pop that right under here so use this at this code to allow the player to jump set the jump height to 16 pixels but if the player holds up it will keep on jumping you can like double jump and triple jump because this negative two is not enough to override the 16. so i'll demonstrate one time so as you can see you can like jump like flappy bird like when you hold it you just get stuck on top and fall back down it's like this is good for like flappy bird games or something but not for a platform game scrolling platform game like we're doing so we do not want that so we will fix that so let's go back to the player y position this define change player y by block so we're gonna get a we're gonna set the inair variable we have so the inair variable it's for the sprite only remember all the lower case ones not in all caps are for the player only so remember to set it for the only for the player so you want to set the in air back to zero and up here you want to change the in air by one so what the in air oops so the in air the longer the player is in the air like when it's jumping um the bigger the value of the in air gets and when it's touching the platforms it'll reset the in air back to zero because it's not true the player is not in the air so next we want to add an ifthen statement to the tick go here and an ifthen statement wraps around the set sy to 16 so now it will not be able to jump like flappy bird so now just add this if in air is less than four then we can set the sy to 16. so add the statement so if the player is in the air for a bit it will allow the player to jump but if a player is coming down a slope or leaving the platform they are allowed to jump so add that if then statement wrapped around the sy so yeah so now let's play it so that's all the code as you can see now you can jump perfectly fine you cannot jump like flappy bird anymore you can jump normally however there are a couple bugs as you can see i'm not jumping you'll teleport to the top we can fix that in the next video and let me add something in the platforms the costumes so if you i were to draw like a line so like a green color okay so i'm gonna get the oops it's supposed to be like this i'll just draw the line just like get a green color okay maybe five thickness uh actually let's increase it to ten okay so i will zoom out a little bit let's draw oops let's make green color okay so i will draw like a line from this side let's hold down shift i've done shift i'll just draw it like about this long and i'll show you what happens when i do that so when i play it the player can automatically teleport up like that and go up there we will fix that bug in the next video but when you on top it will stop the player but when it's on the bottom and jumps up it will go through so we will fix that in the next video i will delete this real quick we're not gonna end the video quite yet we can teach you guys how to draw the background so i'm gonna i think i have to import it or i think i already have it oh i i don't have it yet let me just uh oh yeah i have a backpack so i'm gonna drag this one so this one these two we got from online let me just delete this one uh this one we just made ourselves we drew this one so we're going to teach you guys how to draw your backdrop so let's open a new uh backdrop so first i'm going to explain what everything in here is so for the back for the blue sky we made it two different colors so it can like fade out on the bottom so it'll look better and then for the trees we just did uh lines with the thickness of 80 it's just like make the trees some of them are 70 when you go up it will get thinner 50 60 and same with the other tree these we put vines on the side that are 20 thickness and then we have a tree branch that's just 60 thickness with the line and then we have a sun that's just a normal plain circle with a yellow color with no outline and then here we just drew some of these uh blocks with the um a square tool like right there so i will show you guys how to draw it so i'm gonna go back drop so first we can get the back the color so we just set it like that just draw a square no outline we do not want any outline so we just drew it like that center your backdrop next we want to draw this and one thing before we do the sun we have to do the double fill like we said like the fade so we're going to make this a light blue color the second one a light blue color like that and then we're just gonna fill the backdrop with that so there's a little fade on the bottom the top is darker and the bottom is lighter so now let's draw the trees so we just got like a um we just got like a thickness of let's we just got the trees as a thickness of 60. we can draw the ground actually it's just a gray color with no outline i'm just gonna go here draw like a gray block just so just like so let's draw some blocks like that just you can randomize them and we have another block on top and then we just got a 60 thickness tree branch and a tree trunk just draw it like that hold down shift so you get a straight line don't forget to hold down shift and then we can hide that with another grey block which make it go to the front make the other gray block go to the front and then we can draw some lines for the tree like thickness of 80. so we're going to get the line hold down shift so you get a straight line for both trees and then you can just stretch it out a little like we're doing and then we can make it like 70 thickness now and then hold down shift to get a straight line and then maybe we can do it to 60 this time like that oops sorry about that maybe we can like center that a little do it for the other one and finally we can do a thickness of 50 and we'll just finish off the top layer like that hold down shift and finally we can draw like some vines with a thickness of 20. you this is optional if you want it just hold down shift so you get a straight line draw like one longer one shorter just like jazz up your little game backgrounds are very important in games same with music and then we'll add the sun for the final thing for the yellow color we'll just draw a circle with no outline hold down shift so you get a perfect circle since the sun is in front of everything we'll make it go to the back layer but make the blue go to the back the very back layer so select the we'll select the blue background select the tree we'll just group up the tree first let's group up the tree let's make it to go to the forward front layer and there you go so that's how you draw it so we're just going to delete it now so just we just demonstrated how to draw it so that concludes today's tutorial so we're just gonna do a recap we just drew the backdrop now we can jump around there's scrolling physics um there's still some bugs however we will fix that in the next video so thank you guys for watching please like share and subscribe to our channel for the latest uploads on our channel and i'll see you guys in part four for the platformer see ya guys you
