hello and welcome back to the kids calling playground channel today we'll continue working on this uh platform ninja game um i think we're almost done just a couple more uh things to do with the ninja and then changing the uh the uh the platform once we you know get the portal get into the portal and also you know putting the enemy in place i think we're maybe a couple more lessons okay so before we begin please uh like share and subscribe to our channel and uh tell your friend also like you know anyone is interested learning scratch and uh uh please tell them and then they get subscribed subscribe to our channel as well okay let's begin okay so what where we left off last time was we worked on the ninja throw and then the ninja attack also uh we can go over to co a little bit um just to see make sure that you know you're missing anything you can take a look so we're gonna move through pretty quick here uh just some of the code you can pause the video if needed right to just check the code okay and we have this on top and here so this is our main ninja and this one is our attack ninja this is the ninja for the throw uh throw in the knife this is the platform don't have anything for the sign the crate we have this kill water set uh very simple and then there's a hitbox one and this is that small knife that will be thrown out from the ninja okay so uh let's begin i will work on the uh the code for the ninja gliding down uh what you can do is you can create a new sprite or you can just duplicate the one that you had earlier let's just duplicate this one we'll put it over here we'll call ninja clay okay we'll go inside here we'll change the costume we'll trash on this guy here and then we'll upload the sprite that we have um let's see um here okay we'll do the glide so we're using this guy here so zero to nine open that up okay we'll trash the first one this no we need okay same thing we're doing zero g zero g one two three uh four five six seven eight and nine so g zero to g nine this is the gliding okay all right we have the uh sprite for that okay let's go to the code um so now once more let's take a look this is pretty much sim uh sanding as before not much change here uh same thing right go to front lane go following the ninja same thing we don't need this we are going to change this instead of um this will do number three here we'll do three and we'll broadcast a new message call glide three let's call it three because that's number three okay and we'll go back over here this ninja we'll select glide three okay if he's not dying uh what we're going to do is um we're gonna add something we're gonna have to change the gravity so we won't go down as fast okay that's a set gravity set okay we can put that over here um set gravity well i think default is like one alternate negative 0.15 something like that negative one was the default and um after that uh we have to uh here this replete we are going to have another one actually we want to glide all the way to the bottom so we have to say this will copy this we'll throw in here this is until it goes to the end let's drag all this out put this uh repeat until it goes to touching the platform and keep on repeating this costume so if it's higher it'll go longer okay okay and then we'll put these in okay all right okay let's go back to the uh ninja um we'll insert show two we are going to make a new message that is show three so this is going to tell the ninja to show back up after this is done we'll duplicate this here we'll call it show three you can zoom in a little bit okay with one for the attack two for the throw three for the glide okay and also we want to set the gravity back to one since we change that rate so let's say set gravity back to negative one okay okay let's test it out real quick and see how it goes okay we'll jump up and push three as you can see he can't glide down i slowly come down okay all right we're done with the glide so um so you can see it's kind of slow down a little bit right before it drops okay all right we're done with glide right now now we're gonna work next on the gym uh the after we um you know destroy the crate well we want to uh we will broadcast something called crate broken right so we'll walk on the the gym so basically we're gonna make a colorful gym here uh what i already had i already had a sprite for that if you don't just download one online or clear the background whatever you like or something else doesn't have to be a gym but uh we'll just put a magic gym there okay so what we say is uh in the beginning when start uh we're gonna clear the graphics so we're gonna make this gym kind of flashing okay so we'll clear it back to normal and then we'll have to throw in this forever loop in here and what we're going to do is kind of change the look the color back effect by 25 and then we're gonna check if it touch the ninja so the ninja touch it okay so we'll say sensing touching the ninja so we'll add a sound here okay fairy dust is already added earlier okay so we just say stop sound you don't have to do wait until done because you let it run in the back it's fine and it will continue to move on to the next code and let's say we just say think for one second say again obtain okay and then after that we want to hide this gym then we have to broadcast a message okay we're gonna podcast a message here and a new message say jim okay so that means the ninja picked up the gym okay um we are going to have some check here so the beginning is high when the crate is broken or show okay and then also um i think uh we it checks it right it broadcasts when the where the crate is at right yeah okay so what you can do is um you can wait for the setup for where the crate is going to be set up so what we're going to do is we can do this go back to the gym you don't need another message broadcasting from the crate where it is because the crate cannot wait for the map to generate before it creates right and the gym has a way for the crate to be generated before the gym can go there so what you can do is just you can use the same um uh wait message that setup message is fine what you can do is you can also hide it in the beginning right so in the beginning you can say hi okay and you can say here when i set up i also want to hide as well because let's say you move on to the next stage you want to do that and you can put a weight we'll wait for two seconds for everything to uh set up anyway the ninja's not gonna be able to get to the crate i guess i guess maybe this map he can get into two seconds but if it's like jumping now we have to get there we'll get there two seconds now let's put him one second okay i think it's good enough and then we will say go to i think that will be enough let's just see if it's enough go to create okay let's stop this game so if i break the crate you'll see the gym if it all works out okay let's try it out okay so i move over here so you can see right after i get the crate after i break the crate you see the gym and then i can walk the ninja there to obtain the gym so that is pretty much it so what we can do is when this gym obtain gym broadcast we can create the portal so what we can do right now is we are going to create a portal sprite i think i already have it downloaded let me see if not you can just um did a couple times long time back i don't remember let me see what it is so okay this is the portal i download from the website so what you can do is you can just import this gif what it does it'll actually create all the um all the uh icons custom for you in the gym so we create all this custom you see like a kind of spinning right effect for the portal so what you want to do is after the uh the the gym is obtained we're going to create a portal for the ninja to move to the next level okay so what we want to do is go to the code we will go control say start when green flat calc okay we're saying well we can go to the back layer because we want him not to hide the uh hide the ninja or something so go back to black layer one time okay and then um when green flat click right well i'll go back to the back layer and also on one high in the beginning as well all right okay then we will i guess that depending on where we want to put him it might be a different location let's say if they obtain the gym we'll want to put the portal here uh maybe i don't know 50 let's see 50 still kind of big okay maybe 40 will put them at this position as you can see you can put the portal in different location right it could be here this map but not here on the other map 35 and 35 is good okay so for now for the starting map we can put it at this position but later on we can depend on the map where generally we can put them in different locations okay so what we can do is um we will um have forever loop okay so hi i'll go to the forever loop and here we'll say if same thing right touching the ninja so basically when the ninja walk into the portal we wanna wanna make him go to the next stage so ninja when touching this ninja and then you can say um so let's say you have like two different level and then you want to make sure that okay at the third level you kind of stop and you want to make the game in so what you can do is you can use like a if statement let's say we have three level right now so what we can do is say hey um we're going to check the level actually we are going to check the level um if the level is less than three then what we can do is say broadcast we are going to broadcast the events and go to the next level new message next level okay the house of podcasts you win so with that it's like you have got to the last level right and then you can say what cash you win and we can do different things with that okay so and then we also need this um message when we obtain the gym right when the gyms obtain okay and then you can say um depending on different level and you can put like a portal in different level let's say in let's say we're in level two let me change the platform once let's say level two and changes hit box because i'm using that so let's say in level two we want the portal to go back here right let's say here then what you can do is like when jim here you can check the level right and you can see the control here say when you obtain the gym if uh you can use the operator here so level one we write taking care of right so if it's level two we can check this variable level if level is two we want to uh move it to this position now so so before it was this position that's level one so level two goes to this position and then it can say show okay so um and then also when we receive a next level we want to hide this right um because once we go to the next level we also want to hide this right so we don't want to show right so go back here say when i receive this next level this guy's broadcasting next level i also want to hide sprayed okay we can put them here okay this one let's finish this we'll show and then what we can do is uh using a forever control whatever and you can repeat i think we don't need a really small weight because this thing actually has a lot of costume if you can look it has like 24 so it's a lot of custom so we don't really need like point wave point zero one second what you can do is um just say next custom so let's just if you want to test it out right just click on this you can see this is turning so you wanna execute the code just do that and we'll do that okay let's try it one time i mean we haven't fixed everything with the level right let's just just try one time so we'll obtain the gym you see the portal comes out we'll go to the portal if podcasts yeah let's go to the next level but we have not do the coding right for the uh platform to change the next level and all which we can do that next time uh so today what we did was we kind of work on the ninja gliding right and we worked on the uh the gym and then we worked on the portal i think next time we can work on changing the level and then maybe the monster the medusa comes out you can attack them and that would be pretty much it for the for the series this is a ninja platformer okay we can change this to a portal right okay all right i think we're done here uh okay thanks for watching see you guys next time bye you
