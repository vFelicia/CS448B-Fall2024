hello it's kidscodingplayground here and today we're back with another video on a scratch tutorial so as you all know today is january 1st of 2022 depending on where you live for us it's january 1st so it marks the first day of the new year so in google they have something like this thing we're going to be making this in scratch for new year's so when you click on this you see how confetti goes everywhere we're going to be doing that on scratch so of course it's not going to be 100 accurate but it's going to be quite similar to what whatever this is so let me show you guys the game so when you play it's just 20 22 you click on the little popper thing you have like all the confetti and as you can see um before you um get the confetti to get right there you cannot click again so you can't keep spamming confetti it does not work because we have a script for that so that's pretty much for their project today so let's start a new project and no we will not be using any sprites from our backpack or anything this is all from scratch so you do not need any other sprites apparently 92.8 percent of our viewers are not subscribed and only 7.2 percent are subscribed so it would really help us if you guys just clicked that subscribe button and left a like on this video and as always just comment something down below tell us what you did over new year's now back to the video okay so first let's rename the project let's name it new year's 2022 how about that okay new year sorry and then next let's delete the scratch cat and then we'll get the party hat so just search a party in your thing so you see the party hats right how the way we made the popper was we deleted these two costumes and then we removed this little thing right there so now we have the little popper and then we can just group it flip it over just flip it over like that something like that and censor your sprite okay so now we have our little popper we'll put it like in the bottom lefthand corner let's make it like actually a little bit more to the left so that's your popper and then the backdrop we just took the night city so night city this one we picked this one for a backdrop so it's easy to see the confetti and then next let's get our confetti so all we did was just paint a few sprites it's really easy to draw so we're gonna make four costumes um for confetti and one costume for the confetti ball as you can see it goes like right there and then all the confetti goes everywhere so we're just gonna get red color and then we're gonna like for the confetti cluster we're just gonna like draw let's zoom in actually let's zoom in maybe like right here so all you want to do is just draw some small squares and rectangles so we can draw a perfect square right there rectangle you can rotate it a little bit and then maybe some diamonds as well rhombuses so make a perfect square rotate it uh hold down shift so it rotates perfectly and then you can drag it out and you get a little rhombus put that right there let's make it a little smaller you have just make whatever you want make it into a little cluster and then after you got you're satisfied with the amount of shapes you have you can just copy and paste what you like so let's just copy and paste a few of these ctrl c ctrl v rotate it let's put it up here i guess ctrl c ctrl v move this one down a little bit and let's just copy one more and put this down here great okay so we have our little cluster of confetti um maybe let's put one more right here so it looks a little bit better right here rotate it like that okay so now let's group our sprites right here let's group it so we have confetti cluster let's just name it confetti cluster let's make that capital and then next we want to make the confetti we'll just use these sprites right here so i should have actually grouped it earlier so you can just ungroup it and then you can just move like copy paste this into another sprite so we're gonna paint okay so we're gonna get four sprites so let's get a perfect square for one of the costumes on the sprite so should copy it in here zoom in center just right that also let's center our confetti i forgot to do that so let's center that um and then right here we have the first one so we're going to rename the sprite to confetti confetti and then we're going to make a new costume we can just duplicate this one i guess delete this thing and then we can get another one like a rectangle or something and rotate it this way hold down shift like right there and then next you get another one so let's get this one duplicate the costume to get that there you go you have that and then let's do one more just get a rectangle and rotate it on the side so we're gonna just draw it just like that center it make it a little bit smaller hold down alt so it doesn't okay so now we have our four costumes for confetti next we want to make right that you know the 2022 right there so we're gonna just make a new sprite choose a new sprite and then you see the two there's the glow too and we just need the costume get the glow zero and then we just need these two you copy paste the zero into the first costume okay we're gonna zoom out it's a little bit too big to zero so now we just delete this one so let's move this to the left so right 20 22 20 22. we're gonna rotate it a little bit like in our old project we had it like kind of like that so it looks a little bit better you know like rotate the entire thing kind of rotate a little bit just a little bit and then we're gonna get this one duplicate again rotate slightly again let me get the zero oh 20 20 22 sorry uh there you go there we have our 2022 we can group this entire sprite now so there you go it's not perfect but you can make it better if you would like so let's group it and we're going to center it so there we have our 2022 we'll move it like right here maybe okay now let's start coding let's go to our party hat inside the party hat we are going to point green flag clicked we are going to go to this position wherever you put it and then we're going to make new variable we're going to name it confetti is flying confetti is flying for all sprites that's fine and then next we're going to set the confetti is flying to no in the beginning so that basically this is to check if the confetti is flying up and we won't let the players spam this popper thing so that's what we need it for and then we're gonna get a one this sprite is clicked when this sprite is clicked we're gonna do if the confetti is flying is equal to no meaning that the confetti is not in the air so if the confetti is not in the air then we're going to allow the player to shoot confetti so we're going to broadcast the message name it shoot confetti so there you go and then next when i receive the message shoot confetti we're going to set the confetti is flying to yes because it is fine now is this in the air next we're going to get an ifthen statement so if the confetti flying is equal to yes so if it's in the air confetti is falling is equal to y we're going to play the sound pop until done so inside the sprite we're going to make the sound a little louder so you see how it's kind of soft well we're going to click the louder button so as loud as it can possibly be okay so we have the pop and they're going to wait one second because it will take about one second for the confetti cluster to travel to the middle where it all splits so we're gonna put wait one second and then you hear this like you said you know how there's a sound that's how we actually got it from this thing so what we're going to do is go to the sounds and we're going to record a sound so this is how you record a sound you click this one and then you click begin recording and i'm going to be quiet for a little bit so i can record the sound okay now you go back and you cut the recording so we're gonna play the recording stop right there and then we can just cut all this up to like right here let's play it again yeah that's all we need and we cut it right there so that's pretty good okay it might be a little quiet i'll turn up the volume so you guys can hear okay now you click save that's good enough you can make it louder actually we'll make it louder okay that's good enough okay so now we'll rename our recording one let's rename it to party party okay so this is kind of like a party sound so and then after that we're going to play the sound party and then we're also going to after this we're going to set the confetti as flying to know okay so we're going to reset that back to now okay and then next let's go to our confetti cluster in the confetti cluster let's go make it big zoom in and then we're going to go when uh green flag clicks we're going to make the confetti cluster go to the party hat which is basically the thing that launches it and we're also going to hide it in the beginning and then after that when i receive the message shoot confetti we are going to show now for showing we're going to uh go to the party hats which is basically this thing and then we're going to make it shoot into the air somewhere around like here so like there's not some like somewhere here and what i got was i got the coordinates of 0 and 50. so it would launch around like somewhere here so 0 as the x position and the y is 50. maybe i might have to move this one up a little bit because if you change this to 50 you can see it's a little bit too high so maybe i can move this up a little bit to make it look better okay and then right here we'll put s50 and zero you see it's about like right here maybe move this to the left a little bit so it looks more even and after that okay so we're gonna glide one second to this coordinate and then we're going to hide after that and then broadcast another message we're gonna name it make confetti fly so this is where it breaks up and all the confetti flies everywhere so may confetti fly and then when i receive shoot confetti in here we're also going to change the color so it the confetti cluster is a different color every time you shoot it most of the time at least so we're going to set the color sorry that cheek set the color effect to a pick random 25 to 300. okay now let's go on to the confetti so inside the confetti we are going to uh when reflect we're going to hide okay also but before we begin on the code let's show uh demonstrate the thing we just did so see it shoots at the confetti cluster place the sound so yeah that's exactly what we want except one thing as you can see when you click it it's on the front of the thing with the popper so you want to make it go to the back so we can just easily change this by just putting go to back layer so now as you can see let's play it it comes from the back so it definitely looks better so we'll just do that okay now let's go back to the confetti inside the confetti we are going to when i receive make confetti fly we're going to make a hundred clones of this confetti so we're going to repeat 100 times and then we're going to create a clone of myself and then when i start as a clone this is where the code for the clones are we are going to switch a costume to pick a random one to four which is either one of these costumes so we're gonna switch the costume to pick random one to four pick random one to four and we're gonna go to the front layer go to front layer with the confetti so it goes in front of the 2022 and then we're also gonna show it after that and then we're gonna make it go to we're gonna make the confetti like randomly spawn like from negative 200 to 200 around this area and we're going to keep the y position as the same which is 50. so we're going to go to x pick random negative 200 to 200 and then for the y we are going to change it to 50 as normal and then we are going to point direction point direction of the thing to pick random 0 to 360. so it's in like a 360 circle because 360 is a circle so it's going all around it looks better when you do it like that so we're going to do it like that so zero to 360. and next we're going to repeat until it's touching the edge so it's gonna just keep on moving until it touches the edge so we're gonna repeat until touching edge and we're going to change the color effect by 25 so the color is like different it also changes and then we're gonna move five steps towards the edge and after that it touches the edge we are going to delete this claim and boom there you go and then finally one last bit of code in the 2022 we are going to when green fly clicked zoom in when you fly clicked we're gonna get a forever loop forever we're gonna set the color set the color effect to pick around one to three hundred so it's like a flash and it changes to a different color it looks better than just like changing the color effect by one because it just doesn't look as good it's like blinking to a different color and we're gonna put a wait one second so it stays in the color for one second so there you go let's demonstrate the game full screen okay so you see the color is changing right there let's click this button you can see it is working the confetti is flying everywhere there you go so a very simple project for beginners um for the start of 2022 so that's all i have for this video thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share
