welcome back to the channel kids coding playground today we'll be doing a video on broadcasting concepts this is not really a game but it can probably help you understand broadcasting more easier so the bat pictured right here is no longer available in 3.0 you can get a substitute for it I picked the other bat because they still have another bat available so if we will be learning these falling concepts in scratch today understanding broadcast messages using variables using random operator animating sprites for messages receive the point of the short animation is that the microphone will be broadcasting a message and the sports will act accordingly when they receive the message so let's head on to the project so indeed I'm we need to rename this to rock has 10 concepts so we can we will need the cat the cat should set the size to 80 because he's pretty big moving like right here let's get a background I like the bench one this one is a good background and then we can import our sprites from the sprite library we need the bat put that up here and you get like a size 70 front it's a bit too big and then we'll need the Frog and finally we'll need the mic from take this frog and we'll need the microphone so in my career here every scale the size okay so we might also want to turn this don't rotate negative 90 degrees so it look this way so it will look better next we'll work on the code for the mic okay so when the key will start out when when the key space is pressed actually no we'll make a variable first random action make a variable called random action when spacebar is pressed then we'll change set the random action to pick random one two three cuz there's three sprites to pick from so next we need three if then condition statements duplicate this then we will need some operators we'll need the equal operator if it's equal to one if right of action the variable then we can probably broadcast fly and wait why is probably for the bat okay then we did another equal sign if it's equal to two if the variable random action is equal to two then we will broadcast walk and wait walk and finally um third equal sign if random action is equal to three then real broadcast and wait we'll broadcast jump okay so now we are done with the mic let's head on to the cat code so we'll always want to set the position of the cat in the beginning and then we'll need a if it's brought if it broadcasts if it receives the walkwalk message then it will repeat 10 times move 10 steps they can move forward and then we'll make it move back again or next costume and wait 0.1 seconds so Oh make it look more like it's walking we can duplicate this instead of 10 steps will move into 10 steps so I put backwards and I look like it's walking backwards so we are done with the cat now let's head on to the Frog code so we always need to set the position make it bigger next we'll need to if it receives the junk jump message then it will change the Y by 50 making it look like it's jumping up so change Y by 50 then we'll wait zero point 5 seconds so it look like it's in midair then it'll fall back down so by making it fall down we'll do change Y by negative 50 so that's the Frog code now it's worth at the bat finally we have the bat left so when clicked we want to set the position on all the time that it's in this position and then receives fly then will repeat 10 times make it look like they'll fly switch costume to costume a and then weight 0.1 seconds and make like a flapping effect then switch costume to batbeam I mean duplicate this actually that'd be complete 0.1 seconds so now we are finished we can try this out so when I play spacebar that that starts flapping its wings because the random action is 1 and inside the mic one is fly so the fly is gonna be broadcasted to the back room for space again random action is 3 3 is jump so our broadcast is a frog and make it jump striking see if we can get walk see it one so I wanted to get to 2 yeah so it walks forward and walks back see ya so thank you guys for watching this is pretty much the video so please like share subscribe and ring the notification bill to receive our latest updates on our Channel
