thank you welcome back guys it's kids coding playground here and today we're back with another video in scratch today we'll be making a Halloween game because Halloween is right around the corner and yeah so I'll be showing you a quick demo of our game that we have made today so let's go so there's a little bit music I'm turning it low so you can hear me but there's a pumpkin uh it's jackolantern with uh witch's hat a wizard hat and a room so this game is called design a pumpkin so you show us a objections to design a pumpkin and share it with all your friends for them to see so first uh there's these icons so you can just click on this to change the eye uh shape so where it can be red so I made three skins for these and I've also made nose like a circle nose and upside down triangle also made mouth so and the color of the pumpkin and there's also the stem color and you can drag these witch's hat and the broom onto the pumpkin for decoration so it's a pretty fun project to have and a share so that's the game we'll be making today before we get started with our video uh you can come to our Channel and check out previous Halloween games by scrolling down to the Halloween theme game section to check out more fun and cool games for you to learn so I've just created my project here and we don't need the scratch cat so we're just going to delete it and I'll teach you how to do the artwork for the pumpkin so let's just have a quick uh representation of how you should draw the pumpkin so first we have this shade of orange it's already selected but 1088.98 or you can use your own shade of orange if you do not like our shade of Orange and the outline is three and it's black so we use a circle and we just draw like a pretty decent Circle or oval ellipse then when you click the reshape tool and we drag out the edges so it's almost like a circle or rectangle kind of like a plant cell if you've seen a plant cell so it's just uh round on the edges but it's like a rectangle shape so that's basically our pumpkin here okay now I'm gonna give you a quick demonstration on how to draw the eyes of the pumpkin so we use a rectangle so we just have fill white outline is black and it's three so we use this and we draw like about this big and then we click on the reshape tool we click on one of the edges and then click on the backspace key to delete it then we click on back here and then we flip it over to give the eyes and you can just duplicate that onto the other side but uh the eyes are a whole entire different Sprite we're just teaching you how to draw the different parts of the body if you uh don't don't want to use outer Sprites so you can come to my profile of Gumball zero nine eight and I'll be sharing the project soon and you can just come over and Export our Sprites if you want to use our Sprites or you can draw them on your own so that's why we're teaching you how to do that and the nose is just same as the eyes you take that go to reshape go like that cure and that's your nose and then the mouth uh I'll give you a rough demonstration on how to do it so you just click the line tool outline is three and then you just draw lines to represent teeth on a JackoLantern because jackolanterns always have these type of mouths uh if you've seen one and you just draw the lines and connect them all together like that as as so and that's just a rough representation of how you would draw your mouth and these are all our body parts for the uh oh yeah we also have to draw the stem but it's just an oval that's just colored green all right so uh one more thing about the mouth you click on it with the uh button the little pointer and then you click on the fill and then you select white because if you don't do that it'll just be orange if you put it on the pumpkin so now you have that it's gonna be white on the pumpkin and we have our pretty much assembled jackolantern so put the new put the eyes and then the nose might be a little bit too big but it's fine and then that's just our pretty much assembled jacko'lantern and the stem is just an oval from uh the circle and you just make it green so let's just get a nice shade of green and and go like that and make it go to the back that's basically how our Sprite was but they're all separate Sprites so we're going to delete our Sprite now and drag it from our backpack so first we have our pumpkin which is just what we drew earlier and it comes with all these costumes so if you want to add extra costumes which is the point of this project you just uh go duplicate right click duplicate your um pumpkin from earlier and you can select any color you want and color your pumpkin any color you want so I just selected colors of a normal pumpkin which is orange light orange yellow and dark orange and darker orange so that's just basically what I did for the pumpkin and now we also have to drag in our eyes which are a full entire different Sprite so you would to do the eyes you would just draw like how we did earlier and just uh drag it on to where the eyes would be on jackolantern and the nose it's just going to be there same as the eyes and the mouth we taught you how to do that earlier as well and the stem on top and the icons so the icons you just take your eyes look you just take this you Ctrl C and then uh just draw a blue circle and you just put your eyes on there shrink it and put it on same with the nose the mouth and the color I just decided to do something different I just drew a circle made of multicolored with this tool right here but you can just do whatever and the stem I just uh duplicated the stem from the thing so now we have our assembled pumpkin let's start coding so our yeah and backdrop yeah we change our backdrop first pretty necessary I think I used Woods yep so we have Woods because it's creepy it looks creepy so now we have that also for if you want and you make you have to make extra skins for the eyes so just duplicate it and draw a circle wherever your eye was so let's start working on our icons okay so uh first thing from icons as always the green flag clicked and go to the front layer because it could get stuck behind some other things that you would not like it to be and then you switch costume to costume one which is this one the eyes and also uh you want to drag it to the top left and make it go to whatever position so I just have it over here so I'm just going to use this position and we're gonna make it create a clone of myself and we're usually using one Sprite for five icons so we would use when I start as a clone we would go to the front layer because we want all of them to go to the front layer just in case and then switch costume to costume number plus one costume number plus one so basically when I started when the icons started as a clone it'll go to the front letter and switch costume to the costume number but it will add one every single time so it will just go to a different costume and after that we'll change X by 40 so each um each little icon will be separated by a little bit in between like that and you need this block so if if then you put a knot if then not if the costume number is not equal to five create a clone of myself now we have that done we are going to work on how the icons would be clicked up just a quick demonstration we have all our little icons here so now we would use when the Sprite is clicked if then if then the costume number equals one so basically if you click on the first costume which is the Eyes costume number is equal to one then it will broadcast something called iTune to change the eye tone or eye texture so from a circle to a triangle or whatever item and then we go to the eyes so let's just work on the eyes and when the green flag is clicked oops we would drag it to wherever it would be so it'd be whatever here and then switch costume to costume one because you always want to make a start at the standard jackolantern and now when I receive I tone it will be next costume so every time I click on that little button it'll broadcast something and that would just transfer it to be able to change costumes so now we have our three standard eye costumes we duplicate this block if costume number is equal to two then we would do broadcast nose tone because that's our second our second little podcast and when we we now have to go to the nose and when the green flag is clicked like that we would go to whatever position that we dragged it to we would switch the costume to one and when I receive nose tone it'll be next costume so we have the nose done now we go back to here we duplicate that and then if the costume number is equal to three if you click on the costume number three it would be mouth tone because there's different mouth tones that I've drawn to foreign and now we go to the mouth and when the green flag is clicked why is it always unzooming it'll go to here and it'll switch costs and cost him one because it's the standard mouth which is the car third and we have the surprised and the smiley face but the carved part which the little tooth toothful smile and when I receive uh no all mouth tone we would foreign go next costume so we have that done now we go back to the icons and we duplicate that and if the costume number is four it would be color tone which is our fourth Sprite for the icon for fourth uh costume so that'll be color tone then we go to the pumpkin because that's where the base color actually is and we would set the position so just in case if it gets whatever moved or anything and we would put a switch costume to costume one which is the standard orange color and when I receive color tone it would be next costume so you can choose whatever you see all these colors now we go back to the icon and for our last one our fifth one our stem our stem instead of costume number four because number five in our broadcast stem toe which is for our colorful stem we have seven different costumes or six because yeah we have six different costumes for our steps and now we go here when the green flag is clicked it will go to whatever position it will switch costume to costume one which is the standard green stem and when I receive stem tone it would be next costume so you can make a rotting pumpkin with the Blackstone or whatever and also there's extra for this stem since the stem is supposed to be behind the pumpkin because it just looks a little funny in front of the pumpkin we would have to go go to back layer over here so it just go to the back and now you can test out your game and it should work like this and I'm gonna give you the code for the icon try to put them together feel free to pause the video and copy down this code and we have a few more uh props before we end this uh project so we have our prop prop number one our witch which is going to get sadly deleted to make our hat for our pumpkin so let's delete the witch and ungroup this part because this is all once one little thing so we ungroup it ungroup and then we delete the head delete the little hair behind and now we're left with the witch's hat we delete which b c and d and now we have which a and rename it to Which hat because now we just destroyed the witch so for the size for the witch's hat you might want to use 200 oh this is a rough estimate because this hat looks really small compared to the pumpkin so I'm using size 200 for my witch's hat and uh when the green flag is clicked I put the witch hatch here just a rough estimate where it should go and it'll go to this uh position it doesn't matter which position just somewhere anywhere you want around the pumpkin so they can drag it on if they want to and then it has go to the front layer because if you when it was on the back layer it looked funny behind the pumpkins head now you have the forever Loop and you can set mode to draggable which is set drag mode or draggable which will give you the option to drag your hat now we have oops now we have that we have to go to get our wizard hat which is our other prop that you can drag on if you don't prefer the witch hat so I just put my wizard hat somewhere near here and when the green flag is clicked when the green flag is clicked it will go to a rough estimate where it should be and it will go to the front layer so it would look funny like behind the head and go forever set mode Dragon Ball set drag mode to Dragon Ball just like the witch is hat and now we have the broom our last prop remember you can always add other props if you want so just add broom broom here and we just use the broom we went like this we rotated the whole thing because it was a little um it was to the side and we didn't want that so we just moved it up like that and when the green flag is clicked uh it will go to x oh wait that's the wrong position because it's too big right now honestly I'd make it 75 or you can make it smaller if you want and you would just put it somewhere here just a rough estimate or it should be and now we have that X position and it'll go forever you know set drag mode you're draggable and to stop touch things off and to end the video I mean end the project we would go and the green flag is clicked it will go forever and it'll play sound well you can use any song if you want but I I use Cape because it just says spooky for the new Halloween theme so now we have our whole entire project so let's test it out okay let's test out our project now so let's go full screen reflect so I see our five icon working perfectly uh we can drag the wizard chat on if we want we can drag the witch's hat click on if we want we can drag the broom we make it move the broom for the spooky themes and we can make him an evil pumpkin or whatever your mind comes to so we're gonna make his eyes red like he's a genetic scientist make his nose like that he seems a lot evil with this face though and make him red just seems really perfect for the theme in a rotting stem which would subscribe this character ah okay so as you see has unlimited possibilities for What Pumpkin you want like to make so um yeah there's a lot of pumpkin choices to choose from so anyway please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below are you trickortreating or and if are you if you are trickortreating how many candy do you think you will receive for Halloween so anyway see you guys next time wait one last thing forgot to name this it's called designer pumpkin anyway see you guys next time
