hello everyone and welcome back to kids coding playgrounds today we'll be continuing our chain reaction game so so far here is what we have we have the cloning and the spawning of the dots and we have them moving across the screen and uh we have the starting dot so that it gets larger when you click so right now we have this okay so first we're going to go to other dots and so let's go into the other dot and when i receive start game forever if the game stop so let's make a new variable called game stop and if gamestop is equal to yes yes then we'll stop all other scripts so other descriptions in the sprite so now let's get a when i start as clone and repeat until it's touching the edge let's um if dots left is less than one then we'll delete this clone and if player dot down is equal to yes and then and and then let's get when i receive start counting forever if dots left so just duplicate this and then inside set gamestop to yes now in the repeat until touching edge if it's touching the color of the starting dot so let's press the green flag and then select the eyedropper and now you should select the color if the touching color this and the player dot down is yes so player.down is yes so if then let's upload a new sound and search crunch and let's start the sound crunch and switch the costume to the last one which should be the gray one now let's change dots left by one and let's make a new variable called score and also change score by one score now let's go into the starting dot and drag this part in here so now we should have copied it into here and drag it below into the if condition now right here let's set the score to zero and let's set gamestop to no and also set the size to 50 percent and let's hide so as you can see dots going around right here and if you click yours should get larger and then everything disappears when there are no more no more dots so let's try it again and if the dots touch your dot your score goes up okay it's good so now at the end it should display your score so let's change this to a large readout and drag it down here and let's hide the other ones so now let's make a new spray and let's call it score score and then let's just have it name them one and then it should be one and then let's center this now let's duplicate this and then change this to two and do this all the way to nine and then change this to zero so right now i'm making a new costume and naming it zero and typing zero good so now let's go into the code and let's make a new variable for this sprite only and name it clone so when the green flag is clicked let's set clone to zero and let's repeat 10 change clone by one and then creating a clone so then after that we hide and then when i start as clone forever if else if the game stop equals no gamestop equals no then let's set the size to 100 and then let's go to x clone number clone times let's see 20. minus 150 and then y is negative 160. and now if the length of score if if else the length of score is less than clone number clone then let's hide so hide else then let's show and then let's switch costume to letter clone of score so let's hide all the variables and as you can see it works oh change this to plus 150 so as you can see the score right there and maybe we could sit set it a little bit larger 200 percent yes and now if you place the dot down the sound plays and your score goes up and now you have that so when you lose so i'll just set the dots left to zero so you've lost now and let's set the size now to 400 percent let's go to x clone times 55 and let's go minus 55 y 0 and it should show your score right here so if they're too far apart then you can just lower this 40 40. okay now let's duplicate this and then let's name it high score and now let's make a cloud variable and name it high score so let's drag high score in the to replace score and drag this into the if and let's replace this with hide and let's also go to 20 minus 55. and y negative 155 and let's make another backdrop and we'll have it saying that the high score is that high score so now that we start we should when i receive start game forever if else gamestop is yes then we'll switch the backdrop to the second one then else then we'll switch the backdrop to the first one so okay change this to yes so now it should work and if we lose the score and i high score should show and now when i when the game stop is no so when forever if the game stop um equals yes and the score is more than the high score then let's set the high score to the score okay so let's hide high score and should work now so if you place it in the corner and the high score is zero and now if we get a higher score than zero the high score should be set to that score so now it works okay i'm just going to stop it and see the score is now 55 and the high score is now 55 so make sure to love to like the video and subscribe to our channel and hit the bell thanks for watching and yeah okay and see you guys next time
