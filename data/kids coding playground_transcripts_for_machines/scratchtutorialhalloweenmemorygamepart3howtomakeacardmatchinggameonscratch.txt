hello welcome back to kids coding playground channel today we'll continue working on the halloween memory game that we have left off so this is part three uh before i start let's let me do this let me rename this halloween memory game i'll call it teaching so because i have the other one don't want to get it confused all right um i believe uh you guys understand if not you have to uh look at the uh part two of the video but uh last what we left off is we generate the list for the game matching number and then we generate the game sprite name and after that we send the broadcast message to the individual halloween sprite and based on that they get the name of the uh sprite and then it will set that costume just like right here you see that uh one is a spider so that's why one got set up as a spider and number two is the candy that's why it's set up as a candy so that's where we left off so now we will continue to walk on it we'll work on the cover um and then we will create a clone of each of these duplicate this uh costume uh this sprite and then we want to set the costume for our game all right okay let's go to the uh the sprite uh first so make sure we have uh the correct code uh we have let's go to the first frame so we have the uh when we set up this sprite we have changed the customer i think you'll understand that uh what we also want to do is we will put the drag this show under here just in case later on we hide it at the end you know we can hide the screen and then you know we need to show it at the beginning all right okay that's done uh we'll add the same thing here i think i was missed that earlier let's add this here as well okay so we have this and this now let's walk on the covering okay all right so we will work on the first cover so the first cover will be covering the first right here okay uh what we're going to do is we are going to drag the event when green flap is clicked kind of zoom in a little bit so you can see a little better and what we can do is there's something called go to right what you can say is go to halloween sprite one so this cover one will go covering this guy all right and what you also want to do is make it go to the front layer so that you know when it goes there we'll cover the hollowing spray so that player cannot see that and then you say show okay all right okay what we want to do is if we run this code right now you will see that this will cover the first box so let me try that let me run this code real quick you see it covered the first box right so what we need to do is when we clicked on it we have to review the the card underneath so what we need to do is this uh we have something called a there's an event for when the sprite is clicked right so there's some kind of event like that so we'll look for that let's see when the sprite is clicked right this is when the sprite is clicked and what we need to do is we are going to check if the actually the cat finished saying something right you remember cat we were broadcasting the game is started as yes right here this broadcast here so what we want to see is after this is done then we will allow it to click otherwise we don't want it to click while the game is still setting up right so that's why we need to check so you say if put this here and get this operator okay you are going to compare that variable we just set right is game started we set it to y right so if the game is started then that will allow the player to click on it okay okay so how do we hide it is very simple right we can just call the high right also like let's say we do this we click on it you see it shows right but this is not enough to make the game um correct right we just started the cover and then once it populated we just say hi right high height right it click it open up so that's how we hide right but this is not enough so what we need to do is we have to keep track of the what the player selected the first choice and the second choice right so what we have to do is you remember we created some variable earlier uh for the players choice one and two so we will be using these to uh to check okay all right so we'll get another uh condition here so you drag this let's take this high alpha right now we'll put this condition in here okay we are going to use a or joint here okay this is a hall joint for the if statement what we're going to do is we're going to check if the user had already selected something so uh how do you tell if the user has selected something what you can do is using this link though so the link just telling like how big the uh how many letter in the variable they have so let's say we have um say player choice one so we player did not choose anything the link will be zero so if the player choose something we'll put we'll put the name of the sprite into this variable so will have some value right so we'll do that later so what you can do is just take this the length of this guy nope you have to do the operator take another operator equal so you say the player choice link to zero meaning nothing is there okay you drop this into the first or joint here then let's take a duplicate this and put on the second one maybe i'll zoom back out a little bit okay and then you can right click and you can choose the player choice two so basically you're saying if the user have not choose anything for the first choice or the second choice what we want to do is we are going to broadcast something called selected sprite one right because this is the first sprite and this is the first cover so we'll in order to communicate with the other sprite and the variable will have to broadcast messages okay so use this broadcast message and wait uh click on this new message and then type in selected sprite one so the player selected the sprite one since it's clicking on the cover one right which is going to be on top of the sprite one okay and then what we're going to do is we are going to hide it okay okay so this is the first time the players do the choice so where to do the second choice so we'll work on that a little bit later so this is either choice one or choice two is not there or broadcast the the the message okay okay all right so what we go going to do we're going to go back to the first sprite when we broadcast a message for the sprite and we are going to add some code okay so we just broadcast that message right so we have to receive that message so let me kind of zoom in a little bit so when i receive this selected sprite one okay then we're gonna check the link again so using the if condition here okay and then you can use the operator and you can use the length again and we are you checking for player choice one okay we don't have to check both of them since there's only two choice so what we do is we are going to check up check the first choice if the first choice is not correct then we'll use the second choice so we know the second the if if it's not the first choice then it will be a second choice so uh what you do actually i pull the wrong one we need the if and nails right so that because we have two choices so what we do is this okay if the length of the first choice is zero meaning it did not if it is not it did not have anything selected then we will set it okay we'll say variable set the player choice one okay to or say it set it to the custom name so what is that custom name let's go back to look what the custom here right so let's say costume number right name so we want the name so which is these kind of name right and then else we will set it to player choice 2. so if it's not player choice 1 it's not there we'll set set it if play choice one is already there we'll set it to player choice 2. so when you first time you clicked on it let's say player clicked on choice 1 then the player doesn't have any choice yet then they will set that name and then the the player click on another choice uh for a different sprite and uh you know there's choice one already picked then they set it to choice two okay i hope you guys understand that okay i'll run through some scenario you you'll understand a little bit better so what we need to do is we are going to create another another cover but before we do that let's go back to the cover we'll finish some code here so we can duplicate the code okay so we will need another if operator here put it underneath here uh what we want to do is make sure that okay if the player has select both of the choice then we want to check the answer right okay so what we can do is this we use an operator this time another or so above is using or now we're going to use it in so we are going to take this choice one and choice two not greater than we're going to use a greater than not equal so sorry i was trying to be lazy i guess that's not going to work let's just use the greater than here oops so the length of choice one is greater than zero meaning something already selected and we'll duplicate this now we don't need this we'll select this so you have to right click that if you want to select it okay right click on the variable it will pop up this uh window and you can select okay so the length of player choice one is greater than zero meaning something has selected on player choice one and the player choice two also selected so basically the player had selected two uh two cards then what we want to do is one broadcast a message okay and wait so what you want to do is use broadcast a message and wait what this is going to do is wait for the checking of the instruction so if you don't if you put a weight here so that means they'll prevent users from clicking more than one time on the or if they already select two choices you don't want them to keep on clicking right so that's why we use this uh selected uh broadcast and wait or settle a new message called let's say check answer okay i have this a lowercase i mean it could be uppercase i guess let's maybe let's make it um same i think all my broadcast is uppercase right yeah let's just change that to be consistent call it select one right selected sprite one okay all right okay once since we made that change we make sure that we have followed that uh changes back to select sprite one okay all right so you don't have to do that i just want to check make sure it's consistent so send us as i was using capital as in the broadcast message i want to make it the same okay all right okay so what we want to do is we are going to create one more cover box okay uh and then we are going to code the second sprite here so you can see so let's just say uh right click say duplicate so this is cover two so cover two will have most of the code from what we have done for cover one but we are going to change it slightly okay instead go to halloween sprite one we have to go to halloween sprite two so this is the second box we want to cover this guy so i want to go to uh two right same thing here the game is started same we are going to check this but instead of broadcast uh selected sprite one we need to broadcast a different one we'll call it selected two so this will let the sprite number two know that we have selected him okay so same code uh player choice one not there or this then it will select it if um if the player choice uh one or two is greater than zero meaning both of the choices are populated then we'll broadcast check answer so check answer will have the code in the cat later but for now don't worry about that just make sure the code is kind of looking like this and we have to set up in a a different location right uh i don't know i think we're fine because we have the location of the sprite too i think we're good there so far okay all right let's go back to number two we're gonna have to copy some code from the cat to this guy the sprite one to two okay let's see we have this let's copy drag and then kind of drop it in here okay all right so make sure you remember to change this to two right because we are number two sprite and i think we're good here so far let's just run the game see how it goes okay so run the game will populate the list and properly the uh the sprite and they'll cover it so what do we see here number one is the toe is that right yep that's the toe and number two here is the black cat right so that's correct so let's say we click on this does it open and show let's see okay also we want to see the variable right you guys make sure you want to turn this on so that you can see what you have what the player has chosen right okay let's see so if i click on number two first doesn't matter which one whatever i click on first we'll go to the first choice okay let's say click on the second box so you see it populate the first choice same black cat right the black cat if i click on the second choice since the first choice is populated here right this code here right you see right if it's or or this or broadcast so so now player choice number one already been populated now player choice number two is not there so what it does is it's gonna broadcast this uh select uh sprite one we'll come back over here and select sprite one will set the name right if there's nothing has chosen uh for choice one it will put this and else it'll just put on choice two so it doesn't matter so choice one already fulfilled right because of this this code here so choice one was not there before so it set it the name for choice one so now this will run the choice two so if i click on this so you see that it populated choice two as the frog so now we have over the choice so player have opened two card so now we are going to match it right okay all right so how do you match it so what you have to do is you have to go back to the cat okay the cat has a lot of code we'll do some code on the side here let's do it over here okay so what we do we're going to zoom in a little bit drag this event here when i receive check answer that's when we have both of the choices have been picked we're going to call this check answer what we're going to do is we are going to grab the condition here this if statement and else everything else so we are going to check if they're the same so what we're going to check is we're going to check the variable of their choice 1 and the variable here is two so if they're the same if that's the same then we will make the cat say something say uh you have a match we'll do it for one second so a little bit faster if you want the user to be able to see the longer then you can put it like no two seconds and then what we want to do is we want to add this uh choice to the uh match list so we are going to use the match list to uh to match it later okay so that we know like if the user have picked up all the match then the game is over so what we're going to do is we'll go back to variable go to the list here grab this one at things okay so we'll put it under here so we'll take up one of the variable it doesn't matter which one because they're the same right so they're the same right you can get one or two it doesn't matter and what we want to do is we are going to set it to this player selected actually so this is so if you have a match we'll add it to this list okay and we will use another one i'll put this here so we are going to compare the the less sense we have a six uh 12 we are we're going to create 12 boxes right so that will be six match right so if all of them are done they will have actually six uh value in this list right so we can say go back to variable and you will say um there's something called linked right so you say linked off player match selected list equal to six meaning you match all six pair then you can broadcast a message so you can broadcast a message anyway it doesn't matter it doesn't really matter for this one you can podcast a u in so because you made all the six pair send you in so we can create another sprite and then display you in later okay just for now just broadcast it don't worry about it we'll get back to it and then we will grab this one here saying sorry not a match on or not a match again okay and then we what we need to do is after they check the answer we want to clear the answer okay okay so we have to clear the answer so that next time we can check it right so you have to say check player choice one just delete that duplicate this player choice two or delete it okay and then what we need to do if it doesn't match what you have to do you have to cover it right if it match then we'll stay on right so we actually after running this check here after the check what we can do is we can broadcast an error message all right so you can say broadcast net message you can either use either one this one really doesn't matter so what we can do is just say a new message called cover cards okay so what it does is it's gonna tell the sprite to to cover it up if they don't find a match okay so we're gonna go back to our sprite right so when we receive like uh covering the card where they do something right okay so what we need to do is we are going to grab this let me move this over a little bit i guess okay and i'll move this over here i'll zoom back out a little bit okay all right okay we are going to grab this if statement here and then we will use a not operator so you remember the list that we created earlier when we found a match we added to this list so what we can do is we're going to check if that they have the match here okay okay so here you say not use a not operator here and then we are going to grab the player mesh list whereas that we are looking for contain here contain okay game matching number let's play your selected matchmakers that's the list that the player selected right if it contains okay go back to look and then we're gonna use the custom name okay if it contains a custom name that means it's a match okay then what we're going to do is we're going to broadcast another message okay we will broadcast another message okay what we want to say is show cover one i think i have spaces and lines uh okay this one doesn't last man i'm not putting consistently i really hate that but uh anyway i think these have no space that's me putting no space i should make it more consistent on my coding with these messages show cover one so what we want to do if it doesn't match anything we want to make sure the cover cover back the the sprite so we have this in our sprite one right we have to go back to cover one okay so in the cover one we will receive this right show cover one what we want to do is we are going to show it basically after you hide it right select it open and then if it doesn't match the the sprite then this guy will broadcast the show cover one will come back to here and then this guy will show up and we'll hide the frog right whatever it is okay now let's finish the other cat as well similar to what we had here okay we are going to drag it and drop it into the cat and we move it down here okay so we we copy it over here right now let's go check okay we have it over here the uh check answer so what we need to do we are going to change this broadcast message we'll make a new one say show cover two so this will broadcast back to uh cover two so similarly for cover one right with this show we'll just copy it over we'll we're going to change the message here show cover two okay all right i think we are good here let's just test out the code and see how it goes okay okay let me play this again so you have the empty list two of them populated i'll click on the first choice is the i second choice oops okay i made a mistake over here this is the check answer make sure you guys select the uh cover cards okay just like what we had here should be cover card no check answer okay i'm gonna stick there so all right so make sure you select that correctly i think i did not select it correctly earlier okay uh the check answer should only be here that we're checking the answer these two are actually covering the cards okay so make sure you do that okay let's run it again okay once it's populated the list right we will click on the first one just send it the demo second one the candy you see that it doesn't match so it close it back so they actually have a match then it will actually stay on okay i think we'll stop right here for now um next time we'll go into uh creating more uh sprite and then the more cover uh to finish off that part okay so thank you uh for watching please like share
