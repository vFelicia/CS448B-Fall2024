hello guys welcome back to kidscoolingplayground so today we are going to work on a project kind of like a drawing project i think some someone asked us to make some kind of game related helping patients in the hospital or something so before we we can do that you know you can let's say you can have some sprite that you can draw you make a story like let's say you have a hospital the cat going in getting his vaccine shot or whatever right so so for this kind of thing you know let's say you don't have the hospital sprite in the in the day in the in the sprite library what you can do is you can go to like google just look at like hospital cartoon image you can just download one of them and after you download it you can just kind of draw it so i can show you guys how to deal with that so as you can see my hospital i took the uh i took the image from here this is the actual image from the hospital and i drew this one so mine is look kind of exactly like that it takes a lot of time but we can just go through some of the steps to how you would draw something like this right so now let's say you can close a new project right and then let's say whatever sprite that you downloaded you can just upload it to the to the scratch cat i mean that's your project here and then you can go to the costume here so so for this let's convert to vector okay and then let's say you want to draw something like this you can select the line and let's put this black is fine let's do 10 so you can just kind of trace through this so you can let's add trace through here right and then here i gotta trace through that on the bottom and then right here then right here and then the other one i can just draw another line like this like this just kind of trace that objects here and then at the end over here okay all right so you have this box here that we kind of draw so if you actually move this you can see i can have the box here right so that is just my box so now let's let's fill in the color right for this box so you can just say hey let's click on this so you can click on this box and you can click on this you can set the color like this so now you fill it up right so same thing for this one you can click on this select this select the color now you fill it up but now we we just have the outside of the box right so what we need to do still is we have to draw the you know so with the draw the um so this one go to the front so we still have to draw the whole whole whole sprite right so now so i have my um background sprite let's just bring them back to the front so this is the uh the hospital i want to draw so i got the box around so far right so let's say i want to draw this window here you can zoom in a little bit so window you can see black blue so what we have to do is we cannot just use black and blue and select that and create that because you have to have different layers so what you can do is this so you can select uh no fill here this one you can go black you can say 10 or 7 or whatever that matter let's do seven i didn't originally have ten so let's see you can just try trace through this let's kind of trace that so now you have this square box right for the uh for the for that and now you have to draw another blue box inside so what we can do is we have to do that because we're gonna have to cover this blue line later so now let's um so select outside click on this thing again let's pick another color so i'm going to take this dark blue color now we're going to draw this blue box inside here so now i have the blue box inside right so far and then next you can just say hey i want to draw this blue bar so go back here you can select this color select this blue bar i'm go to 15 and then let's just draw something like this so you can see mine's a little bit too big let's make it a little bit smaller just enough don't worry about that it's not covering the blue i mean the blue covering no problem we're gonna fix that later so now let's let's click on this again so we're gonna have to draw another smaller line down here so what you can do is you just draw one more oops sorry why did i have black on i do not want black i'm sorry about that uh make sure you're selecting this color okay oh because i i selected another one when i clicked it outside that's the problem okay so that's why so let's draw this little line here in the bottom so now you have two little lines right which is this two little line but you still have this color boxes right so what you can do is you can use this and then say hey let's select this color box and then let's do a no outline okay let's draw a square shape kind of square shape like this and then click on the reshape tool delete this so now you have the triangle so use that you can kind of paste this guy in here kind of thing right so now you just just send this back say backward you can see it i did it so now it's back so what you can see these two lines still in the front so what you can do is select this guy click in the front you can see my window look kind of exactly like this window here right okay so i have this window now i want to group this window so i can move this guy out of the way a little bit so that i have this window so you can see oh sorry i don't want to move that so i have my window right so let's select everything now what you can do is you can select all go to another one i think it's pretty easy so you can delete it okay so what i'm going to do is going to delete all this thing here i don't care about all that so now i have my window i can group it ctrl c group it so when i go back over here right this this the screen that we were having earlier so now my window this is my first window so let's say i want a more window so i can control v right and then i say group and then i'm gonna move it so this is my second window you can see right so third window right fourth window so you can get the point right so this is fifth six oopsie got the wrong one so it takes a lot of time kind of thing to do that but uh as you can see i almost almost done so there's some more that we need to do i think this one doesn't have one yet production and they moved it so make sure you do have it all group right so that way you can you can do uh you know to uh to um easier to move so you can see i have all the uh window done so these sides are smaller window what you can do is uh you can you can just make it smaller right just kind of smaller size a bit right so like this it takes some time to to do that so as you can see i'm trying to not doing way proficient i guess it's because i'm trying to do it fast for the video so but as you can see i have all my window pretty much right and then that's the last window so you see all the windows done so one thing is now you have to draw the door similar thing right the door just um so for the door you can select this box here select the color inside okay select this color and then here just make a black i'll do a five outline and then you can just kind of trace through that so you can see i just draw the top portion of it right don't have to be exactly right and then next i'm gonna draw the bottom portion of this right i'll move it one block i'll draw this guy here right and then for the stair same thing right for the staircase just a different color inside oops sorry make sure you select it out and then select this color and then for the stair we can just draw the little stair here and then next draw another one and then draw the final stair here okay so you can move it so you i have my door i have to stare but i don't have to do it right i don't have this door yet um so something similar let's finish this side first so we're going to use the same thing for this side so here let's draw like this and then what you can do is you can go back one layer so making sure that other ones cover it we can do that later too doesn't really matter uh and then next you can draw this like this right so now this side is pretty much done but we still have to do this green bar and all that stuff so i'll show you how to do that later same thing so for the door where to draw like something like this right okay so for this little throw we're going to do like uh five and then we're not gonna use the inside fill because we're gonna have to cover the line just like how we did the window so you can just draw uh the door like this okay and then and then another door like this so now you have two door right and then what you need to do you just draw this big line right just like how we had this earlier uh what you can do is draw a line i'm going to do 15 and we're going to select this color here select this dark color so what you can do is uh draw this you can draw the gray box first oh let's draw the box first so let me go back sorry let's do this one first i think that would be easier actually so we're going to select this color to uh um no fill uh no no our line so what we're going to do is we're going to draw this little box here so control this little box we're going to send it backward okay let's send them all the way to the back for now we'll fix it later so let's draw another box here okay we're going to send it all the way to the back so we have the two glass blocks now whether draw this big line so go back to this let's do uh this color right 215 and then we'll draw one kind of big line like this down so what you can do is just kind of touch the black a little bit so let's move this a little bit i mean this uh this is a little bit harder to draw you know the doors you know because of the uh kind of it's uh you know it's a it's a little challenging uh because you know you have to kind of position correctly so let's say my door like this okay so now you have the the line and then same thing you can do a little triangle here just like use the no fill here i'm not sure if you guys are able to catch up i mean do all this but uh you can just give it you know you have to try more so you can draw the little triangle like this let's say like this and then you can delete one of the corner to make it like a triangle right and then use this thing you can move it in here like this right uh you can use a reshape tool to reshape a little bit move it like this so you have the triangle right and then copy that ctrl v here and put it on this side as well so now you have this triangle but you still have one more triangle on the back i mean you don't have to be so detailed but if you want to do really detail then yeah you have to do something like that so so now let me copy this triangle i'm gonna paste it again so this time i'm gonna make a make the color in the back so i'm gonna use this color here in the back in between there and this triangle i'm gonna put it around here all right and then i'm going to make this one sorry select this tool make it a little bit wider let's go up so i know it doesn't look right yet but uh once we kind of put it together it will look right so let's put that over here as well all right so we have all of them let's just delete the background first for now so if i just delete the background you can see kind of like this right my whole building looks like this right so what you can do you can see this this this this one right so what you say hey um kind of cover it actually more actually i didn't have it enough you see didn't have it covered enough so i'm gonna cover a little bit more and then put this up here like this a bit more this one same thing so now i have it kind of cover right all of them uh the bottom one maybe a little bit drag a little bit down okay so you can see this one what you can do is you can say send to the back right and then you can go back forward forward forward for you see i can see it now right so this one is a little bit so you can see you can see this one right so same thing for this you can say center the back can say forward forward forward forward see so now you see this triangle you can still make this a little bit bigger okay so this one you can make this a little bit bigger okay so what we have is that we have the sprite here so far so what you can do is you can just click on this and you say front click on this go to front so you can see you kind of hide it right and then this one is um should be like this okay so so let's go front on this guy front on this guy okay this guy should be in front and this guy should be in the front so now you have the hospital kind of door what are you missing is just the knob right uh if you want to kind of you know just kind of line that you can just kind of line that doesn't really matter i thought to be exactly perfect and then you did draw this little uh the house right earlier we have the color we can upload again let me upload the other sprite here so i think we're missing the the doorknob right that's thrown up so we can just say hey i want the circle uh draw the circle here select this color right this and then the box and then here you can select black five and then just go back to our thing we can just draw here then we can move it so let's say hold shift if you like uh this will draw the little dot copy ctrl c ctrl v so you have both little dots so let's say copy both of them select open put it on your door obviously you have to kind of move it you can use that the arrow key to move it right so any way you want so this is my hospital pretty much um this guy maybe let him go back a little bit go forward see there you go right so now what we're missing is some kind of um you know you have to cross on top right so the cross is pretty much really simple right you have two square uh no fill right uh select this one select the red color right just draw the square right draw your square shape see and then draw another square okay and then you can just select them both copy go back to your first one put it on there see there you go so but there's still some green stuff right you see this green stuff what you can do is just like how we do the window right so what you can do is say hey let me draw this here so here there's no fill let's take this color green right and then you can draw the track uh square shape kind of thing right it doesn't matter so this is not our thing right let's go like this and then this one let's go all the way over here so far and then we're going to use a reshape tool so reshape tool can say hey let's reshape this all the way here right and then this one how how did they do it they had like kind of like this i don't know it doesn't really matter you know i mean just some green stuff that you want the hospital to have some player i guess right so let's say you have this so what you can do is just take this copy ctrl v right and then you can say center back layer first and then click forward forward forward forward forward see there you go so but you see this one is covering right what you can do is just select this go to front oops sorry um go back sorry um this one this this box is not on the front side so this guy gonna have to move him a little bit in actually and then just kind of change this a little bit i think i messed it up earlier so now something like this right that should be good enough see there you go you have some kind of green kind of outline there with that and that's similar you can do something similar on this side right so this side has like the green thing also right so what you can do is let's click that let's just use another square and then what we can do is just use a reshape tool right just put this over here uh you don't have to be exact but let's go something like this and then this one doesn't really matter i think uh you can go on top and then this one you can go like this uh you can go something like this this one you can delete i think this should be good enough actually um it's a line like this so let's take this copy go back paste it here we might have to kind of try to adjust it a little bit let's just use this so adjust this a little bit adjust the bottom a little bit so okay and then you can say go back and then say forward forward forward forward see there you go so you have the whole hospital like that so pretty um that's how you actually do it so you have to use the layer like the window right you have the the first layer right let's go back so you have the let me ungroup this thing oh sorry so what you have is the black square then you have the dark blue square and then you have the uh the light darker blue line darker blue line then you have the lighter triangle so i hope you guys know uh you know how to draw it so not that i mean it looks pretty good i mean you can really use it for your you know your game or something like that and you wanna you don't have a hospital or you don't have any kind of sprite you can just download online and kind of kind of trace through the the sprite and make your own so there you go so hope you guys enjoy the video and i'll see you guys next time bye
