welcome back guys it's kids coding playground and today we're back for another video on scratch so in this video we will be talking making a beyblade burst game and yes this was uh commented by one of our uh subscribers so yeah let's just jump right into it so there's a player one which is you and then there's a i which is the yellow beyblade and you're the uh pink labeling and then so if you click it the background making these colors to make the game more interesting and um you can uh as you can see ai does damage and he'll attack you once in a while and then you will lose your hp up there and then you can also attack ai and then you can do some damage so i'm gonna let him uh you win so you won and if aai kills you you lose but uh ai is a little dumb and always moves around and so you make it so then it moves around it doesn't always hit you so ai does more damage so it does eight i think eight to five damage or so so and then the regular beyblade does like one damage five to one so yeah sometimes they'll hit you and sometimes it won't to make it more random so uh so i we have a shout out and it's he said or she said can you make a beyblade game please and then we replied so yeah uh so this is your beyblade game i know that comment was like three weeks ago but we finally checked some comments later and then some dude named d world decided to um wanted us to shout out so she is uh so you can check out her uh scratch and then yeah these are all our shout outs for today so we're gonna um get everything prepared so let's get everything done there's a backdrop for some reason i used the light blue no one knows why um i don't know why either so there we go we don't even need this brush scratch cat goodbye and um let's center this in the center yeah so and then we need this the outline so it's like this so i click shift and then you move it in the middle and then you get the two lines right through it oh okay oopsies i gotta hold the ships it is in uh proportion because i didn't move in the middle yet but look i can put this right in the middle there we go it's really hard to see the line there we go we finished our beyblade stadium i don't play beyblade so this is what i watched a youtube video and it looked like this looks like the stadium so anyways let's continue so we have to put our backpack things so you can download from our google drive links in the description so we have the you lose you win sprite the beyblade what the ai and the player so if you do not know how to do this you can go to my project that i share and export it so you can get the sprites under for your own so export yeah that button so yeah anyways i'm gonna get started on coding player so let's code player so in the beginning when the green flag is clicked it will set player one to a hundred so you have 100 hp and i'll go to player one negative 160 i do have coordinates i just want to do this so then they're on the opposite sides of the stadium so yeah just better and then go forever turn 15 degrees so it's always spinning always spinning so yeah and then when the green flag is clicked it'll go forever and if then if then the mouse is down which means that if it's clicked now down where's that button there it is so if then mouse down then glide 0.1 seconds to mouse pointer so glide to your mouse once you click and now we need a if then statement and put it in here and if touching a i then broadcast bounce and wait so yeah bouncing bounce so we have that finished and now when i receive bounce i'll start this sound called hit i downloaded this you can download this from us too so yeah uh it'll start sound hit move negative 30 steps so it'll bounce back like go like like if you hit it that means it would go like bam and no if this hits this it'll go up so yeah that's basically what it is and we have a weight point one second oopsie and then we'll move negative another negative 30 steps so let's see yes oopsies yeah see look it's working so it bounced in a random position because yeah you know that's how it is so yeah now we're gonna work still work on now we're gonna work on a i so the ai has a decent amount of code so first we're gonna for the ai we're gonna go when the green flag is clicked i'll set the variable ai so we're going to make a variable ai to 100 of course oh it's to zoom down zoom and go to 0.75 and now we have to go forever and i'll turn you know like any other beyblade well i don't play beyblades so sometimes it turns yeah you know we'll turn like the other one and now when i receive bounce the first we have to do this because it's a great flag so when the green hog is clicked i'll go forever wait pick random amount of seconds so i'm gonna get this real quick wait pick random one to two seconds and it will go like bang and start attacking them so you need to if then else statement here if then else if then else the pick random is equal to one okay random pick random from one to two and it will glide 0.1 seconds to a random position so sometimes it'll attack it sometimes it will like a real beyblade in real life so yeah glide 0.1 seconds to a random position and you need an else and then you put the else in 0.0 seconds to the player this time and now we have broadcast to bounce a new message called bounce 2 so that's that's what the ai does to damage to the player and the player attacks it with bounce so now we have to add this so when the when when i receive bounce it'll move back 30 steps it will wait 0.01 seconds so that's the fraction of a hundred and it will move go back negative thirty steps where is that yeah okay i'll just duplicate this it will also change ai hp by pick random negative five to one so the beyblade can do up to five damage or up or down to one damage in this now we have to do bounce two then it will move negative 20 steps okay i'll just get this uh so since this is the same as this one i'm just gonna do this i mean nega minus 30 is the same thing as 20 basically and now the player we're going back to the player bounce two my original project had 0.01 but i'm just going to change this to 0.1 and this to 0.1 because i feel like the weight is better like that and when i receive bounce 2 same thing basically it'll start sound hit it will wait 0.1 seconds and it will set player one so change player one sorry and it will change player one by pick random negative eight to negative four so the ai is slightly stronger than the um you deal more damage than the player itself and now it's time for the you lose and you win sprite so you win um so when the green flag is clicked so this is how you make it you lose you wins right because some people don't know so first you have to paint a costume got the text you go switch it to handwriting if you want to and you can write whatever you want why you can write you win and there you can place it in the middle and make it gigantic that's how you make a you win you lose sprite and just center it so that's how you do it and so i'm now i'm going to start coding the you and you lose sprite so when the green flag is clicked it will go to x 0 y 0 in the middle directly and then it will hide wait one second it'll go forever so you gotta wait one second because um it's a little delay for like if you want to set for everything to set up the hp and everything so that's why you need to wait one second so that's really important so please do not miss this part so i'll go forever and i'll go or if it's tight if player hp is equal to or less than zero i mean zero is greater than the player hp player one i really like this game it's pretty fun and then it'll show and switch costume to costume too no stop all right there and now we gotta duplicate that and just tweak it a little bit you know put it under the then loop you know how to do this by now probably and you need the ai and then ai and then it shows which yeah yeah you get the point and then now for the final touch the backdrop changing color and all that jazz which makes the enhances the project so when the the green flag is clapped clicked it'll set the volume to 25 percent well you can make it a hundred percent but i did 25 because i wanted you guys to hear my voice during the demo so it'll go forever and i'll play a sound called trap beat so trap beat and now when the green flag is clicked it will clear all graphic effects and then it'll start changing color the board will start changing color because it's a magical board and then it'll change color effect by one so it will slowly change color let's do this oh yeah i lost as you can see i made a mistake so this i i noticed that this is costume one so if you win it's costume one if you lose costume two and both of them were costume too so that's what so i just changed it and yeah so now time for the real demo a lot of massive damage but since the ai is sorry but i got it backwards and if the player hp is zero then of course it's gonna say you lose and if the ai's health is zero then of course it's gonna say you win so now it's time for the real demo so yeah win see okay great and if the ai kills you that means you lose so i'm going to show you that so i just changed his hp to 10 and i'll show you and then the ai will kill you so it says you lose so that's basically the concept of the game and um yeah so please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below i mean like basically what else you want because we can make those games uh as you say so anyways see you guys next time
