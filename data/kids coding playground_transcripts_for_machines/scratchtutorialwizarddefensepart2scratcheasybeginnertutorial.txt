hey guys it's kids coding playground again and today I will be doing it wizard defense part 2 this is part 2 oh yeah I forgot to name it so got it done that in part one bellows name it wizard wizard defense so if you didn't watch part 1 please watch part 1 or else you might not know everything right now so in part 1 we finish the wizard you finish the wizard the fireball and I think no not the news right and the backdrop so we're not done with the wizard completely but then let's move on to the crow so let's work on the crow on if flat clicked the flag clicked bill set rotation style left right so it won't flip over or you can use the direction things right under here but let's use um left right set rotation style left right point in direction 90 so I'll always point on the right side as you can see it could set sigh let's make it fifty a hundred so a little bit of show this yeah hundreds way too big let's make it 50 set size to 50 so you can make a show in the beginning you'll show and then I'll go to a position let's make it go to let's make the students and then let's see how big this is let's make it go around we're gonna make him go to the left and talk so let's make let's use some like friendly numbers let's say negative two hundred and 150 you should work I think we have to make it we have to set the bird count so the bird count is how much birds or crows so we got to make a new van call it bird so you set bird count to 21 even you can choose how much burbs you want but I'm gonna use 21 and then this is the tricky part you need a repeat okay you need to repeat but three and you need to repeat seven because three rows of seven three rows of seven so it's three rows of seven so it's seven like this in seven seven four three rows so that was your tricky part so let's create the clone of myself so seven times three equals 21 so that's why it's um like that so let's change X by 60 we have to use our change X by 60 because it'll go move six X by six cocreate another bird it'll keep on going until it touches um and until it makes 21 so let's change Y by negative forty so keep on going down so let's do change Expo negative so thinking twice we have to change the X back to 60 and we have to move on to the next row and take a it's a set X and change it especially a set X to let's say negative 200 then let's just put the change Y by already in here and then we have to make a new on message and then let's broadcast the message let's name it start marching so it'll go this isn't the end of the code you also need a hide right here so this is the end of the code for for um The Crow let's move a little bit here this as you can see it will generate 20 rows 21 roses 21 crows and then when I receive start marching so he's receiving a message from yourself it'll go forever I'll keep on moving one step keep on moving one step and then you need to if then statement so this is one you're touching the fireball so if then touching fireball go change the score by a high tree you can use anything you want but I decided to use a hundred misuse a hundred um and then you can start sounding the bird sound cuz that's when it dies and it plays like the birds out and then I'll wait let's make a small wait let's make it wait 0.01 seconds so let's put this right here 0.01 and then you can change the bird count by negative one so that's what it dies and then if then you knit if then statement right here and then you need a equals equals because if the bird count equals zero you win so we need it equal so you got to do if the bird count equals zero then broadcast you in and then do you when the sprite will show up so let's make a new message called you and then in the next row you have to delete the clone because it was already made so you got a delete right here so we're not just done we've gotta have an ifthen statement right here so then I'll keep on the exposition so you need this thing will go this way 210 exposition so if exposition is larger than 210 it will move down though change direction and move down that's what exposition means and then you can broadcast the message change died right so you can take another of this you can use it here but we have to change the equal sign right here let's take out the exposition and we need the other way and you gotta put that exposition of smaller than negative 210 they don't change position change their action so we need the change direction when I receive change direction because a broadcast message can be capable of doing multiple things it'll turn 180 degrees right and then it'll change Y by negative 20 so basically it means to turn around and it'll go down so when I receive start marching it'll go so right now we're actually setting up from the knife so we need a forever right here wait no wait you can use any pick random you want but let's used I'm going to use 3 to 5 so then it won't be all the time won't come down all the time so 3 to 5 then you need a set X seconds as you can see 3 or 5 seconds set X and you'll make a new variable night tax and then you can let's set the knife X to x position so cuz it's knife X so we can set it to x position and then we also need a knife why and then set knife y2y position then we also have to create the clone of a knife so I'll create the knife repeatedly for pick random oh yeah wrong one create clone of sprite it's raining this and it's bringing this so the crow is giving the x position in Y position to the knife let's also rename this to you when you so let's go to the crow so actually we have to work on the knife before I start on the knife I'm a demo it so the birds are slowly moving down as you can see you need to take them out so we're not they're just done with the coat yet so the knife you gotta make if flag clicked point in direction 180 so it's facing down so set set size you will hundred I don't know how big this is just make it show oh wow it's actually really big so probably fifty do you think fifty will work let's see you can click on this to make it yep that's the size I think 30 you would work 30 yeah that's the great size I'm hide so you'll make it hide and then most people are used to doing this and this but today I you will learn something new if you don't know this yet so you can hide the variable knife duplicate this hide variable knife why so it just hides the variable up here so set so yeah as you can see it's gone now and then you can set got hit to n B gonna make a new variable first got hit to n n means no it stands for no and set got hit to know so if the knife didn't hit him it's it won't hit him right now and then the knife also needs more code so when I start as a clone because you need a clone of this as well go to X go to you need this and then take the knife X for the exposition X and the knife Y for the Y position and then make it show let's repeat until cuz I'll repeat until the knife will keep on going until it's touching the edge or yeah I'll keep on going until it's touching the edge now move ten steps we're touching wizard you can use the or statement but the Wizards a little bit different so you need it if then for here and then touch in wizard set got hit to Y so if the so there's another way to do this it's more compatible so we can use or here an or touching edge or yes touching edge or touching wizard so you need to build the code if then touching wizard inside of it inside of it then it will set got hit too why because if the knife is touching the wizard that means ill set got hit too why so they lose health little broadcast hit wizard do not it we have to use another one just has to wait and have a little wait before it hit wizard so broadcast hit wizard and wait and it do not do not put the delete this clone inside or also keep on deleting the knife sprite you have to put it outside so let's move on we're still on the knife when I receive hit wizard if then got hit equals y so if you did get hit then as it is true you will lie then it would change one life out by negative 1 and then set got hit to know so um I'll reset each time we're also keep on telling that you died using the variable got hit makes it change lives by a negative one but if you use if then touching wizard and my touch it multiple times so I lose more health than normal so let's go back to the wizard um if flag clicked if the green flag clicked then over a P until you needle or statement lives because the lives have to be equal zero or if this goes into the negatives so we need or and this one so you'll die see you yeah so the live you need lives over here and lives over here and then switch costume a little bit switch costume to wizard a so I'll stay so put it right here so okay yes but right there I switch costume wizard a so it won't change in any costumes and then it's then touching crow we're almost done guys if then touching crow then I'll start the sound crash sweet box you can take any sound you want but let's take crash beatbox start sound crashing beatbox and then you guys set the got hit why so then if it's touching the crow you also lose lives why and then broadcast hit wizard this house you take but just it was written wait and then broadcast when your new broadcast message let's name it game over and this is one that you lose you win sprite comes into action so if then fly clicked let's say let's make a show first let's say go right here let's make it go to here and then Oh hide this is simple enough and then when I receive you win that means it will switch costume to costume more I think that's one right yeah one switch costume to costume one and then you can show make it show and then stop everything let's duplicate that and two and then change this to game builder in the stuff ball so I hope you enjoyed it guys please like share subscribe and it's working frequently she lives so please like share and subscribe and don't forget to comment to see what you want to see you later and goodbye
