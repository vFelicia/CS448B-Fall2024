hello and welcome back guys to the kids calling playground channel so today we will continue with the crab cross the roll game we'll be editing the some custom sprite and also making some changes to the background so before we get started please like share and subscribe to our channel and let us know in the comment what do you guys like to see more okay so let's jump right in so where we have left off last time once we finished it the roll with the stripe in the middle and then a little white line in between so and then we have the grass done what we can do next is we can put some flowers here on this side flowers on this die and then we'll put a crab in the middle what you can do is you can go to like Google and I'll search for a flower patch PNG cartoon or something and looking for like a PNG art once you find the one that your life like wins and so any of them you can download it and then you can just import it if you'd find one that is not PNG for instance that you want to use it then you actually have to erase the background that I think I talked about last time how you would do it you have to use the scratch tuqwan ojeda unfortunately they don't have the magic one anymore on three what you can do is when you go to a scratch if you scroll all the way down to the bottom here this thing called download click on download here if you scroll down and then you will see the older version editor you can load this one scratch 2.0 offline editor with this one you have the magic one to remove the background which is this this editor 2.0 editor so using this you can you cannot make the make the you raise the background for the year for the sprite so I can show you that one time that's for example we go to this flower patch right let's say we want to use this flower we can see this image right flower called flower so as you can see this is a JP he is not a PNG image so it might not have a transparent so we might need to erase it so what you can tell if you if you go here let's say you have the cat here and then you upload this flower as you can see the flowers blocking the cat you can't you see it doesn't see through you see half of the cat so what you need to do is you need to go to costume you use this magic one and then you can just highlight this so it will try to get order or the flower so I mean you cannot have to go in a little bit know what zoom in maybe sometime to get the perfect figure oops so that was wrong so get the wrong and you can just kind of yeah do the undo so as you can see I mean it's not as stir still some some some spot oops so I mean there's still some spot that you might have to clean up after afterward so as you can see the flower still you see you still see some white spot here right so you might have to go in and just use the eraser to can I erase this piece out you know the kind you might have to zoom in a little bit if you want to better better you know I'll control the sprite as you can see once I erased it I can see the cat somewhat you can still see some songs some white spot so I will recommend if you could find the like a PNG file to use that way you don't have to mess with the yeah Jenna editing the edit the sprite but if you want to you can some of the sometime you cannot find PNG and some does require you to make some changes to edit the sprite like when we're working on this game later on with a car the police car and the old truck they only have a PNG planet they don't have PNG they have only the you know the jpg so you do actually need to do some changes to to arrange the our line and all that so you can use this magic one tool here to help you okay so let me get back to it let's say you found one PNG file and you say that what you can do is you can go back to your code oops go back to the KO here you can go to background select background here and what you can do is Ian upload a backdrop so let's say I use this flower I download a while go so when you see you download this flower is some time and it put it into a bitmap where you can do click on this to convert a vector and then you choose this arrow here select this picture control C or right click copy and you can say control V here so as you can see I put this flower here right so you can kind make it smaller you can adjust a flower any way you like you move it up move it down so I just want to move it around here so I can do a copy again and I made another flower around here so you can just adjust it that way you know it kind of look like it's even on both side so we have the two flower patch here on the side or you can put the crap in the middle so this part we are done with the flower now so our background was I believe it's done unless you know you wanna change something else you can what we can do is we can start coding now we'll go back to the code for a backdrop what we can do is um pull this one in so when green flag is clicked that means when you click on this green flag this code will execute you can select a sound we can also select a volume like if you don't want the sound to play too loud in the back you can just give it like 50% and you can say forever then we need to add a sound let's say you can choose one how will you go choose a loop so these are the loop sound that you can kind of look together and it looks this sounds good so let's say we use this sound quite just hover over the label so let's say we use this we can choose this and we'll go back to the code and you go to cell and you can drag this in so let's play until done softer this sounds completely done what happened is go and then we'll play again and then it'll keep on playing the same sound over and over again so if I now let's just change this project name say crab cross bro I'll make it to since however I have one regular one if I now play this you can hear music in the back so you can hear a little bit music in the pattern right we put a volume kind of 50% and I also change my alright so far we have this walking alright we have the volume we added the sound and all then we have to go on to the next next sets of code ok now we have to agree after another variable what this new variable we are going to make is going to help us to control the game a little bit better now explain why this variable it's called stop action so basically this variable will help us to let's say if the crap is going across the street it got hit by one of the car we want to stop the you know the podcast of the the car hitting the crap and deduct a live one so basically we don't want the theity the car hit the crap like the Navajo I come and hit again right before he took all the crap moved back and we don't wonder the life that decrease more than one maybe like two or three time rate the car could have hit the the crap knees in the middle of the lane maybe that's too car coming so that's why we want to use this valve variable to help us to control that so I will show you in a bit so we can hide this a variable by clicking this checkbox so this this variable goes away if you want for debugging purposes you do want to change have it on so that way you can see what's going on what is getting set to okay we have the created this new variable what we can do is we can trash this cat here we are going to get the crap okay and we have the crap so we have crap a and crap P so they look pretty much alike what we are going to do is we are going to add something to the crap I was at the craps pricing like if he get hit by a car you know he splashes a I guess blood or something if it's crab I think that blue blood so let's just add so add a splash so what you can do is go for here same thing and in Google color for splash PNG scroll down find the one that you want like this is the one I got is a blue one alright downloaded earlier so what we can do is go over here you can say upload a promo costume and you can say blue splash splat okay alright so click on this vector again so as you can see it's really big what you want to do is you want to shrink it okay shake it shrink it some more I mean until you are you're comfortable where it should be so the crap is let me sell the crab looks like okay so what we're going to do is you can just click on this copy ctrl C and controlv so you're putting a splash on the crap so that means he got hit by a car right so we can trash this now so we have only one thing so what we're going to do is we aren't gonna make this crapola as small actually this is a little too big so now let's go back to the coal what you can do is first with drag this in so this is one green flag is clicked we can go to look set the size 40 and we have to initialize our variable so we can say set live to let's say in five set score resetting this all to zero and then we can have one more set the stop action to no so we're not stopping the action so once we actually get hit by the car then we say stop actions why so that can stop the action the what what is trying to perform and we also want to set the the crab's costume one so in the beginning we always want to have custom one so the crab looks something like this and we want to go into a certain position you know you can't move it around you can see this right so let's let me put it like around maybe live 165 see how it goes I didn't use that last time I think that works best so 165 is around here somewhere at the zero position this is like Center next we'll go get the a forever loop here so what we are going to do is we are going to add the kick sprite okay we are gonna put a kick somewhere on the top but for right now let's just leave him so big we'll change it to a little bit smaller what the what this crap will do is it will have this statement here okay if touching it's obvious if the crap touch the cake well what cast a message so we can do more things with it later on so we'll say a cast message say new message cake softer you get the cake you just podcast get cake so we are going to use that later on to do some something with that for now let's work on the crap we want the crap to be able to move left and right we also need to set this up as well so in south winds key space key is pressed you say when hub arrows is pressed what we want to do is go here and we are putting an if condition here and we are going to check if the stop action that we just saw right because after you get hit by the car we should not be letting the crap to keep on going up or down we want to stop that so we are going to use this condition here not condition basically it's not that variable so the stop action it's not equal to Y then we will allow them to move so we can say change change X nice change X&Y sorry change Y by let's say 20 and we want to put a little weight in feet we don't want the user to hold down the up and down arrow key and just fly through the history right you don't want that so what point zero eight something like that really fraction of a second so they can still move pretty quick around the map but just not like completely you know push down the key and go all the way to the to the end and also we don't want them to to go all the way to the top what we're going to do is we're gonna say bounce on edge so that you know player won't be able hide up here somewhere off the screen so now we will duplicate this so we got the up a route on we are going to work on their you know damn well say arrow similar thing so why instead of a plus point you can do minus twenty similar thing and bounce same thing so now we will walk on the right and left arrow so this is right so for right we'll have to use the X so we cannot use that toe we are going to say change oops why am i grabbing exit why can't change X was X okay so we are going to say change X this is right so be positive change X and we will say on edge bounce we don't need to put away because if they're moving left and right that's fine we'll let them go a little faster and we can put this for left button and we say minus 20 so now we have the basic movement of the crap so let's play this and just check it out so the probe is you guess push the up arrow or run this hole with the down arrow arrow so basically what we had is the crap is able to move off the street and get the cake right there don't call right now okay so we'll stop this we have the basic of the co for the crab so far so if you guys miss anything let's just pause the video here and take a look at the ko make sure you have everything here like this okay alright so next we are going to walk on the car and we are going to broadcast if the car she hit the you know hit the hit the the crap what we can do is we can bring one Carver's and we can work on the other car later okay we'll bring this green car we can place them any way you like we can place them around this here or here anywhere so what we can do is we start with the here and again okay so and then we are going to set the car over smaller you can set the size here to 75 or you can set the size here as well I like to do in Akko that way you know it's you know the won't check it will always walk maybe even anybody changing just to test something I run into always what we can and what we can do is look at the motion as you can see when you adjust this you'll see a different value right where the x and y is when you can do is let's say I want to put this car round there's this location maybe further so we'll probably come out like this when you can do is you can just drag this I said go to negative I mean doesn't matter negative 40 and 12 right so cause here and then we have to go in and get a forever loop so we want to make this call keep on going no tort this way so as you can see the cost pointing this way so you want him to go forward you have to use the Move depending on what side of the sprites facing you might have to use a positive move or negative move but for this for instance this one is facing to the right the sprites are facing to the right we haven't change any of the orientation so just use the positive number so this I put seven that means the you know every every every time this loop run no move seven step forward so if you want the crowd to go faster the other change is the high number like 10 15 right if you want go slower you use a smaller number all right and also one two you can also make him point in the direction as well so make sure that okay he's always going that side or you can put it in the front here that's also fine I mean now car is always going that side anyway okay and then what you can do is you have to us check if the car gets to the end you want to move them back today so if there's a car get all the way to the end here and disappear you want to move them back just hide them and moving back here so what you have to do is you have to check the position so you will say the exposition of this of this of this car right because we're checking an exposition so you get the operator here you'll see if the exposition is greater than you know you can move your car you can tell go back to motion you'll see it right like 200 or whatever I walk what to 30 because that's like probably at the end right now this is 209 to 30 maybe all away like this right there's 255 right this depends on what you wanted even 255 right 250 is fun also doesn't matter so like if the car move all the way to the end what we go into with a highlight right we just said hi so we'll hide it and we can set the eights back to whatever the eggs we had here so what we can do is a set X back to negative 240 so since we're doing 250 let's just change everything to 250 it will be easier oops so let's do 258 250 and 250 all right and then what we want to do after that we'll want to show so want to show the toy again I think I think zoom out a little bit colors getting along and we are going to check I've it touched a crap so we'll need this condition here sorry the if condition put it here so this is the moving part right so now we have the after this Co is finished running it will run this code so now we will check if this if the if the crap got hit okay so we won't it there's a condition will pioneer and join also so we'll have to check that stop button so remember that stop action we don't want the car to run him over twice and he lost to life so we need to enjoy so not just just not just one so what we say is this will say touching crap so the car is touching crap and you remember we use the not operator right so throw this that in here say not and we call the stop action oops we've got one more so when it's not equal to Y meaning up the the crappy not get hit then whoa what casts a message saying to crap that hit so podcast drop clicked on the dropdown click got a new message and say hit crab so the car hit the crap so let's run this and see how it looks so as you can see the cars running left to right then gets it and he'll come back and it's not going again right okay alright so we can see the car moving now we will have to go back to the crap what we can do is in the crap here okay alright so what we can do is I will stop right here the one that make the video too long we'll stop with another video and we'll complete the crap and the car and everything else in the next video alright thank you very much for joining us today and I hope you learned something and please subscribe give us a thumbs up on the video and we'll continue next time thank you
