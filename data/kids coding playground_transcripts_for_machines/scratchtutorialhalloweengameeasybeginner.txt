so welcome back guys to the channel today we'll be making a Halloween game so I know it's not Halloween but this is still a very fun game to make so this is how the game should look like so in this Halloween game we'll be learning these fallen concepts and scratch using broadcast messages variables random operator clones and point and direction so I'll show you how the game plays so keys and you press the spacebar so when you get their life is zero you loose so without further ado let's start our project so let me go here so I imported the witch so this which is no longer available in 3.0 so you can use the substitute this is from 2.0 so first I need to leave the scratch cat and then this may be to all bean game so Halloween game so now we need to import all our sprites in a bathroom so our backdrop will pick like maybe the wood spectrum that one looks the best for this theme the woods yeah and then we can add some sprites we need the ball sprite that can act like the fireball we'll need the ghost break I can use this ghost um we need the bat sprite get out of that so this is all we need oh yeah and can enter lady bucks right that's like an alien do they still have it I'm not sure if they have it yeah yeah they still have it okay so with which ball we can renew justifier ghost bat and lady book okay so first we'll start out the code for the backdrop we can do when clicked forever change color effect by one you'll make I'll give the the spooky appearance to the game as you can see when you play it background will change color making it a little cool but you don't want to do 25 or anything that's a big number because the blinking will make it not look great so I suggest you stick with the change color effects by one so now since we're done with that let's move on to the fireball sprite so when clicked you want to set the size to 20% because you want a small fireball so set size to 20 so next we'll hide let me drag a one clicked forever forever loop forever loop so we'll need it if then space so it will activate the fireball shooting out so if then key space pressed then create cloning myself that means you'll make a duplicate of itself so we need to wait until wait until not keep key space for us so then they can trap in rapid shoot so let's say if I take this out let's say later if I take this out then that means um this will a rapid shoot and it will not have no pause so if I add this not key space pressed next we all need to move on to the start as a clone part okay so for all clones this is the code for the clones so you need to get this block when I start as a clone you'll go to the which the which go to the which point in direction pointing direction point get the sensing and you need the direction of the witch so you want to click this one first this one first so you can get the which direction not the witch so it will go to the direction of the which will move 50 steps so move out a little bit show so we'll need a repeat until repeat until it's touching the edge so it will hide so repeat until touching it then move ten steps to move out and then we'll delete the clip so the clone will disappear so this is the code for the fireball so before we can keep on continuing to the bat actually I want to see a demo of how it works right now so the fireball will keep on moving ten steps until it's touching the edge as you can see and this wait until not keypress makes it so you cannot rapidfire so if I take this out you can rapidfire as you can see see so now let's move on to the back okay so for the bat we want a one clicked one flag clicked we need a win flag click block drag it then then we'll need a for every drag forever okay go to a random position so it will appear anywhere so you need an ifthen statement if then x position is less than zero that means somewhere on the left side x position is less than zero x position then set X to pick random 0 to 200 so be somewhere around here set X to pick random or okay pick random 0 to 200 this part is so it will generate somewhere on the right side so it won't be touching the wish that's fun so then next we'll need a show then we near repeat 15 repeat repeat loop so maybe 15 15 times next costume so make it look like it's flapping its wings and we don't need this one and we don't need this one we only need these two so make it look like it's flapping its wings so next costume and weight to 0.1 seconds so it won't be flapping very fast so next we'll need an ifthen statement so if then touching fireball oops fireball then place on pop until done we half the topic No then we have to choose it pop pops leave the pop until done oh yeah and we'll need a score variable so let's make it their variables we need a life and score we have it as you can see so we'll need to be change to score by one and hide once it's hit then we'll need the another density then we need a touch of which so if the best touching the wish hi we needed to go to another random position then we can broadcast a message called lose a lot so lose life okay so then we'll need a hide down here okay me zoom out so you can see the whole chunk of code so now as you can see the bat is generating and random areas every few seconds and if I hit it this way until it comes down here if I hit it it will disappear and play the pops up okay next we'll need to go to the ghost that goes through so when your one clicked set rotation style left and right so it will not flip upside down hide will need a forever loop so everything inside here we're building forever until the stop button is pressed we need to wait wait one second book will need to use a pick random operator three to five seconds so they'll generate a clone in that time range so create a clone of myself and then you also need to when it receives to lose a life then delete this clone so if it touches it it'll make which was a life but I'll also disappear okay when it starts as a clone we zoom in when it starts as a clone you want to point in direction of ninety point in direction of ninety go to a random position so go somewhere random set X to 240 so it be somewhere up here somewhere right here to the right so I won't hit the ghost I mean the witch sorry let's spawn it we show show point direction of the witch so we'll follow this one is kind of like a homing they'll follow the witch put towards which so next we'll need to repeat until repeat until it's touching the witch so it'll move ten steps and at the speed of ten steps towards the witch so then we'll need a weight zero point three seconds to give a little delay every time so it'll be a bit slower zero point three then we'll need it if then statement so if it's touching the fireball then we will if it's touching the fireball then we will play the sound pop until it's on you know pop so when you get this air you don't need this okay code place on pop until done we need to change the score by one when you kill it with the fireball and don't delete the clone then finally we need one more if then statement and this one we'll need an and in an operator so what this basically means is if the x position x position is less than negative 240 i mean it's less than negative 240 92 for so we're here then negative 240 and touching edge touching the edge of the map then you'll delete the clone so if it's touching the edge at spawn it will delete this clone and if it's less than this exposition name 240 then it will also delete the clip so when you know we no need to broadcast illusive life forecast lose the life and delete this clip okay so let's move on to the witch code now okay so now we're gonna move on to the witch so for the witch code we will need to do it when clicked this is the movement area so for every new forever loop we need for ifthen statements and you need upward sensors sensing so we need a key Takia up arrow is pressed then change the Y by 10 I guess and if the down arrow is pressed the bottom arrow and then change Y by negative 10 negative okay next we'll need a the left and right arrow keys so let's do the right right here for the right arrow will change the X by 10 next we'll need the left arrow instead of 10 we need to change it by negative 10 as the left arrow so change X by negative 10 negative 10 negative 10 so now with the movement so we need to receive the when I lose a life thing when I lose a life then change the life by negative one and I'm gonna start this on screech I think we have it in here yes so and then we need ifthen statement so we need an or operator so what this code means is if the life is less than or equal to zero so the life is less than or equal to zero life is less than or equal to zero then I'll stop all let me so I end the game pretty simple and then finally we need to if blacklick set the score it's a zero in the beginning set the life to five so you get five lives in the beginning and for a builder you can do play the sound cave until done so get a little music in the game it sounds wait we already have cave okay please have cave tilta okay so now we are done with everything except for the ladybug finally we have the ladybug code then click we wanted to go to a random position it will set X to 240 twoforty is somewhere right here and then we'll need a one clicked and plucked legs zoomin and flag clicked so we get forever loop so in the beginning change X by negative five so leave this way no move continuously this way so change X by negative 5 so negative 5 so we need to extend statement if then the x position is less than negative 240 just like that ghosts so if it's less than is negative 240 and it will go to a random position after so first let's put the X negative 240 then go to random position set X to 240 so go back to right here somewhere the x position to 40 so next we'll need another ifthen statement if it's touching the fireball will you get to play the pop sound so I don't know if we have it yeah we do okay so we'll play the pop sound until dawn change score by one so change the score by one chase where by one hide we'll need to hide hide it once it's hit okay so you go to another random position go to another random position set to X 2 2 4 D so 240 set it in the wait two seconds you'll get a little delay so then we'll need another fine statement so if then touching the which if it's touching the which we you know so if it's touching the which then you want it to hide obviously touching which sensing touching which and go to her in a position like the other sprites set the X to 240 so we'll be somewhere right here right there 240 broadcasting his life wait two seconds give it a little delay so now we are finished let's try it out we have an effort on the show the period shut these two variables so you can see them okay stop it the game is pretty wellfunctioning background makes it a very good scenery like a very eerie beam I guess okay so that concludes our video for today thank
