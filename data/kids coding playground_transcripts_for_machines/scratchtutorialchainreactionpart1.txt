so welcome back guys to another video on kids go to playground today we have another guest another member to the YouTube channel so he will be introducing you guys to this game you'll also be teaching you guys how to make this game called chain reaction so today we're going to be making this chain reaction game where there will be balls going around the screen and you have a dot which will try and collide with the other dots so today we'll be learning how to use a broadcast message run without screen refresh custom block and using the random operator and touching a if touching a color so now when we demo the game so as you can see there are dots going around and you place one and it shows their score at the end and the alltime high score so as you can see there are dot and it shows your score because you have two dots collide ok so now let's make a new project and name it chain reaction and delete scratch cat and choose paints a new stripe and select this and let's make it a grey color light gray so here and make it and set the pen size to 36 and make a dot in the middle so this should give you a dot size of about eighteen by eighteen and let's Center this okay and let's name this starting dog now when flight when the green flag is clicked let's broadcast to start the game so start game and now when Reece when we receive start game let's make a new variable and call it dots left dot this will be counting the dots when the dots on the screen the your gray dots on the screen reaches zero then you'll lose and it will show your score so first let's set dots left to zero let's make another variable called player dot down and let's set player dot down to no since you haven't placed your dot down no and then we want it our dots to show clear it's graphic effects and set size to 50% and now let's repeat until player dot down is equal to yes equal to yes so we want it to go to the mouse pointer so go to mouse pointer so now if we try it when we start player dot down should be no boss left is zero and it's going to your mouse pointer okay so now if the mouse is down so if Mouse down then we're going to set player dot down to yes so that'll terminate this loop it's not going to the mouse pointer anymore and let's broadcast start counting so this will start counting your score and saying if there's no more dots on the screen so it will also see if you lose or not start counting and let's change dots left point one so now if we see if this works it's moving around the screen player dot down is no if you click the loop isn't working you're not going to the mouse pointer anymore player dot down is yes now we want it to get larger so grab a repeat block repeat forty change size so change size by 90/90 divided by size divided by ten and then we're going to wait one second and then we're going to repeat ten change size by ninety divided by size by negative fifty change dots left so change dots left by negative one and then we're going to hide so now if we try it it's following your mouse when you click it gets larger it waits and it gets smaller perfect now that this code works let's start making the other dots that go around the screen so let's make another sprite and name it other dots other dots and let's make them a lot of different colors so so now I've made a lot of other dots and they are different colors and the last one should be the same color as yours this dot so to duplicate it drag this into the other sprite so now we also want them to be about the same size so you see this one all of them are eighteen by eighteen and this one is also 18 by 18 so now let's go into the code and when I receive start game so now let's create a new block called create clone and make sure to check run without screen refresh or else this will not work so first we want it to go to a random position and point in a random direction so point in Direction pick random negative 360 to 360 and now we're going to repeat until touching the edge repeat until touching edge move one step one and turn 180 degrees 180 and then move five steps now we're going to create a clone so create clone of myself and then switch the costume so switch costume to pick random one to seven pick random one to seven and now when I start as clone we want to show and then when I receive start game we want it to clone so forever let's wait 0.16 and then we'll clone so now if we try it there should be dots appearing around the screen as you can see if you click this dot expands and then it goes down again good so now we want it to travel across the screen so when I start as clone repeat until touching edge move five steps and then lastly we want to delete this clone so now you see that the dots are moving around maybe a little bit slower three steps there oh yeah and also set the size to 50% and now that there's the same size as the mouse dot and now if you click it should work that's it for this video make sure to LIKE and subscribe and leave a like on
