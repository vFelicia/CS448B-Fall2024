welcome back guys it's kitchen on playground here and today we're back for another video in scratch and today we will be making a game called rio soccer shootout and let's see what this game is all about so let's play it there's a whistle sign in the beginning bullseye's moving everywhere this keeper is here guarding the goal very tough and you click space oh yeah and you have 10 balls over here and you score zero so that's a goal so it has a chance to leap up and get your ball so let's see uh i missed okay all right so that's three i'm trying to win here so it looks like i won here and if you run out of balls you lose yeah and there's a little thing in the beginning you have to get five points to win and wherever the target is that's where the ball is going to be so so i started my new project and of course we delete this scratch uh uh sprite so we have the sprite we have the bullseye we you can come by my project and export the sprites we have the ball we have or you can draw on your own we have the keeper we have the backdrop we have the goal post the net the waves there's a lot of stuff in here and there's the cloud and there's the score whatever to win so let's do this so first we have to start off the bullseye so we have the when the green flag is clicked it will set size to a hundred percent so it's going to be pretty big in the show and after that it will um go to this certain position so so um we have our bull'seye so we just wanted to start around here so because we want the bullseye to start around there and go around so go to this position and then it will go forever and glide to this position and glide one second to this position and then it'll glide to to this position which is this and then it'll collide to this position so we're getting a bunch of coordinates down here and then it'll collide to this position and then it'll glide to oopsies this position and then it will glide back up so yeah so i'm going to put 0.5 on here so we use the same coordinates so negative 113 and uh positive 82. so yeah and now let's see look it's gliding seems right and we'll go back up so now we have to do another script so when the green flag is clicked it'll clear the graphic effects because it will constantly change color so you want to clear in the beginning and then uh we have to put forever let's make a new variable uh to make x and then we have to make y and then now we have to make set x to x position up here so it will follow and then set y to y position the reason for this is it'll keep track of the place where you click space and then you'll shoot the soccer ball so that's for later use and now i would change color effect by 20 doesn't really matter but 20 why not and then let's go to the ball we do have some last script to code in the bulls eye but first we do have to do the ball first unfortunately so let's do this so when the green flag is clicked it'll set ball to 10. so you have 10 balls to shoot so let's make set ball to 10. we set our ball to 10. so and now we have to set score which is another sprite i mean variable set score to zero and it'll go to the front layer because the ball is always in front set size to 50 so after that we have go to x uh we have to find a position so zero negative 80 and then it'll place down the whistle so oh we already have the whistle so that's really nice whistle until time so these uh sounds are actually from the ball sprite so you guys can export the sprite from my project and i'm gumball098 so just go to my project and export it and you also also can download it from the google drive but you have to use your own google account to do that so so okay so let's move on so when the space key is pressed if then and if then the ball is greater than zero so the ball is greater than zero oh and not so you need a knot uh and not equal score fives and if you still have balls and uh you don't have um more less yeah you don't have you don't have five points yet you can continue playing and um so you can continue shooting the goals so let's get broadcast shoot and wait so we have to actually make a new message here shoot and wait and uh now when i receive shoot oh change ball by minus one because you lost the ball from shooting and it will glide 0.5 seconds to x and y so that's why we track down the coordinates for bullseye because the ball has to go to the position where you shot it from so you need glide 0.5 seconds to x and y and now you need an if then statement so if then you need a and statement if then it's touching the net so you need touching net and not touching keeper that means you get a goal so not touching touching then broadcast goal and wait so that's a new broadcast message we will be using that later broadcast goal and weight and you also need an if then statement if then it's touching the keeper which you don't get the point for then it will broadcast miss and wait so now we're done with that uh we still have a little bit more code to do so let's finish this off so you want to give some effect to the thing so when when i broadcast when i receive shoot it'll repeat 12 times it'll get smaller and smaller so it looks like you kicked it away so that will add effect so change size by 2 and now when i when i receive shoot then it will play sound kick off until done so because you kick the ball so if you want to put this into one script you could actually put this inside here but you have to use the start sound block instead of the you want to put it up here uh uh you want to put start sound kick off up here you don't want to do play sound until done you can put it into one uh script if you want and now you have to go back to the bullseye to finish off the shoot so when i receive shoot it'll hide and because you are thing you are kicking the ball so it will just hide so then you can see where it is so hide wait two seconds and then it will show again and now we're done with all of those scripts over there we have to go to the keeper so so we're actually not done with the ball yet so we have to continue the ball there's a little bit more scripts over here so uh when i receive gold it will wait one second and it will do an if then statement if then the score is equal to 5 then it will broadcast win which you win if you broadcast win and wait so one and wait and then after that you need an if then statement if then the you need to and so i'll explain this when i'm done so so i'm going to explain this when i'm done so if that equals zero if the ball equals zero and not score equals five you still lose because uh you you ran out of balls and uh you did not complete the quest of getting five points so you still lose though broadcast a new message and wait lose lost now we have lost and then this is just a few scripts so when i receive goal i'll play sound goal until done because you won you got the goal and then you when i receive miss it's boo all right so now we have to do this so when i receive goal it will change score by one because you got a goal so now you're gonna get one more score it'll say goal for one second and uh you have to wait one second and it'll set size back to 50 so it'll go back to normal size so then you can kick it off again and now it will go to the position where it was earlier so go to x 0 y negative 80. so we have that and now we have to get missed so when i receive miss oh wait one second and it will if then statement if the ball equals zero so if you ran out of balls you still lose so where's ball uh broadcast lost and wait and now you're done with that script we have to do when i receive miss um you have to say miss for one second so say one second and it will wait one second and it will do the same as this because it will wait once i can set the size back to 50 and go to the place where it was originally so this is a lot of code so if you need to take a moment to pause i know it's really small so now the code is organized you can feel free to pause and here's all our code so i'm gonna give you a few seconds and we have shoot we have space bar we have the green flag and more shoot over here so feel free to pause goal all throughout there and then miss all over there so now let's test out our ball so our bull's eye is working perfectly it looks like knuckle now we have to code the keeper so it works uh hello so now we have to code the keeper so let's go to the keeper and when the green flag is clicked i have to also have to hide the y so when the oh yes i have to rename this to rio soccer shoot and now when the green flag is clicked it will set the size to 45 and it'll switch costume to keeper one go to x i think i already have the position for him yet and forever it will wait 0.5 seconds and next costume and now see our costumes we have one two one two so it looks like he's ready to carve now we have when i receive shoot we have to have glide 0.5 seconds to a pick random place so we're gonna pick random negative 90 to positive 90. so as you can see the x for this keeper from negative 90 see negative 98 to positive 90 and there's also the y so pick random from 20 to 70 so maybe from here 20 that's yeah 20 around 20 and then to 70 yeah so that's our code over here and then wait two seconds and then it'll go to back to that position yep all right and this is the code so feel free to pause so let's try this out real quick so he's in his position we have that miss uh so it's just a pick random wherever and it doesn't look like he's too smart so i want to add something called perfect block so it doesn't look like he's too smart so i'm gonna make perfect block so when i receive shoot it will set perfect block a new variable perfect block and it will set perfect block to pick random one to three and if you want it to be harder like really hard you can do one to two so it's a really high chance you'll get your ball but i'm doing one to three so it's more easier for me and then i'm going to use it if then else statement uh per if perfect block equals one perfect block equals one and it will glide 0.5 seconds to seconds to x and y but remember from the bullseye we have the x and y we've marked down the coordinates well if it equals one so it's going to pick a random number and then if equals one it'll go to that coordinate and it'll catch your ball so we have that and then i'm just gonna drag in this script right here yeah um else it will go somewhere random and then it'll wait two seconds and go back there so now we are done with the keeper uh let's organize our variables a little bit so ball score so you see perfect block let's see it's one so he will get the ball but what if it's three it's a goal so let's see and it's one again so three again so it's perfect block right there hide it real quick and now we have to work on the goal post which has barely any code just when the green block is clicked just in case it will go to this position just in case if it moves or whatever and our net that has exactly the same code just you know just in case and now our wave which has some code so unless we're gonna wave so it's just gonna add some effects so the green flag is clicked it will go to x zero zero y zero and then it'll go forever it'll repeat three times and wait 0.2 seconds so it'll go up and down and up and down and up and down and it'll change y by 10 and then i'll repeat another three let's just duplicate that and just make some tweaks to it put it under do not put it in wait 0.2 seconds instead of change y by negative 10 change y by 10 so it's like what down up and down and up and down so as you can see look at the waves look at the waves and now let's look at the clouds which is just some extra you know look so when the green flag is clicked it'll go to this position i think i have the position yet and it'll go forever he'll go forever um well let's just make this even uh repeat oh repeat two times and it will wait 0.4 seconds it will change y by minus 1 so go up and down and up and down just like the waves but just in the sky so change y by 1 and then you just have to duplicate this put it under and then change y by one so we have our game and our banner is the last thing to code on our list so let's see what we have to do this year so when the green flag is clicked we have our three costumes you can either go to my thing my project and export the sprites or you can either write your own i think it's pretty easy to write on your own you just need some uh text and just write it so when the green flag is clicked so three costumes are the start score five to win are one and the lost and when the green fog is clicked um it'll go to x 0 y negative 40. i'll go to the front layer so be in front of everything and it will switch costume to start so it's in the beginning so switch costume to start and then it will show and then it'll wait 0.5 seconds and then it will hide and after all of that when i receive one that no go to uh same position and switch costume to one and it'll show and then it'll stop so it's the end of our project if you win and now we have to do the lose so just duplicate when i receive lost it'll go to this position switch costume to lost instead of one show and stuff so let's test out our game over here so we have our 10 balls our bulls eye is moving our goals keeper is dancing our waves are moving our clouds are slightly moving our score and we missed let's see what we get so he got basically two ones in a row and i got maybe a two or three so let's see i think i'm gonna lose this one though it's really hard actually to do this okay that's one more ball please yes okay so it says you won okay and now you lose uh so i'm here in my goalie to speed up the process perfect block is gonna be one out of one so it will always make it this is impossible game to win now no way you can get score anymore let's just farm out all our balls here so we're in our last ball here and it looks like you lost works so we have our game here so please like share subscribe join our studio join our discord server um and comment the comment section below what else
