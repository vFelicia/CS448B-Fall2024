hello and welcome back to kids coding playground Channel today we'll be looking with a new project learning to use this in scratch so I know that there are many kids struggling with this and how this works in scratch so hopefully after seeing this video you be you'll be more familiar with it and you're able to understand what Allah says in scratch ok so here's what we have we have a list of name in here and and if you click on this sprite here Giga she will tell you what is the shortest and what is the longest name in the list and there's ass button we we added here if you click on this it will tell you if that name you can type of name and it will tell you that name is in the list Allah so unless you go over some other function with lists so what we can do with this is you can add something to a Miss you can delete something in the list you can insert something into a list somewhere between two two elements you can replace something in Alice and this one is the item number on the list just how you are what the item number is but on this and then this one is checks if the object is in the list basically if that whatever the name is that in the listener and this one tells you how how many items are hidden this and this one is check if it contains the item in this this one actually tells you the number of the object in the list so basically let's say go back to this first page so message gems gems will give you this number five the index of five so let's jump into the game let me just demo it a little bit okay so this is the waffle witness we have these names here if you click on this ear she'll tell you like the longest name is Isabelle and showing them is Kega and now you can click on this that asks ok find that item in the list so you can say let's say jeans I type in James here push enter it'll tell you ok Jim is in the list so let's say if I type in something else like either so it will say Hiba is not in the list so you guys nondelivery that's how how how some of the function within there so we'll go through some of the function that we could call with listen how we work with it okay so let's get stopped with a new project ok before I start up please like share and subscribe to our Channel and give us some feedback and comment below our video go pretty appreciate that ok alright what we need to do is we are going to select a background you can use any background you like we were just using the classroom background right and then you can use the sprite you like for me I already had the sprite Giga so I'll blow her okay let me upload that sprite ok ok I have to go here let me delete the cap and then the tree and then we have blown the other sprite I had okay back you hit the wrong button and my past sprite okay so I have all the spray I need I'll move the tree stump here or over here okay alright so what I did was for her please he just used the sprite that you have and I just added this hat to her so I just created it downloaded a hat and then just erased the back yeah background and then just put a hat on her and then this thing is another like here a diploma or something you just put it on her hand so you can get that if you like you know from online you can erase the background head so that's what we have for her okay the tree stump same thing it's got the form online and I just use arrange the background and then this ask is pretty easy just draw the background and then put the text text box you want just type on a text one okay so make you're making it faster so I imported some of the assets I have okay so we have these sprites with me look in the background can also add like walking with lists or something like that if you like you can just put the text here so you say so one less oh you can have a different font if you want right but this something like this put it in the backboard that chalkboard okay okay we have we have that so far okay what we need to do is we'll go back to the code now what did it create some variable in the variable we'll make some variable so first one will make the kernel name we'll make another variable longest name so to find the longest name in the shortest night night so we need that so this one is the shortest name so we have longest name shortest name and current name so using the current name we can go through the loop after this and then we can find out what the what the name what is the shorter said what is the longest and what is the comparing to the current name right so let me just put all three on top here so you see to see in a bit okay so wouldn't we'll need another miss variable so I make the list variable call nameless or something okay in my nameless so you see the currently the nameless is empty you can put some name in there let's say you can say click on this Add button okay one and let's say you put Emma right and you hit enter okay the next one all right and James okay okay so so far we have these names on the list and you can make it a little bit bigger by dragging this here okay so so far we have six over one more okay wave Oliver so these are the name end of this so far I'll go to some of the thing that we could do with this okay first Wow we on this right we wanna make her go to the front just in case she go to the back you know was her standing in front of the chalkboard and then the the tree spring so we can say go to the front layer okay and then let's look at some of the this we can do with operation with this so you go back to variable you have something say delete all right if I click on this it will actually delete all the names in the list I should have done that before I did all this but uh let's try anyway so let's say I click on this right you see them this here or delete all so you see that this is now empty and you can do something with this also insert list this is insert and there's hat right let's try that so let's say I want to say I add something I said had Emma so if I if I click on this you add a Matilda's you can see that it added Emma let's say I had another one James and then I click on this so you can use a program right you have the stock like when stock it's correct you can put all your name and then every time it run they'll add it in so you can also do something called insert let's say I want to insert in position two under this so what happened is they can't push James down and put this whatever name I put in here will go there as I put here so and then I hit enter I click on this so you can see digger goes through the number two position or move James down right so this is how you do something called insert so we come to that so there's something called a leap so what delete does is number you want delete from the list you can click on this so let's say I want to delete number three right well I said put number four what happened never done before right what do you didn't happen nothing right nothing happened because we don't have number four but if I put number three I click on it it'll remove James since James is number three so as you can see you can do something like this right there's something called replace also I can say replace number two right with Oliver so what happened is it will replay Kega this name here here with hover so if I click on this once you can see that every place it with Oliver so these are the different function that you could call witless so delete all would clear everything out and basically have it where but the bottom is so if I say at James again it will go to the bottom so it will always go to the bottom of the list insert we can insert in any position into this you giving the number so what do you think that happened when you say insert can go to six so if you do this it will not insert anywhere so it doesn't go anywhere since six is not a valid on the list but if you say app then you add to the bottom so we can say I have to four so we'll go to the fourth position okay so we have we have understanding that these some of this function here okay and then there's something called um this thing here the item item in the list so if I say one of the less what happened is it will bring up Emma because that's number one if I could and one you see that am i right I pray for it will say here by foot five it won't have anything because we don't have five right so we have gone through most of these here right and then there's here also this is things the nameless so whatever you want to check let's say I want to check if you guys into this let's put on this I'll say zero it was there's no no no position for for diva do I say yeah James it will tell me that is in position three position three that is so this one gives you the number the position of the object the element in the list okay and then what is that length of the list so this one will tell you oops this one will tell you how many items in there or how many elements so if you click on this it'll tell you C is 4 so if I ask something else to it let's talk well I had time to so you see tom is 5 if I click on this again now it tells me okay have five correct and you can also click on this and delete give you one put on this to delete it okay okay so we have gone through some of these function and then last one here this one contained that means it will check if something belongs to the list so let's put however if I say contain was return true because Oliver is in the Miss rate if I say let's say some other name like mine right so it says false because Mike it's not into this right okay I hope you understand these this function we have gone through all of them so let's do our game now with all these things okay all right so we'll go throughout him see how we can create him to find the longest and the shortest name the endless okay alright so what we need to do is when this sprite is clicked so we want to do something so we'll click on Kega she'll tell us what is the longest and shortest name and we'll leave one more variable we did the position index so call index or keep track of where we are in unless doing using a loop or later so you remember scratch indexes always starts at one as you can see one two three four if someone so what we need to do is in the beginning you can say so we'll reset the index at one we can set the current name to plain just delete this and we can do this again and duplicate again we will select the longest name and the shortest name so we just initialize everything basically making it to default or what reset again every time you click on this uh Giga sprite okay so what we need this we will need a loop or still repeat until you remember we were playing with the length of the list I won't go through all the item in the list and find each name and compare right so all we needed there was we need to use this operator will say the index let me decide the index now okay maybe not we'll show you guys since index is one obviously so this is the okay we'll say that linked up in this so basically we'll repeat until the index is greater than the length of the list so let's say if I put this something here say hello and then I'm gonna say I they get one of the name so let's say here say set current name so to get their item where to say item right here so item of the list so can I use one because one is will always get em all right so what we need to do it we're gonna use index so right now index is one so we will pick the first one which is Emma and then what we can do it we can change the index change index by one that will go to two and then we'll go get Oliver so if I say I put this and in here and what I do is I'm going to put current name if I do this what happen you'll see that Kia will repeat em our James and Geeta go by clicking her let's just try and then you can see this index go up one two three four so like the corner you can see Emma Oliver James and Giga so as you can see every time it goes it increase the index by one until it gets to five so five is greater than four right that's only for item so five is greater than four or stop so you see again Oliver James and Tia and then this stuff so it go through all the name in the list so now we know how to go through all the name in the list and we know how to get the chronium littlest what happened now is we have to save the name and compare them so what we can do is we can use the if statement control here so if okay um we're gonna use the operator here to compare okay we're gonna have to compare them linked what we're going to do is we're gonna use something called length you remember we use that on the previous lesson before with the variable and loops and index what you can do is you can put this current name so let's say your current name is Giga if you click on this it'll reach one for a which is the length of the word name so you say if the link of the name is greater than is the operator again the length of the name of the longest him so basically if the current name is longer than the longest name what do you wanna do we wanna set I wanna set the longest name equals to the current name so basically if the whatever name that picks up if it's longer than the name that is in the longest name it will set that him so the first time what it does it will set Emma right because the longest name is zero we can we don't have anything right and then after that longest name well Emma and then I'll go on and check with Oliver and then check with James and then check with TIA so if I run through the Coe again just pay attention to the longest name you can see that it will change initially will be Emma and they will compare down and maybe one can add one more say value right and then we'll have one more say John okay so what happened you'll see that will you'll know stop at William SL for longest name the current name next so we'll have John but it will not set so let's just run through one time and pay attention to the longest name so you can see oh it's already so quick because I didn't have any uh any way to write any say for two second or whatever so it go through world quick as you can see it go through and they already found out that will miss the longest name if you want to have some break in between right just like before we can but I just say you're right say the current name right and then we can kind of slow down the loop and you can kind of see and that's still for one second so if I do this I'll write me again I'll click on her should say mo you can see him all over okay come here and comparing kamandalu young so you can see that it said well you miss the longest name so let's look at it again let's run again so you see Emma Oliver Oliver is longer than Nemo right and then Williams longer than our it says William right so that's how how it works so we have so far we've found the longest name in the list right so let's remove this again sorry I was just demonstrating that piece so now we'll put this back in so now let us set the shortest name so similarly we need some operator right in control as well so this time we have to check we'll use the equal and we'll have to use another one called order so what we want to do is the we're gonna check the link ok the length of the shortest name it's equal to zero basically in the beginning so what we want to do is actually in the beginning we need to set both the longer then and the shoulders name to the current name so this will ensure that the shortest name will always get set so in the beginning assess okay there's nothing in the shortest name if that link is 01 set it or we need t another operator here or the link to pay this the length of their current name okay so current name here so basically or check if the length of the current name whatever name we had is shorter than the shortest name then we have to also set it right or if it's in the beginning we also set it so those are the two condition so they said the shortest name equals to the current name so what happened it'll go through the first Hamlet it doesn't have anything for sure shortest name it was said that whatever the current name has and next time onward it will check if the current name is actually shorter than the shortest name give me this then I'll set the curtain into the shortest name okay so if I run this again you can see just pay attention to the shortest name here go try to find the shortest name so first or set Emma as the longest name Emma the longest name and the shortest name and then they'll start from pairing so if you I have to put the weight here right because well let me put this here and then I'll put this current name so just kind of go through and you can see okay let me click on her again let's go so you see Emma is the first one who set both Emma shortest name and the longest name and then start comparing so Kega is shorter now okay so we'll make it one second we'll try again what happened is um here I will see that Emma has four letter John or the whole letter so what it happened is when Kiki also I told her who happened and so we'll pick the first one once that first one is satisfied it will not pick it since it's not less than that right so if we if we add something else in there like I said we had Ava or something like that then we'll put pick Ava so right now we run this again so you see Emma is the shortest name so even though Kega is also for will not pick that because Emma already these been set as a shortest name what we can do is let's say we had a new name to it like anger or something right so if we do that then it will definitely will pick up Eva is the shortest name because that's three character ID so let's run it again so you can see Emma it's the shortest name right now it's not changing anything right John now Ava so paid us the shortest name so you can see Williams longest then he was the shortest name and if we add more it doesn't matter we had more Sofie right it will not I will not pick that because they've already been set right so let's render again just try understand change go through the name and then once if I never I've said that as a shortest name and then that's it so pretty much that's it and then you can just say right go back to you for look you can say say you can use the joint statement here you can say longest name is and then we just put the variable longest name and we'll duplicate that and shortest name or use the shortest name here so we can hide this variable now and if we run it again Oh see come on oh we still have this loop here so we need to remove that right so what we can do is take this out for a minute remove that put this back in so let me zoom back out you can see the whole Co weekend so now click on her you'll see the longest name is William short its name is ava so it finds the longest and shortest name in the list and we can do one more thing right with the testing this last what we can do is same thing when the sprite is clicked we can use call another this function here let's go back to a variable well we can ask first we'll say fine item in this and then we have to use the if an else statement here and then we can use this contain right so the name is contain the answer whatever the user typed in if it contained and we can say join was safer's and we are going to use the join joining two things together one who can say answer okay answer space open space is into this okay and okay this and we can say answer whatever user Titan is not into this okay so let's stop this will suck again will click on this and I'll say fine item you know this and let's say we said John says John is into this right okay and then let's say we put in liam or something sadly and it's not under this and liam is not under this right okay so that's pretty much it for the for the walking witless I hope you guys understand this and release like share and subscribe to our channel see you guys next time thank you
