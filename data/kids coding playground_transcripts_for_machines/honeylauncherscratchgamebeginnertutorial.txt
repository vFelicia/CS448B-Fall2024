welcome back guys it's kid playground here today we're back with another video of scratch and today we'll be making a springtime themed game called honey launcher so I'll show you guys a demo so first of all some music plays and then there's also you can move the monkey with the left and right arrows keys and then you can't pass the tree and the objective is the game is to launch honey into the monkey catcher guy over here and the honey should go into here and try to catch as much honey as you can and try to improve your score with only a limited amount of launches so you can use the up and down arrow keys to uh move the arrow so then you can launch the honey with space bar and it'll launch the honey like that and if it touches the guy then you'll get a score as you can see I touched it so I get one score and you basically have to predict where it's going to go or you can like time it correctly if not it'll hit the edge and you lose a launch and if you um lose all your launches without getting greater than six score then you lose so and if you get six score then you win so let's get started so we made our new project and I'm going to rename it to Honey launcher first thing you want to do is delete this scratch cat and we're going to get some Sprites in so first let's get the monkey Sprite let's also get the tree Sprite let's also get the arrow Sprite let's also get the jar and we'll only be using the honey variant and let's get um so I do have another monkey it's called the monkey catcher I have it in my backpack it's really simple to draw so it's just a normal monkey so I'll just show you it's just a normal monkey and then um basically it's uh reshaped Circle so you just move it down and you just import some uh honey costume in there and it's done and that's just your honey catcher your monkey Catcher And yeah so these are all the Sprites we need except that you and you lose but we'll do that last so let's go to the monkey first thing we're going to do is set his size to 45 so so he's a little bit smaller when the green flag is clicked we're going to make it so it goes to X and I have a certain position for this 180 140 so it doesn't really touch the edge so it doesn't like get the honey bottles on the edge because it'll delete the honey bottle so after that it'll switch costume to Monkey a so there is two costumes for the monkey that we're using and I have a throwing costume and a normal costume so this is a normal costume and I take this one so we don't need this one I take this one and I shifted the hands up so just like this to create a throwing effect for the monkey so this one I fli vertical and I just placed it like that and just readjust the hands a little bit and it shows a throwing monkey maybe like that yeah and those are our two costumes next we're going to have a show and then we're going to make a new variable launches it'll set launches to 15 and after that it'll set rotation style so we're going to make it don't rotate so it doesn't rotate at all oops like that all right so now we're going to get a the green flag is clicked we're going to get a new variable score so let's get score and we're going to set score to zero and then forever so let's get this done if then key space is pressed then it will switch costume to Monkey B wait 02 seconds and it'll switch costume back to Monkey a and then under that so not inside under it if youve got to F if then touching tree then it'll reset the position back to it'll reset the position back to 80 140 so it gives the effect of bouncing back and then after that we need a if then statement under if then statement under the key left arrow is pressed then it will change X by 4 and then if key right arrow press it'll change X by4 so now we're going to code the you and you lose stuff on the bottom of the monkey so we get a if then so first you want to drag an and and then you also want to get an or and then place the or inside one of these sections and also you want to get equals and a less than sign so just like that and get another less than sign just like that so if launches is equal to zero or launches is less than zero so you ran out of launches and score is less than six so six is the determining Factor if you win or not then it will broadcast you lose broadcast you lose and we'll duplicate this so if launches is equal to zero or launches is less than zero and score is so you got a or or right here so take away this you put an equal sign and score is equal to zero so if you ran out of launches and your score is equal to zero or your score is greater than equal uh greater than six then it'll broadcast you wi okay and that's the monkey so let's move on to the tree so first of all the tree want we want to pick a place for it to B and the position I ended up putting it at is 10 um 1 138 so it's down there and I also set the size to 60 so you can just do the same as me it'll just be over there and when the green flag is clicked it will show that's it now let's move on to the arrow so the arrow when the green flag is clicked it will show and then it will set launch power let make a new variable launch power it will set launch power to f 10 and then after after that it will go to x 1880 140 so the position of the monkey and point in Direction 45 and then it'll go to the front layer so it'll be in front of the monkey so you can see which which way you're like aiming at and when the green flag is clicked forever it will go to monkey and when up arrow is pressed so left and right is to control the monkey up arrow is to control the arrow position then it will turn 3° left and then when down arrow key press it'll turn 3° right after that um you take a when up arrow keys press you take a if then statement if then launch power let's get launch power is less than 20 then it will change launch Power by .1 and then a when down arrow key press so just do at it and if launch power is greater than one then it'll change laun power by negative .1 so it's not as strong okay that is the arrow code so I'm going to pause over here feel free to pause over here now let's move on to the jar let's go to the jar so we're only using the honey costume so delete that and we'll use this so when the green flag is clicked it will go switch costum JB it will hide and it will go to Monkey we'll take a forever Loop take a if then if then key space is pressed it will show and then we'll get a sound effect so let's get boing sound effect bo bo it'll start sound boing it'll go to arrow and then it will point in Direction and we take the tricky block so go to sensing take this backdrop number of stage switch the second one first so point in Direction of Arrow so it just point in the direction of the arrow and then it'll set new variable fall speed it will set F speed to zero and we'll make another new variable gravity did it not make did I not click enter gravity oh oh man it's just lagging okay we're back I just went back in and it's back because it was lagging earlier so we're going to set gravity to .25 so that's going to uh affect the fall speed and then after that we're going to have a repeat until we take three ores so I mean two ores but like three sections and it would repeat until touching Edge or touching tree one so the tree is a factor or touching monkey catcher drag this and put it in here and then the thing will move launch power amount of steps after that it will change y by the speed also going to close the launch power and also that it will change fall speed by gravity so the gravity is affecting the fall speed and you take a if then statement so we're going to place it right under here if then touching the monkey catcher then it'll change the score by one and under all this like under the repeat until and the if then we're going to put a hide so that's if it touches it it'll go to Arrow one and then after that it will change launches by ne1 and now our last thing I I mean we're almost done but the monkey catcher so when the green flag is clicked it will go to x I do have a position for this I put it at 136 136 134 we're going to make it show we're going to make it go forever and it will repeat until you take a or statement so let's K A or launches is equal to zero or launches is less than zero just like that and then after that it'll Glide 1 second to X so it's going to be 134 that's the Y but then the x is going to be a pick random 90 to 200 of course you can alter this to Glide more often or Glide to um a greater uh range of positions but I put 90 to 200 and then it'll wait one second last thing we have to do is the you wi you lose in the backd jop so let's do the you win you lose real quick so you win I put it in a blue color since it's the we use the forest back WP so yeah we'll use marker and we'll write you win and we'll make it pretty big maybe a little bit smaller it's still a little bit off the screen so a little more F and then you you win and then Center it then we'll duplicate this take a make a U lose Center it and color this one red because red is normally the losing color after that we're going to have some more code over here so when the green flag is clicked it'll go to 0 0 it will hide and then when I receive you lose then it'll switch costume costume two it will show after that it will stop all duplicate this when I receive you win switch costume costume one it will show and a stop all so the game should look like this but let's just move the variables around and let's get the backdrop so I use the forest backdrop so going to use the forest backdrop and we have some code back here so I use when the green flag is clicked forever it will play I used OD song It's a pretty good one OD song it'll play sound OD song Until done so let's test out the game and see if it works let's just save the project real quick it feels safe yeah so we got the music the guy is moving we can also move the arrow bounces right off the tree and the space bar you throw the honey ooh and and you try to get at least six score before okay let's see if we can get him in time oh no come back you can't even throw the honey because it's not a clone so okay I think we're going to win this one we have not we have eight more launches and we only need one more score so the objective of this game is try to get as high of a score as we can but it's kind of hard cuz the monkey moves at random positions and to like find that correct angle on the Arrow to like get the all the score in so yeah we're going to win this cuz we have six score but it is kind of hard to win and it says you win so yeah and let's see what happens if you lose so I'm just going to spam all my honey at the tree see let's throw it at myself we we and you lose cuz I didn't get any score so that's the whole game so if you like the video please like share and subscribe and comment in the comment section below what else games that you want and I'll see you guys next time
