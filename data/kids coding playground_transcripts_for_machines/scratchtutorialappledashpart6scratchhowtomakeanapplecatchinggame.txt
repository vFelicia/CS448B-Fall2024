okay so welcome back guys it's kids coding polygram here so today we will be finishing up apple dash so you guys may be asking why haven't you been posting the video it's been over a month well it's because i have end of the year exams and have to um like study it for the tests but now school is over i can upload more frequently so we will be working on the last part of apple dash so before we start i will quickly go through the code of the game all right zoom in so inside the player here is the movement and switching the skins if you buy the other one the starting up the game and we got the bomb this is the code for the bomb the sound when it hits the player when the bomb falling out of the sky and the hp on the character the basket fruits so it's like the fruit movement the fruit falling down so this is the fruit and now we got the begin button really simple just it's like clicking the begin button coins this is the currency of the game you use this to buy different upgrades you can pause it if you'd like hit box the shop the shop icon you can click on it all right so that's the shop icon the shop background switches the background into the shop the exit button in the shop so you can click and exit and then this is the speed upgrade okay and then this is the bigger basket upgrade and then we have the different skin purchase you can buy the pig all right and this is the button let's say you want to switch back to the ghost you just click it all right so right now we're gonna add like a little title screen so when you start the game as you can see it's kind of like blank right here we're gonna add like a little title screen right there so it'll look a little bit better so i actually got the skirts for my dad he helped me add this thing so let's paint a new sprite so first we're going to i'm going to get like a yellowish color like kind of yellow or orange with no outline um make the saturation max and i'll click on the text probably going to make it a marker because it's easier to see so i'm going to write apple dash dash like that uh make it bigger okay all right so we have our texas make it a little bit smaller so apple dash okay all right so first in apple dash in this a title we're gonna rename this thing to title capslock title title all right so let's start coding inside the title so when i receive the start screen uh message on the title we're going to go to the font layer go to front layer and i'm going to go to x0 and y10 so it's going to be somewhere like right here about like right there and we're going to show the sprite and we're going to go point in direction of 90 point direction 90. i'm going to set the size of zero percent all right so like it's gonna like turn small and flash big that's what we're gonna do and we're going to make a new variable we're going to call it turn turn for all sprites so inside turn we're going to set it to zero at the beginning so that so we're also going to make this apple logo apple dash title like rotate side to side so we're gonna make something called turn to zero and we're gonna get a forever loop forever forever um we're going to change change the size oops change the size uh by 150 divided by 150 we're going to divide and subtract so we're going to subtract the 150 by the size well size and then we're going to divide by three so remember the um subtract has to be in the first slot and then we're going to change the turn by four we'll use the term uh we're going to change the turn by four we are going to turn this amount of degrees so this is just to make this thing rotate side to side so turn going to get a divide by two divide by two and we're gonna get cosine all right um oops move it to the front cosine of turn all right and then if it if we're gonna move the mouse on the sprite the title sprite we're gonna make it flash big okay and we're gonna get so we're gonna get if the touching mouse pointer then we're going to we can just duplicate this change this instead of 150 we're doing 200 200 minus the size divided by three all right and then one more script right here when i receive start game so when the game has started when you click on the begin button we're going to hide this and stop the script stop other scripts in the spring okay so now we can save the project as you can see this thing is right there it is toggling from side to side you put your mouse on it gets bigger i think we can actually make this sprite smaller in the costumes so i'm going to make it a little bit smaller looks a little bit too big i think this is better there you go that looks better and when you click play as you can see it flashes big that's why we said it's a zero percent right just makes your game look a little bit better with this little thing title all right so now we can start working on our uh fruit armageddon scripts so what this is is uh so at some points a bombard of fruits and bombs will fall into into the game to make it more interesting you know so we are going to make a new sprite i'm gonna paint it okay uh text we're gonna use the red we're gonna use marker i guess and then we're going to say i guess incoming uh use the we will add the force field after this use the force field by getting the f key all right uh let's go into text let's space it out a little bit so it looks better here we go and we're gonna make this text flash so it'll look better all right okay so we have the text we're gonna go into the code uh we can probably shrink this inside like that so we'll get more space to increase the size let's make it a little bit smaller okay there you go all right so now let's go back to the code for this thing and then when i receive start game uh start game we're going to make a new variable we're going to call it uh fruit arm get done definitely spell it uh this is for all sprites again so we're gonna set it to off in the beginning because it is um it will occur every off every so often so in the beginning we don't want it to play and then we're going to get forever forever if we're going to get an if uh then statement so if not so if it's not equal if the fruit or what we're getting is on so if it's not that means it's gonna be off if it's not this then we're going to wait 10 seconds so probably like every 10 seconds and armageddon will occur so we're gonna repeat four times we're gonna make it like flashes making the text flash so we're gonna go hide wait 0.5 seconds 0.5 seconds and then we're going to show i'm going to wait another 0.5 seconds all right and then we're going to hide after this is done playing we're going to hide this and then we're going to set the fruit i'm getting to on so it's in progress of doing it set through i'm getting status to on you know we're going to broadcast a message called fruit armageddon this will be uh um the fruits will receive this message actually so you're gonna get broadcast fruit and then we're going to wait another 10 seconds so it won't be that pretty good all right so here's the code for that and then we're going to get our one green flag clicked uh i'll probably keep this text like right here in the middle of the screen maybe like zero zero or something so we're gonna hide and then we're going to go to zero zero which is the origin zero zero and we're going to set the status to off set fruit i'm getting status to off um and then when i receive here end game right here we're going to stop other scripts in the sprite all right okay so now let's go back to our fruits so inside the fruits we're going to receive the message when i receive fruit armageddon okay so when i receive fruit armageddon we are going to set the fruit speed to negative 15. so right here fruit speed is negative six we're basically gonna like make it faster so then the fruits will fall faster fruit speed right here we're going to negative 15 and then we're gonna wait eight seconds so it'll be like that for eight seconds i'm getting will probably be for eight seconds and we're gonna set the fruit speed back to negative six after it is finished negative six so we're going to set it to negative six and then we're going to broadcast a message called stop fruit armageddon and then the armageddon text will receive that and we'll stop so stop that okay so we're going to go to the sprite um we can rename it's like text or something and when when we receive this message inside the text we are going to receive stop for armageddon stop returning again we're going to stop uh set the fruit arm cutting status to off all right so now we have this fruit armageddon let's test it out also everyone i made one small mistake this has to be on so you have to wait until the fruit armageddon status is equal not equal to on that means is off so i found it out so be sure to put this into your code right so now let's test it out should happen like every 10 seconds there you go as you can see the text is showing up and the fruits are falling faster we can also make the bombs fall faster by putting the same code into the bomb and the coins all right so it's just that one small mistake i put right there you have to put it on and now off all right so let's go to the bomb we could just pretty much go back to the fruits drag and drop this thing into the bomb and drag and drop this thing into the coin all right so let's start just waiting for another i'm getting as you can see the text is showing up so you can see everything's falling faster yeah let's save our project also i forgot yeah right here you have to switch these this has to be bomb speed not fruit speed bomb speed this also has b bomb speed that uh how fast do we oh we put at negative eight that's the speed of the bomb that's normally um so we're gonna make this like negative 20 or something and inside the coin we have to instead of doing this we're going to have to oops uh we'll have to do this as the same thing corresponding so we're going to use the coin speed the coin speed um and also we have to um set the wait time to zero right here so it won't be waiting wait time zero negative fifth let's do negative 20 as well and the wait time wait eight seconds we're gonna put the weight time to three again so this just not let them not spawn too quick wait time to three and then we're going to set the fruit uh coin speed back to original speed which is nine all right negative time okay let's do it now uh okay i just turned on the volume um just wait until the armageddon comes all right so here it is all right see as you can see everything is falling faster now not just the fruits all right so yeah that's the armageddon so now let's work on the force field i don't think we'll actually be able to finish this today if we can then that'd be great so first let me um i think i have my backpack if not i want to get it okay so hold up let me get my force field sprite real quick all right so now we have our force field um purchase uh button and now i have to get my force feel all right so now i have both the force field and the purchase button so something where that's different between these and the force fields you can bought unlimited amount of force fields so that's gonna be one different thing we're gonna have to switch okay so in the force field when i receive start game we are going to hide and when i receive start screen we're going to hide and we're going to switch the costume to costume one which is the nongrayed out one so we have a grayed out one and laundry that one so every time you click it it'll just change a little color that's what i'm just gonna do also one and when i receive um i'm gonna receive what is that um endgame i'm going to hide okay and then so basically we're just going to drag and drop the same thing over here so right here we have this thing right uh this check purchase so we're just going to drag and drop this into right all right so now we have this so i deleted the endgame thing because i realized it's a whole different thing so we need that so right here we have this thing instead we have to make a new variable we're going to call it start buying this this one you could buy infinite amount and it seems that we already have it because i imported this sprite so start buying is the variable it's for all sprites as well so we're going to instead let's change this to start mine because here by infinite amount and we're going to put yes right here and we're going to instead of using this we're going to have to broadcast another message so drag and drop another thing this thing when i receive shop into our force field so when i receive shop i'm gonna make this guy go to negative 60 and negative 25 instead and we're going to switch the costume to costume one okay and 100 minus size divided by three that's the same thing and then instead right here we're going to change something different so we're going to allow them by infinite amount so we're going to keep this out for a second now we're going to set the start buying variable start buying to yes and put this broadcast we're gonna use the broadcast and wait instead and we're going to make a new variable called check field purchase check for the purchase and weights all right and right here uh instead of this we're going to do check force field purchase oops and we're going to start buying to yes and instead right here we're going to set to start buying back to n uh so if it's equal to yes could have set it back to no and this has to be an if then statement not if else if don't we we can keep this actually because it's the same cost we're going to set the start by start buying two node and we are going to get an equal operator start buying here to yes and we're just going to put this back in in here if and this has to be an ifthen statement again so can you use another if that statement so this is a bit different because you want to buy infinite amounts so if money we're going to make it 25 costs the same as the wings then we're going to change the money the money money by negative 25 and we are going to switch the cost from the costume to switch costume costume two and i'm pretty sure we have the variable force field already force field uh right here yeah so this one we're gonna change the force field by one variable force field it's for all sprites as well so once you buy one you will gain a force field and you're going to wait 0.5 seconds before letting them buy one more again so wait point five seconds and then we're gonna switch back to the original costume allowing them to buy another one switch costume costume one all right so now let's go to our force field actual sprite the actual sprite itself like the actual force field and we are going to get a when the f key is pressed when key f is pressed we're going to get if then statement if so we're going to get if um force field is uh greater than one we're only going to allow it if they have greater than one force field of course you can use one if you don't have any so greater than one and you have two conditions of course fuel greater than one and not forceful status equals on so that means um if a force wheel is on then that means we can't allow them to use another one so they can't stack on each other so we already have the force field status right here i made it and so basically it's for all sprites as well and we're going to get a knot right here not equal to on so force field status not equal to on and then we're going to set the force field timer which is already right here set the force field timer to 10 so it's going to be for 10 seconds and then we're going to broadcast a message and we are going to name it start timer i think we would have it start timer apparently we do not have it so we have to make the message start timer and inside start timer we're going to show go to front layer so it's going to go in front of the actual player we'll go to front layer where is it over here and then we're going to set the ghost effect 50 so it's a little bit seethrough so you can see through it a little bit set the ghost 50 and we're gonna have forever forever if else if force field timer is greater than zero then it will always go to the fruit catcher so if it's not over basically meaning the force field timer is not over force field timer is not over then we will always go to the fruit catcher or the ghost the player yeah and else if it's over that we are going to set the force field status to off force wheel status to off and we're going to hide and stop the script all right so this is the when you click f this will happen and then we're going to get it when green flag clicked set the force field uh to zero so you'll start out with zero force fields zero and then we're going to set the force field to off force field status to off in the beginning you do not have a force field on and we're gonna hide in the beginning all right and then when i receive start game we are going to uh start game we are going to hide and sing with endgame just duplicate this one and oops uh duplicate this one and we're going to rename it to endgame right here and when i receive start screen we're also going to hide start screen and one last thing this is the timer so when you receive start timer like we broadcasted earlier timer we're going to set the force field status to on so while the timer is active the force field will be on um and we're going to change the force field by negative one because you've used one change force field by negative one and we're going to repeat the amount for force field timer so which is 10 repeat the force field timer amount and we're going to wait one second and change the force field timer by negative one all right so now let's save it let's go full screen all right so as you can see oh yeah we can also hide the variable in the beginning so let me get some money first it costs 25 um money i'll get a little bit more so i can show you can buy multiple okay so let me keep on going all right like 50. and remember you can click s to go to the shop all right so we are going to buy some force wheel so as you can see by one by two you get two all right let's hit the f key you can see the force right there and you don't take any damage one last thing i forgot that we have to make it let the player not take any damage when they touch a bomb with the force field active so we are going to go to the player again one last time player so right here i forgot to add this uh not player let's go to the bomb and so right here if the y position we're also going to put a or statement so we're going to put or or or it's touching the force field touching the force field all right so we're going to do the same thing to the fruits and coins so inside the fruit if touching basket or force feel and finally the coin right here in the coin we are going to get a um so we're going to do it down here where it's touching the basket we're going to get an ore touching basket or touch it so apparently the recorder stopped for some reason so you'll see a cut right there so we're going to continue where we left off so we're going to do this one touch if touching force field as well all right and that should be it i'm pretty sure so let's play let's make it bigger all right oh missing all the there we got a coins we're pretty close to 50. i'll show you that you can buy multiple and okay one more one more please so you buy one let's go back all right oh that one gave one come on looks like they gave a random amount um let's buy another one all right let's wait until an armageddon comes and i'll show you that the force field should work or i can just show you right now yeah see as you can see i don't get damaged by the bombs so yeah that's pretty much it for this project um don't forget to like share and subscribe to our channel kids coding playground and i'll see you guys in the next tutorial bye you
