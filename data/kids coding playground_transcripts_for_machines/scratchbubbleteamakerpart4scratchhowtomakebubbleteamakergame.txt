thank you hello guys welcome back to kiss calling playground Channel today we'll be working on our final tutorial of the Bubble Tea in Mexico game we hope you have learned something new from this tutorial series and I'm excited to see the final result if you have enjoyed our video please consider subscribing to our Channel give us a thumbs up and leave a comment below you support means a lot to us and we appreciate it greatly thanks for being part of our coding community all right so without further Ado let's go into our uh last tutorial so here's what we have left off from last time so we have some code for the chat so if you wonder um miss anything please pause and uh just copy the code down all right so I'll quickly go over each of the Sprite so with the cat this is the customer this is the tapioca scoop tapioca pearl cup the teapot teacup so the teacup is a little bit longer so I think at the very end we have to put the straw on so this is where we're gonna start and then we have the tea the syrup bottle the syrup and that's about it so we're gonna be holding on the straw and the icon and the ring and then put the backdrop you guys already know we have the sound for the brain okay all right so let's get on to our Cove okay so we go to the straw so you remember the the tea cup where I put the straw and that's where we left off so we're gonna stop here okay so when green flag is clicked okay here we'll switch to costume number one so custom number one is the straw that's coming down like this uh with the sharp edge I mean sharp pointer yeah sharp tip I guess and then we're gonna say hi and then when we get the message put the straw on this is where we're going to switch the custom one also uh just to reset the thing when we go from one customer to another and we're gonna put it at this location I think I had it earlier zero and negative 25. and then since we have high We'll add show and then we have a little repeat Loop here so we're gonna say repeat until touching the teacup so that's why the straws come down and then pop through the little plastic thing for the straw so let's say change to y minus five so that will come down okay and then we're gonna put the pop sound foreign times and then we use the next costume and then we'll do a little bit of weight okay so and then the final costume of the seven Loop we should be at the costume number a which is the last one so we start at one and then two three four five six seven so after that we're gonna say broadcast a message so new message say give to customer so this will keep the drink to the customer so when we do the give train to the customer what we're going to do is we're going to have to make the straw follow the cup and also make the cup lie to the straw so I'm gonna say when I received gift between the customer I can't have a forever Loop here and then in this whatever Loop we'll use the X and Y position and then whether you use this tricky Block in the sensing here so here you have to select the uh teacup and then you can select the X position then you select the teacup again we'll select the Y position and we're not gonna exactly the same position because we want the little straw to be a bit higher so we can we can use the operator add so we're gonna add 10 to that and this is the position so basically we're gonna call when they when they give cut to the customer will make the straw follow the cup while the cup is gliding to the customer Okay so after that uh we're gonna have to go back to the cup so tea cup will will actually give when we receive give to customer we're gonna send the cup back to the customer so we're gonna say when we receive give the cup give children to customer we're gonna collide one second I have the uh the 40 and zero so basically you can just move the cup kind of wherever you want like somewhere right here like you see that is 55 right so I put 40 and zero so somewhere like along this line here right so someone here like that so when it goes from here it goes here okay and then we will do um change the customer counter by one so this is what we're going to use like to count how many customer we have left then we also can use it to change the icon and then next we'll say wait one second and then we're gonna broadcast a new message called customer walk away so after the customer get the teeth and walk away we have to hide is strong okay and hide the cup as well so we have to we have this also so this is hiding the cup so I'm going to go back to the straw so the straw we're gonna have to hide the straw as well but before we do that we have to stop this Loop because when the forever Loop here so we're gonna say when I receive um customer walk away plus stop the script so I'm going to say stop add a script and Sprite and then we're gonna hide this job all right so basically after the straw comes to the customer I mean it still comes to the club I'll give it to the customer and then it will go away all right so let's just try it again so we're gonna have to put this put the cup back at the composition okay don't try this out so now we have this so where we have put the straw on right so the cup do this little shake and put the straw on so we can just click on this so to test so you can see the cup at the shape and then we broadcast a message and the straw goes in and the straw under a cup Glide to the customer and at the height so what we have to do is we're going to go to the customer and make the customer actually Glides away when he gets the the drinks so that it can be have like the next customer comes in so what we can do is go to customer and here we have the when we get the customer walks away right so here we say hey when I receive customer walk away I'm gonna make it kind of Glide toward the end here so we have motion say Glide two seconds to 200 25 so 200 is probably somewhere around this area after that I'm going to high and I'm gonna broadcast a new message so after the customer leaves he's gonna broadcast a new message called start again so start again so start again will actually help to have the new customer come in again so when we when we have start again in this customer we have to add some code so here we can add the when I receive start again so for the start again we'll just kind of wait one second and then we change it to the next costume which is the next customer and then we're gonna have a if condition here I'm gonna check the number of uh costumes so basically I have five customer so one two three four five so if my costume is greater than one then I'm going to a custom number greater than one so after that I am going to say move customer so uh for the start again we have after the the next costume the the number will be one right so the first one is gonna be one the second one will be two so once it put it in one which is two they're gonna move customer move actually to the to the golden back land and the customers start gliding back in okay all right so we have the customer we had the straw right and what we need to do next is we are going to uh work on the icon so so that when we give it to the customer uh you know the icon um will light up okay but before we go to do that let's finish the cat so the cat where we had the um start again we can also have uh with that change here so when I receive a start again so here what we're going to do is we're going to use the if and else condition here I'm gonna check these are not operator okay and then we have the customer counter so we're going to try to use that so we're gonna say equal and then customer counter equal to five so number five will be the last customer so if it's not equal to five we're gonna say uh next for one second so that will he'll call the customer and we're gonna change the oh yeah oh yeah I knew I missed something I'll come back to this so um we'll change the costume to uh one which is the standing custom and also we want to change the color of the uh you know the next uh next string so let's say change uh color by 50. so if it's the last customer so we're gonna say good job whatever you like to say good job making bubble tea for all the customers okay so we're gonna say hey good job missing bubble tea for all the customer and then you can stop the game here after that I'm gonna say stop all so I think I forgot one thing here uh so one of the thing I forgot was that you know I forgot to change the costume for this the cat so when we get when we give drink to the customer I want him to raise his hand oh I'm gonna add that right now so when I say when I say give dream to a customer I'm gonna say switch the costume to give and I want to say here you go okay and we'll do it for one second whatever okay so this will give to the customer and uh you know and then after that we'll when they start again we'll say next it's gonna change the color of the drinks and then when we go back you can see that in the customer after uh start again it's kind of called move customer so when move customer will run their broadcast start so we'll start over the game so let's just play it for a minute so make sure everything is good before we work on the actual icon okay so we have the first customer comes in I only have the cup we're gonna add the bubble let's add to T foreign and then it shakes the cup Okay so all right enough that the straw comes in so you can see it says give it to the customer customer walks away he raised his hand it says next and then the next customer comes in so as you can see it seems to be working fine right so yep so this is the next color so since I added the color right so the cat actually changed the color by 50 so after that it gives a different color so let's change the color for that and then pulled the straw and give it to the customer and you can see that it will be the next customer so you can see it gives the cats it raise his hand and then it has next it starts again it's called the next customer and the T will be different color each time so last time was green and we increased by 50 so change color is a different number now is 100 so you can see change color is 100. so you see it's a blue color okay all right so this is pretty much good so the only problem we had right now is just the icon so we'll work on the icon next okay so for the icon we are going to create the icon on the top okay so we'll go so the icon is actually exactly the same as the bubble tea cup so what we're going to do is just going to make it smaller does it and I'm gonna say when green flag is clicked we are going to make it high okay and then we we're gonna set the customer counter so here we'll change the customer counter to zero so this is where we can reset the customer uh you know counter each time and then we're gonna create so also the icon should have a index I think I already created that earlier so the icon make sure you create for the Sprite only so you're making a variable for index make sure you select this and type in Index right that's for the Sprite only okay since I already create I don't need it so icon index okay for the Sprite only I'm gonna set the index to zero and I'm gonna make him go to gonna start at negative two one five and one fifty okay and since I have five customer I'm gonna repeat five times here I'm Gonna Change index each time when we create one icon so I'm gonna say change index by one okay and then census starts at 1 in scratch so the first one what I want to do is again check if we're going to use anything else here and then we are going to use operator called equal I'm going to use the index so if the index is one so let me hide this one now we don't need that so when the index is one I'm gonna set it at this area so my icon will show up like somewhere around here okay so it was index F1 I'm gonna make this set X to negative two one five two fifteen which is what we had started and after that uh we're gonna change X by 40 so every time of the gray one will change X by 40 will create the next block here next one next one next one and now until we have all five icon okay and then we'll call this say create a clone of myself under here okay okay so when you have this cream my clone you have to do this one start as a clone uh what I'm going to do is going to set the ghost effect set the ghost effect to 50 so it's kind of transparent not very clear or not worry like you can see it real well and then once I go to the front layer and then we'll say show and then here what we can do is we can use the uh the code here if condition so where we can use the index so we're gonna put it here so if the index is one we are going to say wait until the operator equal and now we have the customer counter right so every time the customer we gave one to the customer uh we increase the counter that's why the cat thing either somewhere than the customer so it is actually here in the teacup so we keep the between the customer and increase the counter by one right so that's the way it is so when we wait until the customer account is equal to one and then we're gonna set the course effect so set the ghost effect to zero okay so we'll clear so it will see it so same thing we're gonna do this duplicate this like this we're gonna say the index is two we'll wait for the customer to be two we're gonna set the goals effect so the next three so this index is keeping track of the icon each time and this will wait until the uh the custom account it goes to three times we'll light them up so we can show it like clear so this is four and four and then last one five and five okay so we have all the icons so let's test it out real quick so if you see I start the game it created uh five icon you can see five icons started at 2 15 negative 215 and then add 40 each time so one two three four five six by five in the loop okay so let's just finish one so we're not gonna do multiple because it'll take too much time so once this fills up right so right now if you see uh my customer counter is still at zero right so when my customer counter becomes one it will light this guy up so now we're gonna give it to him so you can see it lined up right so these guys are still I mean these little cups are still kind of faded right transparent fifty percent so once the customer counter goes to two this guy will light up because this is the waiting condition here right so this is a index here so this is the second index of this uh bubble tea cup icon here so he's waiting the customer counter to be too right now customer counter is still one so once we give this we'll increase the counter in the teacup here you see this customer counter becomes two so this one lights up okay so I hope you guys understand that so I think we're almost done so the last part is just the rain effect for the game and I think you guys also did that last time I think on the I think you may have seen the project earlier I think uh we made one one simple um tutorial for the rain effect so the ring effect I'm gonna switch the costume to the First costume okay so I have like one two three four five six seven so what I'm going to do is just look through it six times so yeah uh what we have is I will start for the First costume and we're gonna say set the Y at zero and then we have to Forever and then we say set X and we can pick a random negative 240 to positive 240. and then we have a repeat Loop six times and then we have next costume and then at the very end we're gonna switch it back to the First costume okay all right so let's try it out here so you can see the Raindrop kind of like just hitting on the table you can see it kind of if you look at closely so here what you if you want to make it go higher you can change the X and if you want to make go higher you change the X to like let's say 100 right so you can see that it's going to be higher so we run this again you can see the the rain kind of stopped like right here you see that if you want it to be lower uh uh you know you can put like negative one negative 50 or something so you run this you can see the brain drop all the way down to the bottom so for me I have a zero so what is actually is look like it dropped on the table so so you can see it kind of dropped on the table okay so you can adjust this however you want okay so that is pretty much the end of the game I can hide this one again so I think that is everything so who we have for the game uh should work everything if it doesn't work uh please make a comment on the on the video we can try to help you or you can go to the project itself and just check out the projects if you miss any code so the pro I have to share the project already so the project should be on the video link as well okay all right thanks guys uh see you guys next time bye thank you
