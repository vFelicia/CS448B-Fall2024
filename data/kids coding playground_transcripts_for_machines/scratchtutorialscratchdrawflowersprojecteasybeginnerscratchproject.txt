welcome back guys it's kind of playground here today we're back with another video in scratch and today we're making a draw flowers game so it's um we're drawing some flowers today so let's go when you click on the stage you will draw these vibrant colored flowers that come in all shapes and sizes and yeah it's just uh oh yeah it's just like we made some christmas themed so i think they're christmas themed they kind of look like christmas themed to me we actually made this one christmas themed this one but it's just uh it's just random color so this is what happens all right so um there's gonna be this special on my scratch account so uh i'll be now accepting f4f for the rest of november so if you really want me to follow you and you want to follow me follow me and i'll follow you so i am accepting for f for the rest of this month i'll have to change my scratch profile after this video so anyways um let's um start uh with the code so so i created a new project and i'll be showing you how to draw the um the flowers and i actually am going to take a backdrop so i'm gonna make a uh blue backdrop i don't want it to be fine about this yep there we go get down saturation yeah all right and as you can see i'm gonna make a backdrop so this is gonna be our backdrop and we're gonna show you how to draw the petals for the flowers so let's paint a new sprite and it's time to controlling so i put my stuff in the backpack but if you wanna do something different besides exporting the sprites for my project visit me at gumball098 and if you do not want to do that i want to make your own because you're feeling a little bit creative today then um we're going to make a tutorial for you so we start 10 100 100 so thickness five so and no no fail so let's start drawing draw a circle a circle kind of like an oval shape it's a circle but it's an oval on an ellipse because it's oh wait and very important you always have to keep the bottom of the thing on the um bottom of the sprite on the cross so the cross is something where you put the spray on you you don't you don't have like people don't use it but you have to for this one so you have to reshape it a little bit always put the bottom on the cross so if you feel like skipping this part please do not skip this part uh it's very important put the cross yep put the cross there shrink then we put in the cross there we go and now we're gonna duplicate and we're gonna make some we're gonna make some variants of this uh petal so you can make your own variants we're just going to give you a few examples so the normal line variant which is just lines across the pedal in such a vibrant flower color so that's just one of the most basic designs you can do there's more designs you can do so we have and there's also the polka dot that's also a very easy design to do so for the festivity we're gonna do um a christmas theme so we have that and we have this so it's kind of like a christmas type of theme so it's just gonna be like ctrl c ctrl v and we're gonna add that control v and we're gonna add that so it's basically just some christmas theme uh green and red so yeah that's basically the basic polka dot design so we're gonna do some uh so we do have another sprite which is gonna be our one that we're gonna be using for this project so uh we're gonna have one of the costumes for reference so this is the polka dot so the wavy line one uh the kind of football one that's like see that's like fall themed because well you know football yeah and to make the design just draw a line horizontal lines this would take a really long time so we're not deciding to do this one and the christmas themed one kind of like a christmas tree with red inside so you just draw a line like that bring out the reshape tool and start curving it as so remember guys go to my uh go to my uh scratch account gumball 0982 if you are not willing to do this just go to my scratch account and export my sprite and uh we actually made a little spot for the red spot as you can see the spot is a little bit red that's like uh what's that thing called you call put on a christmas tree garland or something that is the garland part of the tree and you just yeah oh use red and no outline do this make a circle you put it on the reason we don't fill that in is because it's not going to be a perfect line and you make it go back because it's not going to be a perfect line there's a little bit sticking out but we're gonna yep close that in yep so that's basically like the things you put around the christmas tree the yeah so that's basically this one so so now we are going to go straight to the code so let's close that go to sprite 2 which is now sprite 1 and rename the project uh draw flowers so that's gonna be the name of this project the thing we're gonna start out with today is the backdrop and the backdrop is what it broadcasts from and there's something new i figured out oh we have pen too so go to pen yeah so we have pen make sure you have pen on as you can see this over here pen so we're going to do the backdrop so when stage clicked i've actually never used this block in my whole entire life in scratch so this i'm using it today so yeah until now so uh and we're gonna have a race all effects on in the when the stages clicked because you have to start new flowers so we're gonna get uh broadcast draw flowers and wait uh uh we're gonna take uh weight so be sure to take that and then you write draw so and we're done with the backdrop here so we just go to our pedal and we finish up the code so when the green flag is clicked it will erase all it'll take out all the pen effects and it will hide and now we're gonna have the draw so when i receive draw it will set x to negative 165 so it's going to be on the left side and it'll switch costume to costume one now we're going to have a repeat five and as you can see we have five costumes the regular one with nothing inside the wavy line the polka dot the football and the christmas tree so we have that repeat five and we will set y to pick random because we want the flowers to be somewhere else set y to pick random negative 100 to positive 100 so negative 100 positive 100 so it's going to be around this area and it will broadcast a new message called broadcasting wait a new flower call oh i mean a new message called draw flower and now we're gonna change x by 80 so your next costume so now we're gonna have the draw flower almost done so hang in with there hang in with me so when i receive draw flower which is a new broadcast message you'll set a random color because we want a random color but we have a range that we will decide from so set color effects to i'll pick random zero to a hundred so zero to a hundred that's gonna be a range of the color and then it'll set brightness effect uh we also have a brightness effect here i think so to pick random negative 20 to positive 20 so we're going to have some brightness here and now we're going to set the size to a pick random effect so everything's basically random here cited by the computer so it will set size to pick random 80 to a hundred percent so why not keep writing 11 100 and um now we're going to repeat 15 times and we're going to stamp because that's the thing that makes them draw just stamp it and then it will rotate 24 degrees so now we're done with the project and um feel free to pause to uh feel free to pause to um get the code written down and done so yeah let's test it so now let's test it so green flag click on the stage and you see we have the polka dot we have the football we have the christmas tree we have the christmas tree no that's the wavy line we have the regular we have the regular we have the wavy line the polka dot the football so it's just a bunch of um designs of flowers uh so yeah and remember i'm doing for f for the rest of november for a uh kind of thanksgiving christmas special so feel free to follow me and i will follow you back if i do not follow you just um comment on my profile and then i will eventually follow you so please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below of this video on what else games you have in mind for us to make and um see you guys next time you
