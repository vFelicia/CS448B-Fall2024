so welcome back guys to another tutorial on kids coding playground today we'll be working on the part three for the math game so i already have my division button from the backpack so what i did was just drew a rectangle and wrote division so it's pretty simple to do pretty sure you guys can all do that so first i'm gonna start on the code on division so i'm gonna get a one flag clicked i wanna hide let me zoom in a little bit one flight click time and then when i receive start game i wanna hide and then when this sprite is clicked i'm gonna um broadcast start game and i'm gonna broadcast a new message and call it start division start division and next when i receive choose game we are also going to show when you receive to choose game we're going to show and then this part is just for when you put your mouse on it will get bigger and smaller so when flag clicks get a forever loop if touching mouse pointer then set size to 85 85 else we want to set the size back to 100 so okay so that's all the code for the division button let's move on to the cat so for the cap we're going to be making a new custom block so let's go to my blocks so we can create our new custom block and we can just simply call it division division and click ok division i'm going to move it onto this side so i'm going to start coding from this side okay zoom in a little bit so i'm gonna get a forever loop uh i'm gonna set the guess to zero set the guess to zero and then i'm gonna set the random number one to pick random 100 so i'm going to do a pic random 100 but for the second one i'm only going to pick random 1 to 10 so it's not too hard random number 2 to 1 to 10. so it could be 2 digit divided by one digit or three digit divided by two digit so it's not too hard um so we're gonna get a repeat loop repeat until repeat until um we're gonna repeat until we're gonna get an equal sign and a mod so what mod is is basically the remainder of two numbers so let's say i have a 10 and i have a five so if you click on it the mod is zero because 10 and five do not have a remainder but let's say if you do 10 and 3 the mod would be 1 because 10 divided by 3 is 3 remainder 1 so the remainder is 1. so mod is simply put the two values the and the remainder of the two values so that's what mod is so we're gonna get the mod so this is just to pick it so it'll be a um so the two numbers getting divided would be even so it would not have remainder so we're going to make the numbers not have remainders so we're going to find the mod of random number one and random number two and if it's equal to zero because zero means um that there will be no remainder then we want to reset set the random number one to one pick random one to 100 like that and then we're going to set answer to problem uh to random number one divided by random number two so right here gonna put random number one divided by random number two like that and then we're gonna get a repeat until so we're going to repeat until repeat until um guess is equal to answer to problem guess is equal to answer problem um and then next we want to ask ask uh join we need two joins um since there's no division sign on the keyboard i'm gonna be using the slash symbol which also means division so we're gonna join the random number one and then i'm gonna put slash random number two like that and then i'm gonna set the guess to the answer set yes to the answer and then after that i'm going to get an if else so let's put the if else in here drag the if else right here and if answer gonna get uh equal so if the answer is equal to random number one divided by random number two um random number one divide that by random number two then we're gonna play i'm just gonna duplicate this play sound guitar strum say that is correct and change the score by one and then when you get it incorrect i'm going to duplicate the same thing play the string pluck and say that is the wrong answer so that's it for the division block so now we're gonna have to call it so let's go back right here um so i'm just gonna get a broadcast when i receive start division i'm gonna call the custom block division and one last thing we have to do the random so i'm actually gonna i have to put i still have to put the random in my um backpack so i'm gonna do that real quick okay so now i have the random block so what this does is if you can't pick either of the modes then you can just click random and it'll pick a random mode for you so let's get a one flat clicked we won't hide this in the beginning hide and then when i receive start game when i receive start game we're gonna hide and then when i receive choose game we want to show and then um we're gonna get the same thing from here drag and drop this into here this is all the same like that and then for the random part we're gonna do the random part now so this function right here will pick a random uh mode for you so when this right click we want to broadcast start game and then we want to set um the variable random game we made from the beginning of the uh videos from the first video we made the variable random game so now we're gonna have to use it so we're gonna make it pick random one to four because there's four operators addition subtraction multiplication and division and then we're going to get an if then statement if random game is equal to one if random game is equal to one then we want to broadcast start edition um so i'm gonna duplicate this everything else is pretty much the same so if random game is equal to two then we're gonna have to do subtraction and let's duplicate all of this put it under here and when random game is equal to three then we want to start multiplication and then when random number game is equal to four then we can start division okay so i think that's it so let's play the game i'm gonna save it and then for the cat i'm just gonna um put this right here so i don't have to keep on listening to this so let's make it bigger let's play let's play a math game so let's click random as you can see it picked a random one for me and when you get it right i'll say it's correct if you get it wrong you'll say it's wrong so i'm gonna quit um and i'm gonna do division this time to show you guys what division is so 44 as you can see it's a whole not it's a a number that has no remainders um so 44 divided by 4 is 11. see there's no remainders uh we use the mod making it have no remainder so that's that's the good part of this so as you can see there's still no remainder so that's working so it's pretty cool so that's it for this video i hope you enjoyed learning the series make sure to like share and subscribe i'll see you guys next video
