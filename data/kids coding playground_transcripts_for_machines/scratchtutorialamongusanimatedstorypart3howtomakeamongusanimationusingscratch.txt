hello guys and welcome back to kidscoolingplayground so this will be the third among us part three the animated story so the part 2 we did the the first stage where you know the saiyan can take out the red among us sprite and then we go on to the next stage then there's a pink among us sprite there so what we continue to do is we did the door for our last video um so we'll continue working on stage three and then all the other weapons that you can use to take out this crew so let me just run through it one more time so just refresh everyone so you say start so okay let's do that again no this one is not correct you see how this is showing up you need to fix that so in here make sure that you code it for the first first one just in case you know something like this happen because a different episode right go to one so what you can do is do this okay let's start again so we have this one second for now we can change it back to like four seconds so the user can read but uh for right now we just keep it at one let's run it again so you have this right and then it comes to here then we call it the club we can kind of hit them and then swirl effect we're going to push the up they open the door it hides the sprite and it goes to the stage two and you have the paint among us okay so that's what we left off last time so let's begin again so we'll continue here so uh what we want to do next is that we can work on the other one like the laser gun the infinity garnet and lightsaber and so on okay so we're going to do the laser gun so the laser comes a little bit different it's actually not a weapon over here when i did it at that time i actually did it with the uh a costume so we'll just do it like that so you can do it other way but so what you do is you we're gonna put this little laser gun i found online just kind of cut it up and then we just kind of move it and copy it and then move it over here so if you want to add different sprite you can just upload this sprite into here say upload and then you find your spray upload and then after that just kind of copy the image and put it in here if you guys want me to show you let me see if i can so we're going to show you here um so let's say you kind of pick a sprite when you download online sometimes they're not the icon is not clean even though it says png sometimes it's not like for example this is the old laser gun we had right so as you can see you have white it has some white background here so you have to use like the scratch 2.0 to clean it up if you don't know how to do that take a look at one of our uh how to uh series and then we actually show that and you can download scratch 2.0 and use the magic wand and do that so after you clean it up you can import it here after you import it here you can do convert to vector and you can kind of select this and then you can put it into your sprite here and then you can resize it however you want right since you see how this one has a has a back white background which is no good so this one i did is i clean up the background so after that you can just kind of move in and rotate and then just give that give it to your sprite so anyway if you need to know how to do that look at the uh what about to do uh how to video on how to clean up a background for a sprite okay not go into that for now so what happens is you just pick any weapon you created online or you can create you can draw your own and then just put it for this uh sprite okay okay so what we're going to do is we're going to create a code down here okay say when so number two is press so we did number one on the club so number two is press and same thing that what we did in club right it it's not not in progress basically the they're not saying anything then we want to do that right so same kind of logic we need okay let's go back to our sprite here let's zoom in a little bit we're calling for number two uh attack which is the laser gun okay so you drag the if and l statement here if and then i mean we don't need the else and then you the nut operator and then you drag the equal operator go to variable um select this dialog in progress say but yes basically saying is dialogue progress is no or you can actually do it like this if you don't want to do it or not then you can say no whatever it will be the same thing so this is the same as not yes okay since i did it not yes i can let's just continue using that uh what you can do is you can switch to custom number two so we're gonna delete that icon actually here this thing's messed up so we're gonna switch to custom number two which is the the sprite holding the laser gun okay put that over here and what we do is we're gonna do a wait for one second kind of show up a little bit and we're gonna broadcast a new message called fire laser okay so this will fire the laser and wait until the other uh message is finished right and we'll do a little bit away again then we want to switch it back to custom number one which is the standard costume okay so we're gonna use this fire the laser switch it back to this one okay okay so what we want to do is we're gonna have to code this uh the sonic power that suit from the laser and then like you know kind of fly to the the other sprites right to attack him so we need to do something here so what we want to do is we're going to create when green black is clicked we want to hide the sprite in the beginning now i'm gonna draw a forever loop here and what we're going to do is we're going to change the ghost effect just kind of make it blank blinking so goes effect by 25 and we're gonna wait for 0.1 second do that again duplicate the block okay and then duplicate one more time kind of like a blinking kind of thing okay so when when we run this so let's say i run this just if you want to test something right you can always just you don't actually have to run through everything what you can do is just click on the code block here on top so right now it's actually running you see it's yellow but it's high right so if you say show let's see where is it i don't know where that is actually maybe somewhere here actually let me stop this again okay here it is so so let's try this again so you'll see it it goes away so you see that it kind of flashes and goes away but what we want to do is we're going to have to make it show right and then this thing should should also you know uh show up so we want to show up in high right i think i did it wrong here so what i want to do is i'm going to kind of go dimmer and then i have to go back out actually so i'm going to have to do negative 25 and then 25. okay let's try it again so my mistake i did a copy and i forgot to change the effect so oops so i don't actually have to do that just click on the green flag let me see this oh it is so you can see it's blinking you see this it's blinking that's what we want right so we're hiding making it dimmer and then making it uh making a brighter dimmer and brighter a bit demonstrating so that's why it's kind of having this blinking effect okay all right okay so we have the fire laser right so what we want to do is from here with this fire laser right so what we want to do is go back over here so when i receive fire laser i want to create a clone of myself so basically going to create one of this sounding tower okay and then you have to say when i start as a clone what you want to do so this will actually call this so what we want to do is we're going to set up another well another variable i think called got hit so got hit you have to create that for the sonic power only okay just for the clone so that you can so we don't want to so we want to keep track of if the actually the sonic power should hit him let's say i can shoot the other way and it will not hit him so we want to check that make sure that actually hit him before we change the you know the effect for this uh uh for this uh uh among the spray so that's why we need to create another variable called gap hit so we don't know how to do this you can click on make variable and say got hit put got hit here and then you can select for this sprite only okay so that will create the variable basically this is a private variable for sonic power okay okay so what we want to do is we want to set got hit to note so first meaning like when you start the clone that means it did not hit the uh hit the uh the other sprite this right right so and then we want to make this go to so that means when they fire the gun this clone should go to the cyan and we want to point in the direction of the science of the just like the club right so the science pointing to the to the right right now the signs pointing to the right so this thing will actually go in here okay so the cyan is pointing to the left then the sky will point it the other way okay so that's what we want to do so what we want to do is point in direction here and then go to sensing and you have to pick out from here put it here so always select the back one first before you select the front so you select cyan first and then you select direction okay and then we will do a move 50 steps what happened is we want the the sonic power come out from like right here we don't want it to come out from his stomach right we're gonna push 50 steps so that it's somewhere like this okay that's why we have that 50 set and then we'll say show so that way now after we do all this coordinate thing then we'll show that way you can always see it kind of flying like this i mean let me change the costume for this guy so you can see a little bit better so maybe something like this okay so you can adjust it so if you think uh 50 is not enough you can put 100 or 75 whatever kind of justice so that it looks like this okay so i think i have 50 let's just try i think 50 is fine okay now next we will want to say repeat until okay so here we want to make sure that you know we want to destroy the clone if you're doing clone you have to make sure you delete the clone so we want to make sure that you know when you touch the edge or touch this guy the clone should disappear if not you keep on having too many calls on the game it's not good it can potentially mess up your game okay and it looks better when you when the bullet hit the hit this guy the laser hit this guy the laser disappear okay so what we want to do is we're gonna have to use the or join because we wanna check if it actually hit him or the edge right so we'll use the whole joint so all meaning either condition happen it will work so we'll say select the among the sprite which is the red one here and then duplicate this and then we'll say touching edge meaning you know it missed the uh mr spry and it hit it on the edge okay so after that you're gonna say set so we want to set this gap head to yes now since we it was every time the clone created is known but if it either touching the edge or touching this then we say got it yes i mean oh sorry i got it wrong so um we're gonna do that a little bit later only if you actually hit the among us sprite then we'll go through cut it yes my bad so what we want to do one make it move right so you have to say move 10 step as you can see it's just a 10 step you don't need like negative a positive since you're already pointing to the direction so if you're pointing to the this side if you say 10 step and just go on this side you point this side 10 step it will go on the right side okay all right okay we need another condition here so if oops i'm making a lot of mistake today for some reason okay so we want to duplicate this so if it actually touch the among us you know then we say god hit is yes okay that means it hit the among us sprite okay and then what we want to do is so i've either it touch the edge or this it will finish the the code here will go out of this loop then we will do another check here okay so we say if the got hit it'll use another operator here to check and select the variable got hit if it is go to yes meaning like it got hit right here you go yes then we're gonna broadcast a message what has a message okay this time we're gonna say god hit by laser okay so this is for the the among us uh sprite to change the effect okay and after that we want to set this back just resetting it just in case you know you might not need to but uh just for good of it we'll just reset it back to no and then we can delete this clone delete this clone so basically make this disappear okay all right so let's zoom back out so let's see so this is everything that we had to find the laser we'll call this code and run this okay so that's what we have so far let's go back to the red uh the red um uh sprite here so what we need to do is we are going to have to code this right so because we haven't called the red sprite to change things right when we got hit right so where to do that so we will try to put it over here let me move this on the top so these are all the control moves are like from one place or another we'll put on top and then we are going to do the you know the effect on the bottom you know so this is the first one is the club so second one you can say got hit by laser uh what we want to do is we want to insert a swirl we'll do the fisheye effect by 25 play the sound and broadcast mission complete so so you remember the mission completely coded earlier on the portal so basically it will open up the portal or allow you to go into the door so for this one if it's not backdrop one seven or eight it will show the door and it will show it will show the portal inside inside so the portal okay so it's not one of these those have the portal so after your broadcast mission uh uh complete okay and then after that you can go back over here so you can see right here so if you push the up key and you're touching the portal or high broadcast next stage it will open it will not allow the open door again which will actually change the uh the background of the sprite here on the portal uh so right here not in the portal i mean on the background so you have like next stage you'll go on to the next background so let's just try it out let's see how it works not sure it's gonna work let's see should let's try it out so we're gonna start so you can see we have the club and let's just use a laser right now number two so you see it didn't work right so something is wrong so let's see what's wrong so we made some mistakes so we did a copy from here right so that's why so when when you're doing coding you always want to check if it doesn't work see how you're going to figure out how you do it so as you can see when we shoot it's touching among us so this is correct and you can open up like the variable right so let's say if you try to debug your code or some problem you see got hit is no no so let's just try it again so let's say we say yes so this is no so let's say hit two so i think you cannot really see it because of the clone okay so we were not able to get it working so let's just check through our code make sure everything is correct so here we have got hit this no and we see that touching either this or this and then we get yes so if this is yes then we're gonna broadcast this message so i think we might have some error on the uh here and the among us so here actually we actually did it wrong here we actually don't need that that way until so uh actually when we actually we know that it got hit because this is the sprite here that checks it if it's already touching the uh among us sprite uh we know that it got hit so and then we broadcast this message so when we look at this message we know that this guy got hit already so we actually don't need to have this way until uh touching club or touching the sonic power so i think i made a mistake because i did a copy from here so it's always i mean all the time you know you you will make mistake from coding you know not always one time it will always work so when i do coding i have never done it like one time i will always work so try to like learn how to debug and find out what the problem is so you just kind of check you know what what what would it be wrong you know things look correct here then you see like okay it's broadcasting this so what is it doing i think before i had like touching club or whatever and then i it was incorrect or touching sonic power whatever that is still incorrect so we shouldn't actually need any of that so when we receive this you should just change the fisheye so now let's try it again okay so let's try again uh we have the gun so let's say i shoot on this side right so it should come out on this side you see that come out on this side looks okay not a problem so if i shoot on this side so you can see it got hit it becomes yellow you see it got yellow and then it changed so after that it broadcasts the complete ignition and you can open the door push the up key then you see the the other sprite here which is the uh the uh the pink one but you see we don't see cyan yet so that is incorrect so we need to reset cyan to a position maybe right here okay so what you want to do is kind of open up cyan see where your cyan is okay click on them you see let's say let's say we move them right here so what you want to do is let's go back to cyan so we have the code for the backdrop right so backdrop one so we can duplicate this so sometime when you duplicate code make sure you change it correctly so that happened to me right so so this is backdrop two so we want the sign let's say go to somewhere here then you can make sure you delete this go to get the new go to from here put it here okay and then you can say show or you can have switch to custom one too just in case you know you're switching from another one to here it doesn't hurt or you can i think uh even show is fine because we always reset it after the gun or the club white we always reset it but anyway let's just do that so that you know whenever the screen change from one screen to the next it has the custom show as one okay let's run it again okay we're gonna use the club this time make sure that's the box so that works fine so you open the door you can see that yellow is bright lighting up meaning it's working running the code so let's say use this so you can see fisheye and then the total open up you see that so now we're done with the second stage right so we push up again if we put up this will activate here we'll touch bottom or higher stage so let's go back over here we'll push up so you see this cool run now you see this photo is coming up right that's incorrect so this is stage three the portal should not come only come when after we broadcast the message saying the mission is complete so this is incorrect we need to fix that so what we want to do is go to the portal we add a small piece of code that will kind of take care of some of this problem uh what we can do also we can set the uh like the location of the portal where you want to go so um what we can do is since this is the second one let's say let's just put it here so we haven't done that so first stage we don't have a portal right second stage where portal let's say we want to put at this location then you can say okay go to this location right but don't show until the actually the stuff is done and also what we want to do is every time you receive something called next next stage we want to hide it so when you move from one stage to the next we want to hide it and only show when actually you know when you completed the mission so now let's test it again so here we use the club that works fine we're able to go into the door so so now switch to backdrop too it actually has the border over here you cannot see it because it's not shown so if i take out this stuff here this uh this among us right here you see the portal comes up once i go in this code should run you see it run really fast and hide it so you don't actually see it okay all right so we'll go on and do the next part of the next weapon okay so let's stop this let's go to the hand which is the infinite corner so what we want to do is we're gonna say green flag is clicked okay so what we want to say is high and then we will want to throw in a forever loop here and similar to the other one we want to make sure that it goes to the cyan okay go to cyan and we also want to point in the direction that the cyan is pointing right so similar to that one go to sensing grab this guy here and you select the back one first cyan and then we want to say direction okay so the glove will point to the left or the right depending where the cyan guy is standing okay so what we want to do is we want to have another if condition here is a little bit different so what we want the glove to be let's say let me open cyan here and open the glove here so we want to make the the hand kind of like like this in front of uh you know this guy a little bit in the front on the top you know top top right or top left depending what is that right so that you know it it looks a little bit better so what we want to do is we have if an else condition so we need to do the sensing again here and select cyan and we're going to check the direction okay direction so now where you can use the operator we're going to use the greater than so greater than zero so when it's greater than zero meaning it's actually pointing to the right so the direction is like less than zero you see this is let's say we go here this is pointing to the right right any any number is positive it's pointing to the right right you see any number that's negative it's actually pointing to the left you can see right so you can see the hand kind of switch let me put the hand over here maybe i don't know it may be easier to see so you see positive pointing to the right negative pointing to the left so we're trying to see where it's actually pointing and then we're going to make the hand going up accordingly okay okay and you want to set it at this uh this one here so that doesn't rotate all around okay so we're gonna put it back at 90. so if it's the direction is greater than zero meaning pointing to the right side okay okay what you want to do is say motion set x and we want to use the operator use a plus so what we want to do is we're going to find out where cyan is standing in the x position so select cyan x position put this in here and then you say plus i mean you have to test it for me i already tested so i know so i say plus 45 and do something similar here and this one is where to do a minus plus i always say use this the x position let's say if cyan is you know is uh standing on the right i mean facing to the right we want the glove to you know show up like right here so if he's actually facing if science facing to the left let's say facing to the left this side then we want the glove to be on this side okay got it so hopefully you understand that okay so that's why i have to check here so i know where it's gonna show okay now we are going to minimize this a little bit put this over here on the side so we have the code for number three so similar to what we did for number two and one right um why am i not able to find my code okay here's the callback so when i say three so this is the number third plot power the infinite garnet so we're gonna try to call that and also same thing right we have to make sure that is not in progress you know the uh no one is talking so make sure that we want to do that so that you know we don't want the sprite to kill off the other guy before you have a chance to talk okay so this one you say equal and over here so dialogue with dialogue variable okay and you put down yes so not yes then we want to make sure that we can go to the front layer so that it will show up in front of everything else okay and then we want to show because we have high in the beginning right so we're gonna show and then broadcast our message so what we're going to broadcast is snap like a finger snap so that that nose will do a finger snap right to make everything disappear so that works well because uh scratch will have something like ghost effect we can make things disappear okay we can put this one and then we are going to hide it okay so now we have done the gauntlet code but we still go back to the anonymous right to fix it okay so now we have got hit by laser right the club now we're gonna do the among us uh just pull this event here and change it to snap okay and what we want to do is we're going to repeat 10 times and then i'm going to try to use this ghost effect west coast effect okay so change ghost effect by 10 and then we want to do a little weight so 0.1 second so a little bit of weight to 10 times and then we're gonna play the sound until done and we want to broadcast the message same thing okay so now let's let's try it out so see how it works so now number three for thanos who actually doesn't care actually way snappy looking on the left side snapping it the right side doesn't matter so let's say i'm facing to the left side if i use number three the gun will be somewhere here so as you can see you can't make the other guy disappear right and then what has the complete message you can go in same thing i mean if you think you've gone that's a little bit too close you can adjust it let's see do it again so it's right here and if you want to move them a little bit further then what you do is you go to the garment and change this position like 4550 so now we're done with gauntlet now stage three same thing right we don't have anything yet but we do have uh created the power for the laser and the infinity gauntlet right so in stage three we can go back over here so what we need to do we have like stage one stage two right so we need to do something for stage three to show it right okay so you can just copy this duplicate let me move this down a little bit i'll adjust it later so i get more space so now we have one two and then we'll do number three so number three you can kind of put whatever you want i have some coordinate already down but what you can do is just kind of open the this guy and just try and drag him around where you want to put them right and then you can just grab the motion and just put it okay so let's say we want to put him right here or whatever doesn't matter right then you know you can you know uh just drag this position like this or whatever right so i think we all had a hundred so we can't keep it a hundred so let's say we want negative 105 get a good number and then negative 100 right and then what we want to do is uh we're gonna face it to the let's say he's gonna face the other way he didn't know that something's happening to him okay let's say he's gonna face the other way so if i hit this back drop three you can see he's actually facing this way right and then make sure you clear the graphic effects of that you know whatever ability you did to him it will clears it up and also cyan number three you also need to do that as well i think we'll probably move this guy let's see how i want to do this i'm going to move this over here so i'm going to put this here because this will not change right so we have this this will not change mostly so we're gonna stack this up here so we have one over here and two over here so this is where two and three can open let's say you wanna cyan face this way or this way it doesn't matter right so either way is fine so what you want to do is a backdrop three you're going to say duplicate right so say back drop number three go to the front layer you know let's say you want to implement this position you can right so or you can put it in some other position down there so let's say you want to put them at this position and then switch to custom one and show all you let's say you want to turn around doesn't matter then you have to say the the direction so if you want him to turn around this is one into the right if you want to turn around then you need to do negative so you double click on this you can see that is turning around okay so either way so let's say i didn't have this whatever he is coming in doesn't matter so let's try it again okay so we have this guy here so we're gonna use the club we are able to go in then we see this one let's say we use number three this guy disappeared the portal open up we go in number three stage number three let's say we use the let's say we use the gun we shoot this side see it doesn't help rather than do it so that's why we have that check uh that got hit right so we have to have that check so it touched the edge doesn't matter i only even touch this sprite so you might go back so when i say touch the sprite then effect then this the photo will show up again we'll go in so as you can see we go in this is stage four where we've got a little computer in the box here so we don't have anything yet for stage four and also we hided the power ability breaker so the empire so when we say we'll get the backdrop number four and hide it so you get more room to see things right i think for the first three stage we want to show you know what the ability the among us character can do after that we don't have it so this is where we're going to start for now i think that's a pretty long video already so we got the gauntlets and then the hand and other stuff done and then moving to stage four so we'll walk on this next time for the stage stage four and other power ups so whatever powerups we have here so we're done with these three first three we're gonna work on these one next okay all right all right thank you guys uh please like share and subscribe to our channel and comment in the comments below what uh about uh if you have any questions about the video or just love letting us know that you know we'll do a good job or something that would be greatly appreciated all right see you guys next time bye
