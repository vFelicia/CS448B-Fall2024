hey guys and welcome back to kids coding playground today we'll be making a scrolling maze in scratch so before we begin this demonstration of the game i would like to give some of the credits to uh rayleigh1123 for um designing the scrolling physics of this game we added some extra levels and stuff like that but his um account will be linked into the scrap in the description up below this video and he has also made a few videos for this channel so be sure to check his videos out all right so i'm going to start so i'm going to play it as you can see when you go right the maze scrolls to the right yeah it's like a little scrolling maze the player can look like it's moving so as you guys know in scrolling um things the player doesn't move it's the maze itself that actually moves so the player is actually staying in one place the maze is just moving simulating that the player is moving so i have two levels right now so let's beat this one and then we go to the second one so in the second level let's get to the exit she has just a pretty simple um scrolling maze and when you get to the end you win all right so first let's create a new project all right so in our new project let's rename our project to scroll maze oops scrolling maze okay we can keep the scratch cap let's just rename it to player we'll keep this trash can and um right here i'm going to import my own maze right here oops all right so this is the maze so you guys can make your own maze i think in another video i think it's the um mouse and the cheese video we also gave this maze away so you can check that video um it's the mouse maze runner game so you can check that out we have it in there or you can draw your own we'll also be putting this link through google drive to the this video description as well so if you'd like to take this maze you may you can also make your own all right so first in the maze i'll show you the costume so basically inside it's just um we have two costumes one is for this one so last time i accidentally resized this way too big so i guess we'll just keep it like this um we just have to set the x and y position to a little bit different place so as you can see these two are different sizes so our maze is basically just a bunch of us blocks all right let's go to the code for the maze so in the maze for the last game i did i put i'm going to zoom in so we're going to get it when you fly clicked and then i went to zero negative 194 this was the position i had last time all right and as you can see in our maze we have some costume called costume one which is a blank costume and we will need this so basically in scratch if you switch it to the first costume increase the size um and switch back to the first maze the maze one it will actually change the size of it so you can set this to like 600 and it'll actually set the size to 600 without switching the costume it will it'll cap the limit at 150 actually so as you can see it did gets set to 600 size so putting that costume can actually help it will um somehow allow you to um actually switch it to the size amount you want so i'm going to set it back to 150 because that's the one i had last time 150 is the perfect size i guess all right and then after this we're going to go get a rubber loop so forever okay if if that's even so if you're into the or so if the up arrow key or w key is pressed so we're going to do we're going to let the player use both the wasd or the arrow keys so w alright then we are going to change the y by negative seven so you may be asking why don't we change it by positive seven because we're going up well the background this means is scrolling right so we want to simulate the players going up so we have to make it go down so we're going to change the y by negative seven instead of positive negative seven and then we're going to get an if that seam and put that inside here so if it's touching the player so if the maze is touching the player we're not gonna let it go through the walls so we're gonna make it change the y by seven to not allow it to get past right and after that we're going to just duplicate this and put that under here so next we're going to do the down arrow so down arrows pressed um or the key s press s then we are going to change the y by seven so remember we have to simulate how it's scrolling so moving up for the maze is basically moving down for the cap and then we're going to change the y by negative seven if it tries to hit the wall alright so now we've finished the up and down movement let's duplicate all of this we're going to make the left and right movement now so when the left arrow key is pressed left arrow key or a key is pressed then we're going to we're going to change the x's time so instead um for the left arrow key we are going to change the x by 7 to simulate as if it's going to the left uh left so we're going to change the x by seven um change x by seven and put this back in and we're gonna take this out and we're gonna do change x by negative seven if it's touching the player so then it won't let it pass and same right here we're going to do if key right arrow or key b is pressed cd is pressed then we're going to take this out and then we're going to change the x by negative seven to make it as if the player is going to the right and then we're going to put this back in and then we're going to change the x by seven so we will not pass the ball so as you can see this is what we have so far it's the maze movement so yeah that's pretty much it so i'm gonna put the player right here so as you can see you can see the maze kind of move the player can't get past yeah as you can see we'll probably have to make the player a little bit smaller so it'll actually work so as you can see the scrolling is working now all right okay so inside the player we're gonna go into the player we have to add some code in here so in the beginning when green flag clicked inside the player let's see manila and green flag is clicked then we're gonna switch the costume to costume one i'm gonna make the player like have a little walk animation so we're gonna switch costume one and i wanna set the size of the player to 40 in the beginning and then the position i had him at last time was negative 63 and the y position is 41. right and we're going to set the rotation style to left and right so it won't flip upside down when you're moving around and then we're just going to make the little uh walk cycle for the player so forever loop if left arrow or a is being pressed so we're gonna if key left arrow or key um a is pressed then we're gonna point direction of negative 90 um i mean positive nine because it's right arrow i'm sorry this should be left arrow sorry so we're gonna do negative 90. so if key left arrow or a is pressed which is going to the left we're going to point direction to negative 90 which is going to the left and then we're going to do next costume and then we're going to wait at 0.1 seconds okay or else it'll look way too quick and then we're going to duplicate this in time so when the key right arrow is pressed or key d oops d and we're going to put in the direction of 90 instead of negative 90. okay and then duplicate this we're going to do the up and down walk cycle so instead for the up and down we're just going to take this point direction out so i'm not going to make the when you're going up or down i'll point in any direction so we're going to go up arrow and w and we're just going to do the next costume and then we're going to do down arrow or s so i'm not going to make it point in any direction when you're going up and down so let's take that out all right so let's play it all right so i'll show you the code real quick so let's just move in walk costumes awesome okay as you can see the maze is scrolling around and the player is um has has a little walk cycle a little walking animation as you can see you can still do this as you can't we haven't coded to go to the next level yet so yeah so now the player can actually walk around and the maze actually kind of scrolls all right let's go back to the maze for a second all right so we're going to make a timer we're going to make a timer timer so we're going to show the timer and then when green fly clicks you're going to set the timer to zero we're just going to make a little timer running in the background we're also going to add a high score stuff like that and then we're going to get a forever loop we're going to get a control um control forever we're going to set the timer variable to the timer right here so we can actually control it using the variable all right and next we're going to allow the player advance to the next level so when greenfly clicked so right here um so remember as i said when you go down with the player the maze is moving up because it simulates the player going down so let's go to the end real quick so as you can see in the maze sprite right here the coordinates are moving repeatedly so let's say the y position is greater than 370. so when the y position is greater than 370 like about right here then we are going to switch the costume to costume 2 which is the second maze so once the y position for the maze passes like right here then we're going to switch um the backdrop i mean the costume to the next maze so we're going to have forever loop if the y position is greater than y position is greater than 370. 370 then we're going to switch the costume to maze 2 just the second maze and then we're going to make the player i mean we're going to make the maze go back to its original position as i have right here all right so now we can play it let's get to the end it should work all right see as you can see as soon as we got past the y position is greater than 370 we automatically went to the next level so after this level i'm going to allow the player to win so we're going to get an if then seaman again so if let's play it i want to see um how what the exposition has to be greater than in order for the player to um win so right here i'm going to keep on going so the exit's right here so let's say the x position is uh less than um if it's less than a certain amount we will let it um pass so let's say um uh maybe like right here negative 448 okay so if the x position is less than so as you can see the maze is moving to the left because it's scrolling so we're going to do if the x position is less than negative 448 negative 448 now we're going to broadcast a message and called win and we're going to stop this for now and then we're going to make a message let's name it win all right so now we're going to make a new sprite and we're going to paint it excuse the text i'm going to make it green swine on i'm going to write you you win i want to capitalize that you win let's make it big all right center the sprites all right now we have the u in text we're going to code in it so let's rename this right real quick to win and then we're going to go to the code so inside the code for the you win spread we're going to one greenfield click go to zero zero which is the origin of the um screen and then we're going to go to the front layer and we're going to hide okay and then when i receive the message when on the windsprite we're going to show and right now we're going to make a new variable we're going to this is high score we're going to make it a cloud variable so it will store on the server we're going to name it high score high score all right let's put the high score on like this side um and so inside here we are going to get an if that statement so under receive win show if the timer is less than the high score so basically the lower the time is the better the score is because this is like a speed run game kind of so the timer is less than high score that we're going to set the variable high score to the timer and we're going to stop all after this all right so now let's test out our game oh yeah and i forgot let's reset our high score real quick set high score back to zero actually let's set it to like 50 or something so then we can easily break this high score all right let's go full screen all right as you can see we are able to move around let's see exit we go on to the second level also if you want to add ops uh like coins or something don't put them into the maze spread because it will not work it'll just keep on bouncing out because we already have coded that if the cat is touching it it won't go through and as you can see once it's greater less than some position you'll see you win and it'll set the high score to the fastest time so let's say i do this even quicker than what i did before then it should set this new high score um in place of the other one as you can see the high score has changed so yeah that's pretty much for today's tutorial um scrolling maze so thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share and
