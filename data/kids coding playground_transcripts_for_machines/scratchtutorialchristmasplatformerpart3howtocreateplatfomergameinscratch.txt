so welcome back guys it's catch coding playground here today we'll be doing another video on the christmas platformer so from last video we're just going to go over the code from last video so let's do that really quick so this is the checking the player position like the green flag this is like positioning the green flag stuff like that if it's touching the green flag then it'll move on to the next level platform detection if it's hitting the ground starting a new level resetting the player re starting the game this is when you start the game um we have jumping and this is starting all the controls like moving and jumping and then we have jumping oh this is jumping sorry about that this is jumping and this is if it's hitting the ground and then this is jumping movement control and then this is the move player speed x okay and after that we have the animated character some simple code we didn't change anything from the last video green flag nothing here so no we'll work on that later round we have this code right here and the spikes will be uh completing it we'll be adding some other stuff too and trampoline we have not done yet so yeah so without further ado let's get into the coding so let's go over here let's get this block we coded from last video so the check player position so we're going to get an if then statement just put that on top so if it's touching the color so like this is like if it's touching the color red or it's falling off the edge so we're going to do this so if we need an ore okay so if touching the color red so we're going to use this little eyedropper and select this red color or the y position is less than one negative 170. so like we have like one level where like you can fall off so we're going to make that little fall off thing that's why we need this so if it's less than 170 negative 170 so if the y position let's go here y position is less than negative 170. we're going to broadcast another message we're going to name it die so the player is dead if any of those conditions are true then we're going to get another if then statement so if if the g player uh dead is equal to yes so if the player is dead equal to yes so we're going to get g player dead detection of the player's death is equal to yes then we're going to wait a 0.1 second and then we're going to reset the player so 0.1 seconds reset the player and then we're going to broadcast start game start game right there okay so now we're done with this um we need a for this to receive die so i forgot to zoom in a little bit so now i zoomed in so you have a better look at it now so now we're going to do something else we're going to receive so when i receive dye when i receive dye we're gonna set the g is player dead to yes so she is player dead yes okay so now i think we can move on to the spikes let's go to the spikes so for the spikes we can add some more spikes for each level actually no let's work on the green flag first before we do the spikes but now as you can see when you touch the spikes you go back to the beginning as you can see so yeah now the spikes can actually kill you so yeah let's go into the green flag and work on the green plugins now okay so for a green flag we're gonna make some of the similar code as the spikes so we're just gonna drag and drop the place clone at xy just drag and drop that to the green flag and then in the green flag we can also drag and drop this when i start as a clone into here we can also drag and drop this as well and this of course we're gonna have to change some of the code up okay so as you can see now we have this we can take this out because we're gonna work we have to do different x and y positions so let's start coding in this block this is the block in particular we're gonna code for now so we're giving you a forever loop so i did this in the costumes where i made two green flags so what i did is i used the converted to bitmap cut it like that and after cutting it i flipped it horizon vertical and then i made two um uh costumes so then it looks like it's uh waving the flag is waving around so that's what i did so we're gonna do forever next costume and then we're gonna wait 0.2 seconds so if you do not have this you can either download one from online or you can just get it from our google drive in the description uh below or you can make your own if you'd like so this is the moving the flag waving or whatever and then in the beginning we actually want to hide this thing so when green flag clicked we want to hide okay i forgot to zoom in again but now you have clear look at this we're gonna put this right here i'm gonna hide okay and now we're gonna position this somewhere else so let's go to the setup code right here so we're gonna get an if then statement if level is equal to one so if the variable level is equal to one then i'm going to place a clone like right here you can drag and drag the flag wherever you want it to be maybe right here so i'm going to get these positions so place clone at um 208 and negative 107. so those are the two um positions i have so yeah you can do any place you would like but i just like dragged it somewhere on the right side okay so now for the player now you can see it and i forgot to do one thing so before we um end the uh before we try it out i actually tried it out and there's above right here so you can put the hide and set the x to negative 99999 so you want to move the original green flag off of the screen so x to negative something like that okay so there you go let's try it out as you can see the flag looks pretty good when you hit spikes you die obviously and when you touch the flag you advance in the next level of course the um spikes are not done yet because on the next level we have like some of this but the spikes are still there because we didn't change the position so we're going to do that and um for the next level what i did was just like some of this just a tree i got a tree from the sprite library and i put a platform and and we put some of these things in the description so like you can download them if you'd like so let's go back to the spikes let's go to the code and then for the spikes we also have to do the same thing we have to hide and set the x to negative 99999 okay something like that okay and then for level two we're gonna probably place the spikes maybe right here um this is just a random thing i just did um i didn't actually do this in the actual thing i don't think i'm just going to do it because why not so let's just do that so we're going gonna duplicate this put that so this is gonna be level two we're working on level two now so when level is equal to two we're gonna place a clone at wherever this place is 138 and then 44. as you can see right here oops add an extra four okay so this is the spikes and then we can also add the green flag at the end so we're gonna show the green flag so i'm going to give you one last look at this just did that and let's go to the green flag and then we showed it so that we can move it uh probably put it like right here okay so i'm gonna put it right there you guys can put it wherever you want whatever levels you want so i'm just going to move this duplicate this code put that right under put that right there so if the level is equal to 2 we're going to go to 212 53 okay so now let's try it out so save it play it so as you can see let's go to the next level as you can see the spikes are there and then the next loop so we we just have to keep on adding green flags on each level so as you can see the spikes are not there anymore because it's not the same level we didn't code it so yeah that's what we have for now and um let's work on the snowflakes like the snow thing so now let's work on that okay so for the snow we're going to make another variable we're going to name it g with global wind so what this does is like so like we can like change the direction of the snow so we're going to get a one green flag clicked zoom in a little forever loop set the uh g wind to pick random negative one to one uh g win right there so then we're going to pick random we're going to set it to pick around either negative one or one so what g wind is like just to change the x position of the snow and then we're gonna get another one green flag clicked so we're gonna set the ghost effect to 100 in the beginning and then we're going to start making clones after that so we're going to set the ghost effect goes to 100 and then we're going to go to like negative 240 y 240 like in the top left corner that's what we want to do so we're going to set 240 somewhere in the top left corner and after that we're going to get a forever loop you can like do anything that's in the top left corner we're going to forever loop uh create clone of myself so we played with the numbers a little bit so we want to wait a couple seconds like 0.005 so like this is the perfect amount i found is 0.005 seconds to 0.01 so this is like um how many the delay of how many clones will spawn so like we just put a little bit delay so it looks cool okay let's save it and then let's get go to control and then we're gonna get uh when i started clone okay so now we're gonna start coding for the when i started clone so we can also make the uh snowflakes random colors so we're gonna set the size set size to pick random let's say uh 60 70 to 90 let's do something like that pick random from 70 to 90. i'm just making up some numbers right now you can do any number you would like and then we're gonna go to oh yeah and by the way the snow is in the description below and if it's just like a circle small circle i drew that's what it is and then uh we're gonna go to pick random duplicate that negative 240 240 so in the beginning you want to go there pick random negative 240 for the x position to 240. so it'll just either spawn from this corner or this corner and then the y is going to be 220. so it'll be on the top like right here and then we're gonna get a repeat loop repeat four times that's what i did so like it'll just keep on ghost effect as it keeps on going down so we're gonna change the ghost effect by negative 20 every time so we're gonna change ghost effect by negative 20 every time and we're gonna get another repeat repeat two times and then we're gonna change the y by negative five so it just keeps on constantly going down change y by negative five and then and then we're going to change the x by the g win which is right now defined as negative one to one so you just keep on moving so the wind can either push it to one or negative one it's like it's like it looks cooler it makes the wind blow in one direction so we're gonna do a change x change x by the p when put that in there and after that we're going to get a repeat until loop it's like what this is doing um when it's touching a repeat until touching any of these obstacles so we're gonna get a repeat repeat loop repeat until loop sorry and then we're gonna um repeat until it's touching any of these and then we're gonna change y by negative five and change the x by g when that's what we're going to do so we're going to do that real quick so and when it touches the things it's supposed to disappear so we're going to do we need a bunch of ores so or we're just going to put a bunch of oars in here so it has to touch all of these that's why we need a lot of ores how many do we need one two three four five so we need five because counting the edge we have the green flag the player the main character the spikes the ground and the edge and we can add the trampoline as well but we're not working with the trampoline yet we can still add it so we're gonna if touching main touching i know this is a bit long of a piece of code uh edge touching the green flag touching ground touching spikes and touching trampoline so like you can do something like this okay so like we just put a bunch of ores and all of them into the repeat and so so we're gonna change the y by negative five and then after that we're going to change the x by the g wind duplicate that and then we're going to repeat 10 times if not touching whites like if it's not touching white then we're going to change the y by negative 2 and then we're going to change the x by g when divided by 2.5 like some so just make a little variety to the wind of the way the snow blows so it's going to be a little bit cooler if not touching touching the color white so white just do this something like that like that touching white then we're going to change the y by negative 2 change y negative 2 and then we're going to change the x duplicate that change the x we need division sign division g when divided by 2.5 okay and then we're going to change the ghost effect by 10 so like when it touches something it just goes away change ghost effect by 10 put that right there oops ghost effect by 10 and then delete this clone once it touches something i'll just ghost and delete it okay so now let's save it and play so as you can see there's snow coming down and when it touches the player it just disappears it just goes away as you can see that's pretty cool snow so yeah we have level one and level two finished so yeah it's a pretty cool tutorial uh pretty cool snow and i think that'll be do it for this tutorial so if you guys enjoyed
