so anyways we're back guys and um this is part two of the spear fishing game so if you haven't seen part one please look at part one so anyways let's get started so first on our diver we have the we have all all this code that's it for the diver right now we have the spear code this is it for the spear code and let's just review the diver code and this is if green flag clicked set hp to 100 set rotation style left right and all the moving and spear oh whenever one green flag is clicked he'll set fish to zero forever go to diver if a key space is pressed broadcast fire in the spirit and wait when i receive fire the spear show repeat until touching edge move ten steps go to diaper and let's go to the fish so when the green flag is clicked go to front layer set rotation style left right move fish and then define move fish go to a random position set a costume name to join fish pick random one to four switch costumes a costume name show forever if then touching spear then broadcast got fish and all of this so right here okay and then let's get started what we have so fish so we'll be working on the fish again because there's more code for the fish and when i receive got fish it will stop other scripts in the sprite so that's when you get the fish not stop all because there's it's top other strips in the sprite and change fish by one so that's when you know that you cotton and switch costume to join this costume right here to join the costume name so it's either costume to dead one dead dead one so and then they'll start sam bobble so explain this code afterwards so i'm gonna go to the sound and then bubbles this already bubbles yeah and start sound bubbles and wait one second hide and wait three seconds and i'll move fish so as you can see i'm gonna demo it and as you can see it's not working that well whenever you throw the fish it's always so as you can see it goes to the head right there when i just hit it hit him in the tail it just went to the head it went through a fish one head but that does not work as well so you also have to make one for the tail so this is not the right coat i'm gonna demo a woman's so this is not the right code i'm just gonna stop this and then we're gonna work on the correct code so when i receive got fish stop by the description fight change um fishes by one fish by one and then instead of this you have to replace it so i'm gonna continue working on the code so you if then statement we're going to change this all up later so if then um if then the direction of the spear so it's this tricky thing again you could change the back first of the spear the direction of the spear is over than zero that means the sphere is pointing to the right and um you need it again we need actually this one and the direction the direction is greater than zero that means it's pointing to the point to the right so you know switch costume to join let's just take this one right here join instead across instead dead two so i'll be in the back did two yep that's in the back see and then um we're gonna keep on going with the other one so just put it right there okay so let's do that and switch costs you incent you need direction of spear but the direction is the other way is this way instead is less than zero the spear is pointing to the right and the fish is pointing to the left so we're gonna switch the costume name to dead one so there and we also need the other ones to duplicate this again wait wait a second just so we just duplicate this and it's if the oopsies have to i think let's move this a little bit off there let's move this down okay all right so this is if the spear is pointing to the left so we got to get the left one and then so the spear is pointing to the left two and the fish is pointing to the right so we can duplicate the last one so let's just duplicate that again and then instead the direction of the spear and then the direction of the fish is left instead so there and then we can put this for death 2 and put this under it there you have it so it's just a code for the fish so you just look at the arrows so if it's pointing here if the spear is pointing to the right and the fish is pointing the right you'll hit him in the back if the spear is pointing to the right and the fish is pointing to the left it'll hit him in the head if the spear is pointing to the left and the fish is pointing to the right they'll hit him in the head and if the spear is pointing to the left and the fish is pointing to the left it'll hit him in the back so there we go and we still have some code to do like we still have some spears to do so when i receive got fish then go hide so i'm just gonna take out this variable right here um i think yes in the fish so take out the costume name variable and then move the fish right here let's actually put the hp on this side and the fish on this side so here we go i'm going to show you so as you can see there's one fish right now so we want it to be more and then as you can see i got him in the back that's basically how it works so we're not done yet so we want more fish because there's two little fish so we can just duplicate fish and duplicate another fish so i'm gonna go to a fish too but instead you gotta make a new message called got fish two and change that to catfish two and change this to codfish too and you also go to go fish three and say you guys you got fish three so got fish three and got fish three so i'm going to show you how it works it's not completely done yet let me go to the spear and you just have to duplicate it and then instead change it to got fish two and duplicate this again and change this to catfish three let me show you how it works so as you can see there's three fish instead and i'm gonna try to catch one right here so i caught one it's a head shot i mean this is a head shot you can see there's three fish and there's more i got two points that's good that's basically it and we also have to add the puffer fish so it's easy to find puffer fish and we're going to work on it it's not that easy the puffer fish but let's make it so let's define let's make it move fish fish and define new fish we'll go to a random position switch costume to puffer fish a it'll show and i'll go forever move it'll always move five steps and if then it's touching if then touching edge then if it's on the edge you'll bounce so there's no way you can kill the puffer fish unless if it hits you so and then you can just duplicate this if you want more challenge you can just duplicate the popular fish and change it a little bit yeah so diver too and i'll broadcast hit diver instead hit diver so i'm just going to take this out because that can be more complicated complicated so we can just put this right here put it right here put it like this and then it'll define and animate fish so you gotta make a new thing animate fish and make fish and then it'll go forever the next costume and i'll wait one second so you have to do this just because you don't want to block the fish from moving this limit and then so when the green flag is clicked it will hide and go to the front layer i'll set rotation style left right so it won't flip over um i'll wait three seconds and oh define move fish i'll call new fish and then when the green flag is clicked call animate fish and then when i hit diver when you hit the diver so i gotta get a sound so i have to get the sound bonk and when i receive fire this beer no i mean hit diver um it'll start some bomb go hide wait three seconds so that that's when it hits the diver i'll go to a random position again and show there's almost all the code it's almost all the code but i you can it's optional if you want to make it color effect but let's go to the diver and you gotta add if then this is um you need this if then or if it if the health is hp is greater hp is less than zero you can hit right copper fish twice that that might be needed or equal to zero then hp equals zero then it'll broadcast game over so when i receive hit diver i'll change hp by 10 and i'll repeat 10 times i change color effect by 25. and then you want to stop the graphic effects in the end so it changed back to a normal color and there we almost have all the code we also have to get the game over so we can make and paint a sprite and you gotta go text and make it red because whenever you lose you always have to do red and then let's use marker so i'm gonna write this right game oh and let's make this bigger and center it that's around the thing and then when i when the green flag is clicked it'll go to the front layer um go to x zero zero so that's just the middle y0 i'll hide and when i receive game over oh show and it'll stop everything so that's all the code came over so i'm just gonna demonstrate and fish and you can't kill the buffer fish as you can see oh so it says game over so there that's basically it thank you for watching please like share subscribe
