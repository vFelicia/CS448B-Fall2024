so welcome back guys it's kids coding playground here today we'll be doing um july 4th baseball on for google doodle um for july 4th for those of you who are not american and do not know what july 4th is it is independence day for america so that's what july 4th is if you want to learn more you can probably just google it or something and um google doodle um they have like a game called july 4th baseball i'm just gonna do some gameplay for it i guess i don't know i'll attempt to break the world record which i don't know what it is okay let's let's see still loading first try home run haven't played this game in a while oh not bad single all right green hats these aren't that bad hit you can also play this if you'd like to search up july 4th baseball on google i think they'll show up i think this is a double yeah we got two runs uh white hats these are the probably the easiest to get oh yellow hat all right there's also a red hat which there's like a really fast ball it's really hard to hit i'm really bad with hitting those alright let's go that's pretty far actually 900 feet blue hat i throw it high boom another home run see how much runs i can get i don't think i'll be beating the uh world record anytime soon but i'll just try to get a high score i guess my personal high score i think my personal high score was like like 40 or 50. i don't really remember i haven't played this game in a really long time got double that's nice all right that's a that's a run definitely that's a run purple oh i hate these guys the ball becomes invisible as it gets closer 12 runs so far okay high ball oh that's that hit that's a single that's all right all right so next oh no it's a red hat oh let's go we hit it we hit it that's that those are actually kind of hard to hit i didn't think i would hit that thought that'd be now purple one all right got a double that's fine single oh no i i missed time that that was bad okay lettuce and lemonade are lefties i think so oh yeah we have homeroom lettuce oh cherry these guys are good so if you gotta run with them you'll count miss two because there's two of them so if i get her oh there's lemonade all right um let's go we got another home run okay three more runs that's great four four runs oh yeah cherry counts as two that's a double haven't got a single out so far i'm surprised i'm doing this green i've played this game in a while too another home run apple wait they gave us a white one actually okay that's that's a home run that's good that's actually pretty far again 900 feet these are probably the easiest to hit the blue hats or the white ones yeah yellow alright we got a couple that's one that's another run purple second that's a double double yeah let's go to second uh let's see home run wow okay we're actually doing pretty good right now i'm surprised we're doing like i haven't got a single out yet it's been 30 runs so far 31 runs another thing okay that's not that good okay hopefully you can get home run let's go home run got it and popcorn hopefully don't they don't give me another red hat because i'm probably gonna get an out if they do purple they haven't given me a red hat in a while actually i'm pretty lucky oh there's a red head oh i have to hit that i actually hit that i actually hit that those are really hard to hit okay got double two runs more that's not that good but all right another run okay that's good been five minutes so far oh okay oh no red hat no gotta i gotta strike that's bad it's bad i only have two more i only have two more chances left all right two runs i i try i'll try not to get out on these ones because like these are probably way easier than hitting the red ones hopefully they don't get out okay that's pretty good it's double oh i thought i missed that for a second but we actually hit it let's go home let us you got double oh no no i i went that way too early that was bad hit it way too early one run cherry that's two runs with the two cheers so you got four yeah oh almost understand i wasn't paying attention i was paying attention to the worm in the back oh let's go we got a home run 54 runs lemonade oh red ball oh we hit that let's go i remember this one time i got like 2 000 something no oh another red no okay i'm out that's 55 runs so thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share and subscribe if you enjoyed uh watching this video and happy july 4th to everyone watching this video thank you guys for watching
