so welcome back to another video on kids Cody clicker so today I'll be teaching you guys how to remove a background for sprite so for example a down this car right here and since there's no more back a back magic background remover in 3.0 you have to do it on the offline 2.0 editor so first I'll be importing the sprite and I can't delete this one and I'm gonna duplicate this to show to the recurse I will make a background to show how the background can affect your game or project okay so background so I made a dark background for you guys so as you can see and if you go here background can ruin the game look and it just blocks I can't you can it can cover the other car and it can block other sprites and stuff so you don't want that so first I'll hide this one so I can show you how to remove the background so first here to take the magic background remover you want to trace around oops I messed up there that's okay wanna trace around the car like so see now take out this part now as you can see this has no more backdrop compared to this one see this one as a background this one doesn't so then you can in export save this your local file save it and then you can go to scratch 3 and then you can upload the sprite and when you import it it doesn't have a background see no white stuff covering it so I hope this video really helped you guys so thank you guys for watching please share this video subscribe to this channel like and comment this will really help us out thank you for watching
