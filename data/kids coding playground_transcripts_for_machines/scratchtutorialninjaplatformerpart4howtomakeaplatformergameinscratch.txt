hello and welcome back to the kids calling playground Channel today we'll go over to try to make the ninja move around the the platform here and also he should not be open to he should not be able to walk through this wall here so we'll try to fix that and so before we begin now please like share and subscribe to our Channel and if you know any friend that's interested in doing Scratch programming please introduce our channel to them and ask them to watch some of our video and hopefully they will subscribed as well alright and now let me try to go through what we have earned last time okay here we go let's take a look at what we have done last time so we had created some of the custom block here jump control run controls and make roughly and start again basically this is like kind of reset the game so as you can see this is start again so if you have missed any of the code please you can pause the video and I'll just take a look and make sure that you got everything that you need it so this is the green flag like this is the run control right and then here says simulated gravity let me throw this away it was testing something and here is the checking if the the user is hitting any button if not we'll put him back to a standing position and this is the Chum control and we added the arrow to jump we can also add like the W key to jump as well since we already added the other key for moving left and right D he and the 18 right so at the W key okay so this is so far that's what we have for the ninja right that's the code for ninja from top here and then someone call in the bottom here we can probably organize it better a little bit la later putting all the custom block maybe on this side so that way we can kind of focus on there on all the other camps and stuff so custom block on the left side and go on the right side okay all right so this is our kind of begin this is another when flat click and these are two sham control can pop or the army next to this get this jump so that way we have everything together okay all right what a nice and neat okay what we're going to do is right now we want it I'm gonna teach you guys how we can make a hitbox prevent it and just kind of run across here so let's try run test this game now again okay okay let's begin I think I had some Co here let me remove this kill this hitbox I was actually trying something earlier let's put it back originally it is the codes like this okay now let's stop this let's run it again so as you can see that it just kinda can't move right but one problem is he can kind of run through here you see that that's not what we want so what we want to do is prevent the ninja from running across like this now what we can do is we can bill hitbox so once you set up all your platform or your platform make sure that you have a code and make sure that all when it start we always want to go to the position that you want to lay your your image here and we'll do something similar for the air hitbox so on the platform once you have the platform set up with all your three costume when you can do is this I already have it right here but I'll show you so you can say rightclick duplicate so we'll create something new right for this what you can do is you can go in and you edit this so what I'm going to do is I'm gonna go in already have the hitbox here what I'm gonna do is go in and edit the first level basically I'm gonna take off the Queen part and leave the brown part in place so that you know we can use as a hitbox so that the the character cannot run through it works well for like this kind of level but um and this level is fine but this level will have some trouble you'll see later on why because of the you know the small box here in between okay so it's not so how you do it right you just do a copy duplicate and then similar to yeah right habit so I'll show it to you here so what you do once you duplicate you can go in and kind of remove the top so I'll show you how how this is being done so let's say I'm over here on this one so what you can do is this you see how you have these boxes ready so when you can do select the bottom piece just hold the shift key and when you do is select the more copy and then come control V control C and control V and you kind of move it on top like this okay and then after that what you can do is you can select these guys on the top the green part and just trying to tidy them like this and if you want to adjust your you know up and down you can do that as you can see is not perfectly even if you want it to perfectly even then you know click on it you can push the up key up here to make it come out perfectly even right whatever you like to do so you can see this perfectly even so same thing for like other boxes so you can do is just select these just the middle row copy control C control V move it like right here and you can just delete the top piece all right so that's how we'll actually do it right so same thing for this just find one that you like and put it okay so this is how you actually do the platform removing the hitbox just removing copying and removing the top of here okay so let's go back to my hitbox I can Trash this that was just an example we go don't trash it I'll show you something later okay let's go back and let's fix our level one so for our level one hitbox I just did a copy from here so it's the exact same position so what we can do is kind of go in and delete all this wrong icon here so we don't need that so what we can do is we can just copy this guy then ctrl V and you can see I just laid over here and then I'll delete the top same thing with this C control V so we'll delete the top wall just the height here so come from the back down at all you can just adjust them using the up and down here if you wanna perfectly aligned so so I have my second level down here same thing here your copy control C and control V you can just put it like right here something like that if you wanna just sit just use the arrow down arrow it's a little easier okay just delete that this part so now I have my color my hitbox here right okay alright so what I did I write it in level 2 and for level 3 new series there will be some issue we can either cut it later I'll show you so we'll leave it like this for now so let's save it let's put our then you're back to the here so what we need to do is go back to the platform go back to the cajon so when we start we're going to set the level so what we wanted to is set level 2 1 send us our custom write number 1 so it will match that costume if it is a 1 2 3 right right 1 2 3 so we'll use that as a change switch costume so you say switch costume to the variable level which is 1 right now ok that means I'm in a little bit so you guys can see better ok now what I'm going to do is I'm gonna make it go to the back layer because they don't want the platform to be covering the ninja whatever all the tree right so will be called black layer and next time when we increase let's say go to the next level where some coke and changed level by one or you can do that later we don't need to do now so what we had is kind of set up the level and what we can do is go back to our hitbox same thing right without hitbox we want to one set it up as such right so okay for the hitbox we will kind of keep it done on level one for now we'll have some logic like be depending on the level what we want to show for now we're just gonna three the track is quick because I'm actually going to change that later on to maybe receive a message thing when they start up our setup then we'll do that but I will go for right now we're testing the hitbox so uh we can just put in a logic light something like this if so we have the variable level right we'll change it later on this thing so it is equal to 1 it was equal to 1 then we want this to go to this position so wherever this position is right so what we want to do we want to make sure this hitbox and the platform goes to the same position so that it over to each other right if not then you'll have some issue okay what we're going to do is we're gonna put into platform 1 for now so we're gonna test it out and now hitbox is also on platform 1 right okay so what we're going to do is we're gonna set the ghost effect of the hip so that you cannot see the hitbox ok what look ok step closer effect till 100 so when the green flag is clicked go to the number 110 I will use this costume or can do my chain costume or whatever alright so we'll just say switch custom for now till level 1 right okay alright so very similar to the platform right ok what a hiphop so we say start or save it lets thought so you will so what we are going to do is that we have to delete this this is kind of blocking the way right let's just trash this guy ok this is what we have so far so the hitbox is behind here you couldn't see it what we can do is we're going to keep the ninja from walking past this right so we're gonna go back to the ninja go ok so we have it hearing so we don't want the ninja to run pass it if I touch the hitbox mmm so what we did to do is we're gonna use this one we are going to use this enjoin and this is a knot so basically is if it's not touching the hitbox and he's not dying then we'll let him move right so put this so change that out change it out to this and then we will actually need another stops script here so what I'm doing is having different start script so that is the it multiple you know is going with different thread so it doesn't block whatever is doing so this guy can do one thing this guy can do another thing right so I had the stuff Flags quick so basically when you click on this green flag these corun what we want to do is use of whatever loop and we are going to use our condition check here okay so we are going to see if it actually touch the hitbox right so what we say is hitbox it is touching the hitbox and actually if this is not correct the movie this one only that ifs payment actually inside the if statement will put it if they'll statement inside okay so this is what we're going to check is what direction and then just pointing to the name is pointing to to the right which is 90 then we want him to go back there is pointing to the left they trying to hit the hitbox and we'll go back to the right so either way right so with a check the direction of the ninja is pointing when you can do them you can use this and where the kotas go to the ration and leave us in here here exposition so this is the direction of the ninja in the direction of the ninja is 90 which is pointing is facing to the right side we want to change his eggs okay change is six by minus 10 so within minus 10 because that's how fast is running right you remember with the run speed in the beginning so it runs speed is 10 so this is kind of matching that up so minus 10 backward so else so he's not going to 90 then they must be going the other way so you will say +10 so make him go back to the right so he's facing to the right and when we can go left is facing to the left when we feel good right if he hit him box okay let me stop it so before as you can see right we wash it running through let me take this out you can can see again so if I run the run oh okay so because of this we are blocking him right also we put this here just in case if he actually run faster and he actually hit this right we wanna put him back okay let's run again bigger so now so you say you cannot pull into the hitbox so he cannot run through the wall now so you see he can run like this like this but he cannot run through now because this Co here we came pushing him backward and this Co is stopping him to able to go forward okay alright so this works pretty well right let's check let's stop this and let's say we use a platform number two and see what happens and we'll make this guy go to open up wait for one second okay here so what we couldn't do I think though I don't even platform two is the same position I think the co2 can be else I actually I have not moved my platform when I did the I'm doing different level so actually well what I'm going to do is I'll put a little weight here so I want this I want this to set up the variable before this guys go right so put a little weight here will change all this later on okay what we can do is we can even draw this if statement we don't need it so what let's make it easier okay this will throw this away okay so the hitbox will just follow the level hairspray so let's start again so you see how it is slow right so you see this that's why it doesn't work well so you make wou have to want to make sure that you know next time we'll have this setup right well some kind of setup so it will wait for the level to generate before we put the music in you can do that next time but for today we were just trying to get the the hitbox working correctly so now the ninjas you right so we still haven't fixed the box right with the Box we had to make sure that okay here is this level water put the box here or something like that we can do that later but with the setup once they generate a map we know what it is then we'll set up the box okay so let's go back to the ninja so that's running again so as you can see right he can he can compare go inside the box easy it's getting block right it works pretty well right for this kind of platform so we can kind of go through that he'll fall into the water we haven't walk on the coal for water yet so he'd found the water make him back over here right now we can walk on next time but as you can see if we try to go through like the third level let me just take this out I'm gonna switch it manually to dirt hole and here in this hitbox no selector which is this one so now we start you can see that we're fine with this one they cannot run through but you see he's getting it when he get into here when you trying to jump up this is coming getting stuck on him right you see this because we have this hitbox everywhere and then they charge em up we got chopped back away right so what you can do is um what you can do for simplicity sake you can go here and you can go back to any box what you can do is you can convert this to bitmap first or you can just change it but uh make it smaller right so but you if you don't convert the bitmap you wanna erase it doesn't erase you see yes it doesn't erase so you're the convert to bitmap so this one I converted to bitmaps of what I did was I tell you raise a lot of it just leaving just a tiny bit on top tiny bit on top so if I use this now it walks a little bit better so let's try again so you see only if I jump all the way on top here right if I hit that then there's a little problem but other than that this is okay we cannot really get around with that unless we'll we'll just remove the hitbox like this lioness let me try this so there's duplicate this let's put this up here so what we can do is we are going to delete all these guys no hitbox on the top so if I show you this you see so the linear can can can you see if he can get running through it right which is kind of bad so again you can jump he doesn't have any issue but you can jump but you know sometimes we can get into the middle of it right so that's why that's why we added those hitbox but uh I mean I'm not sure that's a a better way to do it for now you know we can just kind of make it smaller I think there may be some way we can check mr. jumping action and then we can make more that or something with a hitbox it was a running action then we have to stop it but that will require some call to check so basically this is lesson just trying to get the ninja kind of move around with the with the hitbox are in place so that you know we can't block him from moving across the platform that's what we're trying to do so we got the light using a level 2 level 2 is fine it works pretty well right level 2 as well right move the ball at this that thing can I moved into the into the rocks but um you know level 3 with those little step there's some problem so what we'll see let me think about that see if we can do that a little bit better if not what we'll just continue with the with just cleaning out the thin strip here so that you'll prevent him from getting his head stuck in the middle of this grass when running okay alright I think we'll stop here for now I will contain next time thanks for doing the lesson with me I'll see you guys next time thank you
