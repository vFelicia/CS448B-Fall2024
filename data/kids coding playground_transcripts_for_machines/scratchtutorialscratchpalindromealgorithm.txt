hello guys welcome back to kids coding playground so today we are working on another algorithm uh project is called palindrome so basically it's basically it's like a a phrase a word or a number that you know a fun reading from the front and the back is the same so uh we're going gonna try to write a uh algorithm in scratch that will detect that if the word or phrase or number is a palindrome or not okay so let's begin all right so we're gonna create some variable so let's create a bunch of variables that we need for this project so let's call uh each character so this will help us to uh basically like if people write a phrase then we're gonna try to take out the space in between so we're gonna have to write a a custom block to uh remove spaces so that's why we need that next we're gonna create one more variable we're gonna create all the variables up front so it's easier for kids to follow so the next one is our index okay uh next is a linked so the link we're gonna be using to detect you know the the link of the uh the word or the phrase or number that's coming in from the player input and then we're gonna say player input without space okay without spaces so this is uh after we remove the space and we're gonna put the wood inside here without spaces all right next we're gonna go with um position one and another one called position two so this will use to check the uh the pa uh the what is the palindrome or not okay all right we'll save this so i'll open up all my variable for now so that is easier to see okay so what we're going to do is we're going to load in a backdrop so i created a backdrop that has some of the palletron word so all right so let me delete this so as you can see these are palindrome words so eve right backward you can read it as eve kayak same thing right race car same thing uh taco cat same thing right so uh you see how taco cat has space here these have some of the spaces so we're only taking care of spaces but not like special character like like uh you know like uh semicolon or or colon or or apostrophe or comma we're not taking care of those but you can write the code to do that as well but all right so we're only taking care of the spaces so we're going to try to remove the space so that we can compare each of the letters so let's say this s and s is the same right t and t is the same e and e is the same p and p is the same so you can see you can reverse this and they will still read the same way step nut on pads okay all right so let's get going to the code okay so we begin so we have the backdrop where you can see we have some of the palindrome words right here okay so let's go to make sure you're on the sprite cat okay so let's let's you can use any cat you want you can use the flying cat or whatever i think in the in the application i mean when i for my project earlier i have the flying cat actually so let's use the flying kit okay all right so we're going to use this flying kit so we're going to delete this scratch cap so we're going to use the flying cat and then we can rotate them around put them in the middle here so that can doesn't flip over okay so we have the flying cat we can change this costume we'll use this custom we'll make him 150. okay all right so this is our cat we're gonna use for the uh palindrome code okay so make sure you're on the cat and don't coat it in the backdrop so let's create a new block make a my block we're going to call it remove spaces okay and then we'll take one input okay so this is called input and say okay so right now i'm only concerned about removing spaces between the word like let's say uh ufo space tofu right so we need to remove the space when we're comparing the word so make sure that so they will compare correctly so let's say u and u is the same you see f and f is the same or knows seven t is in the middle so if you flip it over you can still read it as ufo tofu right all right so this will remove spaces so we're only in doing spaces but actually you can remove like commas or um the apostrophe or something like that you know they have something like that you can remove that too but right now i'm just removing spaces okay okay so let's go i'm gonna say set so now set the index to one so send scratch speaking the index one unlike uh you know java other language they begin at zero okay so next we are going to set the player input without spaces so that one you have to put the backspace to delete the zero so make sure you have nothing in there so next part we are going to control we're going to get a loop so we're going to repeat the number of times so here we are going to repeat the number of times the length of the input so basically if there's 10 letter we are going to repeat 10 times okay all right so next we're gonna what we're going to do is we're going to try to get each character out of the uh of the word or the phrase or number and we're going to try to see if it's a spaces or not okay so we're gonna go back to here when i get this so this is the letter of one as you can see letter one of apple is a right two is p right so what we're going to do is we're going to put the index here and then we're going to put the input here and we are going to put the index variable here okay so each time the loop will go through we're going to increase the index and then we'll add one to it so we can get the next letter so next we're gonna check so if so we're gonna check if it's not spaces so we're gonna say equal and then we're gonna say each character and then here make sure you put a space in your space keyboard so if you can see i have a little space here okay all right so next we are going to say set set player input without spaces so let me zoom back out a little bit all right here we're going to join use the join operator so we are going to join the input without spaces in the beginning the first time go around gonna be blank so blank and join with the first letter which is whatever letter the player types in right so after that every time we go through we're gonna check if it's not a space then it will add it to this uh word here and next we're gonna increase the counter so change the counter uh the index by one so it will pick up the next letter so i'll show you guys how that work later okay so so far we have this code here so if you miss anything just pause and write that down okay so next we're going to call the bottom here okay so we're in the scratch cat so we're going to make every time it clicks on it we're going to do the code okay so when when the key is pressed the space i mean the the sprite key is pressed we are going to ask a question okay and what we're going to do is we're going to say um enter a number or a phrase all right so it will check the panodrom for you so next we're going to call the remove spaces here so this will call the uh the custom block what we just created up front and we're going to put in the answer so whatever player type it will put the answer okay so now let's just test it out real quick so if i click on this little cat here and say enter phrase let me try to type in ufo toefl right i have a spaces here right here you can see all right i guess it doesn't show very well okay so you can see uh maybe i'll just zoom in so ufo toefl right so when i enter this you can see that it created the uh it took out the spaces of ufo tofu right so that's what we did so we go through each of the uh letter and then take out the spaces so we're going to try again let's say step not on pets right so you can see step not on pads they all remove all the spaces okay so so far you guys understand the remove space function so now we're gonna go check the uh the the phrase or the number or word is it the palindrome or not okay so next let's say set uh we're gonna set the length so basically how how big this uh word is okay i'm gonna say set the length um okay and we're gonna put in the uh player input without spaces so that one is without the spaces right so we can compare next we're going to say set the position one oh i spell position wrong oh okay let me fix that rename i here okay position one so position one we're gonna begin at one okay and then position two uh we are going to get the length of the you can use this actually because i already did that so let's use that so use the link okay so position two is the linked whatever the uh uh you know you have ten letters so it will be ten nine that will be nine okay all right so what we'll do next is i'm gonna say repeat okay so we are going to divide the uh uh divide the uh the word in the half and then we're gonna try to compare the left side and the right side all together at one time okay so now what we're going to do is um okay so what we're going to do is we're going to get this um divide operator here and we are going to put in the length and divide by two so we're going to compare half of it so from the left side comparing to the right side okay and we are going to put a if condition inside here so in this if condition we are going to compare if the letter are not the same so if it's not the same we're going to stop immediately okay even if one letter is not the same it's not a patent draw okay so what we're going to do is we're going to use this not here and then we are going to compare the equal okay so we're going to use the equal sign put that here and then we're going to use something called the letter right just like how we do earlier looking for the the words so we're going to put letter and then duplicate one more time into this one oops sorry okay so we're going to compare okay the position okay i'm going to put this here without space put put this one here okay okay so let's zoom back out a little bit okay so basically we are comparing the first letter and the last letter so first position we're gonna put this first position here and then the set position two which is the last position okay all right so this is how it looks like so we're gonna repeat uh divide by two so we're gonna compare half of it from the left side compared to the right side okay each of the ladder and then keep going okay if they're not the same now we're gonna say say so we're gonna put say here not with a timer so that can show up easily people can see and we're gonna use two join here let's use two joints so that we can put a hole in between okay so he's saying say and then we can put a quote oops put a quote here okay and then we're going to say answer so whatever user type in we don't want to take this one because this one doesn't have a spaces right we want to see what the tech player type in so we're going to use the answer and here we're going to put a quote here and then a space here say is not a parallel drone okay and then if it's not a palindrome we're gonna stop so we don't need to continue okay so i'm gonna say stop stop the script okay otherwise we are going to increase the counter so we're gonna say change here gonna say change the position one by one and then we're gonna change position two by minus one okay so because position two is coming from the back right position one is coming to the front so we're comparing the front let's say step on pads right so so position one is s position two is s so they're gonna compare this is the same uh yes they're the same so they'll move on to the next one so the position one will increase to t right and then now position two has to go back right so we're gonna minus one right so vt and then let's go forward again and this is going back again so that's why you have position one going forward position two going backward okay so next we're gonna say okay and we're gonna put it here okay so here we're gonna say is so if it's everything is correct all the way to the end then it is a palindrome okay so that's it so that is our code so let's try it out so let's take out some of these things here so that we can block some of the words so we can use it okay all right so let's zoom back out so this is the code for the cat on the palindrome check and then this is the code for the removing the spaces okay so let's try this cat okay so let's enter a number or letter okay let's say one two three three two one right so you see that one two three three two one is a palindrome it's a number right we can click on the cat again we're gonna say uh maybe nine one one nine right nine one one nine right that's a palindrome so if i say one two three four five six right that's not right so enter it's not a palindrome you see that okay so now that is working fine the number is working fine now let's check out the letters so let's say kayak okay so kayak palindrome right let's say taco cat okay so taco cat palindrome so this one what is good about this a check here even though we're checking out it actually ignore the spaces you i mean ignore the capital letter so you can see t and t it only checks uh checks it as the same so that's good so scratch does that but the other project i mean other language it might not do that so you might have to convert it to lowercase or something but scratch is fine they check it so they saying t capital t and lowercase t is the same thing so let's try one step not on pets all right step 9 pets is a palindrome right no lemon no melon right so those are palindrome so if i type in how how are you right so that is not a palindrome because you cannot read backwards right for how are you so that's it that is the algorithm for palindrome check using scratch i hope you guys
