so welcome back to the channel guys today we'll be doing a video on how to make a dropdown screen so for the dropdown screen well so this is a example game that I have a dropdown screen on so when you press either the stop button this will drop down or when you press the thumbnail I mean give up button it will drop down so today I'll be teaching you guys how to do it so when you enter any game in the beginning of any game the timer this thing right here will start running but what this code does is it keeps on resetting the timer so it get to zero and then when you print either press a stop button or give up stops the script and then the timer will start running again and when timer is greater than 0.1 then this thing will drop down okay so let's just get a new project we can name this drop down of that okay we don't need this cat and you upload a sprite so this is a spray I have so I'm gonna delete this code and go through it one by one so first we'll need a one when clicked when flag clicked we'll need to go to zero zero so this will go to the center we want it to go to the front layer when it drops down so you want to go to the front layer high so it will hide in the beginning until you press the stop button you want the forever timer so they'll keep on row setting the timer so the timer won't start so if you take this out and you press the timer timeless running what would you do this and you put the tiger it's at zero cuz it forever resetting the time okay next we'll need this block the violinists which it's a timer 0.1 and critical warning yet we wanted to go to we want this sprite to go to zero why 300 so it will appear off the map and collide in so that's off the screen and glide it through it we'll get the effect of gliding in so we'll need it to show and then when they maybe glide 0.5 seconds to the center of the map screen yeah so if you play this nothing will happen in the beginning going to press the stop one this glides down I hope this video helped you guys so thank you guys for watching and please subscribe to our channel to support us thank you
