welcome back guys it's kidscodingplayground here and today we're back for another video and if you didn't know tomorrow is valentine's day we are working on valentine's game so let's full screen this and i'm gonna download it so play some music i i put on soft so um use the arrow keys to move it left or right you cannot move it up or down and then you click on the bow so it changes costumes click on like any part of the phone that shoots the arrow and it shows the numbers of course that are left and it shows the amount of arrows so i used three arrows four arrows five and then this is happy valentine's day so anyways let's start so i already made my new project i'm gonna rename the title to happy things called valentine's day happy valentine's game so let's set that valentine's game so we have to do some stuff so first i'm going to show you how to draw a bow and arrow so you can skip forward if you do not want to learn because i have them in the google uh google uh drive so so if you don't know how to log into google drive you can watch our video links in description so so if you know how to uh do it um cool do not use your school account if you if you have a school account so i'm gonna drag the bow arrow and the happy valentine's day so i'm gonna so there's three main costumes in the bow so we're going to draw the bow right now so i'm going to teach you how to draw it so skip forward if you do not want to draw know how to draw the bottle because we do have in the google drive or if you want to download one from online so so let's just draw it i'm going to paint a new sprite and then you can choose your color i'm not going to judge you if you make your bow green but you can make it any color you want it doesn't matter so we decided to use brown because that's the most main thing for bows so all bows are made of wood so that's why it's brown so yeah so you draw you start out with a rectangle and five outline and the inside is some brownish color or you can make a purple if you want to or blue and then you just raise up the middle with reshape tool and then you raise it up even more with the bottom to make like the bow the bow uh wood piece like a boomerang and i'm gonna make that larger and fit that so let's also do that for the other side and then we also need to make a string because bows always have strings it's called the bow string so i think that's what it's called i'm not sure so use shift key and then to make a perfect uh line all the way to the other side so that's a bow string but i but i kind of mispositioned the line so i drew the line right there so yeah this is going to be the first costume where there's the little bow the wood piece and the bow string and with the arrow so we're going to draw the arrow next let's make that a little bit larger so touch the string because that's just a flying string so we need to make the arrow but first we have to duplicate it so i'm gonna move that line a little bit it's a little bit dispositioned so i'm gonna duplicate these costumes two more times so i have three costumes in the end because two plus one is three so if you didn't know that's two plus one is three and um now we have three costumes so let's work on the first costume still shift key make the line and then make the arrow so um you need a square and this is a good trick click the delete button with the reshape tool and click delete and backup states not delete wait it is delete nevermind um and it turns into a triangle because a half of a square is a triangle uh so i'm going to move that a little bit so right there right on that thing oh yeah and we have to do the like i don't know what type of detail that is but we have to make the uh uh never mind we have to make the feathers um some arrows have feathers some do not and it's normally for native uh i like native people always have the red feathers i don't know why and they always dip their arrows in poison but this is red air red feathers don't ask why sometimes it's white feathers sometimes it's yellow feathers it doesn't matter what color you make it so i'm gonna move those things it looks a little bit horrible but you know yeah um i'm gonna put that on the bow group it all and then drag it on the ball let's drag down let's move it a little bit there we got a arrow on a bow so let's work on the second costume which also has the errors let's copy paste that ctrl v ctrl c ctrl v so that we got that on the middle and then we gotta pull out the whole string with the bow string without with the reshape tool so you move that up and then you have to move that yeah and there you got it and then the last costume you keep it as it is so it's when you find the bow so yeah next we have to rotate yeah that's that's all we have to do right rotate the bow so group a little arrow little two arrows move it with the shift key and make it directly rotated it's the point to the right side for it to point up so that's how it is and make the bow string right on the cross in the middle do that for the same for these group la la la put it over there and then same thing group move it down there we go above well we're gonna use the original one because i honestly think that looks better so um yeah i don't think we need these small bows these are kind of small so anyways let's just delete these and there we go regular ball we already have links in the description google drive or we can get one from online like what i said earlier so we also have to upload the heart oh yeah and you also have to make the arrows right just copy paste that and we have to just copy paste this arrow ctrl c ctrl v then go arrow you go center it on the center of the arrow in between the feathers and the tip so delete that and we have to add the heart for what you have to shoot so let's shoot the heart all right so we have to make the backdrop so it's called hearts hearts asia itchy i don't know why it's called hearts even though it's one heart it's just one heart it's not even multiple hearts so anyways just like this backdrop and we have to get coding so first let's work on the bowen arrow so so the green slag is clicked it will point in direction zero facing up and go to x zero net y negative 160 so i already have that that position because i drag it for my backpack set size is 75 it's already 75 but let's just put it in so um i'm gonna make this around 25 20 minutes or 25 minutes so stay tuned so anyways forever touching the mouse pointer oh if then else i meant if then else touching the mouse pointer then it will switch costume to costume 2 yeah so it'll be like like i don't know that's a bad explanation like like a pullback of the bowstring so uh yeah um the switch costing costume two uh so you need to if and then if then the mouse is down then i'll fly to the arrow because yeah your mouse has to be on the thing you click on it and then it'll fire the thing so mouse pointer mouse down if the mouse down then switch costume the costume three broadcast fire arrow so we'll get back to that later i think we'll get to that in a minute arrow um and wait one second and then elf switch costume to costume one uh and we're gonna add the right arrow and left arrow rotate so if the well um this this block whatever it's called when the right arrow is clicked it repress just duplicate this right now make the left arrow then move uh turn one degrees to the right this is turn one degrees to the left very little but when you hold down the key it moves like this so let's see you see like it's moving so this is not working yet because i haven't coded the arrow and yeah so let's do that so uh as you can see it was a little bit jumpy here like if you're not on the right thing you'll just jump everywhere like it's like a frog or something but it's not it's a bow and uh so we have to add some code well this was already planned out so yeah uh so i have to make a variable distance to mouse this is a mouse and then i have to set distance to mouse uh set distance i think i already made that did i make that variable yet i don't think i made that variable yet i took the arrow from the project so it's my backpack so it still has this error used variable let's smack that out of here so send distance to mouse to distance to mouse distance to mouse pointer to be precise distance to mouse pointer so there we go and then uh we have to do uh or so we're working on this script okay um let's move this up let's move this away and then we or um if touching mouse pointer or distance to mouse is less than 85 so it won't move a lot and it won't bounce up and down and down and up so if 85 is larger than distance to mouse yeah or it's touching that mouse pointer so let's drag this in uh less than so let's put that in and let's try it it's like it isn't wobbling all over the place anymore see working correctly good so now we're gonna work on the one and only other strip the code for the arrow um so this does not actually have a lot of code so this is actually a pretty easy project to make so you need clones but first i'm going to start with this and i'm going to make the variable arrow used so this is like a there we go so when the green flag is clicked set arrow used to zero because you didn't use any arrows in the beginning and then set size to 75 and um hide uh i'm gonna i'm gonna do this next so when i start as a clone control yes let's hide this real quick so when i start as a clone it will so first i'm gonna do this uh when i receive fire arrow i'll change i never use my one because i always have that i'll create clone of myself so and then when i start as a clone it'll go to the bow and arrow so we have it right here bow and arrow and then point in direction direction of bow and arrow so point in direction direction of bow and arrow direction you gotta change this one first remember this is like the tricky thing the direction of bow and arrow move 50 steps so we have it right here so move up here i'll keep on moving it'll um show and then repeat until touching edge so it won't stop until it touches the edge so let's have that repeat until touching edge move 10 steps and delete this clone and then so let's go back to control delete so let's test it out look it's firing the arrow great so now we're gonna work on the happy va uh let's actually work on the heart first so um heart so this has some code but not that much so part when the green flag is clicked oh my god that's really small it will set size to 30 percent oh wow it's really big right now i think 30 is good enough yeah no no too small maybe like 50. let's try 50 because i was using a different heart in the demo so 50 is fine so it'll hide you know set number of hearts to 20. yeah we have to make a new variable of course so this is the countdown of how much hearts you didn't shoot yet so uh set um number of hearts to 20. only 20 hearts you know repeat number of hearts and we'll keep on repeating and making hearts until they get 20. so uh repeat where's that right here so repeat number of hots and create clone of myself and when the green flag is clicked it will go forever and then if then touching no if then the number of hearts equals zero so that means there's no more hearts left on the board then it'll show the valentine's thing but we'll have to broadcast a message of course yeah of course we have to broadcast a message so broadcast happy valentine's day happy choose valentine's happy valentine's happy valentine's and then we have to work on this last script so when i start as a clone then it'll go to x x position just a position i'll go to x pick random negative 200 to positive 200 and why pick random 25 to 145 so both positive so 25 and then 145 so it will be up around here so and the x will be around here and that y will be up here so that's why if we had similar thing to do in the pokemon game so um i use a different part i use scratch's heart there's two types of hearts and i decided to use them both but it looks like the hard one the the purple one is bigger than the red one but also varying size so go to um and then we'll make it next costume because i just want to make it more fun and i'll show and i just want to make it like different variations of colors just to make it more fun and i'll wait until touching the arrow and then i'll hide i'm not not hi make the sound so it's touching air touching arrow then it will start sound yeah it's already there all the sprites have this i think the scratch count has meow not sure so it'll change number of hearts by minus one so change number of hearts by 1 and then delete this clump now we're going to work on the happy valentine's day sprite and we're gonna demo it in the end so when the green flag just clicked oh yeah we also have to make the music uh i'll make it hide and then when i receive happy valentine's you know show we have to add the music real quick uh the backdrop has it so when the green flag is clicked you know how i love making this update yes uh i'll play it sets volume to 15. it's cool how you can make scratch the different volumes so i can make it like quieter already so set volume to 15 play sound dance energetic so dancing yeah this one so and i'll go forever dance energetic until done so let's do this um screen let's do it so all of them are purple that was an absolute fail this is what happens when you get ideas from someone so yeah we're gonna um make the heart uh do color effect instead of just changing to the next costume because it'll always be the next costume well you can do this if it's if you want to it's optional i like all my hearts red but that's fine i mean um there's heart red so we have to make the color effect by 25 and click on it this does not work just just just don't do the color effect party hearts got to work okay so pick random one two three bajillion three hundred so all different colors really fun cool party hearts see click on it i think i'll get all of those oh yeah this is happy valentine's day so we're done with this um so please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below if you celebrate
