welcome back guys it's K playground here and today we're back for another video on Scratch and today we will be coding the sixth part of the hero war game so this is the sixth part so if you not seen the first second third fourth fifth part it's all on our Channel and you can go watch that to get caught up to now so when I exported the backdrop in part one I used this backdrop so I actually have another backdrop that you can use so I use this for the original game but I honestly like the green grass backdrop too but um this one honestly I think it looks better cuz it looks more dead and gives more vibe to it so I'm actually going to switch backdrop to backdrop two which is this one I'm probably not going to use this one but you can if you want uh doesn't really matter but I'll just have both of those over there and now I'm let's get started and we're going to start with our first boss today which is The Siege monster so The Siege monster has similar code to the armored dude we just need to drag most of it into here so on the green flag click let's just drag all this in here and we'll just and there is no clone for this one so we'll alter it later oh no okay there we go so we got everything over here so this is how it's going to work another one yeah so when the green flag is clicked switch one hide and then we have a variable which is this is Siege monsters armored HP but we're going to rename this to Siege HP because we copied all of them over there so it's going to have armored HP Siege HP h p i Chang Siege monster whatever doesn't really matter oh typing's really bad Siege monster HP so it's going to hide Siege monster HP because the siege monster doesn't come after 250 score so hide variable Siege monster HP so there's no when I start as a clone so let's just change this so we need when I receive first we need to make the broadcast that spawn The Siege monster so let's make a broadcast so broadcast new message Siege Mon oh my Siege monster spawn so it'll broadcast Siege monster spawn so in this start game thing forever if then not creating clone that'd be really deadly if you created clones of 1 million Siege monsters ERS so if Siege monster I mean score is greater than 250 so that's when it comes out it will show and broadcast Siege monster spawn then it'll stop the script so that's spawning The Siege monster so now we have more Siege monster stuff so when I started clone nope when I receive Siege monster spawn so when I receive Siege monster spawn it will set Siege monster HP to 10,000 so Siege monster has bunch of HP in our P until touching player wait. 5 seconds so instead of we have to make it walk right so so when I receive Siege monster spawn when I receive Siege monster spawn so we can keep this the same but it's not going to move five steps that's too quick for The Siege monster instead we're going to make it move 0.1 steps great now we're going to have this other part which is summoning the peons well actually we'll work on the peon last so let's actually um do this part over here when as I start as a clone which is not when I start as a clone it's when I receive Siege monster spawn forever if touching projectile her select one heal water minus 180 and then if Siege moner HP is equals z or less than zero change score by 500 and then instead of deleting this clone because we're not even using clones it will broadcast Siege monster dead broadcast oops Siege monster dead Siege oh my monster dead sieg monster dead and if it section projectile here selected two minus 250 delete Arrow change score by 500 broadcast Siege monster dead then same with the third one so actually um the fair Qui really strong against bosses so it's a boss sluger so instead of 60 damage it be 350 and it'll broadcast delete arrow and then change score by 500 and broadcast each monster dead so we can keep the spectral Arrow part the same because okay actually I'm just gonna broadcast this I'm gonna duplicate this Siege monster dead thing a few times so I have plenty of space Oh so I have plenty of them to use so let's just do that so um and put them off the side so if it's touching the first ability he s is one since it touches it multiple times the special Arrow um you'll keep it the same and then broadcast so each monster dead and then if it's touching the second ability and hero select the two which is the death Arrow then it will not die from the death Arrow so let's actually just duplicate this over here let's throw away this this oh we still need to delete Arrow but yeah let's put this in here and then it'll change Siege monster HP so the death Arrow does a th000 damage to boss is really strong and then uh when it's like that yeah that's right okay so we can literally take out the first ability hero selected is equal to two cuz the Wizard's ability of the not teleport back does not work on The Siege monster or any boss of that fact so let's just try this back over here so if it's touching the second ability and hero select is equal to two it'll change uh Siege monster HP by 6 because it'll pass through it multiple times and if it dies from that let's just duplicate this actually and drag it in here so if it's equal Z or less than zero she 500 broadcast each monster dead it's kind of repetitive but yeah so but it's searching appren star he will select equal two change sieg monation 400o to the star change score by five 00 broadcast sieg monster dead there we go if a second ability in here selal to three um it won't die from that so it will instead let's duplicate this it will change Siege monster HP by negative 00 the broadcast no no delete prcess a star just throw it over there and yeah keep that and then if it's touching the third ability which is The Shield it'll move 255 steps so The Shield is really strong against The Siege monster um it's just so strong take out the switch costumes cuz we're not switching the costum it's so strong because it would just move negative 25 and it just do another 400 damage to it so and then change score by 500 change code by 500 broadcast each monster dead and if it's touching the player you'll broad set oh once he touches you you're basically dead so hit player Siege to Y hit player Siege to Y broadcast hit player and then move negative 10 steps so we basically coded this whole hunk of code so its special ability is to summon these little pods that will chase after you and do astronomical damage and that's basically how it is so um when I receive Siege monster dead so let's just code the Death part first so when I receive Siege monster dead Siege monster dead it will start sound boom Cloud you could uh you can get it from the spite Library you'll hide varable Siege monster hide variable sieg monster HP switch costume to costume three it will stop other scripts in this Sprite so no more peons will spawn any of that it'll wait 3 seconds and hide so wait three seconds and then hide that's a death and now let's look at the um summon peon script script so when I receive Siege monster spawn it will show variable Siege monster HP show variable Siege monster HP it will repeat eight so it'll have the capability to summon eight waves of peons you can put more if you want it more challenging or put less if you want it more easy you'll repeat eight times you'll wait 8 Seconds um this is my recommended amount cuz I tested it out many times so switch costume costume 2 which is the summon peon high high summon peon this is the dead summon peon and then regular switch costume to costume two it'll wait one second then it'll switch costume to costume one sorry yeah one and then broadcast summon peons peons broadcast summon peons so I'm going to go see if we have every code okay now we coded the whole entire Siege monster we're going to weake got the work on the peons but first let's add the um damage of The Siege monster to the player so let's go here all right so we need an if then if then hit player Siege monster hit player Siege equals to Y then it will change lives intive 350 such a strong boss and then I hit player Siege monster to end and that's the siege monster edition so let's add the uh peon now now peons so this is going to be a clone as well so and its closest relation is the enemy so let's actually drag all of the enemy regular zombie one into here huge hunk well it's only four okay let's put these let's take a look at the peons so let's when I receive instead when see start game when I see summon peons because this is peon only no forever not forever because that'll just be crazy it'll repeat four I'll create CL myself and wait one to 2.3 seconds and then now we're going to have okay um I forgot to add one thing for the second ability Sprite so since I just tested it out the death Arrow can go through enemies so when I receive delete Arrow just inside the second ability just do hide and then go to player that's it so that's a needed change for the second ability I'm sorry for that cuz I forgot to do it and um let's continue on the peons so when I start as a clone instead of set Instead This zombie HP right this is actually going to be peon HP set peon HP to 200 so peons have 200 hp and then it'll repeat until touching player and wait. 5 Seconds so when I receive something suon beon that's correct and then instead I make it so the x is also the same as the Y so it's just 100 to 25 so it spawns closer to the player which is annoying and it moves three steps instead of two steps so yeah let's do that so so when I when I start as a clone forever if it's sear projectile and here select is equal 1 minus 180 broadcast delete Arrow just like that just like that see p on HP is equal to zero or less than zero change score by five so that's the same so it's like the closest right so since the projectile of the Mage can kill it in one shot we're going to change score by one by five delete arrow and then delete this clone there we go so if it's touching the projectile hero select is equal to three it change P by 60 broadcast delete arrow and yeah same as that that as you can see over there now let's see the first ability uh change score by five delete this clone second ability change score by five proo this delete Arrow delete this clone first ability of hero select equal to two the switch costume to costume 2 which is the peon stunned wait .1 seconds move NE 150 STS wa. 3 seconds one so it's the same so and now we have the second ability in hero select is equal to two which is the lightning H beond h60 and then uh yeah same as that just like that okay now let's continue so second ability here just like go to two yep oh just like that and then now if touching apprentices star and equal to it's the exact same as the zombie BL and now we have the second ability and here like equal to three change score by five it'll delete this clone and if it's touching the third ability and here'll select these go to three it'll actually change score by five and delete this clone so it'll die by the defender chip no matter what and then this is the same and instead of sit set hit player zombie hit player Pon so new variable hit player Pon set hit player Pon y so if you touch the player all right all right since now we coded on in all that let's actually add the damage to the bomb and all the siege monster death things so let's go to the enemy so when I receive bomb which is the what the Griffin drops nukes the whole thing it'll wait one second and then High delete this clone and then this is the same for The Siege monster dead so we're going to duplicate this so when Siege monster is dead Siege monster dead not Siege monster spawn Siege monster dead then it'll also die so you get a little break and now we'll add that to the Speedy enemy We'll add that to the armored enemy and the peons so let's just see if it went through oh there we go then on the armored enemy Siege monster dead Siege the bomb and then the peon Siege monster dead and then when I receive bomb okay that's the siege monster all right so now I'm going to see how the game works and I'll show you through it my first I'm going to close the backpack and hide all the variables that are not needed so let's go to the hide uh hit player C on hit player Siege p on HP um let's add The Siege monster is that here already hidden okay great let's move the power up one two three we'll have the icons and it will look better later but just for now we're going to keep it like that so I'm going to uh I'm going to show you it all right so now let's I'm going to show you how it works so I'm at like 228 is score uh I'm about to get there uh oh there's a Siege monster he's coming right at me right now oh no he needs to slow down there oh no and now he's summoning peons on me this is not good oh okay I think I'm going to use the um big dude big dude Griffin bam nuke that whole thing then spam the death arrows on him so it looks like The Siege monster does work it's summoning peons um oh no the call coming at me now stop okay let's spam the death arrows at him oh no oh no oh no we need we need the big boy Griffin Big Boy Griffin help me out here bam nice oh we're going to shoot him we're going to shoot you oh and I killed The Siege monster so it does seem to be working um next part will code the old one and the old one vineard and probably hopefully finish up the zombie king and the rest of the game so please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below what else you want to see next and I'll see you guys in the next part
