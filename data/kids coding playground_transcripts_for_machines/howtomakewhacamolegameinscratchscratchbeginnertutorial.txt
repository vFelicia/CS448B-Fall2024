welcome back to kids coding cool around today we'll be doing a whackamole game in scratch so i'm pretty sure you guys know a whackamole famous like at the arcade they have these games where like you use a hammer and you're trying to like hit the moles or whatever so yeah we'll be making this in scratch today so let me demonstrate the game real quick so basically use a hammer you hit it you get hits or if you miss your hit your misses go up so it's basically just an infinite game you can add any screen screen if you want or lose yeah so it's pretty much the game it's pretty simple to do um i'll be showing you guys also how to draw all of these sprites we have here but we'll still link them in the description below but we encourage you guys to like try to draw them and stuff so yeah okay let's create a new project first we will need the backdrop so i'm going to import the backdrop from here so we're going to delete this so i'm going to show you what i did in the background so basically we just uh for the back for like the blue thing we just took white like a light blue color and a dark blue color and we use this circle tool right here to make like that thing and the color is 54 saturations 13 brightness is 99 so it's basically just like uh it has like a little color in the middle you can uh and the other color is color 54 saturated 95 and brightness 95. um you can use whatever color you want but this is what we have and for these circles it is just basically an outline of five with white on the outer rim and then just filled in with black which just basically just duplicated them to make rows of them so we just have like a few of them and then right here we have the hits and misses and um it's just a shaded red circle uh white circle and this is another shaded white circle so and then we'll be putting like the score like the hits and misses into here and the whackamole thing is just like just with the text that's pretty much it with handwriting uh font so yeah and then uh we will be importing the hammer sprite so hammer sprite um this one's a bit like a little bit more difficult to draw we have multiple costumes for it so uh when you click it'll hammer down and so basically right here we have like some like like something like like shade i guess i don't know what to call this like shine i i guess um so yeah this is on the hammer this it's just like so this is that color 17 4 and 30. and then right here we have another one it's the same color the edge like the big part of the hammer is like this and then right here we have basically we have like a darker yellow and then we put a lighter yellow on top of it with this part um and then we have this dark gray and then a light gray on top okay so now i'm gonna be drawing it so we're gonna paint a new sprite all right so first we're going to get that color that is the click the back color we're gonna change it okay so we're gonna be using the rectangle tool we're gonna use some outline as well if you saw we use a 10 outline we're just going to draw a rectangle and then reshape it using the reshape tool so we did 17 18 and for the 17 18 and 15 8 and 15 sorry um so yeah it's kind of like a dark gray almost black color and then we're going to use the reshape tool to kind of reshape it make it a little bit bigger reshape so we're going to make it look like a hammer now i'm gonna reshape it all right so we got kind of shaped up a little it's not it's okay looks okay and then next we will be putting the like the shine or whatever on it so next we will be using this color 17 4 and 30. uh we'll be using no outline for this one so select no outline and then just draw a rectangle and we will reshape it it's a reshape tool like that and then we can just draw another one or you can just duplicate it yeah we'll duplicate it and then we'll and then we will reshape this one a little bit more make it smaller yeah okay so that looks fine then next we will get the handle of the handle so then we'll be using a dark yellow no outline um color 1390 86 for the handle of the thing the hammer oops so now let's draw the hammer handle just draw a rectangle connect it onto there and then we'll get a lighter yellow color like that color i guess and then draw a smaller rectangle and put that right there okay so now we have a darker yellow uh color 12 99 56 so we'll be no outline we'll be drawing using the ellipse tools draw like a small oval and put that right there and then finally we'll just use the same colors as this and the the two gray colors for the end end of the hammer so let's get let's let's actually like increase the size decrease the size a little bit to cover that little part okay make it a little bit more to the left and then we'll group it so then we can make it all together and then move it to the back layer so then it will be covering the top we'll be using the same colors right here so we'll just draw 17 8 15 same as before with outline of 10. so this is the edge of the hammer decrease the size a little bit use this color and we're going to draw the little rectangle so our hammer is complete okay so now we have our hammer okay let's move it to the right a little bit and shrink it okay so now we have our hammer basically to make the different costumes we just duplicate it select it and then move it to the side a little bit use the rotate tool and then and then move it to the side a little bit see that move it again and so i'm pretty sure you all get the idea just keep on duplicating it like five costumes and you will make the hammer costumes to make it smash down so yeah that's pretty much it um for drawing the hammer so i'm going to delete it and we'll get started on the coating so for the cat we were only going to need the head obviously so we're going to select this and just have the head okay we're also going to center the cat head right now so we have the cat head center all right let's get the hammer okay so now let's start coding let's go to the um cat head all right so we're going to start coding in the cat so we're going to need to make two new variables uh we're going to make available hits and another variable we're going to name it misses this is both for all sprites and then we're going to make some lists we're going to make a list called x position and another list called y position y position and we're going to define the lists we're going to like add a bunch of stuff to the list but first let's set some stuff up so let me zoom in when green flag is clicked we are going to set the hits and we're also going to set the misses to zero and then we're going to go uh add a bunch of stuff to the list okay and then so now we have to find the x and y position of the head for each of these little black slots so basically what you do is just move the head and you find the x and y position but since i already have all the x and y position you can just copy what i'm doing so i'm just going to delete all of the lists in the beginning so we're going to delete all of the exposition so we're going to add a bunch of coordinates to the exposition so the x positions from this side to this side so you look down here you can see the x position as you can see if i drag it here you can see it's negative 166. so we will set our add our first thing negative 166 and then after that we'll add another one so you get the idea we just keep on dragging the head to each slot and then you just find the x positions and then next one i got was negative 79 and then as you can see i move it it's about it's negative 79. the next one i move it is three so we're going to duplicate this again and three and next one about right here we got 87 so we're gonna do 87 and we have one more movement about right here 172 so 172. and then we can just delete all of y position in the beginning we have to delete all of the other lists and then we're just going to duplicate all this and put this under be sure to change all of this to y position so let's change it all to y y y y and then we're gonna have to also change all of these and then so now we're just going to find the y position so start from here and since there's only four we're gonna have to delete one so we find the first y position on the bottom to be actually start from the top it's more better so first one's 86 a6 next one we get is going to be 31 right 31. next one is going to be negative 25 and next one is going to be negative 72. so yeah now we have all the x and y positions and after this we're going to broadcast a message we're going to name it start game okay okay so now we're after broadcasting start game we're going to receive start game we're going to forever and then we're going to set the x position set x position and then we're just going to get the item item and then we're going to pick random so how many are here we have five so we're gonna pick random one to five of x position duplicate this and then actually no no sorry uh we have to duplicate that not this set y to item pick random one to four of y position and then we're going to wait 0.8 seconds so it's only going to stay at one spot for 0.8 seconds okay next let's go to the uh i'll show it so as you can see the cat moves around yeah so the cat moves around so it looks pretty cool now let's get coding in the hammer okay so inside the hammer first we are going to get a one green fly clicked we are going to zoom in and if i clicked we are going to switch the costume to costume 1 which is the first costume and then we're going to forever go to mouse pointer so it's going to follow the mouse go to mouse pointer and then next when the sprite is clicked so when you click on the sprite it will switch costume to costume one switch costume costume one and then broadcast hammer cat so it will hammer down on the cat so hammer cat hammer cat and then we're gonna repeat five times repeat five times next costume because there's five costumes from here there's six but we're only gonna do five because there's five moving ones okay so we repeat five times next costume and we will do switch costume to costume one once it's done with action and then next when i receive hammer cat inside the same sprite we're going to wait 0.1 seconds and then we're going to if else so basically in the top we're going to check if it's touching the cat and if the costume number is greater than three so it will count as hammering down because the last three one or it's like hammering down so we're going to get an and so and so we're gonna get if touching cat touching cats sprite one all right so we're gonna rename this cap i guess it'll be easier to understand and the costume number is greater than three position numbers greater than three then we will change the number of hits by one else it will change the number of misses by one so we can get these variables double click on them drag them here and double click on this one again this one's misses make sure yeah so is it misses let's put that in there okay and then after we get that uh we can add music last last step like clicks with the sounds let's just get a random loop loop i guess whatever uh forever play this out and we don't want it to be too loud oh sorry this one so then we're gonna set the volume to 25 okay i think that's it let's play it as you can see we can also make the hammer go to the front layer so that we can go on top of the cat as you can see it's not on the front layer so it's easier to see if you hit the cat or not so we're going to go with the hammer we can do one grip on clicks toward front layer okay there but it's somewhat working all right so that's pretty much it for this tutorial thank you guys for watching um you guys can add like a end screen if you want but yeah like you can have a certain amount of hits once you get a certain amount of hits you win the game so yeah thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share and subscribe and bring
