hello guys welcome back to kids cooling playground so uh yesterday we did our first platformer for the uh among us so uh please like uh share subscribe to our channel and give us a thumbs up on the video uh so far we already have two thumbs down on the video not sure why so please guys if you enjoy this video give us a thumbs up on all the all our video so that was a great way to support us okay all right so let's get to it so this is what we have for the code for the main character yesterday so you uh miss anything kind of stop here and then um uh get it down uh what we can do is um probably put all the uh custom block on the left and then go on the right or whatever you guys like you can do that so i did not give out the main character yesterday the sprite is pretty easy to draw just just black box right so then you guys did that already and then we have this one uh let's put this idle costume on the last one for here and set in the first because we are going to use it to run so we're going to make it in the last costume okay put it in the end 13 okay all right so for now let's get to it okay so what we're going to do is we're going to create some platform for the game so that's that way you guys can start learning it i think everybody really liked the platform uh so i can upload the backpack here but i'm going to show you guys how to do that okay so platform i will provide some of the platform sprite for you guys and then you guys can change it the way you like so let's say this is our first one uh let's just do something simple for now uh so let's let's just remove all these guys for right now okay uh we don't need any maybe one of these okay okay let's have first three first floor okay i think that's good should be good enough so we trash only the other one okay so we're the first four we're gonna even delete this just like that so i'm gonna provide the sprite for the first four level and then you guys can change it the way you want so these are just blocks right make sure that when you are creating the block let's say you need to make a new platform but you can take this base one take all this copy it make a ping a new sprite and then put in the bottom and then what you can do is uh you can say uh ungroup all this and let's say you want to just take this box out so make that as group okay it's already grouped okay copy that you can move them on top let's say you want to put another box here right so you can do that or you can put another box here which you can do that so you can have like multiple box right for the for the sprite to jump up okay as you guys can see we created two little box here it's pretty easy so um i already did most of the hard work here while creating those uh image for you and you can just take it and then just kind of mix and match it like you know you have the rectangular box you have the bowl like the laser so something similar to like that you can however design your screen you know you can have upper top or lower top i mean upper here you have something on the top you can have something on the bottom and make some gap here so that you know it can fall off and die so this is kind of how it looks like and you know just different thing that you can put and if you want something on the top you can say like this copy this control paste uh group them all make sure you cook them all and then you can just flip it and then you can have it on the top so you can set it like here something like this like that so you can delete that you know anything you like right so this is like a a stage like this now you can have boxes here you know stack another one or you can put one of these right on here you can put them like this for them to jump on and if you want to add a laser you can add this guy so this is my laser well you can add it over here let's say you wanna the laser coming down here right and this bottom you want the different laser side and you want something else here or you can move these two blocks and group this and group you can delete these and then you can put the laser on top oops so however you want to do okay and then you can like take one of these from the bottom here and you can put it here somewhere like this right so you have a laser coming down something like that okay okay now let's go back to the code color variable uh we are going to add more variable to this um you can say um what else what do we have okay player dead and then speed right we have that uh you can say uh global variable so we can put them all having a g in the front is good so that we can have everything together uh this is the velocity okay uh for all the sprite okay pick another variable on ground so this will test if the sprite is on the ground and we're gonna make another variable uh gravity so we're gonna use a variable we can change it later you know how fast or whatever you need or you can you don't need it to do that also that would be fine but for now we just use this gravity okay and let's make one more call jumping so this one is not a global variable i did not put a g in the front make sure you select for the sprite only okay all right let's go back to our main character we have the reset here so what we're going to do is we're going to reset some of these variables that we just created so that you know when the game start you know we can make sure we're going to reset it so this reset the velocity to zero i'll reset the underground to zero reset the gravity let's gravity gravity okay we're gonna do negative one for grab and then we'll have one more oh i should then decrease this guy i accidentally created jump on the ground okay delete that sorry about that delete this guy let's go back to the main character okay i'll create over here my mistake i think i forgot when i was creating the variable when i was playing with the platform and i forgot about that so great jumping uh variable on this this sprite only for the for the main character not the ground okay uh you say jumping we'll set this to zero okay all right let me uh take out all these we'll keep this i guess we can yes we can take it out or leave it but let's just take it out a little more space on the screen to see i will leave this on and this is on okay so we are going to take a look at this okay all right so we'll make the main sprite jump as well and walk so uh what we're going to do is create another block called jump control and make this run without screen refresh okay all right so we'll put this over here we'll put this on top here so the move controls here jump controls here okay so for the jump control what we're going to do is we're going to put the if statement here and then we're using sensing block okay uh if up arrows press so we are going to check if the player is on the ground or not um and if it's jump so we need to have a another if condition inside here okay so let's put this in here and then we're going to get the n operator put that here well you guys can see okay and then we're gonna say so on the ground we'll call it greater than zero so we'll use one z zero for the ground testing it okay we're just gonna say if the on the ground is greater than zero and it's jumping where's the jumping okay we're gonna use the variable jumping if it's equal to zero so this uh is on the ground and then it's uh it's jumping is zero that means not jumping then you can jump so what we're going to do is we're going to set so set so we're going to set the on the ground to zero because it's not on the ground anymore and we are going to set the jump to one that means it's jumping and we're going to set the gravity g velocity i'm gonna set it 15 to 15 height you'll jump okay okay so we're gonna have to call this jump block over here in the all control have this away after the movement the jump block and we are going to change out this a little bit so we will say if and else okay we're going to check the arrow key again here if the up arrows press we're going to say change uh the velocity by the gravity so the gravity right now is negative one that we set up here right here on top okay so else we'll change it to two so we're gonna use a multiply so we can use the operator multiply the g gravity by two so it will be either negative one or negative two so it's jumping up then it's one negative one falling down if it's jumping on uh it's on the top falling down with big of negative two so it's faster you're falling down from the top okay all right and then you're gonna have to change the y so you change the y by the velocity that we're just uh changing right so like this okay so let me test it so you can see so when i run this it will kind of fall down and then we'll just follow the way down because we're not blocking it so if you see you see here it's falling down it's falling all the way down so what we want to do is we are going to um make him stay on the top here on the platform okay all right we'll save the project go back to the main character let's put this down okay so we will create another block to fix this so call this uh check hit ground okay so we're gonna have to create this boolean variable called is jumping and then click on this run without refresh okay make sure you have that and we are going to create it over here in the bottom here or maybe over here okay so we're going to use a repeat until loop here we're going to use a not operator now we're going to check if it's not touching the ground okay which is this right here and we have to check one more thing we'll do if and else and we're gonna drag this over here what we're going to do is uh changing the x on the y i mean change y change y y minus one okay and then okay so we're gonna set this variable so set the key velocity okay to zero here and then the else block will duplicate this and then we'll put one here sorry let me stop that accidentally do that and then we're going to say set the uh on the ground to one so when we touch the ground we'll set it to one and then we need another if condition inside here and then operator and check if it's jumping so we get this jump variable here and equal to one that means it's jumping then we'll set this back to zero okay okay so we're to call this new function that we just made so put it under this checkpoint from detection here and what we're going to do is we're going to use the operator using this we say if the velocity is greater than zero we're gonna call it okay okay so let me test it out so i think i see i start here right so let me go back over here and stop so it drops down see just it stays there so as you can see you can move it you see this kind of slides up to this we're gonna fix that actually so this is not good right we don't want this happening so jumping is good we have no animation yet okay so what we're going to do is we're going to do something here to fix that okay so let's go back to the hitbox okay stop this okay so we're going to move this over here actually we're going to call something for this guy or maybe i'll move this over here so that i can have some more coal later on for this put this back here okay so all my red custom block i put on the right side right except this one i guess this one's on the left but it's okay all right so let's continue this so we'll fix this part here um so we are going to create another variable okay so we're going to create a new variable actually make it called deviation so we're going to check some deviation of the sprite and the and the platform okay okay for this one make sure that you select for this bright only since we don't have a a g in the front right so this is a for this sprite only for the main character sprite okay so let's set this guy here set deviation to zero and then we're gonna use a repeat until here and we are going to be using operator nut or not not or and then we're going to use a knot here and then we're going to use the equal here okay let's zoom this in a little bit okay we're going to check this variable that we just created deviation we can open it up i guess you can see it okay we'll check this equal to let's say five or something doesn't matter just some number of deviation here we're gonna check and then you're gonna check this one um touching ground so it is not or the using the firewall not touching the ground so what we're going to do is we're going to change the y by one all right and then we say change variable change division by one also okay all right so so far this is what we have and then we need another if statement under this so if this is done will come out it will run this code below uh what we're going to put an equal here uh duplicate this put this over here go to 5 and then what we want to do is say change change x i'm going to use an operator and change y let's get both of them then we'll go back to the here we're going to get the minus operator and duplicate this again the minus here so we're gonna use a zero so minus the x speed and put zero here and minus that deviation okay so let's see if it's going to work so let me try it out okay so let's try this out okay so as you can see i can move this sprite jump and you see it doesn't fall through the lot like last time so it doesn't fall through right so it's pretty good pretty good so this is good okay so i think we'll stop here right now uh let me zoom out the code make sure you guys got all the code okay so let's go from the this side so you have the uh start here and then there's custom block here so this is the forever loop running this is the main one that calls other uh code and then these are all the other custom block that we have okay that's the jump control we work on today the check box the check the ground they will hit the ground the movement okay so this is all we have for this and this one is the same we don't have any code yet for this one so next next um video we're gonna make the among us uh animated character to move along with this box so that it looks better so as of right now you know it just cannot move like this you can jump so it looks okay so far like a square right if you're using a square uh and uh not moving then this is fine so you see this it's good it's not moving to the top it's great okay all right this is where we're gonna stop here so i hope you guys like this
