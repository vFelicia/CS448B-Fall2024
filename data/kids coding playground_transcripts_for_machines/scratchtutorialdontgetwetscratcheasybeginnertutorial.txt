so welcome back guys to kids coding playground today i'll be making a game called don't get wet so i'll give you a demonstration of the game and then we'll hop onto the code so you have three lives you try to stay under the rain and try not to get wet by staying under the umbrella and the umbrella will move to random places and you try not to get wet and once all three of your lies lost it's game over so as you can see when when you survive for more than 60 seconds um the sky will turn bright and it will say you win so let's hop on to the video the project so let me start a new project so first we don't need the scratch cat um we will be choosing sprites so i will take this one this is the one i took we can keep him and then we'll need two variables first so we need lives and then we need timer that's to count how how long you've been playing the game then we'll need to get our sprites what else sprites are there yeah we need to get the umbrella i think they got they got rid of the umbrella so okay i'm back as you can see i imported the umbrella sprite right here for my old project they took it out from 3.0 so i'd recommend you download umbrella from online a png so next we'll need to draw some sprites will be needed to draw the um raindrop spray so the raindrop will just paint and use bright i'll just pick a blue bluish color maybe a little lighter and get the circle tool oops i'll do this and then and then erase the corners as you can see i'm trying my best to draw this raindrop which is not very good it's going to group all this make it smaller center okay so that's my raindrop i know it doesn't look very good i'm not very good at scratch art so i can rename it to raindrop okay raindrop and we'll need to get a backdrop so we'll need two backdrops we can take the blue blue sky this one for the winning you know when you win it becomes a blue sky let me just add uh sun i guess in the corner okay so i added some clouds and the sun as the winning screen and now i'll add the rainy backdrop so let's just use backdrop one i can rename it to rain gray i will just make the backdrop gray this a grey color first let me make a ground actually so i need green turn down the brightness a little so this is my rainy backdrop so as you can see this is my rainy backdrop so next we will be working on the backdrop code because the backdrop you will need to do some code so first you want to drag and when clicked when flag clicks switch the backdrop to the rainy backdrop in the beginning then we need a forever loop this is just to detect if you win so forever if then me two if then statements if then timer is equal to 60 or less than six a greater than 60 sorry so this basically means if the time which is one minute is equal or greater than 60 seconds then it will win and broadcast win after this we want to broadcast win so we want the greater than sign timer 60 and we'll need a broadcasting message called win because if you uh beat it under if you beat it in 60 seconds then you win and we need another equal sign we need an or equal and uh greater than sign so if the lives is equal to zero or less than zero so i actually need a less than sign but it's i could have put it on the other side but it's easier to read y is less than zero then we can broadcast a message called lose because you lost after you lose three lives lose so when i receive win you want to switch the backdrop when you receive wind you want to switch the backdrop to blue sky that's uh the sunny backdrop then stop other scripts in the sprite and if it receives game over we can just duplicate this and take out that broadcast lose then stop other scripts in the sprint so next let's work on the player movement so let's go to the player i can actually rename so player so when clicked when i hit a one click block set the live to three because he needs three lives in the beginning of the game forever forever loop if then touching the raindrop then it will change the lives by negative one so minus one life so we'll need another if then we'll need two more if then statements you can just duplicate them put them right here so if then right anita if then arrow is press key so if the right arrow is pressed right arrow is pressed then we will change point in direction of 90 and put this on don't rotate so it won't flip upside down i forgot to do that so point direction of 90 so i'll be facing the right and move 10 steps and if the key left arrow is pressed then i'll do the opposite a point negative 90 degrees point direction of negative 90. negative 90 and move 10 steps so when you receive game over save game over which is lose then stop other scripts in the sprite and you can make them say game over for two seconds game over say game over and then we can duplicate this if we receive the win then we can say you win you win and we need forever reset the timer so it will we need forever set timer to timer so the timer variable will keep on going up we need a forever loop rubber lube set timer timer to the this timer drag it in here okay finally no no we should have the umbrella umbrella and raindrop to go so when clicked we can go to 050 negative 50. 0 exposition and negative 50. there's somewhere in the middle show in the beginning forever wait when they wait pick random one to three seconds or one to five seconds one to three seconds um then it'll glide to two seconds to a random position apply two secs to not a random position but we have to put the pick random glide two seconds to pick random negative two hundred for x position to 200 no this is the wrong one i'm gonna glide pick random negative two hundred two seconds to two hundred which is from right here to right here somewhere around there and negative 50 same y position and then when you receive the win the win then you can hide stop other scripts in the sprite and same thing for the lose same code okay finally we have the raindrop code so when clicked you want to set the size to 10 so be like the size of a raindrop pretty small set the size to 10 percent where is that set size to 10 forever wait wait pick random 0.1 to 0.5 so randomly uh produce a new range drop every 0.1 to 0.5 seconds so pick random 0.5 0.1 to 0.5 so 0.1 to 0.5 so when you create a clone of yourself so let's create a clone so when it starts as a clone we want it to have a forever loop forever if then touching we need two or statements or and another ore so if then touching touching the player touching the raindrop i mean the umbrella or touching touching the color green you have to do that touching this color which is the background so actually we want to take out the outline for this thing because it's it might just disturb the the so like and the raindrop might touch the black because i remember there's one so let's take out the outline for it okay so now the outline is gone so now we'll need another so if it touches that wait 0.01 seconds a slight pause seconds and delete the clone so the raindrop will go away and we need another one i start as a clone go to pick random pick random negative 200 to negative 240 to 240 the x position so somewhere right here to right here so negative 240. to 240 and why 175 so somewhere up here it'll generate somewhere up there 175. then it'll show and forever glide three seconds like three seconds so that's how long it'll take to touch the floor to x to x exposition so the x position of it to a y negative 180 so glide somewhere down there so same thing as these we can just put that right there and put that right there drag it there so then it will be duplicated right here and we can we have to make devin a bit smaller because he's uh really big as you can see making size 50. maybe size size 75 let's make him spawn right there umbrella let's make it size 100 and when i when i did the raindrops i shrunk it so let me make it a bit bigger because 10 is very small let me select the whole thing sorry about that let's group it and make it big again so setting it to 10 it will be actually a bit more visible so as you can see stay under an umbrella and i touch it when i hit i'm gonna kill myself it'll say game over so when you play again i'll make it full screen for you guys so when i win it will say uh you win and probably say that let's see i'll see if it works so the raindrops are a bit hard to see because they're kind of light blue i can you can change the color if you want but i'm just here to show you guys how this works so that's it for the video see it says you win so thank you guys for watching and don't
