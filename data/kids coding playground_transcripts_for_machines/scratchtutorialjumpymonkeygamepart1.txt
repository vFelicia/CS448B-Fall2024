hello everyone welcome back to a kids coding playground channel today we'll be learning a new game called jumpy monkey game so basically this game is that you launched a monkey from here jambavati banana tree and trying to catch some banana so the point of the game is to launch the monkey grab the banana key without hitting the tree and then the game will allow the player to control the angle and the power of the launch by how how how high how how much power you want to launch the monkey after from the way arrow is and you know what degree you want to launch a monkey so the game will keep track of the number banana to be grabbed on the on the screen and when you when the player grab hold of bananas then game in so on it will also she traveled how many time you launched the monkey to kick the bananas so we'll try to get it to the fewest launch possible to get all the bananas we'll be learning these following concept broadcasting a message touching spray of the edge picking random variable sprite and cloning speech to text and using custom sprite how to edit up sprite so this is mobile and scratch so you're not from you with some of this thing maybe you can look at the easier one lessons like beginner intermediate but anyway I will teach some of this to you guys alright so let me go into the begin here so let me demonstrate the game once so as you can see if I click on this Go button it created the bananas on the left side right side of the screen here and I will launch the monkey across and trying to grab the bananas also we added this one this one is like a speech icon where you can make the computer top for you so let's check this output we click on this basically just will say this sentence and we Lopez say descendants me a little bit so let's click on this to play this game you can use up or down arrow keys to control the power of the launch to change the degree of launch use left and right arrow keys try to catch as much bananas as you can like you wanted so as you can see this is the point of the game so once we give you the instruction that I can't disappear so let me you can see the arrows moving from here right I can make it bigger probably easier so you see the monkey I can change the degree I can change the power you can see the power can change here right so let's see let me launch my monkey back here so you see this is channel 2 heart rate I have too much power that Mohican went off the screen a bit so if I come along to correctly you can see the monkeys trying to grab all the bananas we can oops create more power for that so as you can see some monkey kept all the bananas and you will display the message say you win so uh just uh let the player know that you win so there's no more banana to catch and we use for launches to get all the bananas on the for this game so let's get started we'll have to do this game come I'll show you how to do step by step for the skin ok alright so we'll create a new project this is a blank logic so we'll make the game form so what we had is we have a couple sprite right we were using earlier on the scam you can see with the arrow so we don't need the cat we can trash this cat and say arrow okay we have the arrow sprite we'll need the monkey it will tell a little monkey here by changing a little to be skipped up in Anna's okay and then after that we will will have to make the make the banana tree so we don't actually have one or you can just use tree from here right you can't I'm sure you but I don't think any of the tree really match for our game so what we can do is we can get a custom one so what we can do is you can go to like Google wot search search for banana tree PNG cartoon or something sometimes you can select transparent and they gives transparent sometimes they don't even though they said PNG but it's not transparent but uh either way you can say right click and then you can say save this image so as you can see I did it earlier a little bit I did download already just few minutes ago so this and this is same so let's say after you download this image let's say we want to use this banana tree but if you can see this banana tree when we open it it actually will not be correct so let's say I go back to my game Here I am going to upload let's say I upload my my download I thought that won't I downloaded earlier you can see the the banana tree is not transparent right I'm a cup of the monkey and the banana so that's not kind of what we when we want to erase or the background around the tree and leave just the tree so that we couldn't use it for our game so what you can do is we're going to trash this unfortunately in the new scratch 3.0 they don't have that magic wand to erase it so I do have the older version of scratch off line enter and you can download that so for this off line here you can say upload you can upload your PNG file that you just downloaded which is the banana tree as you can see it's covering the cat right so what you can do is go to costume and that's this uh here say remove background so basically you click on this you kind of do this this as you can see you can actually remove or like charcoal slowly you can remove all the background except the banana trees or whatever you want you can just highlight it with the screen thing this little green marker and then after that so you can see you got the banana tree so after that just click on another sprite or something so now you can see the companion tree is not blocking the cat right you can see the cat behind that we removed the background so what you can do is rightclick save it to your local file so it will save it as a you know sprite to basically this is an older version of the sprite right this is a older version of scratch so you can just name it tree okay so we have our tree so what we can do is we can go back to our game so now we can load this tree into our game so you say upload so you can select this now you can see the banana tree is not blocking the banana and the back you can still see the banana in the back and the monkey in the back in the air alright so which is good that's what we kind of mean so now we can start coding our game so before we can continue please like share and subscribe to our Channel so I'm support our channel alright so let's get started now okay so what we need to we can select a background right whatever you like you can do the forest blue sky doesn't matter I guess forest probably won't make sense you can use this let's use this so drastic so we have curiosity you have the pen a tree on the ground right come on the ground mmm let's put them right here so what a monkey here so now let's get started so we will walk on this arrow first so the arrow sprite like we always need something like this I'll get the green flag like green Packers click who won't do something this is basically in the beginning what we need to do when whenever the game runs ok before we begin now only to create some variable first to keep traffic well game first variable we can create a banana so they would this one will keep track of how many banana we have in the game and how many Chrome or banana we want to make we can play an x one call for speed this is how fast the monkey will be falling down next one we can create his launch power this is like how how much power we want to push the monkey moving upward then we create another one launches this will keep track of how many launch the player use so what we can do is some of them we don't need to show up on the screen maybe the fall speed we don't need so we need the bananas maybe show the player how many banana they still have this is the launch power where the player can control the launch power right and then the other one is the number of launches that how many time the player launched the monkey up to grab the bananas okay so we now have all the variable we need we will start working on our game let's go back to the arrow sprite we'll move the arrow sprites um be here with this area then we will set the launch power so by default the launch power will make it ten so this is like this is the power when we're moving the the monkey so we'll use that then we go to here so all tractors in here so this is the location of this arrow I mean you don't have to be exactly so you can move it don't get too close because actually when we have the co for the monkey we don't want the monkey actually touching the edge if it's actually touch the edge here it might be of some problem so better move this arrow a little bit higher here I show you this part of it better so we'll change it a little bit okay so next we'll make the arrow point in direction 45 okay so when we click on this you can make the arrow point that way 45 so next we'll say so we want to make the error code to the front layer so that way we can when we moving the monkey we can see it so in the front leg out in front layers and then look coming to the scroll down a little bit so can select that so go to the front layer so the we are done with the co 40 initially for the for the launch power and then setting the angle for the arrow next we'll go to event select this one you can say select left arrow we'll want to turn one degree to the left you can duplicate this you can say select right arrow this one you have to throw it away you can say turn one degree to the right so now you can control the angle and the degree of your arrow how you want the fire of the monkey now we will use the up arrows similar but not exactly the same so the up arrow will control the power so we select up arrow and we need to condition if then we also need to use a operator basically we don't want the launch power to be too much so they don't want to be like we don't want them to go above you know 20 because it'll be doesn't extend you should all wear so what you can do is keep the operator here you can directly launch power here saying launch power is less than 20 then you will allowed to change it this will change the launch power lunch about they're not selected so you can change it by 0.1 so just a little bit so it can go to like 1000 and 100 or whatever right next we will count duplicate this again here so we'll use this as the down arrow this time we have to say I gotta use the different operator you'll say if the launch power is greater than one then then you get allowed them to change it by negative negative zero point one so let's kind of test this for now we'll say that our weathering in our project we can call it jump p21 already saw the name too so let's start this you can see if I move the left key you can see the left common left coal running and the right whole running move right you can see the arrows turning this cause running I move up you can see my power here is churning right the power here turning so you can see this Co is running so it get to Ted 20 you see I cannot go above 20 right because this this if condition here is he not allowed them to go so I go down so you can see I can call it down all the way to 0.9 so you cannot go down any more so now we are done with the arrow we'll go to the monkey next for the monkey we can drag this in when green flag is clicked or little we set some variable so first we need to reset the launch will result launch to zero basically every time the game start or reset the launch so it doesn't continue what the player last time then we have to set the rotation style hmm so set rotation to style and you can say don't rotate so this is the same as if you clicking on this monkey and you're going over here and you click in this middle button same day then we can say Colton launcher we also can set the size here we can set the size for the monkey and we can set it like maybe 35% and we say you can say go to you say go to the launcher which is our arrow we can rename our arrow to launcher or uses to launch so from here I can do mr. launcher then we'll go back to the monkey we can select Archer what does they what this does is when you click on the green flag or reset the launch you'll set the monkey not to rotate and set the size for monkey and make the monkey go behind this arrow now if I click on the screen green flag you can see the monkeys behind the arrow we can move the road little bit I guess the monkey is pretty small I mean it 35% let me move this out of the way here let's move the arrow down this way and then whole tract is over here to connect this block back yep now it's pretty good the monkeys kind of in the corner here following the launcher so what will we accomplish so far is we got the monkey set up to follow the launcher we still have to work on the code to make the monkey jump off from from the launcher and come a fight fly over the tree and grata banana but we can continue this on the next lesson don't want to create too long lesson kids might get bored so right now we'll stop here for now and we'll continue the second video all right thank you for watching now please subscribe and like our video to support us thank you
