alright guys welcome back to the channel we'll pick up where we have left off with the penguin flip so what we are going to do is we will be putting some sprite into the game what we can do also we will delete this cat but before we do that if you guys have not work on the penguin flip pot one I suggest you to work on that one first and then before you move to this pot so this is a pot pinguin clip be sure to click on like share subscribe and click on this notification bell to receive all the latest update from this channel thank you alright we'll search for the arrow so the arrow sprite we need that and we will also search for our penguin okay so we have the penguin and the arrow will remove the cat will put the penguin somewhere here I change the size make him a little smaller alright okay won't work on the coal for the ice block first so for the ice block we can we are going to keep it around this area so what we need to do is we need to bring this in the when start flat green flag is clicked we want to move the ice block into that area so maybe around here right 39 1 48 dozen still one forehand make a decision okay oops 140 not 1,000 so so when we click the green flame you can see okay so we move the green box here so I will move the block here so we're putting the penguin on top you can move it a little bit if you like and then start green flat okay now what we have to do is we are going to work on the penguins of whether make sure the Penguins in the front of the ice block so cold okay so we need green flap is click okay we will in more to the front so we um we'll make the penguin go in from the ice block here so what we need to go this is what the cold look you see there's no honey attract this up Seco to front layer so now if I run the green flag go run this cone you'll see that wouldn't go on in front of the ice block as you can see is in the ice block also I will define a new block or so that we can reuse this code later on we'll call it move to start okay so this is our custom block we can put multiple cone here and this can be executed over and over again so first we'll say point interaction 90 basically point in the opinion this way Oh set some of our variable getting here game started so water we set this so set the pitch speed to zero we can duplicate this part we can set the V speed to zero so when the game start we move the paint into this area we can set the speed to zero then we can set the size of the penguin or you can change the side here as well you can do it here or you can do it with this code is the same so we're gonna change the size here to 50 now the penguin to some area let's run this again let's run this if you want to run the code and click on it so as you can see the ping got smaller right so we move him like my maybe alright so emotions you can see he moved possession whenever you will the penguin this number change if you just move them and then you can track this in and what we will do is forecast a message some will say no message say get ready so this is getting ready for the penguin to jump alright so so far we got the ice block the cone for the ice block and we've got some other code for the penguin we need to add more okay so we have the penguin code so far now let's let's go on and look into the the high spot iceberg top so we'll go to the iceberg so for this one we'll make him go to this position and throw it didn't matter that much position it is we can we'll change it so we can say at first we can go to this position when it start and we'll part doing one for years also that I will line up with the this block here after that we can say when get ready whoa make a a new event that we are doing earlier with podcast event so we see this event so when I receive get ready we will set the X so basically we're not gonna move the Y we're not gonna move the Y up and down we're only moving the X basically the ice nice book is gonna flow between here and here is a set some position here so we'll move between or set the x our this is cool sorry got the wrong thing so we say set ace or use a random operator so with the box back different location so we'll do 30 and to 200 so so as you can see how you can move your box and see right you go back to the emotion you can see the box so this is XS 13 right so come on you can move you can see this is 35 so so we will try to move the Box between here and maybe 200 it's like right here right all the way to the end yeah right what knife out you on yourself basically from here to here that's what we try and move the box okay so once you have all this set up right you can when you click the green black or Mac to set everything so it's always good to have this set see when I click on this this thing move so now that we have the code for the iceberg now we will walk up the arrow so the arrow is a will try to make the arrow pointing toward the penguin so that the arrow kind of Faja when we move the arrow will try to point what the penguin and also they will follow the mouse okay so let's go here so the arrow will drag this event a little bit so that you guys can see a little bit better so so the first thing we do is buttons to so first they always with the control we're gonna track this for everything here and then we're gonna go to here say go to then you can select the mouse position our mouse pointer basically this this this arrow will follow the mouse now we will go to use another one check this here say point toward so this won't be always coming for the penguin and then you can say turn 180 degree so that's when we start the arrows coming face this way so new can't click on this you see the arrows countries in this way so whenever I move the mouse the arrow is kind of following the mouse by pointing toward the penguin so you're just letting you know that okay the Penguins go this way the pigments going that way all going this way right so that's how it is look more with the arrow so what we're going to do is we'll have to have some kind of event here ok so we will get the ready right you remember we did that for the for the penguin in the beginning when we set it already so same revent so we will show show the arrow when the penguin is standing on the iceberg ice block here before jump and when the sprite is clicked we'll need another event so when the sprite is clicked basically when you come and click the mouse the left key on your mouse this action will appear so what we want to do is we will hide this arrow and then we will or cast a message a new message so necessary you message and we'll say jump so this will broadcast a message jump so we'll go back to the penguin and walk on the coal for the penguin to jump so so far this is what we have for the Harrow sprite alright okay so we'll walk on the penguin when it received the jump we'll have to do something so we're done with this we'll move this over here on this side okay all right okay we won't walk on the jum now so I will say when I receive jump so this is the message that is sent by the sprite when you click this message with what cast jump so when we receive jump the penguin should jump so before we can jump we'll have to do some more ko actually we will actually have to create another block of our code for the penguin to flip so then we can jump so we'll make one more call call penguin look so this wall will define another block of code here we move this to the left a little bit so this is the penguin so we will say so we'll say change change eggs so change X by the H speed so this is like the speed how fast the penguin will be jumping off with a speed and then we will have another one go back to mo motion again you will say change Y okay and then we'll go to the barrier where we can change Y by the piece B so this is how high the pin will be jumping then we say change so we'll say change the V speed this is the variable so this is a penguin X&Y this is the variable that is storing the number so when we changes it will affect the penguin as well so we'll change this change the P speed by negative zero point two so that means making the penguin kind of fall down a little bit when it's jumps up they'll fall down by negative zero point two now set the H speed so setting the HP is a HPD's and you can use the operator multiply this this one okay use the operator so go back to the variable so put the HP so we will trying to get a fraction of the number so kind of make it like x 0.199 so making some kind of small fraction number right so we'll be points zero zero point one two three or something like that the speed so that it helps a little bit of periods so then we will make that print and flip say turn a 15degree so when this thing when this when this thing this Co execute all McTeer will set the x and y of the penguin would based on the speed of the edge speed horizontal speed and vertical speed of the Y and then we'll check that it will make the pin and cannot flip round and round with this all right so we're done with that part so next we'll look on this jump here so jump will be let me back out a little bit none of space so we'll set thee when it whenever jump or set the mouse position and the x position so trying to find the how how far and how high how much the gap is when we're making the jump so go back over here say set so setting that each gap this is a horizontal gap between the the sorted pinger the exposition and the mouse explicitly of where your mouse is which is the arrow also right so we'll say now pigs so this is the exposition was trying to get the operator here what did the this is the x position of the sprite which is the penguin and move the mouse likes X okay you have to go to sensing here okay in sensing it there's something called Mouse Experion use that so mouse Ickes is where your mouse is the x position where the penguin is ad and you can find out that hi the gap between your mouse and the penguin before they jump right so we're going to the purple figure this is the horizontal gap sorry this is a horizontal we do enter the vertical now so go back now we can take the bouquet this we can select the vertical cat here now we use the mouse Y and then we will not use the x position we'll have to use the Y position okay go back over here select the Y position bottom put it here so now we find the horizontal cap which in the mouse where your mouse is and where the Penguins at and the vertical gap where your mouth is height and the penguin okay so we have the gap done so what we need next is we will have to have this control so we will use a repeat until controller loop here so what we hope to do is make them repeat until it's either touching the edge here or here in the bottom or touching this blue so if we touch this little corner blue here in this bike when right so we can do is some wheels use the operator again so whether you use the or statement because there's two condition here so go back to sensing so we need to look for touching the edge so something here should have touching the edge okay I think we have found that it's this one you ought to use this one so touching mouse pointer oops first so we can say touching edge basically meaning is touching this left side here at the top here that here or at the bottom here that's called edge if it's touching the edge or is touching blue color so what we can do is you can click on this we have to get the blue color because since were to color for the glazier here the eyes here we have to make sure you get the whole site or not the inside so we have to say use this pan you can use this pen it can zoom in and then you can select that so you can check make sure you at the same color so we can go back to this here and look at the custom right and then we can click on this this thing and then we can look at here what is the color sixty ninety seventy six right okay now let's go back to the penguin go back to the coal or look at it again so this sixty ninety seventy okay so it's different actually different so they did not get it correctly sometimes they get it correctly sometimes it don't because it's kind of small this this line so what we can do who can just type it in this probably better so go back I just get the right number mission we get the right number I will to select him make sure that so I have 60 90 76 okay we'll go back up in one again so you can type it in 68 New Guinea and 76 so you have to match if it doesn't match it will not touch it so 16 1976 okay alright we got it so hold this in the bottom in the middle put it back in there so now so we say if it's touching the edge or touching blue color which is the spike right of the glacier here then we will be calling this function my block so you call it print let me zoom a little bit cannot see everything so so that will call this code this penguin will be flipping okay and then we will add another one saying if it's touching the color so we will need an if statement here to control put it here so here touching color same thing right we have what 16 90 90 90 76 level of 94 oops then he remind me to change this okay 16 1976 okay alright pendous again and then we just think your pen is not getting exactly some time 60 it's kinda hard to put this Creek my knee and then six okay oops okay so 16 1976 okay now we've got it correctly I'll make sure we'll get it correct 60 why is this keep changing you know what let's make a hundred sixty eight hundred seventy six so let's let's change that 68 on your 76 let's change this thing I think the that sometime is jump back and forward on the Y let's go back to this guy open hundred okay 1676 okay all right okay so we'll go back to the penguin again so 1676 1676 so since our new lines to think that's why sometime that magnifying glass the droplet is not able to pick up okay we got that done so next check the color they're touching this color will all say with the penguin stand up so we'll say change in direction 90 so because the printer is flipping it might be turn right so will it make him stand up so say 90 and then we have to go here saying well the point to the position of the explicity of the iceberg so where to get this one now here so this one you have to select this first okay you may choose like this so select the iceberg first and then you select the exposition so we'll set the fix for the penguin to that position so we say set X to the position of the iceberg exit the penguin whoever is that who was then on top of the iceberg where the iceberg is act and then we say change the score by 10 moving it at 10 points so change change the score by 10 so every time you land on the iceberg will you get 10 points alright so we can play some sound so what we need to do before we add sound let's go in here to add the sound so you get the look up sound here search so we can say dance so we're gonna try to use this one okay this one it's like this this is a chilling dance we'll take that okay we will also probably another one when they jumped into the water and it punches into the water so Oni take this one alright so we're both the bends and punch into the water sound for this job penguin we'll go back to a coal now we'll say if if it plays a sound where I so let her go to a sale you know say start the sound and we can say chill out so when he landed onto the the iceberg it will play this down show up and then the penguin will say some something say like hooray or something so we'll go back to look so you can say hooray so for two seconds and then we say we will move the payment back to the stop basically after landed it done it gonna go back to here so we'll call this coal here so called my Brock check this out and then after that we will say so so after that we'll all will walk on the edges now when it bounced to the edge we also have to stop the scrip so let us say stop this script first for this part so let's go here say stop but we don't want to stop all right you say stop this group so and if it landed here will start to squiggle repeat anymore right so where to stop this and if you're touching the edge we'll have another if condition here put it under here so this is getting a little bit bigger so since it's a little bit more compacts the game so it will get a little bit better with a code so here we'll have to say touching head right so we can copy this now and put it here so this is touching edge don't worry about the payment falling off here we're not done with him okay so touching edge we'll say change life so web library so whether add life also so all together so well says change life by minus 1 right so whatever the life is old minus 1 so we can play the sound and we can say start the sound called lunch all right push on to the water right and then say the penguin will say oops I miss so go back to look here check this out oops okay so now with the move the penguin back right so him yes he land on the water with a moving back so that's why we have Queen this coldcut define right it defined block here so they find your common custom block you can reuse it over and over again without doing the same koyukon right so we're moving back and also we will also have to stop this script as well here okay so so far this is what we have for the penguin okay so okay so we need to add the the life or the penguin so what we can do is we'll go available here so we'll set the life to let's say three or whatever we like your ten doesn't matter so we'll set the line for the penguin then we're going to or not drag another start so we'll actually need another one here and what we can do is we can set the score to 0 or we can put it together I guess we can't do that now let's just put it together let's see so set the score as well whatever we set the score so we set the score 20 so basically when the game start wouldn't in fact quite or we said this fall to zero and then we say we will call this KO again move the penguin to stop basically moving back up into the ice block okay let's test it out so if I click on this start here so as you can see the pink would kind of move back to the base here if I click the start again you can see the ice block is moving right by itself that's basically finding a Posada here like 30 to 200 right that egg so it will kind of move between that area so you can see the iceberg is moving right and you see the Penguins flipping let's try it again okay okay my penguins not really working correctly you see he China just landed it should be going straight right so something's wrong with my coat let me take a look who is wrong so I think I know what the wrong with Mike oh I forgot to set the speed before the penguin wanted jum right when we broadcasted John we found a gap but where to set the speed right so that it will get the correct speed when it called this ping to the skipper speed the edge speed on the beasts feet so I've messed up that I forgot about that so let's grab this over here so we'll set the edge speed here we will use the operator here so what we're going to do is we can take the horizontal cap and we're gonna divide it with some number so can get a fraction of that speed so whatever is that pitch in the position and the mouse whether my way of mouse is what a penguin is at will take that number and then we'll divide it by a is a 25 so we can make it a little bit smaller okay so and then we'll remove this variable here call each gap put it here and we will actually need another one so we can duplicate this so this one will need the speed so we have H speed we each gap we cap expand tweak it with so what delete this one use the V gap yeah so we got a pitch gap divided by 25 be captive I by 25 so we won't find E and now we can reconnect the block back now let's test the game again more save it and run it again so I see see we can see ok good touch it but it did not stand up right I think something's wrong not touching correctly with the color let's try it again let's see every chapter so that one walks I think this color thing is messing up let me try it again I was other part of that I'm look to get into that ice block so it's not walking correctly so the penguin is not standing back right let's see what's going on okay I think I was wrong on my toe I think because of this we can't we have to use this with this dropper to get it correctly so what I did was I go back to the iceberg this one I made it five so uh this this is a little bit bigger now so after we made it a little bit thicker I go back to the coal on my penguin I use this dropper and I use this dropper onto this this thing here so I can get it they know the docker so once I did that this thing started working so I replace this and I replace this so now we will try again so what I can do is when it's touching blue I will also set the penguin to a certain position so that the penguin will always be at that Y position so let's go back to motion here so set Y set wire around as you can see the Penguins 85 so we'll buy to a 75 so that is on top of here so we'll put this here set right here we'll set Y to negative 75 so now if the penguin come on to that it will be all stand up on top of the ice ball I swear okay now let's save it and let's run it again so now let's give it a try we missed so we lost alive so our score still zero so I think this is harder than it looks okay okay come on all right there we go so we made it get 10 points s we can seat so zero life we have to say game over I we haven't done that so as you can see that's why this is not working right so zero life we're still able to play the game so we have to add that code and so what we have to do is we're gonna add it to hear this move our penguin to start so every time we call this more people to start we can check the life here so we say if wouldn't it if else okay we're gonna take this guy out surely we'll put it here so use the operator we can go back in and zoom in a little bit so you can see so what we need to do is we'll check the life so we'll say this so whatever it is greater than greater than zero so go there variable or say life if the life is greater than zero meaning here more than one life then we'll play the get ready broadcast get ready and the penguin will start the go back to this position and start the game house so say what's a game game okay and then we'll have to stop all right since game over I were to stop all we will not allow the penguin to to jump anymore right so we'll say stop now let's try out game again so now let's purposely dying so will jumped off the we jump too far but one life left now we jump off the water so think this game over right so came over you cannot play anymore you see the arrows gone no no more it is thought I can to play so that's what this stop all is for so what we have done so far as let's put on a coal here together so you guys can see so kind of hard you might be hard to see because it's uh it's gonna come up smart so I'll try to zoom in as much as I can so we have the start here the pink and flip this is the custom block that's another custom block right to custom block Dafty fine one of them is moving the penguin to the stop position one of them is making a payment flip and this is the podcast message that is a podcast by this arrow one is one of buttons click with the mouse click this click or podcast this they'll run this code so so far the iceberg is really simple just moving the position the ice block I mean no now the iceberg is a same thing really simple when we have a get ready message we'll have to set the exposition basically moving the iceberg between here and here and then the arrow R is the last part this is where we have the arrow make sure that the arrows are pointing toward the penguin and then is following them house where they move okay alright so that is pretty much for this part or have part 3 where we will have the fish kind of jumped up into the air and we're trying to use the penguin to catch the fish so I know this is a little long so this is all we had hope things for tune in to to see this and hopefully you can also make your own game by watching this video alright please you know what to do please like subscribe and and below thanks for watching alright byebye
