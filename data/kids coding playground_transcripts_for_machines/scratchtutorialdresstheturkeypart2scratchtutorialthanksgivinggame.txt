welcome back guys it's kids coding playground here and today we're back for another video dress the turkey we worked on this yesterday if um yeah we worked on this yesterday i made the first part yesterday so if you haven't watched that you can watch that right now right here so and the last part we coded the turkey the scarf choice and scarf so this is the code for the turkey so feel free to pause if you uh if you um i want to pause it because you don't have all this code and that's all the code for the turkey and i think we can zoom in one more and the scarf choice this is all the code for the scarf choice this is the scarf choice and the scarf last but not least the scar so if you do not have this code if you not have this code so if you do not have this code if you do not have this code then you should code it right now because we're going to work on the second part because this is the second part so feel free to pause again so anyways before i start please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below for what else content you want so anyways let's start on the glasses so um oh yeah before i start i gotta show you something so my rooster which was originally the turkey um as you could see no not you can't see right now but um the rooster it was missing a piece of the leg and the bottom so i drew another piece of leg for the bottom of the leg so because this has like this little uh talon and this doesn't have the talon so i drew the little talon for the rooster as well so so you just have to copy and paste this it's going to ungroup it first and ungroup and then you can just copy and paste this ctrl c ctrl v and then add it on here and then shift it around so yeah that's basically how you do the rooster like if you want so anyways let's get started on the glasses so uh we can delete glasses e because this is like a rabbit so we can delete glasses e and then there's glasses a b and c that we're gonna use so i'm gonna try to use that because i think we could use the rabbit one only if we took out the glasses so uh and then we can just control z this so we can control see this rabbit face no not control z delete that rabbit face and we have the glasses so we could use the glasses and improvise if you want and i just figured out a bug it says glasses e it's supposed to be d because there's four costumes a b c d and it says e so that makes no sense but whatever um let's get on to the code so a b c e not d so let's get started so when the green flag is clicked it will switch costume to glasses b so glasses b is the one that's like this so i wanted to start out with this because i just want to and it'll go to a position i have written down negative 165 positive y88 and it'll go to front layer because it's always in the front because if it's in the back layer it won't be on the turkey's face it'll be on the turkey's back so go to black in front later and then when this sprite is clicked so i'm going to code something and show you this so it will glide one second to x y so i'm gonna show you this so when the one glide one second to so you need the tricky block backdrop of stage duplicate this so i'm going to show you how to use this these types of things so x plus you could change the back um turkey exposition of the turkey and y position of the turkey so this is how you use it so i'm gonna start and as you can see if i click on the glasses it won't be on its eyes and you want the glasses to be on the eyes because no one wears glasses on the tail so we need to be up here so we need to add some things like uh add plus 30 like what we did for the scarf to move it to the so originally it was it would glide over here we need to move it to the left and up so x position minus 35 because if this is the negative side this is the positive side and you want it to move left so i'm gonna do that right now x position minus let's say around 35 because why not and the y position it's plus 45 because you want it to go up a little bit so i'm gonna try plus 45 and see if it works so plus 45 so let's see if this will work definitely i was really lucky for those coordinates so not scripted okay so let's just continue so so you can adjust it if it's not right but that was definitely scripted because i have done this project before so when if then else you know if then else so we're actually going to be coding this so we got to put this in the else because it's on the left so if the direction of turkey of turkey is more than zero which is that includes one two three four five uh et cetera oh not negative so it's up here right side so and i'll glide one second so we can just duplicate this and just change a little bit so glide one second to x position of turkey plus 35 because it's positive so you need a plus let's take third i meant three okay this is scripted so um and then y position plus 45 that's correct and also let's try bam right on the eyes but we haven't done the moving code for it yet so so we're so we're gonna move the chicken to the i mean the rooster to the turkey to the uh right side and the left side so that's where it is so anyways we're gonna coat it to follow the turkey as you can see right there right on the spot and if i moved it like here right on the spot right on the spot so we're going to keep on coating so it will follow the turkey or the rooster no the turkey yeah the turkey uh yeah and it'll go forever if then else then i also duplicate this whole entire block but we're going to change it up a little bit it's an outstanding direction of turkey is less is more than zero that's correct and this forever we do not need and we do not need this or this so we delete all that you know set x to uh x position plus 30. so we can just duplicate that put that in there and then we can duplicate this but then make it nega minus 35 so we can put that right in here wait we don't have that yet so set x to exposition of turkey minus 35 and then we also need this for the end and then also set y instead of x from the bottom not inside to y position a turkey plus 45 so let's try out this project so i have the turkey moving frequently right here all the little movements and if you do not move him he looks at you and bam they're going him he's following him great and then the scarf bam following him change the scarf up yeah and then we're gonna work on the glasses change so the glasses change is quite different from the scarf change so when the when this sprite when the green flag is clicked it will go to a certain position so i'm gonna drag this over here let's say around here let's put it over here then we're going to move the hat up and then we're going to work on that later so the glass is choice and the green flag is clicked it will go to this position and then when the sprite is clicked guess what will happen it will broadcast switch glasses because we did that for the scarf so broadcast switch glasses glasses choice i think we had that for this card uh switch glasses i we have scarf choice we can rename this yeah i'll be r i'll rename that so i'm going to finish the glasses right here so um i'm going to finish the glasses oh so for this part you need a when i receive glasses switch glasses which is basically glasses choice it'll go to the next costume so glasses choice glasses choice glasses choice bunny so that's basically what it is i know that glasses d which basically glasses e is not in the exact position so you gotta copy this paste that and we're gonna adjust it so um we're gonna group all this together because i already grouped and then we're gonna do this and adjust it adjust it a little bit so i'm gonna try adjusting this these glasses i noticed that the glasses weren't completely in the spot we'll see i noticed that the glasses weren't completely over there so we can center it so right in the center oopsies so you put your finger on the screen and then we're gonna move glasses e up so i think i have to group classes e now or b and then move it up a little bit right in the middle directly so i think that's great i think that's good i think we're done with the glasses so that's basically it and then we're gonna work on the hat now or we can just change this to scarf choice or we can we can change that instead of writing a scarf choice we can do switch scarf so because i did scarf choice instead of the other one so switch scarf yeah i don't think you can delete broadcasts but it'll go away later because it's not used so we're gonna use the hat so we're gonna do the hat so the hat so um we're gonna work on the hat now so the hat so when the green flag is clicked it'll switch costume to hat b and it'll go to i have a coordinate already written go to negative 63 positive 145 y you can make it go to a different spot if you want it'll go to the front layer so it'll be in front of everything but it'll go backward one layer so it'll be behind the glasses because i'm pretty sure hats are behind glasses when you wear them because you don't want your glasses to be everywhere and also when the sprite is clicked you need it so let's let's adjust it so glide one second to exposition of turkey turkey exposition turkey y position so glide this way so let's see how where it'll go right here no one wears hats on their bodies only on the head so let's adjust it a little bit so let's adjust it so since i already taught you last time let's just get to it so i'm gonna put a plus x position plus 35 because i already have it written down in a y position plus 70. i think that that would be right on the head let's see that's in the head great so if then else but then son if then the direction of turkey is greater than zero then it will do this else it will go one second so let's delete this save this minus this negative no minus x position minus 28. i already have that written down and this also plus 70. so i'm gonna it doesn't look like it's correct because look at this it's not completely on the head so i'm gonna see if this dude can be a 35 and this to become a 30. let's see if it works now it's working and as you can see when you're removing you click on the hat i'll move where i am and then if i'm on the left side it'll also do the same thing and also let's keep on working so you need a forever as always you need if then else if then else then else the direction of the turkey is more than zero that's correct we don't need this bam bam it'll set x to x position of turkey plus 30. and the other one will set x position of turkey instead it's a set x position minus 35 and else it will set y to y position of turkey plus 70. so that's basically all the code but we have still other code to do like the hat choice the actual should be pretty simple so let's get it ready so when i'm gonna drag it around here so when the green flag is clicked it will go to this position and then when this sprite is clicked the broadcast switch hat and then whenever we're one inch away from finishing when i receive switch hat it will obviously go to the next costume so right there and we just have to add the music so when the green flag is clicked okay it'll go forever and play some music so i think i used dance something i think i used um sitar so put dan satar in here and you're basically done with the game so i'm gonna show you how this works so there we go basically done but i will show you how to make the drop down so let's make the drop down okay so you can always use a drop down because it's always better for your game it always looks better so as you can see on my screen i am painting so a paint and you can just duplic get this jungle so the jungle ctrl c ctrl v and make the drop down so we're going to make that it's precisely almost there and we're going to change it up a little bit like that and this is just the drop down so it's different and it looks like it's a little bent over but we will do that uh we will change that so uh we're also gonna add the turkey so the turkey get the whole entire thing uh ctrl c ctrl ctrl c ctrl v whole entire turkeys here group so you can either face it left or right or looking at you so it'll flip horizontal so you can make it left right left right left right and also you can add like the little decorations to make it look better so the hat you can get any hat you want i'm use the bear hat because it's a bear hat so regroup that and put that on top and then i'll get the glasses you can take this glasses pick any glasses you want you can even use the rabbit glasses and then add them on i'm pretty sure that one's harder to drag and then we can also do the scarfy any scarf you want i'm going to use scarf a because it's scarf a and put the scarf and since he's facing on the left flip horizontal flip horizontal place it right on him so there we go and then the text you can always use text and make it white because why not you can use any um font you want but i'm gonna use curly because curly looks good so yeah uh so i'm gonna do that and make this larger uh so so just the turkey and then we have some code for this because drop downs always look better than the original game so when the green flag is clicked it will go to the middle no not basically the middle but the um coordinate i have will go up x0 y300 i'll hide go forever and reset timer because we're using timer to use it reset timer and when the timer the timer is more than 0.1 then it'll go to this position and i'll go to front later also show and glide 0.5 seconds seconds to x0 y0 so glide down so let's see so i'm gonna do this so as you can see everything is working really well glasses scarf so all of this is working pretty well you can move around and then when you click the stop dress the turkey awesome you can start it all over again and the thumbnail comes down because it's always better for the game always better better for the game please like share
