welcome back guys it's turning playground here and today we're back for another video in scratch and today we'll be talking about scratch's 15th birthday and we made a game all about it so if you don't know scratch's birthday is uh on monday so in a few days so we made this game all about that and this game is just about decorating a cake and thanks for the official scratch cat for the original project so they made a whole entire project because of his 15th birthday so let's just look at our game so there's a little bit music i'm not sure if you can hear it but there's a little bit music you see right here there's a uh 15 candles and and there's a cake and you're supposed to customize the cake so you can click on this button right here and it'll change the color of the cake same with the frosting and you can do that with the candles too and we have a little scratch chat right here dancing and there's the birthday so we actually got this one from this uh official scratch cat game so yeah this is what we have here today so so um this is the official scratch cat animation that they made for the 15th birthday so if you don't if you haven't checked it out go check it out uh so it so the birthday of scratch cat is on may 16th which is on monday so yeah so let's just remix this project and most of the stuff we do not need here so like you we do not need this we don't need this we don't need this we don't need this we don't need this and we don't need this so now we're just left with these two so and we don't broadcast any ready so let's just delete that we're gonna put this on the bottom here and we're gonna shrink the size to 60. we're also going to change the go to because now it's a different go to make it let's do a little bit higher because we need to put the buttons down there so let's go to that and point direction there i'm just going to pull out the hide here so now we're going to change out the music so we don't need this we don't need this and we're gonna do this we need that actually we don't need this i don't need this so we put this over here and this is switching part to end we switch it back up to end which is this one and we play sound this until done and we'll delete the shadow so now let's get the candles and the table out of the backdrop so let's actually keep the shadow on the cat so we can actually do that so we have our shadow here we just align it perfectly to where his feet are or we can just do this yes just put it under his feet make it go back and same with the other dance movement so down here and we go back so we have a shadow for our scratch cat so now let's get the table out of the backdrop and into different sprites so we go to the backdrop so let's get the sprite so first we control x so we cut it and then we paint a new sprite you ctrl v and it's over here and now we just drag it and we have to do that ungroup and then click out pull this out and now we have our table here and we put it over there so we have our cake and we have to control x so we cut it and then we paint a new sprite ctrl v and we have our cake over here so we don't need the cake here so we're just gonna do that and we're gonna ungroup it and we're gonna delete that and we have the 15 which is which are the candles so we're going to move to 15 center it and then we're going to get the candles the candle fire because the fire doesn't look big enough so we're gonna get a cake and then we're gonna go to costumes and we're gonna get this fire we're gonna control c and then we're gonna go control v so there's a bigger fire on the candles and then there's a little uh inside the fire type of thing inside the fire thing we kind of missed it this little white thing so we have to copy that we paste it we bring it out we delete the candlestick and we get the candle fire ctrl c drag it back into here delete that control v put it on the make it larger and then put it on the candle and then we control v and control c this one because we enlarged it and then we put it on the 15. so now we got our 15 candles so so now we're just gonna adjust it a little bit and now it looks good so what we need to do next is group it all together and drag it in the middle so we have our cake here we're gonna delete the fire and we have to delete all these candles because we're not gonna use them and we're gonna delete these one by one over here these little extra texture for the candles and now we're going to get the frosting so we're going to ungroup all of this we're actually going to get the cake first because it's easier then we get ctrl c ctrl x and then we'll get the frosting from there and then since we used control x we paint a new sprite and we control v and then our cake appears here and we name this cake we can name the frosting frosting we name this frosting and we're going to delete cake b so now we have our frosting and cake we're good to go so now i have a button so let's drag that in we're going to get a button here if it's going to load so there we have the button so you see each of them we have a cake frosting and our candles so a background is just a white uh circle with the outline of black and our frosting we just duplicate it in but it gets very thick so we have actually have to change the thickness of the sprinkles and the frosting so you see over here ctrl c we go over here ctrl v and you see it's very big compared to the circle you shrink it the more we shrink it the more thicker it looks so we're actually going to change the thickness to a maybe two so now we have two thickness and we can just drag it easily in but we just decided to delete the dish because it looked a little bit better without the dish so you see here we have that done so the frosting is a little bit more complicated so we're gonna go to the frosting we're going to ctrl c ctrl v into our sprite and you see this is very big compared to the thing like just like the cake and now we have to shrink it all the way down to this size and the sprinkles look really thick so this is not good so we actually have to change the thickness so let's so let's change the thickness of the outline so we're gonna change that to two and now we have that two and we just change every sprinkle so we hold shift and then we can select multiple at a time and making this oh i actually messed it up doing this makes it a little bit more easier for us to change the thickness i'm just showing you examples so you and now we can change all of them at once and now they're a little bit less thick that's how we did it for the frosting yeah just like that yeah and some of them are still pretty thick because we haven't changed that yet so yeah that's what we have for that and now we have the candle so we decided to use the scratch one they had for 15 so we just go click on this 15 control c this we control v this and it's just a little bit big so we just shrink it and yeah so you can always decrease the thickness of these little fire pieces in the one so yeah now from three we can maybe do two or one so we have that and this well i think we can keep that we just click that and click it again and we switch to and now we can take out the other now we can just group all of these or we can change these but let's just group that and shrink it so that'll be our substitute 15 instead of this one so let's delete that and let's let's make it a little bit larger and let's put it in there yep and now we have our 15 for our candles so let's get coding so let's do the code for the buttons so when the green flag is clicked let's zoom in a little bit the green flag is clicked it'll go to the front layer it'll switch costume to costume one which is the first costume and we'll go to this position it'll create clone of myself so you'll make three clones of the sprite so when i start as the clone it'll go to the front layer because what if it goes in the back doesn't look good go to the front layer and i'll switch costume to costume number plus one so it gets it just goes up by one costume each time we need the operator costume number plus one now change x by 75 each time so each costume will be separated by each other 75 and you need if then so if then not so we need not if then not equals any costume number equals three then it will create clone of myself and when the sprite is clicked if then oh yes what's this if then the costume number is equal to one which is the cake costume number is equal to one costume number then it will broadcast cake color and that will change the cake color so first broadcast make a new broadcast message cake color and now all we have to do is just do we can duplicate this thing and then if costume number equals two it's frosting color this time so just make a new message frosting and we duplicate that and if the costume number is three then we can do candle color so now we have that so so uh now let's get more let's just go to the table so now let's just run the game so you can see and you see i'm dancing you see the buttons so let's work on the table so let's see let's drag the table down here so and let's increase the size of the table to maybe 125. let's actually move here and now we have that we just drag the cake on the table so it's the cake when the green flag is clicked it'll go to this position and then when i receive cake color then it will change color effect by pick random one to 300 so there's a lot of different colors you can choose from and now let's see if it works so you see the cake color is changing so now let's just do the frosting color so when the green flag is clicked we have to make it go to the cake so it's right on top of the cake so we're going to go to the cake and then when i receive frosting color then it will change color effect by pick random one to 300 so let's see if this works so you see oh yeah we also have to make it go to the front layer so let's do that right now yeah so now it's in front and we can change both colors so now let's do the candles so we might have to actually make it go backward one layer because we want the candles to go in front so we just put go backward from there we have our candles here so when the green flag is clicked it will go to about here just make it go here go to here now when i receive candle color it will change color effect like the other ones i'm also going to add go different layers because we always want the candles to be in front let's run the game so it looks like the flame is actually changing colors and we do not want that to happen because who wants blue flames or purple flames so all we have to do is duplicate this 15 and then we just throw this away and then we just delete both of these and now we have our flames and we can delete the flames over here so yeah we have that so if the 15 appears to be behind your frosting to just click on it and drag it a little bit and then restart it and it will be fine so right now let's look at our game here scratch guy is dancing it says birthday uh and we have our cake and our table here we can change the color and we made the flame thing so now the flame doesn't change color and now we can make our dream cake so so please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below uh if you're going to celebrate scratch's birthday because i i definitely am so yeah anyway see you guys next time you
