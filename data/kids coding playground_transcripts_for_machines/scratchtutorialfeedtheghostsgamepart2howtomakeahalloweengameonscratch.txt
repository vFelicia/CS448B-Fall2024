welcome back guys it's kidscodingplayground here and today we're back for another video this is part two of feed the ghost so um i already renamed it to feed the ghost teaching because i will teach you guys this and a bullseye um if you do not have this code you can just copy this it's just making it glide around the moon um you feel free to pause if you need it clouds this should be simple enough too you can pause this too and um yeah so but it's just going up and down and up and down and up and down so it's for extra detail and ghost we also worked on this it's gonna make it fly around and it's gonna make a clone and it's gonna make five clones of itself and it's gonna hide the real sprite and it's gonna be flying all around the backdrop so yeah before i start please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below for what else content you want so anyways let's get started on the candy this has a lot of code in it so yeah so when the green flag is clicked it will set candy to 20 you can you can set how much candy you want like you can set like 100 if you want or if yeah or and then set score to zero and also it'll go to the front layer because uh it'll be in front of the ghost when you feed them so go different layer where's that right here and go backward one later you'll also set size to 50 it's already at 50 right now um i actually said 26 i don't know why and um go to x i i have coordinates 0 negative 40 140 and then no show and then i'll also demo a part of this so what green flag is clicked but forever turn 15 degrees this side so it will look better i guess so here's the forever right here so to see if it goes flying all around both sides everywhere candy's spinning spinning spinning okay so yeah let's just work on getting the candy launched so when i receive space um when the space he's pressed if then you need if that statement if then an and operator if then the candy is greater than zero and the score is not 10 so you need not score equals 10. so yeah and then it will broadcast a new message and wait shoot and also we'll be working on the sound effects this part is optional but if you want it that's fine when i receive shoot so there's some things already have it bite ratio high whoosh you can get them from all from this sprite library prairie like highways for example there's highways right here and crazy laugh right here and also bite so yeah you can get all of them from the sprite library so when i receive shoot it will start sound high loose yeah so we're gonna work on some other things like when i receive shoot repeat 12 times and then it'll get smaller and smaller like you threw it away so change size by minus one minus two and also when i receive shoot it will change when i receive shoot it will change candy by minus one you lost the candy and it will glide it will glide 0.5 seconds to where the bullseye is so so it's x and y so glide to where the bullseye is bullseye x and y it's right here and it can be and then if then else statement it's touching the ghost it will broadcast hit ghost so you gotta make a new broadcast broadcast and wait hit ghost it goes and else you miss so basically it will say set miss to y and y stands for yes that means you've missed and it'll broadcast and wait again and you gotta make a new broadcast message miss okay so we're gonna work on some sound effects like when i receive hit ghost i'll start sound bite because you hit the ghost with the candy and it will eat the candy so start sound bite and also when you miss it will make the crazy laugh yeah so we have some other code to do so when i receive what i receive hit ghost or wait 0.5 seconds 0.5 seconds and then you need if then statement if then the score equals 10. squared equals 10 and then it will broadcast what the broadcast win so i have it right here one in weight broadcast winning wait another if then statement if then the candy in the end the candy equals zero and not the score equals 10 you basically lose so yeah and also broadcast lose and wait so you gotta make a new one broadcast lose and wait so yeah we also have some other code for us to do and so when i receive hit ghost it will change score by one so change score by one and say got it for 0.5 seconds it'll hide and wait 0.5 seconds also set size to 50 so it will become 50 because once you throw the candy it will um shrink and we want it to be 50 again so it will set size to 50. and also go to the coordinate i have and show and also we have some a little bit more code to do like when i receive when i receive miss it will wait 0.5 seconds and you need if then statement if then the candy equals zero if the candy equals zero then it will broadcast lose and wait i just lose and wait and then when i receive miss it will say missed for 0.5 seconds again and it will hide and then it'll wait 0.5 seconds so we're almost done with this code and also i'll set size to fit i'll go to my written coordinate down and it'll show show and it will set mist to a so the mist the set mist to end means that if you miss it you have to reset the variable or every single time it will miss so we'll also be working on the banner i also have this dude so it is v10 goes to win win and loss so i'm going to demo the game before i do this code so as you can see it's working the bull's eye is going everywhere and the candy is spinning around there's ghosts flying everywhere and as you can see it goes where the bullseye is so yeah we will be um working on the banner next so i have all the costumes here the start win and lose so yeah start win lose so you have to make these so when the green flag is clicked it will go to x 0 6 yet this is the coordinate it'll go to the front layer so go in front of the ghost and the candies you know switch costume to start you start because start is the v10 goes to win and then it'll show wait one second so you can read it then then hide so yeah so you can feel free to pause whenever you want to and yeah so when i receive one win it'll switch costume to one and uh it will show and it will stop everything the second block is really similar to um the second block when you loose is really similar you just have to change up some things so i'm just gonna so you just have to right click here and not add comment not delete block duplicate and then you go here and then when i receive lose instead let's switch costume to the losing one will show and stop all so i can review this again so start as feed 10 goes to win win one lose you lose and yeah so i'm gonna just um demo the game so as you can see it says speed 10 goes to win a bunch of ghosts flying everywhere there's actually five of them and then um you throw the candy and it says missed and then it says got it then you throw it again it goes where the bull's eye is so your candy's going down each time you throw the candy right here see it works so i'm i'm sure the wind function also works too so to speed up the process for you guys so we sped up the process for you guys i have five more candies left and i hope i can win here so yeah i'm gonna try to win here um i'm waiting for the bullseye to hit a ghost and got it and the you win function works too so as you can see so please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below for what else content you want so anyways see you guys you
