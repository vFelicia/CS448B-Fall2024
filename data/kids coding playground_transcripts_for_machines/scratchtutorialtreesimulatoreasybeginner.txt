welcome back guys as kids coding click on here and today we're gonna work on another video called tree simulator so this is another um game which is simply easy really easy so in this tree simulator game today today in this tutorial we are learning these concepts and scratch cloning loops and one stage clicked so this is a setup you can use that right here and set up the trees backdrop okay so since it's a game I'm gonna show you the demo as you can see you can plant trees wherever and then it's a pic random reason also pick random size and it dies later and it falls down that's basically the game so let's make a new project so it's fairly easy let's get the tree sprite so we can tree what tree one and we also got please so the background we also need we can change the backdrop we can use for us cuz it's dinner and like a forest yeah because that's where all the trees are so the backdrop has to have code the backdrop is when the stage is clicked cuz that's where you just want the tree wherever you go and then you need it if then else statement because it's a pic random it will you need to eat balls right here pick random one to two so cuz there's only two trees so when I create the clone of if it's number one it creates a clone of tree one else so create the clone of trees or tree so tree wanted tree to have the same code so lips when you always start out with a thing I'm gonna make a hide and then when I start as a clone that's when they start on the spawning it will show it'll go to wherever your mouse is so it's actually go to X Mouse X because that's where your mouse is and mouse why because it's a right where your analysis of where you click so we can set the size to 10% because it's really big right now well P we need a repeat I'll repeat this thing will tell you it'll pick random the size so LLL be pick random size from 5 to 10 so the 5 and 10 is to repeat number of times of how big it's gonna be so you need to change size by 10 10 and then you're gonna let's make it wait 5 seconds and we can make it repeat 9 times so this is what it dies so we can make it repeat 9 times and turn display if I 10 degrees you can do a 90 degrees but it looks less animated so we can use that so it's really simple so we can save now we can also change the name 3 and we can find out let's try it out you also have to duplicate this to the other tree or just basically you're just I think it's actually too big so we can take this dollar tree and this to the other tree open doesn't have it okay we can put this right here there it goes so I'll pick random it's just the same code then CD just grows random trees I found a buck inside the code so actually I forgot to change this it's actually supposed to be one because all the times they'll be on a certain type of trees but now it'll be all different types of trees in all different sizes so as you can see they flip over when they die and that's how you make it thank you for watching this and please like share and subscribe goodbye
