so welcome back guys to the eighth and final part for the two player fighting game so we are finally finished with the game we just have to add some minor tweaks to it so today uh there's a bug in the game so when you killed the player and you press the up or w key it would uh jump it would like go to a jump costume so we added this if then statement so if the player one is dead is equal to n then we put this in here i did it for player one already but i'll demonstrate it in player two later i'll just drag through the code for a little bit so let me explain a little bit more about this so basically this means when the player is not dead they know allow it to jump but if it is dead then it'll become the tombstone so i'm going to drag through the code so you guys look through if you haven't copied some of it down so this is the um remember this is the collision of the bullet this is the attack this is the starting again this is the uh allow it to fall this is to run running control and then we have the we have the p1 is dead so that's pretty much all the code for the player one player two is similar so i'm going to drag through this is if it got hit the attacking attacking attacking uh this is the starting game start again if you want more information you can check out my scratch account it's in the about section of our channel if you want more info about us so that's it for the player 2. so i forgot to add this for the platforms in the previous video that's why the background is blue blue sky my name is the graveyard background so don't forget to add this so this one flag click do you just want to set the x and y position of it go to the front layer go backwards 10 layers so go behind the buttons and switch custom to custom one which is the regular backdrop so if you have not added it please add this so your game will function correctly and then next you have the magic gem gem is pretty much the same thing from the last video the begin button so remember we have to set all our variables in the beginning i don't think i set the player 2 in the last video i just realized that so you want to set both their hp's right here back to 100 and next you want to go to the character 1 is what we had and remember to add the start game you want hide same thing for this one start gaming hide same thing pretty much the same thing p1hp bar this is what we had this is the p2 health bar p2 health the bullet the kunai these are the projectiles the background button the desert background button the graveyard select button and the force field so that's all we had from last video so i'm going to add that um statement so when it's dead it cannot jump so i'll go i'm gonna show you guys how it worked so i'm just gonna select this and let me just kill this girl so as you can see when i kill it and you jump it will end up like in a jumping position we do not want that so we gotta add the if then statement as you can see from here and then jump control right here we're gonna add an ifthen statement so if the p1 dead p2 dead this is player 2. so if the p2 dead player 2 dead then is equal to n which is no then it'll allow it to jump else it will not so next i'll show you guys so i'm gonna run it again to show you guys how it worked so i'm gonna kill the adventure girl real quick now when you jump now when you jump is not switching the costume so it's working so now let's work so today we'll be working on a um a winning and losing screen so we also want to add this for player one let's go to here the p1 dead we want to broadcast we want to wait two seconds so the winner can celebrate a little bit before switching the costume and we can broadcast a message called p player one player win player win so we do player win and we can add another when i receive start screen we want to hide hide so we want to do the exact same thing for player two player two we do the same thing just go here wait two seconds let them celebrate a little bit then we can broadcast the message the p player when we're here player win i'm going to receive start screen now next we want to hide so basically this player win broadcast we're going to make let them start over at the beginning screen again so they don't have to keep on clicking the green flag over and over again because that's annoying we just want to make it easier for them so we're gonna i have this player win thing so if you haven't done it just make two costumes i just wrote player one wins duplicated it made player two wins made it just a different color that's all you have to do so first we're going to get one flat clicked and zoom in uh we wanted to go to zero zero and then we wanted to hide in the beginning when i receive start screen start screen then we want to hide when it receives the player win when i receive player win we can go to the front layer so show in front of everything and get an if else statement so if p2 is dead is equal to yes so that means if the player two is dead if the player two is dead then we can switch costume to costume one notifying that the player one has one as you can see player one wins is the first costume and else we can switch costume to the second one which is the player two wins we can get a show under here so let a show wait three seconds just give it a little pause and then we broadcast start screen again so it'll go back to the start screen so start screen right here oops start okay so that's it for the player winning and for the four buttons like these four character select buttons we're also going to add something we're going to add if when i receive the start screen when i receive start screen then we can switch costume to costume one so once the game resets again we'll switch it reset it back to the first costume and then we can show so we can just it's basically running this starting again so we can just drag and drop this into the four buttons it'll be the same thing for all of the characters so let me just move it out and we're done with the four buttons so for the four hp bars these four things we want to get when i receive start screen start screen you want to hide basically the one fly clicked but just get the start screen to make it hide and then we just drag and drop it into the four health bars and the hp let me just check if we have it so we have over here we have it for here we have over here yeah we have it for here so we have it all done and i think i forgot to add one flag hide right here so let me just hide it so so i just got my brother here so we can demo the game once again hi so let's go full screen and play it okay so which side do you want i'll be wasd okay i'll be arrow keys then okay so which map it's fine any is fine okay i'll check the wild west one which one uh ninja ninja ninja i'll take the uh okay so as you can see we this is much more enhanced than before no let me get this no sometimes that happens like that and then you can celebrate and then it says player two wins and then it goes back to normal so let's play it again let's try the graveyard map this time so now let's um i'll play the treasure hunter you can play the dragon okay so and you can still slide okay you're about to die huh so that's how the game works i can celebrate foreign i hope you guys enjoyed making this game with us the two player fighting game
