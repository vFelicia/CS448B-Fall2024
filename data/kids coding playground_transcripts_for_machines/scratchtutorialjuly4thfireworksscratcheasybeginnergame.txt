hey guys with kids coding playground here and today we're back for another video since tomorrow is July 4th we will be making a firework display in scratch the player can click anywhere on the screen and a rocket shoot up in the sky and explode into a nice firework display you can find this game idea in the book called coding projects and stress you check out that book that's pretty cool you know so check out the really cool games so July 4th fireworks we're gonna be learning these following concepts in scratch broadcasting messages customs rights timer loops color effects and variable for this sprite only so I'm going to show you the demo for the game let's make the floor larger and you can see you start out with um oh we threw this backdrop and we also drew the rocket and it has like a this shoots out and it has a bunch of colors you're ugly the rockefeller okay so let's get straight into the game before I start please like share and subscribe to our YouTube channel and comments in the cops comment section below to see what games you want to come out so let's make a new project as you can see there's a scratch cat in the beginning always so we can delete that sprite you don't need it you can um you can choose your backdrop you can choose your backdrop you can do like a cine backdrop like yeah these backdrops are a lot we drew one right here so as you can see there it is we drew this one so you can also find some fireworks um there's some Google searches and fireworks you can look at their PNG as you can see right here there's a bunch of you can search up rocket firework PNG there's a bunch of things you can use and you can click on the tools button you can click on transparent so to show you all the transparent uh fireworks that are extra transparent because some are not friends parent so anyways um let's get back to the game we can just rename this first to July or and we lose all let's take all my all my stuff let's open the backpack so I have I already have a sprite I redrew this sprite the rocket sprite and we also have to make this Sparkle sprite I already have one we can paint one so I'm gonna paint uh I'm gonna paint one show you a demonstration as using you can use any color you want but I'm gonna use green so let's look oh that's the same color as normally you guys are the outline off and then you're gonna use a circle and then try to make a 5x5 cuz the sparkle is 5 by 5 2 and you can zoom in you can make it smaller or bigger with the as you can see it's 13 10 by 14 so you have to make it 5 by 5 so as you can see you can use the mouse tool make it smaller it's about nine to nine by nine seven by seven six five six five by five as you can see we already have one up I already have one in my backpack I'm actually gonna use this sprite name it sparkles you can delete this one so I'm gonna use this one cool so we gotta make a bitter bowl and we have to call it speed you gotta click for this sprite only not for all sprites like you would normally do but for this sprite so we are we have our speed speed variable so so we're gonna so as you can see when when you shoot the firework there's just going to be like a glow for like a flash for like but for like a point one seconds so as you can see you can name that two flash can rename it so I'm gonna work on this sparkle sprite first so as you can see the sparkle sprite when it starts I'll always hide always hide beginning it will repeat 300 times it'll create three hundred clones of itself and then a broadcast so we have to work on the rocket the rocket doesn't have that much code so when I receive ready it'll go forever it will wait until wait until the mouse is down so wherever your mouse is it will go through your mouse mouse is down so I know it goes whoo let's take that so negative 180s all the way in the bottom so if lie to your mouse or else if your new mouse of Y or the Y it'll spawn right where your mouse is so we've to do Mouse X though show I'll play sound anytime you want I'm gonna play the sound I already have it I'll play this down go you'll glide to your own wherever your mouse is look like one second like one second it's your mouse X no sex and that's why and knit will high it will broadcast a new message cold bang screw this we also have to remember background visit the flash so when I received bang will switch the backdrop to flash for 0.1 seconds so it needs ear 0.1 seconds so if switch the backdrop to flat for 0.1 seconds it will switch back to the night the backdrop as you can see we do the sparkles gonna make it even cooler so the sparkles so when I receive this is for us when I receive bang um I'll set the speed to pick random 0.12 food so it will pick random how fast the final action that will set ghosts those receptors so goose effect to zero so you can't see it then you need a pen so you got there's some extra blocks you could take like video sentencing Texas Beach translate so a bunch of things you can take but you need pen for this one and you to put the pen at your side put it let's take the pen off right here so you can change the color effect 225 to make it like a glow I know put pan up and then you gotta go to the rocket rocket you know the pen down like it would draw like the lines so you need point indirection no pick random from negative 180 to positive 1 and so again well reset the time where you need the time to make like it looks better so you need to reset timer right here cuz it's always going as you can see if you if I turn on the timer it's always going so I've been playing this for 160 seconds so the timer is always there so I gotta reset the timer each time you shoot up the rocket so repeat 50 times repeat 50 times and it will move speed steps so how quick could be it would change the Y by you need speed not speed 0 you presume right here and by since a timer so you need another repeat 15 me another 150 also has to move speed steps and this repeat 50 is to make the sparkles slow down and disappear so it'll also change the ghost effect it also need a set speed in front the move speed steps speed to divide and I'm multiply speed by you go change the ghost effect first effect I read one day three so it will disappear or it will like fade so that if it does not fade away it will hide and erase everything sure that's a show/hide and erase oh so we're not done with the sparkle sprite yet so let's shred up your that as you can see that pirate doesn't have that much color as usual so let's take out the speed thing so when I receive Bank when I receive bang that will repeat a hundred times hundred times and it will change the color effect by two so let's see let's see you nut so with this has a little bit more color as you can see it's like as you can see it's like making more color than usual as you can see like the sparkles right here are changing color but that's not enough color we can also add when I receive Bang it will set the color effect to kick random negative 100 200 so as all this column around here so I please like share and subscribe like I told you earlier and put in the comment section what you want to see next have a great day everyone and we're done for the day and happy July 4th
