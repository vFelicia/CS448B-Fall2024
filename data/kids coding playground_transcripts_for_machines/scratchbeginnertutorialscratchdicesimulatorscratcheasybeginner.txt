welcome back guys it's kidscodingplayground here and today we're back for another video scratch and today we're making a very simple project called dice simulator so this project um you might want to code if you don't have a dice at home or if you don't have a dice at your disposal and you're playing a board game with your friends and then you don't have a dice right now so then you decide to get on your computer and go under virtual dice dice simulator and um i'm going to show you what this is so let's click on the green flag so just click on green flag you click on tara the person who's uh and this is really cool because it also calculates uh if you don't know math as your strongest subject you click and it goes by a six sided dice so um if you want to make a 12sided dice you can if you want to uh it's pretty simple and uh click on this this is five right so and it says five and then if you're playing a game where you move stuff you move five places well so that's basically what we have for you today so i'm going to create a new project create a new project and um let's name this dice simulator this is a beginner project and um it's beginner so like if you're a beginner just learning scratch you can make this project so yeah delete the scratch cat we never need the scratch cat go to your backpack and get the dice so remember you guys you can go to my shared project and export the sprite and that's how you get the dice and dice one this die one die two and then they're gonna make dice so um go you can go to my project my profile account is gumball0098 and just get on my project and export these two sprites export and then you can download them and make them for your own project so let's put them in such a position and we have a good position set up we're gonna get a backdrop chalkboard you can do any uh backdrop you want but i'm just i'm just going with the chalkboard and i think i use terra i've never used terra we use like nico and all those people uh but we haven't used terra yet so it's interesting to use them so you put them over here and um we're gonna work on tara when the green flag is collect um it'll go to x wherever it is and then it'll switch costume to tara a because we're going to make him talk the thing uh so yeah costume a oh yeah delete costume d this thing is useless and um when this sprite is clicked it will set random one and random one is the first die so random one is the first die so random one nice one same thing so uh you set random one first dice to pick random one to six because if you know a dystic excites but if you're playing a game with 12 sided dice you can change this to 1 to 12. uh and now we have set random 2 oh new variable random 2. two and we do that so the two dice and then we broadcast roll new message and wait and broadcast roll and wait and then say we'll have to go do the die one and die too first so when the green flag is clicked go to the position oh my gosh it's really small i have to zoom in and when i receive roll repeat 20 times uh they'll switch costume to pick random one to six because there's six costumes on this dice one to six and it'll switch costume to random one which is whatever the random uh roll you got now you drag that to die two and you have that we i just have to make some tweaks and then we're done with random two and when the green flag is clicked it'll go to the position it is already at and repeat 20 and instead switch costume to random two because that's the second dice i mean the second die and you go back to tara and we're going to finish up tara right now and when the sprite is clicked broadcast roll and wait and then you'll say whatever random one or two is because what is one say random one what is one uh oh oh yeah you have to have a plus a plus operator first so random one and then you have a random two so we have these two so they'll say whatever plus whatever of these two to make whatever you rolled and now we have to make them talk so when i receive roll let's switch costume to tara and repeat six times this is just an estimated number to make a good type of thing so repeat six we have three costumes so it'll repeat against the same costume twice so we have that and it'll be next costume and we have a wait 0.2 seconds and we are done with the code so um oh yeah one more thing we have to write dice simula in the back this is optional but you know makes it look better and convert to vector this thing use any color you want my favorite color is just blue so i decided to do that and handwriting is my favorite one that fits perfectly oh yes yes but there we go we just have to hide the variables and then we're good we're all set so we go here and variables and bam bam and now we have dice simulator and now let's test it out so green flag is quite terror a see the day simulator you see these two die click on him four and click on him and he does all these costumes to look like he's talking seven and that's ten so we have um this set so please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below whatever games you want so we can make it and you can code it and uh see you guys next time
