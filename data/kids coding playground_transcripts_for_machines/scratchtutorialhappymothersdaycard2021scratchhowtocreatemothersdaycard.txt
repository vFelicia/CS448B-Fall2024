you're doing this in 2022 you can just change this okay so i'm going to demo it to you it's mainly um so i'm just going to show you it real quick so as you can see i play some music i'm going to turn down the volume a little bit so you can hear my voice and then um when it plays that music you can also have flower color which changes his flower and actually i drew this flower actually my dad drew it he drew the flower and um i changed the color i made the color i made the color so here's the rose no tulips and then there's the yellow tulips magenta tulips half um pinkish half magenta half bluish half baby blue um orange pink uh dark purple so there's a bunch of colors for the flowers and there's um half side of half i think that's half baby blue half blue for this flower so there's two types of loud and then there's cyan i mean uh and then there's card color which you can change this yellow purple pink green orange yeah those are all of them and you can type a message on right here so to mom so you can make a virtual card for your mom like this one right here or you can make one in real life but you can also make this scratch project i'm showing you right now and make a nice little card for your mom so i'm gonna write to greatest mom so it says two greatest mom and if you click on the message again you can change the message again so i'm going to type to long this time as you can see it'll change the message automatically or you can do to that and as you can see it changes the message so you basically got the deal and yeah okay so i'd like to shout out um my friend here and his name uh name is one two three four one five and today in this video i'll be showing what he made one of his projects and it's called cells use that full screen at your risk so it's a really good project so as you can see let's look at this so uh you can click on this and there's a bunch of cell stuff like a lot of learning stuff you can learn here it's really fun to learn and you can also zoom out you can zoom in you can zoom in you can zoom out you can zoom in stuff like that and there's also random stuff which you can learn about mitosis and other things that might be coming up in upcoming tests for you guys so as you can see uh i'm just going to go back and start this again and there's that animal cell and there's the all the things of the animal cell so yeah you can zoom in zoom out so so really cool project guys you guys should check it out so one four three four one five please um look at his projects uh and he even has a tank game arena assault game but no one was playing at that time so i couldn't demo that one so anyways um see you when i get back to the project so first things first i gotta change the name to this project to mother's day card because mother's day so yeah we have that done so um first uh if you did not know a backpack you can watch our video in our channel and we also have a bunch of things in our backpack so i'm gonna be dragging these things from my backpack into there but i'll also attempt trying to draw these things so uh also you can also download this from my project i'm gonna delete this right real quick uh so you also you can download all these things from my project or looking on google drive so yeah so first i'm gonna try to paint this it might look a little bit worse because my dad drew the original one and i'm drawing this one so i'm gonna first make the card which is just a simple rectangle um you can do any color you want and yeah you can also change the colors so from this color you can just make a bunch of a variety of colors like orange why not you can make yellow yeah you make blue it doesn't matter what you mean it doesn't matter but you can always make different types of cards because different color is always best so yeah now we're going to work on the flower nevermind since the heart is first i'll work on the hearts this time so first you have to do the heart so there's the tricky part duplicate and then you can add the costumes into it so just get one of these so you can center out the hearts in which way you want so this is the good part so you put the hearts the tricky part as you can see you put the heart you can use the pointer do that ctrl c ctrl v you know the deal and then you put that you make this small put one over there you put that to center where you want your hearts because if you put it in another place it might have looked a little bit different so you need to keep this um card over here so yeah just select that whole thing group it and put it on the bottom so as you can see now the hearts are centered um at least i think their centers and you can also flip them over to make a nice heart card so yeah we have the hearts so you can delete the card now and add on the hearts on your original card so now we're going to work on the flower so i have two types of flowers the rose and the tulip in the sun i don't need i think that's a corn flower i don't know so i don't i don't yeah so so i'm going to trash this sprite because we already have one and trash that as well so now we're going to work on the flour so so now i'm gonna paint it so this is i really like the color context like after after you make those colors colored flowers i like that process so first i'm going to make the thickness of the line 10. so you put that over there and then um you have to make the tulip yeah the tulips the bundle of tubes so you make it five so you can drag that like that so the tulips and as you can see you can put those in the middle and you can also draw the tulip itself and that you can use red or yeah red for now and then we can color it later so first you have to use the outline no outline and then you have to do make a circle it might not look like a tulip at first but when you reshape it it'll look a lot different so as you can see i'm dragging everywhere making the two up smaller bigger wider so yeah as you can see that's the two loop and then you can copy paste this so you move it this way and then copy paste it ctrl c ctrl v and then you can drag it the other way so as you can see i made tulips so you can also color them so i'm gonna do one costume for you guys to see uh a yellow tulip so oh see it's really easy i really like this part because you can make different shades of colors and it looks pretty cool in the end because i made a baby blue and a blue and it kind of looked pretty good in my opinion so now we're going to work on the oxyay daisy the daisy or the corn flour i don't know what it's called but still it's a flower so now we're going to work on the daisy i'm just going to call it the daisy so first you make the daisies middle which is yellow but first you keep the the outline so from the tulip so because that's the uh 10 thickness i'm going to draw another line and make it a little bit higher so as you can see shift so make a straight line because this is a little bit hotter and you can make the leaves and the petals so i'm gonna do the leaves first i'm not sure if i'm gonna do the better i might than my dad or worse but i'm gonna go no outline and then go for the leaves so the leaves sorry i actually dragged to blue so now leaves are always green right no they can be red in other colors like on maple trees and stuff so yeah uh so this leaf reshape pull it out a little bit so it looks like an egg right now like a green egg like a life egg or something from like a dragon game so yeah you just flip over the egg or the leaf now and put it on control see control v and put a second one additionally on the top or on the side you can even it out it's better if you put it uneven because of the you always you know always uh there's always like unevenness in the leaves of flowers like it can go anywhere and also i added it on the tulips because they also have leaves i'm pretty sure and yeah so i'm gonna make the petals but first yeah the petals so i'm trying to reshape it so shift reshape i also have to make the middle of the daisy so as you can see that's a pretty fine pedal in my opinion yeah uh so looks like a sunflower seed actually not that good yeah looks like corn purple corn yeah purple corn yeah it's actually not even that good so yeah you can make it smaller do that flip it and then you can also make the middle of the thing the middle of the daisy a different color just duplicate it and then ctrl c ctrl v i'm adding the corn on the petals guys corn on the stem so yeah we're adding the petals slowly maturely and yeah we'll make it sooner or later and we'll be able to get to the code because it's been 11 minutes and 48 seconds so yeah and i can also make the middle after one more petal on the top yeah this doesn't look as good as the last one looks like some purple corn on the stem with a middle so i'm going to make a middle which is just a yellow middle and then add that on so shift so you can make a pretty nice circle that's even everything so as you can see that is my flower compared to the last one yeah okay so this is what i'm this is all you need and you can just also duplicate the costume to make the color context so you can oh yeah you can make the swap really easy so the swap you can make it two different colors like you can make be creative like you can make a cyan with a light blue almost i like that blue and then you do you can do this and look you're making pretty good pencils see yeah i i like these petals in my opinion because of the color and i just really like it how it is because different color flowers have different petals so i'm just going to delete this sprite for now and i'm in forever and then now i'm going to work on making the buttons so i'm going to make all the buttons i did do a color on it to make it more lively so i use button 3 which is just this button nothing special about it i'm gonna put it over here delete this and i'll use this one because why not and i'm gonna make the flower color so which is just um i did a color color context thing i'm not sure if it's even called colored contacts i just decided to call it that i'll just call it that for now and so i made a dark like a dark maroon on one side and then a light almost red pink i mean light red almost pink so yeah and i'm gonna film this one too so that's what i did for this one and i'm gonna put on the text i use handwriting because handwriting is honestly my favorite and then i'm gonna change the color is handwriting and this must say flower color so now we can shrink it and everything so it will fit in the button and it'll not get off of the button i'll make a little larger yeah this seems good yeah so flower color and you also have to center the button so i'm gonna drag this out and i'm gonna group these two together and drag them to the center and get this thing and drag it into the center oh so go to the front and drag it into the center and there you go flower color and now i gotta work on the other ones so just duplicate and just tweak it a little bit so on this one i used a blue and a white it was just a decision i made i don't know why and i did this and i made this i did a blue like i think almost like a grape blue so i honestly pretty like that one and then there's a white i felt like using a white on this one because so i'ma change it for both of them it looks a little bit unseeable but that's fine and that and then i'm gonna move this when i last did it it didn't look that unseeable but that's fine that's probably because oh yeah i'm just gonna change this to card color oh so because card has less numbers i mean letters in this in the name it will kind of fit and you can kind of see the r so that's card color and then i'll move this under here and now i'm going to make um message so who doesn't like a message to your mom so yeah uh so two mom message and then i made a green color for this thing uh a green like a dark green with a white but i can change it to maybe a magenta because oh i like this one pink rose this one looks nice or this one this one looks pretty nice as well so i'm gonna snazz this up yeah it looks like a flower because this is like the stem and then this is the petals so i honestly like this color so yeah we have it message and let's put this on oh yeah i forgot to change the backdrop to a different color because the backdrop is supposed to be a baby blue and this video is all about colors you're learning about colors guys and so it's just a like a baby blue and just draw a rectangle and there you go so colors colors colors and now uh we have to do the code for all the buttons which is button three is actually this one i should rename this the button one and then this is button two yeah that that works why is it say button four it doesn't matter let's just rename button three so button one is flower button two is card button three is message okay so now we're gonna code in button one so button one is flower color so when the green flag is clicked it will go to x what i have coordinates but i'm not going to use them because this looks great it's it's around the same position anyways and then when this sprite is clicked it will broadcast next flower color it says not that much code but the color really enhances the project so now we're going to work on this one so this is the card color so this and then i just made it go to here why not and then when this sprite is clicked it will broadcast next card color core what is a core anyways so next cod color and now we're going to work on button three which is message i really like this one better than the other message i made so this one when the green flag is clicked it will set the message to mom so you gotta make a new become variable message so yeah and now a while this is really zoomed out i'm going to show you guys up close message to mom and now you gotta go to a position i already have at this position so why not and i'm gonna drag this message over here so when this sprite is clicked maybe up here yeah that one that's a great position so i'm gonna have that right there and then so i'm gonna change this real quick so it says to mom now so you gotta double click that to make that change so he did not know that i learned that yeah so when this writes clicked i'll ask you what is what do you what what would you like to write because what i i have a caps lock on what would you like to write and i'll ask you that as a question because yeah you know set message to join so you need to join um so it'll go to and you remember to put a space do not skip this part put a space so then it would be like that go to and then answer because i'll tell you what they typed because what if you typed to j and you could say join to j that's basically what answer means because it's the what you typed so now we're gonna work on the the uh buttons wait we already did the buttons yeah uh the the flower in the heart i mean the card so first i'm gonna do the card which is just really simple not that hard so when the green flag is clicked they'll go to the back later so it will not disturb and get in front of flower or heart but for the heart so when the green flag is clicked it will go to the back layer and when i receive next card color it will go to next costume and then now if you want to do this one when i receive next color i mean when the green flag is clicked it'll go to back layer and now because oh wait wait no not go not go to back later scrap that and when i rece when i receive next flower color it'll go to next costume so that's what you have for the flower and that we're basically done with this except we have one more step so you can write happy mother's day 2021 well it's if you're watching this in 2022 or 2023 or 2024 or so on you can write happy mother's day 2020 for whatever uh whatever year you're watching this in so happy mother's day new 2021 i'm just going to keep on spacing here and then 20 21. so i'm going to center this real quick and i'm gonna drag this i'll make it a little bit larger i think this is the right size anyways i'm gonna put this on to the middle and i'm gonna put this onto here and we are done so i'm going to show you the whole concept because oh yeah i have the music yeah yeah the music the music yes so when the green flag is clicked go forever you get the deal and then i've done this so many times and uh i actually used emotional music i don't even know what it's called no no i did not use that no i use xylo yeah this was the one i used so yeah so place on xylo one until done and i'm going to show you this project right now so green flag sorry guys it was just three seconds after and i figured out i did go to frontlines i go to back later so sorry guys see you now everything's back i accidentally go to front layer sorry guys after two seconds i was like why isn't this working and then i just looked at the coconuts and i just went to card and i saw it so anyways this is what it is a flower color ah beautiful tulips beautiful eye daisies corn flowers whatever you call it and card color what's your mom's favorite color comment in the comment section below i would really want to see what your mom's favorite color is and you can also add some additional colors if your mom doesn't like any of these colors okay what if your mom's favorite color is blue you can add a blue color for a card and then you can message you can say to the greatest mom yeah you can change this by saying to j i don't know i just that's the first thing i got to
