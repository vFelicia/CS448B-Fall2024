welcome back guys it's kids coding playground here today we will be making a dodge game in scratch so basically you move use your mouse to move the player around the screen and if it touches the edge then you lose or if it touches any of the enemy blocks moving in then you also lose and it's a timer showing how long you survive so i'm going to put a demonstration of the game so um there's like a little countdown at the beginning so use the mouse pointer to move around the player as you can see and then there's blocks go different speeds it's kind of like the same concept in rock blaster how the rocks move towards the player so let's say you touch the edge it'll say game over and the timer will stop let's say you hit an object so we'll i'll hit object and show you what happened as well so as you can see you hit it you'll see game over and also we can actually make this game over sprite go to the front layer i should have done that earlier but we'll add that in the code as we work in this tutorial so without further ado let's start a new project all right so in the new project i'm going to rename the name of the game to dodge game all right i don't really have a name for it right now but i'm just going to call it dodge game delete the scratch cat we don't need it i'm going to draw my own sprite so you we will not be needing to put any sprites for you to download we're just going to be drawing simple objects so i'm just going to draw a really simple um square hold down shift and you'll get a perfect square remember so we gotta center the sprite i'm gonna hold that alt so i can make it a little bit smaller all right perfect so that's the perfect size like a square like that and then we'll rename the sprite to player all right and then we'll make a new sprite called enemies and it's basically just a long red block maybe that long yeah we can shrink it a little as well let's make it a little bit smaller um maybe a little bit bigger actually because that's a little bit too small okay that's better that size is fine okay you guys can um put it any size you want i'm just gonna do this hopefully it's entered yeah it's centered great all right so next so now we have both these sprites the player and the enemy we're gonna start coding inside the hallway oh there's a small dot right here i got a delete that's why it's looking a little bit weird right there so now we have the two sprites i'm gonna rename this red to enemies and red block and then we're gonna start coding inside the player so inside the player we are going to get a one green flag clicked let's zoom in a little when green flag clicked we're going to make the player go to zero zero and hide all right and then after that we're going to so like in the demonstration i showed you guys that in the beginning there's a little countdown so i'm going to make that right now so i'm going to make a new sprite um do text so inside the text we're going to make three four sprites sorry i'm gonna make it some black text i'm gonna make three so it's gonna be like a countdown so i make it bigger about that big that's fine we can maybe a little bit smaller all right and then we can just duplicate this and then and write two and centered and then we duplicate it again and we write one so it's like a countdown before the game starts uh century it's all centered and then we'll duplicate it one more time and then we'll write start start and then center this i'm going to make it a little bit smaller because it's a little bit too big okay that's that's fine so now we have the three costumes let's rename the costumes this is gonna be three there's gonna be two it's gonna be one and this is gonna be start all right so inside the code for this we are going to get a one green flag clicked we are going to show in the beginning we want to show this we wanted to go to the zero zero that origin as well and then after this we wanted to switch costume to three so we wanted to start from the largest number and then go smaller three two one and then start so we're going to do this wait one second and then and then we're gonna switch costume two wait one second and then we're gonna switch the costume to costume one wait one more second and we're going to switch the costume to start remember start and then wait one more second before broadcasting the message start i'm gonna broadcast a message new message name it start and then we're going to hide after it's done all right so with the start thing we're going to go back to the player and inside the player when i receive the start message we're going to show we're going to show the sprite's going to show and then we're going to get a forever loop forever we're going to make this go to the mouse so we're going to go to uh set a set x to mouse x and we're also going to do set y to mouse y so as you can see when you play it there's going to be a countdown three two one start so now it'll follow the mouse pointer as you can see all right and then next we're going to make a new variable we're going to name it timer timer so it's just the timer running in the back so we're going to do a one green flag click set the variable timer to zero set the variable timer to zero and then we're going to get a forever loop so we're going to make it if the player touches the edge then you lose so forever if touching edge in the player then we will broadcast a message called game over and we'll work on it later once we make a game over sprite so game over and after that we're going to receive one more start so when i receive start we're going to reset timer and we're going to forever because the timer keeps on running so when the game starts we want to reset it again so and then after that we're going to forever set the variable timer to the sensing block timer so that's how you make the timer all right so let's save it let's run it so three two one start so as you can see you can move around the timer is running as you can see and when you hit the edge it will broadcast the message game over we'll make a new sprite and it should say game over when you touch the egg and also we can rename this sprite to timer uh it's not really a timer but i just named that for now and then in the enemies a similar concept to the rocks and rock blaster as i said earlier so inside the enemies we're gonna get a one green flag clicked uh we're going to hide and we're going to repeat three times so we're gonna make three clones three and then we're gonna create a clone of myself all right and then when i receive start then we are going to show the sprite over here we're going to show and after showing we're going to go to x 240 which is the um right side the far right like this time and then we're going to make it go to a random y position so we're going to maybe do pick random negative 150 to 150. so i'm pretty sure 150 is the top and negative 150 is the bottom that's the dimension so we're going to make a new variable for this sprite only select for the sprite only because we want the um uh enemies to move at different speeds so we're going to name the speed and for the sprite only and so in here we're going to set the variable speed to we're going to make it pick a random negative 6 to negative 8. so remember we're going to the left so it's supposed to go to negative speed negative six negative eight and then we're gonna repeat until repeat until touching players so if the enemy's touching the player so we're gonna repeat this until touching the player so inside here we're going to do change x by the speed which is pick random negative 6 to plot a negative 8 so we're going to change the x by the variable speed after that we're going to get an if that statement so basically if it touches the left side then we're going to make the blocks go back here to the far right so we're going to do if the x position is less than negative 220 x position less than negative 220 then we will go to back to this position so we can just duplicate this trash all this and put this in all right and if it touches the player down here we're going to broadcast game mover all right and then when i receive game over in the sprite we're going to hide and stop all we can also do that in the player so when i receive game over you can hide it all right so now we're going to make the game over text sprite so i'm going to paint a new sprite um make it red because usually game movers usually associated with the red color so we're going to do game over oops game okay increase the size a little uh shrink it a little it's too big all right that's perfect size i'll keep it like that we're going to rename the sprite to game over and then we're going to go to the code and whenever if i clicked we're going to make the game over sprites go to 00 and hide it and after this we're going to do when i receive game over show since we already stopped all in the enemies then we don't have to stop all here all right and then finally we can add a little music so let's go to sounds i'm just going to pick a random song uh loops oh yeah this one cave is pretty good so i'll keep this one so uh one group my clicks inside the backdrop we're doing this in so we're gonna do a forever loop and put the music all right play this out cave it's hold up all right you can also add a backdrop if you'd like all right so let's turn on the volume a little bit and i can hear the music a little and as you can see around the red blocks come randomly and if you touch a red block then it'll say game over and the timer will stop now i'll touch the edge um i'll show you guys if the touch edge also came over so yeah that's pretty much the tutorial for today a little dodge game so thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share and subscribe and i'll see you guys in the next tutorial bye
