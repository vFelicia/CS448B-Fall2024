welcome back guys it's kids coding playground here today we'll be making a fruit ninja game in scratch so um fruit ninja is probably one of the oldest mobile games there is on the app store um i still remember playing this game as a child so we have recreated it in scratch for you guys to play um so basically it's pretty much like the original one um there's the begin button so you can slice as you can see you slice the begin button you go into the game so you slice the fruits and when you hit a bomb then you lose and um also if you uh let the fruits go then you'll lose lives as you can see you're gonna lose lives and when you lose all three of your lives you will also lose so there's two ways to lose hitting a bomb and also letting three fruits fall so yeah that's pretty much the game we have and then so now let's go start a new project okay so in our new project we're deleting our scratch cat obviously and i have some sprites so we have the lives so these are the x's and we have the fruits and then we have the costumes for the backdrop so we have the this backdrop like the loading the main menu and we have the game screen which is like the cutting board and we just got these images from online on google you can just download your own on google or you can just export it straight from my project i have it shared or you can uh use our google drive but if you don't know how to use your google drive just go to our project and one last reminder for google drive uh don't use your school account and you'll never need to request access for a google drive you'll always be able to use it for sprites okay and then that's it for the sprites and let's go start in the backdrop so in the backdrop we have a few lines of code so let's go to the code so one green flag clicked we are going to once again so we're going to make a new variable we're going to name it score so we'll need to score also um i don't know why the pen is already here um but to get the pen extension you have to click that button down there and click the pen um because i started the game with that so that's why the pen is there um so just remember to click the extensions to get the pen okay and so we're gonna set the score to zero in the beginning and then we're gonna switch the backdrop to the start screen which is our first one this one so we're gonna name it start screen and then we're gonna broadcast the message and we're gonna name it start screen so this is the beginning starting of the game and then uh we're going to go to our so now we are going to get our begin button so we're going to just get the button one use this and then send the costume we're going to use this text i guess whatever and then we're going to write begin so then you can just use the select tool put it right here shrink it a little bit maybe that's the perfect size and then we just copy paste it up there and then we can just oops we can just take this and then we can just use the rotate you hold down the shift so you can get a perfect rotation and put it like that so that you've got yourself a basic begin button and we're going to group it so then it'll all be together the center okay so we have our begin button let's go code in it so inside the code it's just gonna be pretty simple so when green if i click we're going to go to this x and y position i'm going to pick 0 uh negative 120 that's what i had before and then we're going to go to the events when i receive start screen we're going to click the show so in the beginning it's going to show up and then forever it's going to go turn 2 degrees so we're going to make it just basically keep on turning in the beginning so we're going to turn 2 degrees and then if and then uh we're going to get a new sprite so basically um we want it so if you cut like slices it will begin the game so we're going to get a we're just going to like draw a box this is just so we can select the tool use the select tool to select the color so this will be the like the trail of the slice so i guess we can get like some light blue color doesn't really matter or maybe like that like that color that color looks fine um and then we're going to just no outline just draw a regular square hold down shift if you would like center it and there you go you've got the square so we're just going to rename this to the slice and so next we're going to go back to the button and then inside the button we're going to let's hide this right now i actually know we have to show it to select it so um we're going to if touching so we're just gonna use this thing get the color so if it's touching that color then we're going to hide the button because you're basically slicing it and then we're gonna broadcast a message called start game which starts the game so we're going to make a new variable and name it start game start the game and then we're going to stop the script once um you've entered the game so stop the script okay so now we have the begin button let's hide this and obviously we have to click this a green flag and then and right now it will not work obviously because we have to make the trail for the mouse as you can see there is no trail so we have to make the trail so inside the slice let's hop into the slice sprites and then we're going to start coding in here so we're going to have to make two lists just for the sprites one for the slice x and one for the slice y so slice x for the sprite only and slice y for the sprite only as well so basically this will keep track of where the x and y position of the mouse is so it can create a trail so we have the two lists let's get a one green flag clicked so when preflight clicks we are going to delete all of both delete both all of both slice x and slice y and then forever we're going to get a forever loop so if we're going to get an if so if mouse down if you're clicking down mouse down then we're going to add um we're going to add a mouse x to the list so it's going to add mouse x to the slice x list and then we're going to add another one add instead of slice x we're doing slice y so we're going to instead when this is that then we're going to get a mouse y so add mouse y to the list so now when you like mouse down it will add something to the list as you can see it will add as much to the list so yeah basically when you're slicing it will keep track of where your mouse is so it will create another trail okay and then if we're getting another if if um length of slice x is greater than four or not mouse down so we're going to get this or and then so if it's greater than four so we're only going to limit to so it's only going to be four x and y values at a time so we're going to use the greater than so if the length of the length of slice x is greater than four uh or not mouse down then we're gonna delete so basically if you're not mouse down it will also delete so mouse down then we're also going to delete one of both so delete one of slice x and one of slice y so we don't need to make another whole script for this for slice y because we're already doing this so we just delete one from both so as you can see it's empty you click it'll only limit you to four but as you can see when you click randomly the x and y values change and if you let go it will delete so that's what we want we only wanted to limit to four and then we're going to get another one green flag clicked and then we're going to get a hide so when it's in the beginning we're going to hide and then inside the pen remember at the extension we're going to erase all in the beginning and then we're gonna set the pen color to the slice so we're gonna show the slice and select the color and then we're going to set the pen size to six so the slice will be six thickness and i'm gonna make a new my block so we're gonna make it my block we're gonna name it draw slice okay and click okay draw slice and then basically we're to define it so basically it's going to basically like when you like drag it will draw the slice so we're going to just erase all in the beginning if so if the length of slice x is greater than zero so that means there are something inside the list of slice x so we're gonna get a greater than zero if the length of slice x and the slice x is greater than zero then we're going to pen up and then we're going to set the x and y values to the slice x and slice y the item one the first item so wherever they first start dragging it's going to set it to the x and y value so we're going to go to so we're going to go to um item we're going to get the item item 1 of slice x and we're gonna get item one of slice y so we're gonna use the first two and then we're gonna pen down so we're gonna start drawing after that and then we're gonna set the index to two so we're gonna make a new variable we're gonna name it index so basically the index is it'll keep on going up the list through the list um and it'll keep on adding the x and y values so basically f this is index one so we're going to set the index to two because this is the first one setting next to two and then we're going to repeat until the index is greater than slice x and repeat until the index is greater than slice x index is greater than slice x bigger than where it's not length of slice x sorry um that took a while all right so index has to be greater than length of slicex and then we're going to go to we're going to go to the item index of slice x and we're going to go to the item index of slice y so we're going to go to wherever the index is during in the slice x so basically it's going to repeat until the index goes over four and then because we limit it to four so we're gonna go to the item of slice x and item of slice y and reset the index like that and then we're going to change the index by one so you will go through the list change index by one and then we're going to pin up i feel like we're going to pen up uh stop drawing i'm going to pin up and then right here we have to obviously um oops we have to like call this function for it to do something so we're going to use forever control slice all right so now we can play as you can see the y and x values have been changing and now you have like a trail so you can see and when you slice it the begin button hides see that and now you have a simple trail okay so we have our slice let's move on to our fruits so basically in our fruits in the costumes what we did was we got the fruits from the sprite library the bomb bushes from online just downloaded random bomb from online doesn't really matter so all these fruits are from the sprite library and this has to be in order so as you can see one two three four five and then we go back to the apple so you see that go back to the apple banana orange watermelon it has to be in the same order and i'll explain why after okay so just put them in order and basically for the apple what we do is we convert to bitmap and we use this tool like drag so okay let me just like duplicate this to show you so what we do convert to bitmap use this tool and we do that and then we just remove it and maybe like rotate it a little bit and boom now you've got yourself a sliced apple so i think you guys get the idea so basically that's what you do for each one of them um until you get to the last one don't worry about the bomb but just do all of that um it has to be in order just remember that okay and then so basically in the fruits we're going to start with the one group like clicks and green black we're going to hide and we're going to want to receive start game so when you like slice the begin button then you're going to get a forever loop forever wait one second and then we're going to set the number of roots quick random one to four so the maximum amount of fruits you can have on the board is four four or less so we're gonna get a new variable let's make a new variable um and we'll just name it number of fruits and it's for all sprites let's find number of fruits and num number fruit we're going to do pick random one to four and a four and then we're going to repeat the number of times the number of fruits so we're going to repeat the number of fruits and then we're going to set the x position to negative 200 to 200 so we're going to set it to pick a random somewhere on here from like here to here so we're going to set uh the x to pick random negative 200 to 200 and then we're going to set the y to negative 170 so it starts down here so the fruits will start all the way in the bottom and then it will try to like it will come up and then stop at one point and go back down like an upside down parabola so it will go like boom and then it'll go back down so it'll be like that and we're gonna make it some new variables we're gonna name them x velocity so you need to make this with the sprite only so for the sprite line make another one y velocity y velocity for the sprite only as well so we're going to set the x velocity so basically we're going to set x velocity all right so we're going to get a negative one multiplied so the negative one is to make it so let's say the fruits on this side it comes up it's going to end up on the other side to make like a little arch parabola so that's what we want we want it to be like that so we're just going to put the negative 1 in there and then we're going to multiply it so we're going to addition sign multiply addition and then we're getting the x position divided by 50. so what this does is give it a little more variability so let's say you get uh so we could just set so 200 divided by 5 is 4 50 is 4 sorry so we could set this to negative 4 to 4 but we want to make it vary a little bit more so we're going to do the exposition divide by 5. so x position divide by five so we could have some decimals like maybe like a 3.563 or whatever it could be something like that so we just want to make it vary a little bit so it'll be a little bit more randomized you know it'll make the your overall game look better so we're going to do the x position divide by this position divide by 50 and we're going to add it to pick random negative two to two so we're going to add another negative 2 to 2 piconet even give it more variable like vary so vary even more um and then next we're going to put this all into here so we get this one big chunk of code and then we're going to get this set the y velocity and then we're going to set it to pick random 22 to 25 grand 22 to 25 and then we're gonna make another variable we're gonna name it rotation speed so this is how the fruits are gonna rotate and it has to be for the sprite only as well so we're gonna make the fruits rotate as they come up so so we're gonna set rotation speed rotation speed and then we're going to pick random negative three uh to three so it's gonna rotate speed negative three to three we'll have to plug in somewhere later and then we're gonna set the uh random fruit uh we're gonna make another variable just name it random fruits number random fruit number um random fruit number uh will be for this for all sprites actually so you can just keep it for all sprites and then with the random fruit number we're going to set random fruit number and then we're going to make it pick random one to five and then we're gonna switch the costume to random fruit number so basically it'll just switch from one to five so it'll be random fruits every time so we're gonna switch the costume switch costume random fruit number and then we're going to create a clone of myself there we go and next we're going to when to start as a clone so we're going to set our size to 100 because we have a bomb so basically if you cut a bomb will like make the bomb big to make it look explode in your face so that's why we're going to make it set to 100 in the beginning so and then we're going to make it show after that and then repeat until repeat until uh y position is less than negative 170. so you have to repeat until the fruit goes under here so repeat until it's less than so y position is less than negative 170 and we're going to change the y velocity by negative one so it will go down our velocity by negative one and then after that we're going to change the y by y velocity and we're also going to change the x by x velocity change x so the change in x and change in y will be based on the y and x velocity so we're going to get the y velocity and the x velocity right there so now we have both of them and we're going to use the rotation speed now so we're going to make them turn the rotation speed rotation speed and then next we're going to make it so if it's touching the color of the slice so we're going to get if then statement so if if it's touching the color we're going to show this again once again we're going to show it and we're going to select the blue color so if it's touching that's then we're going to get an if else if if a constant number is equal to 5 which is the bomb so if the costume number is equal to the five which is the bomb then we're going to start sound we're gonna make us let's see alien creek yeah we have to start this sound just sounds like this so we're gonna put that in and then we're gonna repeat 10 times so that's where we make it change size and make it like explode in your face repeat 10 times and change the size by 30 so it'll sum sum up to 300 in size so we get that and then we're going to broadcast a message and we're going to name it end game so basically if you cut a bomb then you lose end game and then next if the cost number is less than five meaning you did not slice a bomb so we're gonna get else if inside the l so if positive number is less than five costume number less than five then we are going to start some pop with the pop sound i think everyone has the pops on yeah there it is pop we're gonna use the pop sound and then we're gonna change the score by one change score by one and we're going to switch the costume so yeah this is what why we need it in order so let's say the random fruit is banana so basically we're going to make it so we switch the costume to the costume number plus five so let's say the costume number is two we're gonna plus five one two three four five so we're gonna end up in bananas with the cut so it works for any of them let's say you pick watermelon one two three four five you also end up there so this is why you need an order so we're going to switch the costume switch costume to costume number plus five it'll make it much easier that's why so you make sure to do that that's fine and next we're going to get an if then statement so if the costume number under everything so if cost new number is less than five we can just copy that then we're going to broadcast missed fruit new message i'm gonna name it missed fruit and we're going to delete this clone at the end so basically cost a number less than five any of these and it's not cut at all then we're gonna broadcast missed fruit so i'm gonna zoom out and show you guys the whole code make sure you have all of this pause if you'd like to see all the code okay so we have all the fruits code now let's go on to our lives so our lives basically it's like fruit ninja you know how they have the x's so we have like three blue ones and then when you one fruit falls to the bottom we're gonna make one red two falls to the bottom we get two red and then if all of them fall then all of them some bread so we're going to wanna when i receive start game so let me you start game we're going to switch the costume to three lives which is the first one and we're going to show so in the beginning you'll have all your lives and in the beginning we're going to hide and when i receive start get start screen sorry uh start screen we are also going to hide so start screen we also want to hide it so there we have it and then when i receive mist fruit so if you miss a fruit then we will next costume so it will go to the next costume meaning that you lost life and if the costume number is equal to four meaning that you have no lives left then we're gonna end the game so if costume number is equal to four get the costume number equal to four then we're gonna broadcast endgame all right and then finally we have the white fade background so let's say you lose it'll just fade into white so first let's hide all of these variables and just hide everything for now except for the score and let me hide the list as well we can keep the score okay and you'll hide that okay now we have one more basically it's just a white square we're gonna make it real quick so basically when you lose it'll just show up make the game look much better so we're just gonna draw a white rectangle i guess that just like that white rectangle so when i receive when i receive start screen we're going to hide in the beginning and when i receive end game so when you lose at any point we're going to make it go to the origin which is zero zero and we're going to set the ghost effect to 100 and accept the ghost effect my brightness goes to 100 so ghost effect to 100 and we're going to make it go to the front layer and show so then we're going to show it and then we'll repeat 10 times and then we're gonna decrease the ghost effect until it becomes zero and then you can see it so we're gonna do that and then we're gonna change the ghost effect by negative ten ten times and then we're gonna wait one second and we're gonna start do start screen again so once you die it'll bring you back to the main screen okay okay so i forgot to add one last bit of code here so inside the fruit you have to want to receive end game we're going to stop other scripts in the sprite stop other scripts in the sprite and we're going to delete this clone this part is what when we uh it's basically when you switch when you get to the begin when you slice the begin button it'll switch to another screen the game screen which is this one uh so it's just a cutting board and the other one's like the loading screen i guess like the main menu so we're gonna add that real quick so let's go in here and then right here when we start game when i receive start games when the game is starting then we're going to switch the costume to the game screen so we're going to save the project and we'll go full screen so as you can see start on the fruit ninja main menu so slice the begin button as you can see the fruits pop up and if you have more if you lose all your lives and the game ends i'm also going to slice a bomb that happens then you also lose also we want to change something up here because as you can see when you um like when you lose just the fruits um it doesn't go back to the main menu it just stays on the game screen so what you can do is just switch to take this out and when you broadcast it you'll just do that so if you want to do that that's fine if you want to do either one and right here we're gonna have to do search into the start screen and we have to receive start screen as well and then basically and then we just duplicate this again we also have to keep the old script so we get to start game and the game screen so we also have to keep that so basically this is just so if you want to keep making go back to the main menu after you lose you can it's fine as either way it's still fine so as you can see when you lose you go to the main menu with the fruit ninja and all that so we're missing one last thing which is the high score so we can add high score into this game um it's fairly simple so we're going to make a new variable and we're just going to make it for all sprites cloud variable and we're going to name it my score high score and then with the high score we're going to get an if then statement under here we're going to get if high score is less than uh score so if the high score is less than the score or the score is greater than the high score then we're going to set the high score to the score so we're going to do the high score look right here okay save and let's go so i just say the bomb let's just try again i just want to get some score as you can see when you lose it'll set this your highest score to the uh high score as you can see yeah okay so that's pretty much it thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share and subscribe and ring the notification bell and i'll see you guys in the next video
