welcome back guys it's kid coding playground here and today we're back for another video i know halloween is over but we're making a smash the jackal insurance game with um frank so have you guys went trickortreating lately yesterday yeah we did so yeah comment in the comment section below if you want trickortreating and see how much candy you got to so yeah i hope you guys got a lot of candy but i don't always don't finish my candy well so smash the pumpkin skin smash the pumpkins the objective of this game is to smash the pumpkins click anywhere on the top of the screen to make frank move it to that position and jump down and smash a pumpkin once once player gets 30 points and the player wins the game you can change the point to win higher but for demo we kept at 30 points smash the pumpkins game we'll be learning these following concepts in scratch variables loops broadcast and weight cost some sprite mouse positions x and y and custom block shout out question of the week so we had a community post we'll be posting next week too so we have a few people that were one of the first persons to show us so ahman abhishek single said it was 34 is the correct answer and that is correct and let's try new things with deversh said it's 34 and that's also correct amita gosh uh told us that the correct answer is 35 35 is also correct you can also use 35 35 is also a correct answer so is 34 so they're both correct answers for the unknown so anyways great job on that guys i'm pretty sure all of you guys got that correct and um so if you got uh if you guys wanna you can you guys can comment in the comment section below or you can also comment in our new community posts and you might have a chance of having a shout out so yeah so please like share subscribe and smash the like button like frank is smashing a pumpkin basically so i will be demoing this game so let's full screen and you can see a place on music i just turned down the music there's three jackolanterns and um the backdrop is continuously changing color there's a score on top so i'm gonna click right here and frank comes down and he smashes the pumpkin they're randomized colors and they give you random score so let's break some pumpkins so you can break two at once which is pretty cool in my opinion so yeah so this is a pretty fun game in my opinion so and we won you win yay so you can get your own pumpkin from online or you can download ours in the google drive links in the description so yeah so we have a bunch of costumes for you now we started the project so yeah you have to make a project of course and you have to untitled 31 you that's not a good name so you're gonna name it smash the pumpkins so we will be working on the backdrop first so the backdrop is the easiest so we'll finish this first so i do have some things in my backpack and i will get to that so i think i use forest or woods so it's creepy we can delete the scratch cat that's not useful and so the backdrop when the green flag is clicked it will go forever and play sound a sound that you want so i used a movie too so so mine was a little bit different so as you can see movie 2 is a little bit quicker than mine so i made a slow board one so i in my opinion i think that sounds better but you can make uh your movie too or any sound you want so let's just play movie two until done green flag is clicked we'll clear all graphic effects because um we're going to make the woods change a little bit color so when i when forever it will change color effect by one so let's see how it looks like so it looks really cool it's like slowly changing color like it's like halloween like really creepy so i we will be working on the frank next so frank is actually in the sprite live library so you can go to frank right here he's a little bit too big so i will make him size 50 or maybe 75 that's too small 75 but so when the green flag is clicked i will set score to zero so i have to make a variable called score it'll go to a position so i have coordinates so we can just move it around here but i will type it up so negative 150 and 25 you don't have to copy exactly my coordinates but if you want to you can and point in direction nine remember you can pause whenever you need it so that's great if you need the pause so it'll switch costume to frank a so this is the regular costume frank b we don't really need frank b you can delete it if you want that's optional but and we need frank c in d so switch costume to frank a set rotation style left right so it will not be um turned around so we already have that i think no we don't so let's just click on there too we already have this but you know just for extra protection just in case it doesn't work so let's go forever and you need a if then statement if then the mouse is down because the mouse is clicked basically uh it will glide 0.1 seconds you can make it glide like 10 seconds if you want but but it's just quick so glide 0.1 seconds to mouse x and now it's y so let's just put these two so go to where your mouse is and then they'll broadcast smash and wait i always get that wrong so broadcast smash and wait so we need a broadcast smash and wait because when it smashes down let me finish the animation so you cannot when it's still in this animation you can't just click there and you cannot spam click so that's basically what it does so we also have to do some other things now we're going to do some custom blocks so make a block smash so define smash you know glide 0.3 seconds to mouse x and for the y you need a plus symbol i'll show you just in a minute so i don't have the pumpkin right now so i have it in my backpack so let's just put it right here pumpkin doesn't have any code yet but we will put code for it so and mouse y and you need a plus symbol so you need a you need a um you need so let's write 50 in here first and then you need the y position so the backdrop of stage the tricky block that you cannot change the first one you got to change the second one first and then you can change it to the y position of pumpkin so i'll show you why we need that the plus 50 so when you duplicate this i'm gonna take out i'm gonna duplicate this one first so it says 136 negative 136 and it's way too low but when you do this of negative 86 it'll be more higher because if it was negative 136 would be like around down here but it's like around here uh i can't really drag that one but if you um do negative 86 it's around there so uh yeah um that's great so and then when i receive smash you're not done with this block of code you'll i'll continue with that so when i receive smash then smash and then i'll broadcast a new message smash it was supposed to be broadcast smash and wait so we're gonna take this one out smash the pumpkin i meant smash the pumpkin smash the pumpkin and also uh when i receive smash the pumpkin it will um whatever you smash the pumpkin it will wait 0.2 seconds so make a frank move this is basically making it it'll switch costing to frank c so i'll show you the costumes in a minute and wait 0.2 seconds and we'll switch costume to frank d we'll also wait 0.2 seconds again so we can just duplicate this and it will broadcast start again so broadcasting wait start again and then in the costumes frank a frank c frank d and so um so we also have some other code to do so when i receive start again it will switch costume to frank a now go to negative 150 to 25 so it'll rebound and once you have like here it'll just go back here and you need a then statement if then the score is over 30 then broadcast you win just regular broadcast no wait broadcast new message you win so the rest should be really easy because the um pumpkins are just all all the same just a little bit different code so you're almost done so when i receive you win then stop other scripts in the sprite so stop everything basically in this spread so let's test it jump here costumes go back to the brother we haven't finished the pumpkin yet so we just have to make one pumpkin and just we just have to duplicate it and change things up so we will teach you how to draw your own pumpkin so let's go in pumpkin one costumes so basically it's it's just a circle you have to just reshape it so let's just paint it so a circle it's the outline thickness of three and it's orange in the inside and it's just a big circle you just need some reshape tools and you reshape it to look more like a pumpkin so let's do that right now as you can see it kind of looks like a pumpkin i guess and we just need some lines and we can just draw the triangle nose the triangle eyes the triangle mouth so you just need some lines uh outline is three fill is white so you can make a black if you want i'm not sure if the insides of a pumpkin eye is like white or black but we use white here so um uh so fill completely white oh what we can just duplicate that um that one so just duplicate it ctrl c ctrl v and put the other eye and the nose is almost the same but just um a little smaller and also we need to do the mouth so i'm just trolling the lines right now so i'm gonna learn more lines uh i don't know what to say right now oh yeah and we're done with the mouth so we can just color that white saturation color and also we have to make the top so it's just a circle but that's green and then you just need to reshape it just a little bit so as you can see it's outlined and we have to put it in the back because in the front it looks a little bit worse so put it in the back and you just have to reshape it or you don't have to reshape it just turn it up so we delete this costume and we also have to make the second costume it's just a bunch of broken circles and a smashed pumpkin basically you just have to draw little circles put those the decorations and just um and and just put the stem and draw and reshape them so i'm gonna draw them in the same costume so then i don't have to delete it twice so we just duplicate the eye that we got and put it like on one of the pieces like it's the eye piece that you just smashed off and we can just duplicate this one and duplicate the orange thing and um make it like reshaped a little bit too so this looks like a smashed pumpkin and you can also draw like little lines like a mouth so you can put the mouth basically and we can also make a nose p a nose piece and another eye piece because um he has two eyes and a nose so saturation so you probably get the point so um we can delete this costume now and let's get cody so let's go to pumpkin so when the green flag is clicked it will clear graphic effects so first we actually have to do a my block actually sorry about that and it's called set up define setup and it'll switch costume to costume what i'll change color effect by pick random if i pick random one to 300 you can make one to like a thousand if you want but uh i i picked 300. and it'll go to a position so we this is the recording that we have so uh so later we will get to this and do something about it and we'll tell you so and i'll show and so let's continue off of this green flag so when the green flag is clicked it will clear all graphic effects and so reset the color and it'll set size to 50 because it's a little bit big but we already have it at 50 so it doesn't really matter and then define setup so it will call the setup i mean not fine call the setup here and this will define it and then it will go forever and if then statement if then it's touching frank then it'll break so touching frank and broadcast broken pumpkin one we have three pumpkins so it will be different so gotta make a new one broken okay so it's broadcasting weight so broken pumpkin what and then when i receive broken pumpkin one then i'll change score by a pick random score so change score by one to five pick random and i'll switch costume to number two but it's broken and i'll wait one second hide and when i receive start again then i'll wait one second and just set up again or call set up again and um and when i receive you win then it will switch costume to costume one and stop other scripts in the sprint so basically this is the code we just have to duplicate this so i'll show all the code for this so if you have missed anything feel free to pause or just wait five seconds and then frank if you don't have this code pause whenever you need it and so let's test it out save now so bam bam bam bam it's only one pumpkin right now background changing color music is playing or go wherever you want so the pumpkins will be somewhere around here so um you cannot spam it as you can see i'm trying to click as hard as i can and i'm not spamming it so i can't spam because of the broadcast smash and wait so we'll be also duplicating this but just changing up a little bit code so uh i'll duplicate pumpkin two instead it's broken pumpkin two so we also have to go to x ten because the but we have to make the same as negative 136. if it's for me it's negative 136. you gotta make it the same as pumpkin one for the y and then this is going to be broken pumpkin again two and instead of receiving burgundy one broken pumpkin two and i think that's it so we also have to do pumpkin three so so instead we have to change this to 175 x and instead of broken pumpkin one or broken pumpkin two it's of course broken pumpkin three and we also have to change this to broken pumpkin three so we will add the winning so i have it in my backpack right here it's already centered so you win it's right one so we are almost done inches away so when the green flag is clicked it will hide and when i receive you win then go to zero zero x zero y zero so it's in the middle and we'll go to the front layer so we have that right here and show and also stop everything let's test it so as you can see that gave me random score and i'm trying to break these pumpkins they're changing this works fine right and the backdrop is changing all these colors and uh the music is playing so it's happy halloween guys i'm just gonna eat this game and you win i was over 30. so yeah great so anyways please like like how frank broke the
