so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding playground today is the second part for the rock blaster 2.0 so before i'm going to start i'm going to go through the code a little bit and you guys can put anything you missed so this is the custom block for creating the enemies when it starts as a clone what will it do so this is the code for the aliens and rocks so for the player we just have the movement and just the start game right here and then um today we might as well work in the laser today so let's work on the laser so i have two costumes a single shot and triple shot so i'm gonna make it start on the first costume so i'm gonna start with the one flat clicked um switch costume to a single shot and then i'm going to set the size to 10 so it isn't too big it'll be like a small laser and then i want it to hide in the beginning and then when i when i receive start game when i receive start game then um i want to get a forever loop forever if key spaces press i'm doing i'm doing um the space bar to shoot you guys can do any key one if space key is pressed then i'll create a clone of myself and wait until not key spaces press so what this does is make it so the player cannot spam um cannot hold the space button and then it will keep on shooting really fast so we just put the weight until not key space press so then you have to like manually click the space bar every time you shoot one bullet so and then let me start as a clone when i start as a clone then you want to go to negative 160 as the player go like somewhere right here in the front of the player so negative 116. the player is at negative 180 so you want to go near the front of the player and then you want to get the y position of the player so if you want to do this you have to check this one first player y position so you're going to get the y position of the player and then show repeat until touching the edge so the bullet will keep on moving until it's touching the edge repeat until touching edge and then i want to move ten steps and then delete this clone when it touches the edge okay so now you should be able to shoot at bullets as you can see but the bullets do not kill the aliens yet but you can still shoot as you can see and if i took this out this thing out then you could just spam bullets like this and i didn't want that so definitely remember to put this into your code okay so now let's go back to the um rocks which is basically the aliens and the enemies stuff like that and get an if then statement if touching touching laser then we want to change the money by 100. each enemy you kill you get 100 money you can do it by any amount of money but i'm just gonna do it by 100 and then i'm going to make it go to 240 240 and then pick random negative 150 one negative 150 and 150 for the y position so 240x is like at the edge right here and then negative 150 to 150 y is like from up here to like down there so spawn somewhere randomly from up here to here when it's touching the laser so i'm gonna pick random negative 150 to 150 and then when it's touching the laser i want to make it play the magic spell so i already have it but uh if you don't have it just go to the sound library and get it that's where i got it from so next i will get make the force wheel so for the force field we can we don't have um the shop yet but let's make some variables first so we're going to be making the uh force field via oops caps lock is on force feel uh force fields variable so this is just to keep track of how many force fields there are and then for the force field code actually let's work on the shot first since the force field is uh you need to buy stuff in order to get the force field so i'm gonna go to the shop real quick then uh when fly clicked hide um oh yeah and and we also have to do the pause button i forgot about that uh in order to get to the shop you have to get to the pause button so first i'm gonna work on the pause button forgot about that sorry about that so i'm gonna get a one flat click for this uh pause button and then we'll need to make a new variable called in shop so this is the um just to detect if it's in the shop so when you press p then it will not pause you in the shop so and then the shopping cart will not show up in the shop so let's make a new variable called in shop and we want to set in shop to no setting shop to know for now so we want to set in shop to no because in the beginning the player is not in the shop so we don't always want to set in shop to know and then we want to go to front layer go to the front layer and then we want to hide in the beginning we don't want the pause button showing in the beginning and we want to make it go to the zero zero so it'll be in the center of the screen and then when the keys p is plot pressed key p is pressed because p for pause then if in shop is equal to note that means the player is not in the shop if in shop is equal to no then we want to show that we want to show the pause button letting the player know it's paused and then we want to broadcast a new message called pause game so pause game will basically just pause the game pause okay pause game and then next we want to work on the shopping cart so now let's go to the shopping cart so um we already have the one flag clicked hide so i'm gonna receive pause game for the shopping cart then we want to set the size to zero percent so like come in like it'll like start at zero percent and then it'll get bigger it look like it's like zooming in i guess and then you want to go to the front layer i want to point direction of 90 so the shopping cart is facing the right point direction of 90 and then i want to go to 150 negative 70 i already have these coordinates because it was from my backpack but 150 negative 70 is like somewhere right here and then we want to make a new variable called turn so this is just to make the um the um shopping cart like tilt left and right so we got to make a new variable called turn i'm going to set the turn to zero i already have turn um because i got the certain backpack so i'm just going to delete it because i just made a new one so i'm going to set the turn to zero in the beginning and show and then forever um change the size change size by 50 minus the size divided by three so this is just to make it like when you move your mouse on it it'll get bigger and when you move your mouse off of it it'll get smaller so let's get a division and a subtraction so 50 minus the size of the shop which is 65 size of the shop and then divide it by three and we'll change the size by that and then we want to change the turn by four turn by four and then we want to turn to the right or left turn to the right or left a cosine of turn divided by two so we'll get like a little small number so what cosine is is just make make it a very small number so the cosine ones you have to get the absolute value one click the triangle and cosine of term divided by two um so this is when you put your mouse on it it will kind of like and not you not put your mouse on it then it was just like kind of rotate left and right and then you got an if touching mouse pointer then we want to change the size so if it's touching the mouse pointer we'll change the size bigger else it'll change it smaller right here so we want to get a subtraction and a division the division put in here subtraction in front and then 50 divided by this minus the size divided by three and then next we want to get an ifthen statement so if the in shop is equal to no and you need two ands and so if the if it's not in the shop so if the in shop is equal to no that means the player is not inside the shop then and touching the mouse pointer and mouse down that means it will open the shop and change the in shot to yes so if it's touching the mouse pointer and mouse down so we're doing touching the mouse corner and mouse down so it'll know that it's actually clicking on the button so we're gonna wait until the mouse is down wait until the mouse is down that means the player is clicking then we'll set the in shot to yes letting the pause button know uh player is inside the shot and then we broadcast another message called open shot so this is just to uh call for all of these other buttons so then it will um so then uh call to all these buttons so then it will show up in the shop so i think and then we have one more bit of code right here when i receive open shop hide and stop other scripts in the sprite so then when it's in the shop it'll stop all of this code right here okay stop other scripts in the sprite so i think i'll stop here so that is the shop and uh um and the laser we did that today so i'm just gonna go through the code one last time so if you have anything missing you can put that down right now and with the laser so let's try it out and i forgot one last thing this instead of 50 it should be 75 so then it'll get bigger and i just changed the backdrop to the star in the game but when you're in the shop i'll change to this backdrop but now when you press p it doesn't pause everything yet but now the shop can show up when you click p and then you click on the shop and yeah that's what we have for now as you can see you can move around you can shoot lasers at the enemies and of course the uh rocks and all the aliens don't kill the spaceship yet you press p and you can open the shop but nothing happens yet because we have not done anything to all of these buttons yet so thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share
