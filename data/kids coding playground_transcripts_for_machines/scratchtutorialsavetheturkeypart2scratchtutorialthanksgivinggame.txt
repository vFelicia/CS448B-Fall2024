so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding playground today we'll be finishing up the saving the turkey game so we'll be working on the coin and the baby turkey and the you win sprite today so before we move on i'm just gonna like um go through these two sprites the target and the bat we did in the last video so this is the code for the target and this is the code for the back so i'm gonna scroll up but slowly this and that okay so this is the bat code and today we're working on the coin so let's rename this right to coin and now we're going to work on the coin so let's uh remember we had the variable coin shot so we're going to finally use it right now so that's a detect if the coin's being shot so what the coin is supposed to do is like when you shoot the coin um it's supposed to give you points so we're gonna start in the coin by getting it when green flag is clicked we're gonna get a set the coin shot to zero and then after setting the coin shot to zero get a forever loop if the coin shot is equal to zero that means it's not being shot so queen shot right here queen shot is equal to zero we're going to go to random position and we're gonna switch the costume to pick random one to five since we have five costumes so let me show you real quick so right here one to five costumes we have the one one point coin the two points coin three points coin five points coin and eight points so these different coins can give you different values of score so um we're gonna make this swish costume one to five and then we're gonna show it and after that we're gonna wait two seconds before doing it again so wait two seconds for good measure and then after that we're gonna do something here so let's go to the top um so get a um broadcast message right here when i receive shot fire so this is when you shoot a bullet if the coin shot is equal to zero meaning it is not being shot yet so coin shot equal to zero coin shot right here and then and if if touching if touching mouse pointer and if mouse down if mouse down so if the mouse is on the coin plus clicking it then we will set the coin coin hit uh coin shot to one set the coin shot um coin shot to one i'm sorry not q one and after that you want to broadcast another message we're going to call it hit coin hit hit so and then after broadcasting the message we want to receive it right here so when i received coin hit coin then we're gonna um start a sound so i just got this just play the pop sound i guess start the sound pop hide then get an ifthen statement so if the costume number is equal to one costume number is equal to one so costume number equals to one then we're gonna change the score by one we're going to change it to the appropriate uh costume so the um score what is it right here so score to one you can just duplicate this put it under here if the costume number is equal to 2 we're going to change it we're going to change the score by the appropriate 2 2 score and then let's duplicate all of this again so okay so if the cost number is equal to three then we're going to change the score by three if the cost number is four we're going to change the score by four and then oh we don't have a four i think we have like a five so we have one two three and five so one two three five and eight so after the five we're going to duplicate this one last time to get the eight the costume number equals eight we're gonna change the score by eight so this is the code for the hit coin after that we want to broadcast another message we're gonna name it check the score check school let's name it check the score and after that we want to wait two seconds and then after that we want to broadcast another message called create coin again so you're gonna wait two seconds before creating a new coin create coin again create the coin again so this is the code for the hit coin and then we're gonna receive the message create coin again create coin again we're gonna set the coin shot to zero meaning it is not being shot at so coin shot to zero okay so now we are finished with the coin so now when you shoot the coin you'll get the appropriate score so as you can see i am getting score every time i'm shooting the point uh and shooting backs will still work so eight score as you can see i got eight score so yeah so the coins are working now so let's work on the um baby turkey now so let's go to the baby turkey spray so i'm gonna get one green flag clicked i'm gonna go i'm gonna zoom in a little bit i'm going to go to negative i'm going to go to 10 10 negative 85 that's what i did on my other project so we're going to wait two seconds before starting and then so this weight is like prevent the bat it's like let's say you shoot the bat and then it's dead already but it's going to hit the turkey we don't want it to take any damage so you don't lose any score so that's what we're going to do wait two seconds and then we're gonna put a forever loop if the bat shot we need to end so if the bat shot is equal to zero that shot equals to zero uh and touching that so if it's touching the bat and the bat is still alive then we won't broadcast the message we're touching back then we want to broadcast a message and wait wait until the action is finished that's why we need to wait so we're gonna broadcast turkey hit hit turkey i guess hit turkey and then right here we're going to get when green fly clicked again so that we're going to make the turkey glide around randomly so we're going to get a forever loop glide um we're going to keep that y y axis the same but we're gonna make it glide three seconds and we're gonna make it glide from negative 170 to 170 so pick random negative 170 to 170. like that so next we want to uh receive the hit turkey so when i receive hit turkey then we're going to say ouch for like one second letting the player know the turkey is being hit so let's say after one second could get an ifelse statement if the score is greater than three if the score is greater than three the score is greater than three we're going to change the score by negative three else we're gonna just set the score to zero because if you have less than um three points we don't wanna go negative points so that's why i'm going to just set the score to zero in the house set the score to zero and i'm gonna wait another two seconds down here okay so after you're finished with that let's work on the winning and losing so for the winning and losing let's go here gonna win green flag plates and we have two costumes one that says you win and the other one says you lose so let's see um so when let's go to events from the coin we have the check score we broadcast the check score here so we're gonna finally meet it right here so when i receive check score if the score is greater than or equal to 20 so you only need 20 points to win so if the score is greater than equal to so variables score score score is greater than 20 or equal to 20 exactly you want to switch the costume to the winning costume this one and then after that we're going to make it go to the front layer and then we're going gonna show it and then stop all just because they would okay so when i receive shot fire we're gonna go over here when i receive shot fired so like when you're shooting and if the bullet counter is equal to zero that means you ran out of bullets equal to zero so the bullet counter is equal to zero then we want to switch the costume to lose so once you lose all your bullets you will lose we're gonna make it go to the front layer and show and then go to control get a stop up okay so now we have the winning and losing okay and for these two we're just gonna add a little bit code so for this one the score we're gonna go to one green flat clicked we want to hide it we want to make it go backwards eight layers so it'll go behind the um the mouse pointer and everything so i'll just make your game look a bit more cleaner so go backwards eight layers eight layers and we want to show and same thing for the other one bullet thing just drag and drop this into here like that so now you have the two things okay so now let's play the game and when the bat touches it as you can see we lost some score okay see ouch and we lost all of our score see as you can see the game is working so i'm going to try to win right here as you can see it's not as easy as you would think because the bats keep on spawning right here it can be quite annoying we only have 9 volts left now get these points okay as you can see when you get 20 score it says you win and right here we can actually set it to go to zero zero so then we'll stay in the center of the screen i forgot to do that so there you go um and let's say you just waste all your bullets so i'm just going to waste all the bullets real quick okay so i just wasted all my bullets so let's just watch the rest and they'll say you lose as you can see so yeah so that's pretty much the safety turkey game if you enjoyed be sure to leave a like and subscribe and ring the notification bell as well and i'll see you guys in the next video bye you
