hello guys once again welcome back to the channel so we'll continue where we have left off last time we got the crap we got the freaking car going what we need to work on Nexus I walk on the cake walk on the crap lives how that walks and also walk or not as small out of vehicle before we start please like share and subscribe to our channel make the notification bell and please comment down below on our video if you like alright now let's get started okay what we're going to do next is that we are going to work on the coal for the cake first okay we will go here we'll say start so when green flag start what we want to do we want generate the cake somewhere on the top lane only okay now let me put this over here chilly so we don't want to block that so I have the life on one side disco on the other side and then we have the cake on top so what we want to do we want to generate them kill me like this and you can change the cake sighs let's see okay how we are going to set the size of the cake now we'll make it forty 15 then we will say go to X&Y what we're going to do is we are going to set it up on top 160 so somewhere on top this Lane for the exposition will pick a random so what we're going to do is we are going to make it negative 200 200 so basically anywhere on top here and we are going to have the it's a show so if I push this now as you can see the kick is somewhere on this side nobody can move it a little bit higher thing is okay you know what right so let's say we stop we start again you see the kick is in different position this is the tenth position when it's always generating on the top plane so next what we're going to do is we saw the remember the message got kick right so when the when the crap catch the cake we bought just catch a cupcake so we need to add this here now we go back to the event or say when I receive we are going to hide it we are going to change the score by one and what we can do it we will broadcast a new message say start again so when we see this message later the crap can move back to this position and we'll say wait for two seconds before generator kick again what we can do is we are going to placate his cohere so after we catch the cake we come back we it will create even create a new click again all right we will have to have some Co here to make the crap go back right because we would grab the cake that the crap you don't want the crowd to stay there right so what you can do is in the crap you had say when I receive start again and we are gonna move on back to this position now go to this position and what do a wait for one second before I begin so they pick with generate now let's just try it out oh we don't know much car run pass here to kick if you can see once we catch the king we have two schools or two right don't step five lines but we need to do with the hit the crap right you remember that the colony the crab would broadcast hit crap what we need to go is where the go back to the crap and we have to start a new section of coal what we say is it crab so what we want to do is wouldn't it hit the crap we want to set this action stop action so yes that means it we want to stop the other action on the other thing how this car making sure that it doesn't get hit more than once and we want to change the life by minus one and then what this week to our custom be basically the cat the the crap that hit right we want to switch to custom B and we want to do a little weight and we want to check you we won the check if the live is here oh oh you can always say that life is 0 or less than 0 you want but I think it's ok then who have this to stop it will never go to negative so we can say life life's equal to 0 then you can say stop all or you can have a podcast and not a message saying game over you can do that I think you guys know how to do that now you can just for now we can say stop all here and if not we want to switch it back to custom a after I get hit where wants to back to custom a and we want to reset this in the variable stop action to know so now and we want to podcast start again so let's just select start again so what it does is if we get hit or he get the cake the crab will come back here so let's test this out real quick so you can see if I catch the cake the crab will go back to the to the middle gear or I can hit back wanna see see I get hit back or I turn a little bit to and I come back so as you can see so if I have one more live the game and you see hit that even though the car hit the crab multiple time right because it runs in molar so we don't take more than one life because it's not action will help to uh to to do that right that's why we needed that okay so so far we have one car walking we have the crab walking with the life working with the squirrel walking and where the kid walking okay so next I want to show you guys is uh let's let me do one edit I'll show you one edit with the old one truck so what I did was you can just search for old truck cartoon PNG you can download this truck but this is not a transparent background unfortunately you can make some change to it so let me upload it I'll show you so this is the old truck download as you can see it couldn't you see you see some white celebration it is a transparent that you can see the cat here so this is messed up right so what you need to do you go to here use this magic thing magic Walker just come and highlight the truck okay so as you can see you can't fill out the truck so you see the truck is pretty good in a little bit on top but I think can really do anything with that so so it's not see it's not 100% perfect right but it's near perfect so as you can see now you know you it's not completely blocking the cap right so you can see it's transparent now so what you can do is this so right click you can say safety local file go give you something called all Trump sprite that means that older version of sprite or older version of a scratch so on when you export rice save again so this is the sprite for version 2 so it created this file after that you can come back to your Co here and you can use this and you say upload and you can use this truck too so it will all naturally convert to the pickup truck version 3 of sprite scratch so now you have the truck so what we can do is we can make the truck go a little bit slow we can put them somewhere around here this line here ok what we're going to do is we want to make walk on the truck now we are going to make him go to negative 250 right we'll use 250 and then we can go to 60 and you can change the size of the truck so here the truck we can set the side here well so this is 40 so as you can see the truck is still prebaked and then depending on the year maybe you can say 30 so 30 seems okay with the truck okay now you can do the forever loop similar to the one that we had already right what we can do is actually we can drag it and send it over so let's just do all the size he actually probably will be easier let's remove this because I think different spray of different size so let's drag this over here you see this wobbly and then just rock drop it don't create it over there so now on this whole truck will change the position back so the truck is pretty much the same as the green car so because it's facing the same side we wanted to go to the other you know disappear and come back here oh the truck will make it like too so I'll go a little bit slower and if we hit the crap oh through the same vodcast okay so the truck is done now so let's just test it out in business you can see the truck is pulling little slow so you can adjust it a little bit maybe here or you want to ribbon on that yellow I mean depending where so you can change it so this is 70 actually so let's put in the 70 so now it's running so you can see the truck is gonna go slow to play a little bit in time before they actually you're gonna get the cake okay okay all right we got the truck we're gonna add the police car oh they don't upload that so same thing with a police car you can like make your make your over one McDow no the police car come at you raise that you know but uh well I don't want to do that again but you guys know how to do it what I can do is I can I exported from the other game and going to import the police car here okay so I went to my folder away I have the police car similar thing I just imported so now I have my police car okay so I have my police car here what I'm going to do is I'm going to take the code from the truck and copy over to the police car since the police car also facing the same side this is pretty much the same except for the location of the police car so as you can see the police call you when you move it we want to put them over here so it's about 108 right so we'll put 108 and since the police call you you can see the police cars actually pointing the other way right it's pointing to your left side if you can zoom in a little bit you can see it see the police car the head is on this side so what you have to do if you want to put a police car on this side run across what you have to do is you have to actually change it instead of a positive number yeah they use a negative number so that's why I'm purposely showing you putting it on this side so now the police cars are because of the direction right you see this direction negative 90 so if you put 90 degrees cause facing the other side so we want to go this way then you put negative 90 says negative 90 so you do not want to put neck so this should be negative 90 right or you can change it here also that's fine you can drop this out so now you have this so what happened is the police car will go on to here and disappear now let's just test it out so as you can see the police cosmic traveling pretty fast okay we're missing something okay the police cars not coming back we forgot to set the position back so you see this is I messed it up right I had a negative right negative 250 250 let me let me try since it's the opposite right so let's let's run it again so you see you got stuck over there right okay let's try this okay okay okay I made a mistake here or 250 so that was too much so we actually want to put it like 230 here someone is over 230 we will come back what's over here thinking this this is all messed up to 30 let's not use 250 here because sometimes some sprite depending on the size it might be messed up okay all right so we got the police car we call it negative 99 also we're pointing into this direction I think we can take this now let's take put it back in Figure web 990 here let's just try it again make sure it works okay so we are we've good there so let's move make some article on the other side okay we have that with the truck we can have a truck truck oh they don't have truck here okay they don't have the food truck okay they don't have the foot truck anymore oh there it is okay also we want the big truck as well okay all right so this big truck has a different costume now what we can do is we can move the big truck on the top lane like right here and we can switch it to costume so that they have different costume okay gonna drag this in this is this truck oh let me just copy the coal from the outside will be faster actually well not enough time if not so let's finish that so we copy it over here we're gonna adjust it a little bit so the position will change it actually we can change it to okay let's try them on this side we'll put them on the other side like this I'll come on this side and we'll put 155 and the truck let's put them at a 40% probably will walk and since it's coming on the other side you have to use the minus five because we're flipping him around and we have to point him to negative 90 and what I set this over here okay all right so now the truck will be going this way for this we are going to have to check the position differently because it's going this way now for the sprite so it depends on how the spray is going so if this condition may be different and yeah they check if it's greater than 230 it was less than I mean less than negative to Authority sorry because it's coming from the other side right so negative 230 then we want to set them to 245 so the truck will go back to the right side okay let's test this out for now ignoring this truck here we'll hide this guy let's just try it right now okay so this is not correct so many truckers right okay okay um I think the Russian is wrong on the truck oh I have 90 here that's why let's take this back out let's put them back with negative 90 okay let's try no okay I made a mistake with the movement so on I change it back to positive five cents I rotate it to negative pointing this way so now let's test it out again and she'll walk now sort of just going this way then it goes to the end they'll come back so you just have to play with this up picture this negative and this this position checkin and the movement so depending on the kind of sprite Howard face it might be change differently okay all right so we got that so now let's get to the foot truck so the food truck is the last one I believe for our game oh maybe oh we have a light yeah I think my whole game has a bus also okay now let's copy take oh no I won't take it take this one okay alright so let's try the foot truck put them at the bottom here let's see show him okay he's a little big so foot truck let's say make him 20% yeah it looks good I think because of this little thing on top I could actually hit the crap even though it's not exactly neither okay so one down here okay we'll change the x position oh whatever let's try this here's negative nine year and negative 8086 you see a succes right so let's try four switch this different location let's see okay well if you will go on to call from this side so they'll come back over here and now let's try and test this out what's getting it wrong I think is this would be like this okay okay so then this is not correct let's let's do this let's put them back let's just make it a little easier put 90 and we're going to use the positive number here okay all right I think we should just whatever the truck is facing we'll do that easier use changing around okay so we have that already now we add one more one more the school bus is at one more save the bus is there okay this will be our last one and also in this truck actually if you want you can come and change to you we call it change the the costume between each time so that way you know if they run through at the next costume you can put it like this so the custom of the truck is different same thing with the foot truck you can add that as well because the foot chalk has different costume as you can see right okay the school bus alright so we are almost there so the bus we'll make the bus go maybe this the other way so let's see what we can do will copy the cohere drag it over to the bus okay so the bus we are going to make him maybe 45 40 40 but just saw the bus this row here going to hat that um so this is around 15 right I don't know well let's let's just see all my cars yeah um can try this okay so have the spool a bus going directly let's see yep looks like it's correct no so so far we have all the code now or all the Stefan sprite from now that's nice the KML it's a little tough we'll try across the street so as you can see it's not anything to get it but but we can we as you can see you can change a little bit the car or no slower with the police cars going too fast right okay make myself a little easier let's go to everything by 1/6 okay this is too is fine this is 8/3 is fine this guy's five is boiling the only one is police called us make him seven it's too fast okay now let's say we have a better chance okay so you see them cut the cake there you go so that's how the game works so you guys kind of change the speed that you like or cross and get it to last another game thank you very much for watching the video and please like share and subscribe to our Channel and see you guys next time thank you bye
