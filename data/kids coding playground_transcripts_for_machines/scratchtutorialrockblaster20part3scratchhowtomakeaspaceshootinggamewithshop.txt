so welcome back guys to another video on kids going to playground so this is going to be the part 3 for the rock blaster 2.0 game so before we start i'm going to review some code for the sprites so this is for the shopping cart so this is like for the moving side to side when you put your mouse pointer on it it'll get bigger this is uh when i receive open shop then it'll stop everything in here so for the rocks same as almost the same as last time we just added the if then touching laser then change the money by 100 and go back to here and then starts our magic spell and then um player same thing just the movement and this broadcast start game and then for the laser we just did this in the last video uh when i receive start game this is just for the shooting when when the space bar is pressed i can create a clone myself wait until not key space is pressed so then no one can spam the spacebar and then we have this one this is just to go to the player and if touching repeat until it's touching the edge okay and then this is just to set up for the laser and then the background backdrop will work on that today i think and then for the pause button when the p is pressed and if shop is equal to no in shop is equal to no that means the player's not in the shop then we'll show and broadcast pause game and of course not every uh sprite is paused right now because we have not done the code so we should work on that right now so let's go to the aliens and enemies actually you can rename the rocks to enemies so you guys won't get confused enemies and then um i'm gonna get uh when i receive when i receive a pause game then i'm going to stop other scripts in the sprite and then delete this clone so they'll delete all the clones from the aliens and the rocks and stuff like that so uh let's play it so i'll show you guys so when you press p then i'll delete the clones and it'll stop all the scripts in the sprite okay so now we have that done let's work more on the shopping cart actually no we finished the shopping cart sorry about that so we're gonna do the open shop let's go to the shop background right here i have it right here so when flag clicked i want to hide the shop background so this shop background will only show up when you're inside the shop and then when i receive start game start game then i want to hide so in the beginning we always want to hide the shop background and then when i receive open shop then we want to go to zero zero which is the origin the center and then we want to set in shop to yes so then to let other sprites know the player is in the shop in shop to yes and then we want to show the variable money to let them know how much money they're at um and then let's show and then we have to show the background of course and then we want this to go to the front layer so we wanted to go into the front layer and then go back a little bit so we're going to make it go backwards five layers okay so that's the shop so uh let's work on the buttons now so for the buttons i'm gonna receive open shop we wanna for this is for the skin one the blue the blue spaceship so when i receive open shop we want to go to the front layer with this sprite go to the front layer and then i made it go to negative 50 80. i already have the same coordinates because i got from the backpack but negative 50 80 is like somewhere around here so just i just um dragged it over there and then just got the coordinates and then i want to set the size to 100 in the beginning because when you um sometimes when you stop the game and your mouse is off uh on the sprite then that means the sprite is bigger than a hundred percent so we're going to set the size back to 100 in the beginning then we want to show and now we're going to do the script to make the sprite bigger when it's touching the mouse pointer so get a forever loop and change the size change the size by 100 minus so we're going to get the division sign so um we want to get a division and the subtraction symbol so we want to put the division in here got a size so 100 minus the size divided by three so i put this in here so if it's not touching the mouse pointer then i'll go back to normal size or shrink and if touching mouse pointer then change the size by let's just duplicate this so instead of 100 we're doing 150 divided by minus the size divided by three so you want to put this in here so if it's touching the last pointer it'll get bigger and if uh we're gonna get an ifelse statement if um mouse down if the player is clicking down on the button oh there's a mouse down right here then we want to set the brightness negative 10. just make it a little bit dimmer it just makes the game look better i guess we're going to set the brightness to negative 10. and then we want to wait until the mouse down is clicked wait until mouse down so you wait until the player is clicking onto the sprite then we want to broadcast another message called check spaceship purchase purchase check space ship purchase so this is to check if the player is buying the spaceship and then else we want to set the brightness to zero make it back to normal brightness and then we want to get when i receive when i receive um check spaceship purchase we want to make a new variable called spaceship uh spaceship purchase status so let's just check if the player has enough money to buy the spaceship so the spaceships and the um uh triple shot are all like one time purchase so since it's a onetime purchase we have to make this variable so space ship purchase status so when you go back in the store the spaceship would be already purchased so we're going to get an if else statement if the uh spaceship purchase status is equal to unlock meaning the player has has enough money to buy it and already bought it then uh when spaceships purchase status is equal to unlocked then we want to broadcast another message broadcast switch to blue spaceship because you can select different skins so if they already have it and they click on the sprite and that means you'll switch them to the blue spaceship so we want to make a new broadcast called swish to blue of course blue space ship switch to blue spaceship and then we want to stop the script because that means because they already bought it so stop the script else we wouldn't get an if else statement put it in the else area if the money is greater than or equal to um one thousand so i made this out of one thousand uh money and each character you each enemy you kill you'll get a hundred so you gonna get an ore an equal and a greater than so if the money is uh equal to one thousand or the money is greater than one thousand then we wanna change the money by negative one thousand so subtract one thousand dollar money from your uh um from your account i guess so we want to set the spaceship purchase status to unlocked after you buy it unlocked and then we want to switch costume to costume2 so then the button will switch to like the dark one noting notifying the player that he's already bought he or she has already bought the skin then we want to broadcast another message uh switch the blue spaceship broadcast that else we want to set the spaceship status to locked set the spaceship purchase status to locked if they cannot afford it and we want to switch costume to costume one so then the uh so then it will stay on the first one okay and then next we want to get another broadcast when i receive check spaceship purchase status and if the um spaceship purchase status is equal to unlocked spaceship purchase status then we want to forever switch to costume too so then if the player comes back to the shop you'll always see the second costume which means it's already purchased switch costume to costume two then we want to get a one flag clicked when flag was clicked we want to hide this button because they're not in the shop and then in the beginning we always want to set the spaceship purchase status to locked oops it locked and then you want to switch the costume to costume one which is the first costume and then when i receive start game start game then you want to hide and stop other scripts in the sprite in the beginning okay so now we have this one down we can just uh drag the code into the other buttons but we have to change up we have to change it up a little bit so guys we need one more change to our code so for the pause button when i receive open shop it'll hide so then it'll hide in the shop and then um i will show you guys if it works i'm gonna set my money to like 1000 so then i can actually buy it so then i'm gonna play it click p open the shop and then the button is right here when you click it you can select the blue skin and we need we need to make an exit button so we'll make the exit button right now so then when i can show you guys when i exit it can become the blue spaceship so let's get to the exit button so i'm just going to drag and drop this code from here into here because it's pretty much the same thing except we're gonna put a little weight in the front and then it'll delay by one second i'll show one second later and then um we'll need a new x and y position so the x and y position i did was 150 negative 70. and then set size to 100 percent zero percent and then show forever we want to do the same thing and if instead of this we're going to take this out if it's uh in shop is equal to yes that means it's inside the shop so we need two ands and the player is touching the mouse pointer and it's um mouse down so we're going to say yes or here if the in shot is equal to yes and touching mouse pointer so i'm just going to delete this and mouse down then we can wait until wait until mouse down wait until mouse down and then we'll broadcast start game so then i'll start the game again when you exit the store oh oops don't use the weight just starting and then we'll need to add a little bit more code get it when flight clicked in the beginning we want to hide and want to receive start game start game then we want to set the in shot to no because in the beginning you're not in this shop set the in shop snow and then hide so that's pretty much it now let's test it out and instead of 100 and 150 we have to change this to 50 and 75 so it won't be very big because it'll get too big and then we want to get a point direction of 90 so then it will uh point to the right side so let's play it now i'm gonna click p go to the shop so then the exit button and this is supposed to be the other way around so you have to put the subtraction sign into the division sign size like that put this in here and then we do the same thing for this one put that inside here like that so now let's play it click p go to the shop and then you get the exit button so when you click 1000 exit and then you have to select it right now we have not had the selection so we have to select it so then we have to um make it switch to the blue costume when i receive switch to blue costume you want to switch the costume to the blue costume this one so now let's play so now you have the blue costume select it click exit and now you have the blue costume so now you can play with the other skin and i'll show you guys one more thing so this one seconds needed because if you take it out and you play it and you click and then click here it will come back because it's at the same x and y position if you want to change this then you can just put the weight one second or you can make it go to a different x and y position so that's it for part three um so
