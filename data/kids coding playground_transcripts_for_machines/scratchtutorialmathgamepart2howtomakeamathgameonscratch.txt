so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding playground today we're working the second part for the um scratch math game so in the last tutorial uh we learned how to make the addition and we made the audition button so today and the quick button um so we're gonna work in the subtraction button um subtraction um the custom block and we're also going to work on multiplication so i'm just going to drag and drop the multiplication in here as well hold up i don't have it so let me get it okay so now i have the multiplication button i just got it from my other project so now i have the three buttons so let's start out from the subtraction button everyone um so everyone let's go to the subtraction button and let's code on here first let's zoom in a little bit so for addition we can just copy paste everything just drag and drop everything into the subtraction except we just need to change up one broadcast that's pretty much it for the subtraction button so for subtraction button we're gonna get um so we'll separate all this instead of here instead of start edition we have to broadcast a new message called start subtraction so we have broadcast start subtraction so let's go back into our cat we have to define a new custom block so let's go to my blocks and let's make a new custom block and name it subtraction so subtraction click ok so let's define it now so let's get a forever loop forever loop so in the beginning we always want to set the guess to zero to zero and then we want to set the random number one and the random number two to pick random one to 100 and the um subtraction is a little bit different from addition that's why i didn't copy paste it because you need to find if the random number one is greater than random number two because if the random number uh two is smaller than the random number one and you're subtracting it we don't want negative numbers so we have to do that so so if we set the two random numbers pick random one to 100 let's get a repeat until so we have to repeat until guess is equal to answer problem so if the guess of the answer is equal to the actual answer so repeat until the guess is equal to the answer problem and then after that we want to get an if density if wouldn't it if then else sorry put an if then else inside this repeat until loop so we wanna if random number one is greater than random number two so this is where you detect if random number one is greater than random number two so if random number one is greater than random number two then we want to set the answer to problem of random number one minus random number two so let's set the answer to problem some random number one minus random number two so uh get a subtraction symbol put that in here random number one subtracted random number two so subtract the first number which is greater than random number two i'll be random number one minus random number two and then we'll ask a question ask we're gonna put two joins put a drawing here and put a join here so we want to say random number one in the first slot which is any number that's from 100 then we join it with the minus sign and then we get a random number two and put it in here else if a random number one is not greater than random number two then we want to set the random num then we want to just duplicate this and instead of doing this we can switch them around so instead of putting random number one minus random two it'll be random number two minus random number one so do it the other way around so then it'll always never be negative and then i'll ask and say right here we're gonna switch these two again so we're gonna join random number two minus random number one and then we're gonna set the guess to the answer down here let's set the guess to answer um and then if we're going to get another if then else okay so let's get an if then else and put it right here so if the guess is equal to the answer to problem yes is equal to answer to problem um then we're gonna have to start the sound guitar strum i already have it start sound guitar strum and then we're going to say that is correct so i'm just going to duplicate this right here and then put it down here else we're going to do this string pluck and say that is the wrong answer so as you can see subtraction needs a bit more code than addition because you have to find which number is greater than which so and then finally we have to do a uh we have to um call the function right here so we're gonna get a broadcast when i receive start edition uh subtraction sorry about that we're gonna run the subtraction call this custom blocker here so let's try it out right now so i'm gonna save it and play it let's try it out so okay so at the subtraction button addition button so let's say if i click on subtraction boom now it will not be negative as you can see 90 minus 49 is not a negative number so let's say i get right so let's say i get it wrong then i'll do that but if i get it right then don't do this so there was a little bug right here so i got the answer correct which was 41 and it didn't work so i accidentally didn't answer the problem right here it should be guess so um you guys have to do guess instead of answering a problem that was a little mistake by me so don't do answer problem you have to put yes that's why it did not work so now let's see if it works now it should work so now let's go to subtraction so i'm just going to click on it 60 minus 1 that's 59. so as you can see now it's correct back then i uh when i got the right answer it still didn't get it right because um there's a little bug in it so um so the answer is 22 for here let's see if it's right okay that's right and gain score and you get it wrong on purpose it'll say that's the wrong answer so now we have the subtraction and addition functioning correctly now we can work on our multiplication button so let's go to our multiplication uh just drag and drop all of this code into the multiplication we just have to change one broadcast um just drag and drop all this and one more let's see if i got it off oops i did not get one of them i think yeah i did not get the one flag clicked uh yeah this one so i'm just gonna drag and drop it here and i don't know where this one went so i'm just gonna give it to here as well so drag it from the front i think that's why so when flying click time yeah okay so now we have the code for the multiplication instead of broadcasting start subtraction we're gonna have to broadcast start multiplication start multiplication i think that's how you spell it but that's just broadcast that and then let's go back into our cat sprint and then so for the multiplication um i'm only going to do it 1 to 12 because um this is like for kids multiplication so i'm not going to make it too hard but you have to use like scratch paper and all that so to make a new custom block it's called multiplication multiplication click ok so we're going to define multiplication so let's get a forever loop um you want to set the guess to zero yes to zero and we're gonna set the random number one and the random number two both to only pick random one to twelve so it isn't too hard so pick random one twelve only you guys can do it any value you want and i'm going to set the answer to problem to um random number one multiplying by random number two so multiply this random number by this random number so random number one times random number two and okay so we're going to get a repeat until we're going to repeat until guess is equal to answer to problem so wait until the correct answer guess is equal to uh answer to problem and then once it is then we want to ask um ask we're gonna ask two joints let's put two joints okay so we're gonna since um you guys can do the star symbol for multiplication um or just use the x symbol i'm just gonna do the x symbol so uh x letter i mean so we're gonna join the random number one x or you can do the star symbol this one i'm just gonna do the x random number two so multiply these two ask what's random number one times random number two and then um we want to set the guess to answer set the guess to the answer put that in here and then we gotta get an if else statement so if if the answer is equal to random number one multiplied by random number two that means they got correctly random number one so if the answer is equal to random number one multiplied by random number two then we can just duplicate this this is just to show they're correct i'll play start sound guitar strum that is correct and then change the score by one and if they get it wrong then we just duplicate this that is the wrong answer so that is the code for the multiplication and of course we have to call the code so i'm going to go here when i receive uh start multiplication we'll want to run this code right here so now we have the multiplication let's try that out so save it go full screen so let's play a math game answer the following questions press the quick button to stop all questions choose one of the operators are random so i'm going to pick multiplication um so 1 times 11 so multiplication is working right now so as you can see when you answer it correctly it will say that is correct your score will go up let's say if i answer it wrong on purpose let's see if it works and they'll say that is the wrong answer so our game is working uh perfectly right now so that is uh i think we'll stop here so today we just worked on the subtraction and multiplication button in the next episode i think we'll work on division and the random so i think that's it for this video thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share subscribe and ring the notification bell and i'll see you guys in the next video
