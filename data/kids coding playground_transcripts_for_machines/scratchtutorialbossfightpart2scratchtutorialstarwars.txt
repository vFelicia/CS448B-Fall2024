so welcome back guys to the channel so this is in the second part for the boss fight game so as you can see from the last video we have all this code done so I'll let you guys look through the code for a little bit I just dragged through just copy down any code you did not do yet so right here this is the movement the left and right arrow keys and see jump jumping and this is the starting okay I hope you guys have all that done so today we'll be working on the attacks the costumes for the saber spin saber throw in the force attack so don't get another one flat legs here wait one second just to give it a little slight pause get a furfle do you get if then statement this is to broadcast and the saber Spencer will attack if then key one key one twist press the firt one button the number one button on the keyboard is pressed then hide and we can broadcast a message broadcast and wait called one so then the saber spin cat will receive the message so let's save your spit we'll need a wouldn't go when I receive the one thereof she'll show repeat 36 times repeat 36 times this is to make the full spin to concede these costumes they took let's look at spinning 36 times which means I'll go 3 times around 36 times next costume it's costume hide and we can broadcast a new message called show one this is to broadcast back to the back to the cat itself so we'll broadcast the show one back to the cat but first we made it work on the code for them saber so when Lina one flat clicks here look like legs hide hide forever go to cat in porn boots dark I hope this will make sense to you guys so this all just goes to the cat sprite and point towards the boss point towards boss the boss and when clicks and flag clicks forever forever if then touching the boss touching the boss so if it's touching the boss then we'll change the boss HP by negative 400 you can make it any damage you want I'm just going to stick with 100 and wait one second so we have to have a slight pause before they can use the attack again and when this receives one then we can play a sound I'm a sound engineer called spin play spin it sound spin until done so this is a cat so from last video we have the movement dog back so now we have this saber spin ready but it's not completely done and as you can see it hit it because we have the hyper here so when you broadcast it back to the cat so the cat has to receive the show one so as you see we still have this broadcasting one so I want to receive show one but when we got from the arm we got I got the show one from the saber spin broadcast here we can go to saber spin so go to saber spin and show so show back so when you play it so now we have the sabers now ready she is pretty effective the spinning and we still have the ring we can do to make it a shield so um so what the ring is it's supposed to like protect when it spins the saber the Rings was a circle it to protect it from the fireballs coming from the goal so we need to save her spin um it it can also act like a shield so the ring is kind of like a shoe so we can get on flat clicks they're all graphic effects hide in the beginning forever get it forever loop change fish eye effect so just get the color thing it should be the fish eye effect right here fish your eye effect by 50 as you just make it look better you know wait 0.01 seconds you can just duplicate this a couple of times there you go to placate it like that and one flight wait forever forever loop go to cat and point towards boss go to cat so just go to the yeah and I'll always point towards the boss boss and when this receives one is his show so I can show when use the one attack you receive one then show and when this receives show one then it should hide because show one means the Sabre spin is over so it just becomes the regular cat again so I'm just brought Lucy you show one then hot so when we play it there's a little ring around it actually we can turn about them if they make this negative fifty sorry for that so be more visible knots more visible once you see it and when you're doing it the boss cannot be better effect you within the shield ring shield so next we want to work on the Sabre throw so saber throne will just go back to the cat again an ifthen statement if then key to is pressed you know the he is pressed then hide hide and broadcast to broadcast and wait you can make a new message called so we broadcast this to the Sabre throat so for the safer throw just get on one plot clicks no actually we can just hit the so when it receives it will show and one flag clicked hide in the beginning forever also you have to go to the cat and point towards the boss go to can point towards boss boss and show to is just to hide it again so it will become the cat itself again so when they make a new message I think they have any do we broadcast show too so we have not broadcasted show too so we cannot do that yet as I check through here so next let's work on the throne saber so this is the saber that's gonna be thrown like the same err so when it pressed it'll throw the saber so when it receives the message to saber and place am throne Savior and Tilton I have a sound coach saber through it sounds like that and when flat clicked what it forever if then touchy dark touching the boss I was call it's are some reason boss then change HP by negative 100 you can make it any HP but I'm just gonna do negative 100 you can do anything and wait one second so they can't just keep on spamming the move because that would be kind of cheap so when flike like to in hiding beginning Sabre hide so we'll have more some more code for the Sabre so when it receives to the message then oh go to cat go to the cat point towards the boss all the time so no matter what side you're on does light saber I'll always point towards the boss switch costume the Sabre one so we have this is just explosion to me but when it impacts with the boss I'll explode so in the beginning we want to set the costume to the first costume save the one go to the front layer so then it will be in front of the boss gonna front layer and show weight 0.2 seconds give it a little pause oops 0.2 seconds and I'm glide 0.5 seconds lied 0.5 seconds in the x and y position of the boss so we'll want to get to sentencing this block and you always want to get this one first because you will not be able to select it here so always get here go to here boss exposition or boss and we'll need to get the Y position of the boss so glad 0.5 seconds to the X in my position in the boss that makes perfect sense we'll need an ifthen statement so if it's touching the dark the boss boss its touching the boss then switch costumes a saber this is the explosion remember explosion if it touches the box so just costume saber waiting 0.1 seconds that's which cost him again saber 3 saber 3 and then we do it again for saber 4 so it look like it's exploding so cool better so that's what I have and then high when it comes in contact then we broadcast a message called show so we broadcast it here show okay it's actually supposed to be an ifelse statement sorry wrong one so if you're starting the boss then do this else waiting 0.3 seconds so if it's plotting the egg anything else and hyejin hind and their broadcast show ah mr. Coad so if it's touching anything besides the boss then it will do this that but if it's touching the boss then I'll call this so now we have the show ready we go back to the cat so let's go back to the cat so we don't receive show when I receive show then go to Sabre throw go to Sabre thrown and then show when we play it and press so always pointing direction of the boss not see so that's all we have for now now let's finally let's work on the force attack so force attack we'll need it if then statement and the cat if then he number three is press key three is pressed then hide and broadcast three and lay it this message I'm gonna see three and wait okay so let's go to the force attacked or die receive three then go to cat so always go to the cat point towards the dart which is the boss always point towards the boss clear graphic effects because we'll need to change the brightness and those defects I think go to the front layer show and repeat five times repeat five times is just to make the ghost effect to make it fade in and fade out change ghost effect by 25 ghost thank my 25 point one seconds wait 0.1 seconds you can just duplicate this like that so we have that when I received three will need another one place I'm forced so aside for sense at this awesome we want to play it until done hide will broadcast a message whole show three which will go back to the cat so show three one click you always want to hide this so yeah finally we'll go up back to the cat just cat so when I receive show three then go to force attack and then we hide then show sorry can you show so we have the force attack so it seems I have made a mistake and I fixed it so right here remember I did the I did the go to boss so that was wrong with me so instead should be point towards boss and I forgot to put the negative sign for these so come back so now it will actually work see now it works fine you got all sorts gone so that's all we have for right now so that's all we have for note right now so thank you guys for watching and I'll see you guys in the next video
