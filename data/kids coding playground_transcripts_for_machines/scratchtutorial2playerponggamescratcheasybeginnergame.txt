so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding playground today we'll be doing a twoplayer pingpong game so the objective of the game is to keep on hitting the ball back and forth and you try not to let your opponent hit in the back and when the ball touches this edge or this edge then you get a point so you have this point and this side's point and with that and then the first player to get seven points will win the game so let's go we will be learning these following concepts today variables loops broadcasting messages sensing collision which is like sensing blocks and pick random so i will be showing you guys the game i have my brother here with me hey to show us the game so let me make it bigger so you want me arrow keys sure i'll be here okay first of seven points and i even added some music so you just keep on oh no you like going so i'm just gonna let myself lose or something i wanna um demonstrate what happens when you uh lose so when the ball when the other person gets seven points on you then that means you will get uh you'll say the other pla either if the player if it's the player one that wins so say player one wins so this side is player one this side is player two hit it back okay one more point and then i'll show you guys how to make the game okay so say player two wins which is this team so i'll be making a new project so i can show you guys step by step how to make it so let's make a new project so let's make two variables in the beginning we will need a variable called player1 score one score and another variable called player two score player two score so you have the two variables um we want we don't need this so you can just delete it the my variable you don't need that delete the scratch count we won't need that as well and you can double click on this to make it like that and next we'll be doing the backdrop so for the backdrop i'm gonna put some code for it so this is the color i did um for my last backdrop 39 color 100 percent saturation and 40 brightness so get this color and then we need no outline so we're going to get the box thing uh and just draw a square like so there you go so i got the square this is the backdrop um and next we're gonna get some music i guess uh let's go get a song you guys can pick any song you guys want i'm just gonna pick the song i used this one so just kind of one flag clicked forever loop uh play the sound until done that's it and we will need two paddles so there's a paddle sprite just take two of those just make one and then duplicate it and go into the sprite we're going to make it a vertical oops select this thing so you can actually um just turn it vertical like that okay i know it's not perfect actually just duplicate this so then you already have an uh you already have a uh you already have like a vertical one so there you go two paddles we'll also need the ball let's get the ball sprite let's go here get the ball you want to get the this ball just going to get this one and next we're going to work on the ball code so one flag clicked actually no one yeah one flag clicked you want to set all the variables to zero set the player one score and set the player two score to zero uh set the size to forty percent so it won't be too big and we want it to go to zero zero the center position and then we want it to point in direction of 45 so point in direction of 45 it's going to be like top right so then we can bro then we're going to broadcast a new message called start game so that start game so when this receives start game then we can um execute all this code so get a forever loop move ten steps if on edge bounce that's the first part and then you get if it's touching the paddle one and touching the paddle the first paddle not the second paddle so if it's touching paddle then we can start sound pop to make some sound sound effects i guess turn we need to turn so it'll turn a random degree so it'll go different angles and directions you can turn pick random 170 to 190 degrees so let's get that pick random 170 to 190 degrees so let's uh duplicate this put this under here instead of paddle we'll do paddle 2. and we'll start the pop turn this is all the same and then we'll get another if then statement if the x position is greater than 230 so that means if the x position is greater than like 230 230 is like right here that means it touches the edge i guess so if the x position is greater than 230 then we will change the players one score by one go back to the zero zero go back to the middle and wait three seconds and we'll start it over again we can duplicate this put this under here instead of this we will get the a less than symbol so less than symbol put that in here if the x position is less than negative 230 so if it's less than this position like negative 230s right here then we can change the player to score by one go back to zero zero and wait three seconds so i just scroll around to let you guys see that's all the code we have for now obviously it does nothing yet except bounce around i guess now we can work on the paddle code so we can actually make the paddle a bit smaller like 75 percent size and same with the paddle 2 let's make it 75 size so we got the two paddles let's get coding on it so when i receive start game we'll get a forever loop if on edge bounce so you cannot go down here and hide down here this is for player one so we'll do w the w key and the s key so if the key w is pressed which is the up if the w key is pressed then we can change the y by eight change y by eight and we can duplicate this if the s key is clicked which is down so when the s key is pressed we'll go negative eight and then we want to set the x and y position so i have the coordinates written down we will do negative 200 and y zero so it will be right here about right here that's negative 200 y zero so then we'll get another ifthen statement if the player one score is equal to seven i'm doing seven score as the winning you can do any number if you want uh if the player one score is equal to seven then we can broadcast a message called player one wins player one wins and then for the paddle 2 it'll be similar code we'll just set the x and y position to 200 x so it will be in the y zero so it will be somewhere right here and then we can pretty much just drag this drag and drop it into the paddle too so we'll get the same code and then instead of w it'll be the up arrow key and instead of the s it'll be the down arrow key and instead of player one score it'll be player two score player two score and we'll broadcast a new message called player 2 wins player 2 wins and then we'll also make a new sprites paint a new sprite we will make two costumes for i'm gonna make this first one red so i'm just gonna type player one wins um player one wins make it a bit bigger a little bit smaller actually so player one wins i'm just gonna duplicate this we're gonna do it in the same sprite just two costumes and i'm gonna rename the costume to player one win just duplicate this instead of player one when i'm just going to name this to player two and then i'm just gonna double click on this i'm gonna make i'm gonna change the text to green to tell the difference so instead we're gonna write player two wins so we have two costumes player one and player two wins okay so let's go to the code for it so when flat clicked we want to go to zero zero go to the center and we want to hide so when it receives the player one win then we will show switch costume to player one win because the player 1 wins and we'll stop all just duplicate this for player 2 wins just click player 2 wins changes to player 2 win so that's all the code let's play it i'm playing by myself right now so it's not that easy so what happened to the paddle so guys i actually found out the bug set this to left and right so it won't flip so as you could see the paddle flip to the left a little so just do this left and right so now it will not flip save your project now i'm going to go full screen and show you guys oops i'm playing by myself right now so it's kind of hard i get two screens at two two places at the same time yeah so let me just make one of the teams lose and finally i'll say player one wins whichever team wins so yeah there you have it uh two player ping pong game and we rename it two player palm game player pong game so thank you guys for watching please like share and subscribe and i'll see you guys in the next video
