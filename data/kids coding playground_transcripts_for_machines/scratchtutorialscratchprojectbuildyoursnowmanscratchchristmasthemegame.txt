welcome back guys it's kids going playground here and today we're back for another video in scratch and today um we'll be making uh make your own snowman and thanksgiving just passed so happy thanksgiving everybody and uh hope you guys had a good thanksgiving and uh christmas is uh around the corner so we made a christmas game make your snowman so it plays a xylo some type of sound and you see snow is constantly falling and um you have the the sticks you can drag them onto your snowman this one's on the back because you know like it's like that and um the scarf as you can see you can change the color of the base like the three buttons so we got black we got gray we got blue we got red and yeah basically that's for the body as well as the head no the head we have the carrot only changing orange yellow red purple and blue and there's a random button which randomizes all the colors on the i succeed the carrots red on this one the hat is yellow scarf is yellow and the boots are red the boots always are the same color so yeah i just checked the snowman's right and i'm pretty sure the right boot is supposed to be in the back of the snowman and not the front of the snowman just as this stick uh it was in the front i'm pretty sure it's in the back so we put another bag and now we're gonna change the thing so we'll be right back so we just fixed the problem so as you can see it's behind the snowman now so we could uh put the behind it and the stick is as well so you can make a fairly decent snowman using the random you know so yeah this is what we're gonna be making today okay so now uh we have started a new project so let's write make your snowman and we're going to delete this and uh we have everything in the backpack but this is how you're supposed to do it it takes a while to do it but shut up snowman and we're gonna be doing the base right so you go to costumes and you delete everything until you have the base and then you rename it of course you name this like base one or whatever and this like base two and uh just change the color of the buttons or the snow if you want to and this is basically how we made our bases so we have everything in the backpack so like what if i wanted to do a body so we have snowman uh by the way everything is here is uh 200 uh the size so what if i wanted to do the body well delete everything but the body and just rename it of course but i'm not going to rename it because like it takes too much time and you just change the button color so that's basically what we're going to be doing and uh i have everything inside the backpack to do the process for you so man and if you wanted to do the boot or anything this is how you do the boot so you go here delete everything and what the left boot and this is how you make the left boot and then search it up and snowman you do ripe so that's basically how we're going to be doing things today so delete all of this and we're going to get everything in the backpack so yeah since this is too time consuming and we don't want to waste your time uh watching me draw a bunch of stuff we have the base and black gray we just put that in the backpack so uh we have everything set up here so let's get start on code and yeah if you don't want to make uh to change the base or the body or the head or uh yeah if you want to do that you can make next scarf and just do the same thing for the scarf so let's work on the base so let's just show you guys all right so the base here so all we have to do is when the green flag is clicked we will go to the position of course if you put things in the backpack they'll be in the right position so just find a position around here that is reasonable and of course change the size of everything to 200 except the buttons you can uh just export it from my game and yeah and we have to get the backdrop so uh any backdrop but i'm gonna take the winter one i think it's fun i don't know what it's actually called uh i think it's called winter yes this one and yeah so we have that and just delete this backdrop so now we have that so we have we're gonna work on the base now so everything's 200 remember that keep in mind and export you just go to my project i will share this by the time this is out click the export button and it should be there and you should be able to um yeah able to import your sprites into your own project so since we have this go to right here i'll switch costume to base one which is the regular base which is brown brown buttons so switch costume to base one and yeah so now uh we're gonna move to the next base uh sprite so we have this when the green flag is clicked we'll make this go to this position and when this right is clicked then it will broadcast change based yeah you can change scarf change boot whatever you want change left boot uh and we have we go to the base now so when i receive change base it will next costume and uh now we're gonna work on the body all right so i'm just gonna demo it to show you if it works or not so yeah it's working fine so now we're gonna move on to the body so let's get this done so when the green flag is clicked it will go to this position i already have it so and then it'll switch costume to body one that's the default and then we move back to the next body and we have the when this sprite is clicked it will broadcast a message change body oh yeah i forgot to do the go to when the green flag is clicked go to and now we're going to move to the body and when i receive change body then it will next costume and now we're gonna go to the head and we have the head so when the green flag is clicked um basically we go to and then switch costume to head one and now when i receive change head which is basically we just go to next head and when the green flag is clicked go to and uh when the sprite is clicked then it will broadcast change head so we're gonna do change head and now we have to change head we go back to the head and when i receive change head it will go next costume and now we're gonna work on the randomized one the random so because the random really is the base of all almost everything here so when the green flag is clicked it will go to this position we already have it and it when the sprite is clicked it will randomize randomize is this iceberg randomizer uh and okay uh randomize we go back to the base this has a lot of transitioning so when i receive randomize pick random repeat until it will pick random 10 to 20. so that was the accident uh instead of repeat until sorry guys it's repeat with a number so this one and we have pick random 10 to 20. so it will show you as it's changing it's transition i'm gonna go to next costume and wait 0.1 seconds so we have this done and basically we just have to copy this code to the body the head and the left arm and right arm you cannot change the color so so now we're gonna do the hat so we're gonna put this to the hat we're gonna put this to the scarf we're gonna put this to the left boot but please do not skip this part uh we have something special for the left and right boot so the left boot and right boot we want to make them have the same color because um basically it's matching so we go i'll repeat 15 times so a number in the middle because and they'll be technically the same color so let's do this see so random as you can see it's changing color alright so now we're gonna code the um the hat so the hat we have to make this draggable so when the green flag is clicked we will go to this position and then go forever oh first we have to do something very important and switch costume back to hack number one because it's gonna be different you're just gonna start randomizing so we go forever and set mode to draggable oh where is that set dragon road to dragon ball and since we have that we put it to the scarf the left boot and the right move yes and we have to change the position so what is the position of the scarf right now so i'm gonna the position has to change and this change back to scarf one in the left boot and right boot so instead of hat one we left root one and we have a go to specialized for this one and for the right boot same story uh change the go to and the costumes right boot one so yeah so feel free to pause i'll go back to all of these so if you need a pause feel free and these this is the code here's the code for the hat so we have things specialized for the right boot so the right boot um we will make this go to the back later of course because it's behind the snowman it's supposed to be behind the snowman so we're going to make this go to the back later so we put that right inside here and so front layer backward and now i'm going to code the left and right arm so let's get to the left arm and when the green flag is clicked this should be simple enough we go to go forever and ever and we will set mode to draggable and we're going to put this with the right arm but remember to change the position we put this on the right arm and remember to change the position position should be this and we will put this to go to the back layer because the right arm is supposed to be on the back layer so yeah feel free to pause so right now i'm going to do the snow sprite it's going to be constantly falling down so let's draw the snow white do this i mean i do this and then shift and make a small circle and we center this let me see if i can center is this in the center yeah this is centered and now we have the white bright one which is also known as snow and we will go to the snow and we will code it so when the green flag is clicked okay so i'm gonna drag in my forever loop and this is a very important part of the thing so set wind our new variable wind please do not skip for this sprite only and it'll set wind to pick random negative one to positive one so it's going to be yeah the wind will be scattered around and when the green flag is clicked it will set ghost effect to 20 to give it some effect i mean not not 20 100 uh and then you'll go to 0 20 0 which is uh x0 is over here but we're going to use the y and make it 220 so right here on the coordinate plane like around this one and it'll go forever it'll create a clone of myself and i'll wait i'll pick random amount of seconds so wait pick random 0.005 to 0.01 so that's how long it'll take to create another clone so when i start as a clone it will set size to um set this is the right one no no this isn't the right one this is this set size to pick random 70 to 80. you can make it a larger range of what's big and small pieces of snow but 70 to 80 or you can do whatever you want so um i did 70 to 80 in my other one but then the spring was smaller so i'm gonna do 70 to 100 on this one and then it will go to i pick random position so um goes to x oh y should always be on the top it's always going to be up here uh go to x pick random negative 240 and to positive 240. so as you can see negative 240 to positive 240 and it will repeat for it will change ghost effect by most effect my minus 20 and it will repeat two times and change y by where's the change by um here i said change y by minus five and it will go down and change x by wind and now this is going to be the big chunk of code so bear with me here you have a repeat until you have to zoom out for this and since there's so much things we have to use repeat until put up or repeat until it's touching the base or or you put another or to make it three because you do that and you put or touching body so if this is only if you want the snow too when it hits like the arm or the head or the base body or the scarf or anything it will disappear and um it's only if you wanted to do that but you don't have to do it if you want it to phase through the um thing so so we have this and when it is touching body or we have another or touching body or the head and we drag another or and then from the head we put the left we put the left arm and then we put another ore and we put the right arm and we put the right arm so put that inside there right arm go back and put another or and duplicate that instead of right arm do um the hat that's the hat there it is and another or and instead of that we've got the duplicate instead of using the hat we go do the scarf and um after that we put another ore and we put the left boot and we put another ore we put the right boot and we put no more ores and then we put right next to the right boot we have the edge so it'll also disappear when it's touching the edge so um base body head um left arm right arm hat scarf left boot right boot and edge so get that in and let's continue so and let's put and we're going to duplicate this so change y by minus 5 and change x by wind so let's put that there and repeat 10 times it will change ghost effect by 10. and now we will delete this clone right under there and now we're going to get the sound in so when the green flag is clicked i always set the volume to 25 because i'm talking and yeah uh i think i use xylo 2 if i'm not mistaken get this one and it will play xylo 2 until done for wait first go together forever lou i forgot the forever loop where's the forever there we have it and play sound xylo 2 until done and now we are done with our project so let's see if it works or not so so let's do this oh yeah i gotta change the change the variable okay and now we'll start so now let's do this snail is already falling disappearing and it's touching the arms everything pushing the boots touching the edge and we can change the snowman base black gray blue red you get the white body uh head which is just the carrot on the nose and drag on the scarf so you created your own snowman with your own features that you like like the base if your favorite color was blue uh why not change this to blue when i change this to blue why not keep this blue so anyways please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below what else videos you want to see on our channel and um yeah something please not too hard because i have to spend a lot of time doing that and anyways i'll see you guys next time you
