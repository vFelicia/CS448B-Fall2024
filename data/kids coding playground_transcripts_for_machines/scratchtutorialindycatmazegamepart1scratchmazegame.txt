so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding playground today we'll be making an Indiana cat 2 game it's kind of like Indiana Jones so you objective of the game is to get the gem which is right here and avoid all these traps and gets the exit which is right here you can find this game idea and a book called super Scratch programming adventures for more information check this link right here and we'll provide a link to our Google Drive in the description below on downloading these sprites and will be learned today we'll be learning these following concepts and scratch broadcasting messages custom blocks using operators touching colors using a list in your variables so I'll show you guys how the game works I took up I took out the Indiana Jones music because because YouTube can claim her video if we play copyrighted music so I've just decided to take a sound from the library so when you start and types out to say then churches and you can use arrow keys to move around when you get hit until it we're gonna sleep out and same yeah make a mess out so just try to get past all these traps because you can see if you get the key right here gets not a keyhole open then you can get them then you can get the gem and go to the exit OOP here avoid the spike and all these traps are sort of moving and I'll say you won it took you how many seconds and it took you how many attempts so let's go make a new new project so first we need to get all our spread set up you still like the scratch pad I already have everything all the sprites in the backpack you can just load the sprites into here to load the Indiana I can load the gate just drag them into here so now we have everything set up so this is the layout you can just put all this and I forgot the keyhole yeah so now we have everything set up so let's go to the code for the cat the movement so first we'll be working on the movement and also since we put all these stuff in her backpack it's all in the right position so if it's not like this Dragons the right position like this you can do it any way you want of course but we're gonna do it like this and the Indy cat should be 90 size and the whiptail this thing should be 40 size I scaled it correctly that's the best size for them so let's go for the movement for the cat first so for the setup we'll need to make a couple variables so let's get our three variables we do not need the my variable just delete it make a new variable called attempts attempts so this is supposed to count how many attempts it takes it takes for you at the end make a new variable a letter letter that's the that's for so you know how when in the beginning it will type out the word we'll need that for the type text thing and we'll need make a new finally one more variable called timer and the timer supposed to be at the end I'll tell you how fast you completed the game in so and then we'll need one list called words this is for the type text again we'll get on to that later so now I have the variables we can actually start on the cat so I'm going to start on the movement of the cat so when clicked we have to set the attempts to one cuz at the end it'll show us one attempt so just set the attempts of one in the beginning hide the variable attempts hide all the variables in the beginning hide variable timer and set the timer to zero in the beginning so let's start on zero we can show these for now so I can show you how these variables work right now so next we want to set the size from the cat to 90% so hiding the variable is the same as unchecking them so you can either uncheck them in the beginning or anything or you can use the hide fear pool so easy to uncheck or use hide variable so we want to set the size to 90 again set the size to 90 in the beginning I already know I know I already said it's a 90 but if you haven't then you can just put this block right there we want it to go to like somewhere right here I already set the coordinates for it so I've got negative 295 205 native 205 and 150 that those are my coordinates I got it last time and forever loop and this is a movement like um arrow keys WASD so if then if the left arrow key he he left key opt or W the key up arrow or W is pressed that means if either one of these are oops X if either one of these keys are pressed then it will go up so if so we'll change the Y by three so we'll go up huge y by three and if then touching the color want to if then steam it in here if then touching the color of the edge like this thing the edge just select the edge of it that yeah it is touching that color which is 10 color 100 saturation and 95 brightness then it will change the Y by negative 3 so go back so you can't go through the wall so now let's work on the other arrow keys so you can just duplicate this put it right here if then let's say down arrow or s arrow s key is pressed then we'll change the Y by negative 3 mm and oh and if touching that color then I'll change the Y by 3 so you will always want it to be the opposite of it so go back and we'll go through the wall so you can just duplicate this typically both of them so put her here so if the now if the right arrow is press that or the D or D is press then we can change instead of Y with these X because we're going side to side so change the X by threepoint direction of 90 so face the right side and you can just move take this out put the change X by negative 3 in here if it's touching the color so now we have this right arrow now let's work on the left arrow left arrow just pretty much the opposite of it it's pretty much the opposite of this thing duplicate left arrow left arrow key or a is press ok then we can change the X or negative 3 pointing direction of negative 90 so we'll face the left side negative 90 and change X by three opposite so I won't come through the wall so now we have all this for the movement so now I can move left and right up and down you can use the WASD and it can't and when it touches the color it will not go through you can see it will go through the walls you just hide the letter they're gonna look so now let's see it won't go through so that's the movement and let's add we can do the type text thing today so we need to make a new block so today we'll just cover the cat movement and the text type a thing so we can name this type birds type words add two inputs one is one is gonna be told text one is called text and one is called type so two two inputs so you click OK so you have this so in the beginning you want to set the letter to one so you got one letter letter to one and delete all of words sort of delete the word list in the beginning so you want to get the repeat repeat the Len length of text this means they'll repeat however long the text you write is so if you write if you write like hi it's its so repeat two times so you will change so we'll add you need to go to variables add add letter it will add letter letter letter the variable put it into here of the text so add the letter you input to the text to the word list so you want to change the letter by one every time every time you write a new new letter so you change it by one you can take an ifelse statement take it if then I'll stating it put it under here so if type is equal to say which means if the type is equal to same not not thinking so there's two types there's thinking and say if the type this thing is equal to say then I'll say say the words say or say okay say words you'll say the words in the word list you put in and else if it's not if the type is not equal to say if it's not true then I'll think the words so next you can do under here you can do a weight 0.1 seconds just to make it a little slower so people can read it there for 1 seconds wait one second down here and clear clear the words say so what you want to do right here is just clear and then we need to add something else let me zoom in so you guys can see you can stop you're done then we could take a few clicks forever set timer set the variable timer to the sensing timer so the timer will keep on going up secondbysecond mmhmm and in the beginning in the beginning we can um take the type text type words put it right here put the instructions like go get the Chan and escape like that and think so I put think right here so we'll think it not saying so so right here it says if type is equal to say then I'll say it else they'll think so if this is not say then I'll think it so if you put anything right here it will still think so let's play it I'll think she's thinking and say go get the gem and escape and type it up and the movements don't works and if you show the variable timer it's actually going up right here see so we'll actually stop right here so right now we have the movement the type text words and the timer done so tomorrow in the next video we will work on the UM work on the like the other deep the traps will work on the traps and the walk and the keys next time so I'll see you guys in the next video thanks to you guys for watching and please like share and subscribe to our Channel and I'll see you guys next time thank you for watching
