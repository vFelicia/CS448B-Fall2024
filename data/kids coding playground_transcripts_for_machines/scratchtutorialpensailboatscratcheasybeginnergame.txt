so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding playground today we'll be doing a pen sailboat we'll be making like a pencil i'll show you guys up close so it will like draw a little sailboat with pen this is a beginner's tutorial on how to use pen so i'll play that one more time i'll show you guys so pretty much a pen sailboat it's pretty cool so let's make a new project first of all we will not need the scratch cap just delete the scratch cat then we want to get the ball ball this one this ball sprite um and then we got one flag clicked go to zero zero the center the origin of the coordinate plane then we can set the size to 20 percent so it isn't too big and oh yeah i forgot renamed your project to pen pen uh i can't spell pen sale boat so pen sailboat just rename your project get a one flat click go to zero zero set the size to 20 and we will need the pen extension so to add the pen extension um just go to your click the extension i already have it right here but all you do is click the extension button and click pen then you have the pen extension right here so in the beginning you want to erase all so it'll erase all the pen uh you guys can set it to any pen color i'm just setting it to green because i like green i'm going to set the color to green you guys can set it to any color you'd like and then i'm going to set the pen size to 20 so it'll be like a little thicker line and then get pen down so pen down is making it draw pen up is the lifting up the pen and erase also erase everything so next you want to like glide to x y positions so we want to draw it in like a sailboat formation so we want to glide 0.5 seconds seconds to about maybe 150 so maybe like 150 you kind of gotta like predict and play with numbers sometimes when you're doing with gliding so we wanted to go to x 150 and the y to zero just keep it the same so as you can see when you play um it will just move to the right 150 like that and then we can get another glide 0.5 seconds and we're just gonna go maybe um 0.5 seconds to x zero so it won't go to any to the right or left and then we want the y to go 150 so let's see see that so x is 0 y to 150 it will go up as you can see um and next we will be getting a another glide you can just duplicate this actually just put it under here um glide 0.5 seconds we can set the um x to negative 150 just playing around with numbers here and y to zero so now we'll make like a little triangle that's not complete um so like make a little triangle incomplete triangle but that's okay we will keep on going um but another one under here this time we'll go to x5 and y0 oops y0 x5 so move to the right a little bit more so it'll close into the triangle like that see that now the triangle is completely finished so we want to make the x5 so if i were to put this to x0 the triangle will not be completely closed up as you can see wait never mind so it actually does close up but i thought that it would not close up but whatever let's continue i'll just keep it at five i think zero would be fine also i thought it didn't close up because before i tried it i put zero zero on it it didn't completely close up so i'll just you guys can keep it at zero or five or whatever but i'm keeping it at 5 so next you want to get another glide you just duplicate this and then we change the x to 5 and maybe negative 70. just to move the ball down a little like maybe right here negative 70s probably right here and we can glide another 0.5 seconds um maybe negative 150 negative 170 so we can like draw the base of the boat so once it draws a triangle go down here and glide here so we can finish the base of the boat so i'm going to duplicate this again and then instead of negative 150 we can do like maybe glide x to negative 100 and the y to negative 140. so when i i'm going to play it again it glides somewhere maybe right here yeah we're here um so then we want to make it glide right here maybe we can make it glide oops and duplicate this add a comment so now instead of negative 100 we can make glide to 150 like where this is and then negative 140 keep it at the same y position and then duplicate i'm going to duplicate these two put it down here and then maybe we can go to 170x position like right here somewhere y negative 70. so go back up a little bit the same y position as this go back up here and finally we can close the boat base by moving five x and y negative seventy so as you can see when you play it oops accidentally made the wrong coordinates this was supposed to be negative 70 not negative 140 so let's play it now it should be a pen sailboat there you go this is a simple project you can make with pen not too hard to make so thank you guys for watching if you enjoyed this video leave it leave a like on this video and please subscribe to your channel and see you guys in the next video you
