welcome back guys it's kids going playground here and today we're back for another video of scratch and today we made this epic game called dragon's jungle which is a new game that we'll be posting on my uh scratch account and so you guys can play it and you guys can make it yourself in this tutorial i'll be telling you how to make dragon's jungle we were busy and we went on vacation so now we're back so then we can make some more content for the channel and now uh i'm going to be showing you what dragon's raid is basically about so you're this wizard and you try to blast out the skeletons and and then you see whenever they die they make a sound right and then the stars wherever you click they will go if you click up here they'll go and whatever skeletons yeah the skeleton has my life tool that it has it takes more time to kill than the bat and then once you wipe out the other peons the uh big dude comes out the dragon and then you see you have to start blasting the dragon and you see hp and he goes uh quite uh slowly but he will one shot you no matter how much lodge you are and you will always lose but if you kill him you win so we'll try to kill him right now okay i'm going to kill him real quick oh my gosh so close okay okay i'll be back i'll be back guys i'm killed so i forgot to tell you guys you have to get more than 250 points to fight the epic boss battle so uh this time i'll actually beat the dragon i'll be right back so as you can see i'm about to kill him i'm taunting for a little bit loser loser player oh my gosh okay will you win see i did it in yellow color instead of green color because it's just like yellow because the background is green so anyways let's get started so i made a new project and guys let's be untitled 43 more like dragons jungle and now of course we don't ever need the scratch cat only in like rare occasions but we're going to start with we're gonna get these uh sprites quick uh so let's get the wizard which is uh over here the wizard i know it's kind of big i don't know how big my wizard is i don't know how big let me see uh 50 so move this 50 we'll get every we see all the sprites right now we should be good and um uh the star we have a star where's the stars and then we have the star and we have the skeleton i'll draw the gigantic hitbox i'll explain everything in a moment skeleton uh bat and dragon so let's go get the bat and dragon i think i need to change the size of some things like the bat i'm pretty sure this thing's 50 not mistaken yeah 50 it is and and now let's get this done oh skeleton's also 50 i think let me see 75 skeleton 75 and now let's get everything started so backdrop you want to get is forest it's the one that i use one yeah so it's because it's the dragon's jungle and another uh yeah so just get the dragon uh jungle the dragon's jungle and then now we have two sprites to make but i'll make the you win you lose bright later but let's right now uh paint a new sprite that is um so uh so you have this take a random like green color why not you make the sprite and no no outline so you make a gigantic uh green thing a more like a green uh sprite and it's the hit box actually not the hitbox the thing that lets you shoot your stars which is really useful because the stars normally uh like if you click it'll just go exactly where you click and it'll explode there but if you don't have this that means you won't be able to control your stars where you want your stars it'll just go straight forward so we don't want any of that so now let's get the code started so when the green flag is clicked we will uh go to zero zero because it's just a gigantic green screen and go to the back layer so then be behind everything go to back layer it will set ghost effect to 100 to a hundo and hide because it has to be hidden the whole entire thing because nobody wants a green screen blocking wherever they're shooting and then forever it will if then the mouse is down like if it you click pull down if you're clicking right now if the mouse is down that means it'll set new variable x new variable y and yeah x and y so set x to mouse x which is basically the coordinates of your oh no you the coordinates of your uh mouse so you want to set y and instead of mouse x drag in the mouse y and broadcast shoot star and wait because this is this whole entire sprite is dedicated to the star and now we're done with this code now all we have to work on the wizard and the wizard should be quite easy it does not have much code so when the green flag is clicked uh it will go to x okay i have coordinates it's going to be on the right side so 1 90 negative 40. and it will set rotation cell left right if you remember in our old videos we always use this block so it will not flip over because if without this and you set that direction to negative 90 that means it would flip over and we do not want that so set point direction negative 90 because it's pointing to the left side and so the right side and then try to kill the bats and skeletons coming from the left side so and we have point direction negative 90 and then it'll set new variable lives and score so we're going to make set lives to five say five lives so if you get hit by five times from the skeleton or the bat that means you lose a life and if you get hit by the dragon you automatically lose and then score so if you set you have to set the score to zero because you don't you didn't kill anything yet so you start zero and then uh you'll go to front layer because it's just the wizard you don't want it to be like behind a bunch of stuff that you don't want it to be behind and when i receive shoot star i'll switch costume to wizard c so it's this costume like like pointing and then that's where it shoots the uh thing cost you to wizard c wait 0.5 seconds and switch back to wizard a and we're done with the wizard next thing up is the star and the star has a decent amount of code we're just gonna work on this real quick and when the green flag is clicked i'm not sure if you can see this i'm gonna zoom in for you guys this reflect is clicked it'll hide and then it will when i receive shoot star it will oh you need two shoots arms uh so when i receive shoot star it'll go to the front layer so then it's in front of like the dragon and all that stuff all that good stuff and go to the front layer and then go to the wizard because you want it comes out the wizard right he has magical spells so it gets out of the wizard and it will show and start sound magic spell but magic spell see look it's the star so start sound magic spell and then glide glides 0.5 seconds to where the coordinates of the star is and remember that when we put it over here that's where mouse x in mouse y is so basically x equals mouse x and y equals mouse y so it will be like this and then you want to make it hide and next we have what another one i receive shoot star this time delete all this code and then repeat 30 times 30 costumes of itself to make those beautiful trailing stars and it'll create a clone of myself and then when i start as a clone it'll point in direction so it will point direction 0 to 300 360 because it could go all around it can keep on rotating because it's a star and it spins so you can make it like that and then repeat 10 change color effect by 25 and then it will move five steps every single time so then you'll go closer and closer to where your mouse was and it'll start blinking because the color effect will change it and then the ghost effect makes it way better the ghost effect is just really good the ghost effect makes it more dimmer and dimmer so it will go away and fade away so which makes it uh really effective and cool so you set ghost effect to five and delete this clone i think this game was dedicated to um actually halloween so as you can see we have mr wizard blasting my finger and we have the it's glitching right now sorry guys my computer's lagging really hard so i made this really big mistake and i found out why i was lagging and making all these lag sounds is because you need to wait so i always get mixed up with this so if you're new to our channel uh get used to that so broadcast shoot star and wait so then it won't have the lagged sound see look it won't create too many clones when you click on it and now it doesn't have a loud sound and get distorted and all that stuff and uh now next thing is the skeleton this is the biggest chunk of code in the whole entire game which is just takes a while to do so when the green flag is clicked it will hide go forever create clone of myself and it will wait a pick random seconds to spawn a skeleton in so wait how many seconds pick random you choose but i went 0.5 to 0.75 so it's very consistent and makes the game a challenge and now we have this piece of code to make so when i start as a clone it'll set skeleton hp new variable for this sprite only because it's only the skeleton so uh skeleton hp i'm is that high small skeleton yeah it is i think yeah and then when i start as a clone it will set skeleton hp to 300. 300 and repeat until so uh the reason of this is because if you set it for all sprites you'll deplete all the skeletons in line and the clones will be useless and so you want to make all the clones have its own set of 300 hp for you to use so and then now we have a repeat until lou uh it will touch the wizard still touching the wizard so it will always target the wizard and the next costume will start walking right i think i deleted a costume at this point no i didn't know that that was something next costume and wait 0.5 seconds and now we have when i start as a clone so this is the biggest chunk of code which is just gigantic so when i start as a clone it will go to x i have coordinates so negative 175 so that's around here right x what negative 175 but the y's pick random from 100 negative 100 which is down around down here to positive 25 so it's all like up here so they will start so then it makes it a challenge for you to um do that and let me hide these variables real quick score uh i think live lives here score because it makes it a challenge for you because if all the skeletons spawned just like that then you just do one projectile and you killed like all of them but then if they spawn like around around here you have to start moving your mouse around so yeah that's how you work that and then now it's show you have a show and it will repeat until it is touching the wizard and it'll point towards the wizard so it'll go towards the wizard and it will always try to target the wizard no matter what so it will point and i know point towards wizard and now we have move two steps so then it'll keep on moving towards the wizard and try to kill the wizard and or knock out the wizard and then if you need it if then this is really big guys sorry you need it if then um if then if you're touching the wizard then it will this is a very tricky part hit wizard you have to start this oh i don't know hi wizard hit wizard uh and then you have a sprite called hit wizard i mean variable it's called hit wizard it'll set hit wizard to why because whenever it touches the wizard it will hit it right so and oh broadcast hit wizard this new broadcast message so broadcast hit wizard and then now you delete the clone because whenever the skeleton attacks the wizard it will get deleted because we just want that because or else because like they had a fight with the wizards and then they decided and they got lost to the wizard because good guys always win and so that's what we did here so then uh now we need a if then statement down below the wizard the hit wizard and if then it's touching the star then it will change skeleton hp by minus 10. so don't worry guys i know the skeleton hp has a 300 and this is 10 so it does not take uh that many hits to kill the skeleton because there's multiple of those little star things so it will take like around three or four hits i would say or two two to three two to four so yeah that's what i'm estimating so don't worry it won't take that much hits and then you need a uh if then statement right inside there if then it's you know or i'll explain this after when i'm done coding and you need an or you need an equal sign and you need uh less than so if then the like we've done this so much time so so if the skeleton hp equals zero or if the skeleton hp is less than zero then it will start sound rattle it comes with the skeleton so it's easy to get and change score by five new variable no no we are change score by five and the bat only gets one so it's just like something different that we tried out today and we need it if then like right in there and then if then feel free to pause guys i might be going too quick for you guys or too slow for you guys so then you guys can speed the video up if i'm going too slow and pause if i'm going too fast and if the score is greater than 250 the dragon comes into play and we'll do the dragon in a minute we just have to do the bat which is really simple so let's make a new broadcast message show the dragon show and yeah and then now delete this clone where is that delete this clone there we go and we're done with this and another delete this clone in the end and now we have a one a few more scripts for the wizard i mean the skeleton so let's get that finished and so it's when i receive when i receive hit wizard all done to hide the variable when i receive hit wizard if you need a gigantic if then statement if the wizard was hit equals y so wizard hit wizard equals y everything's coming from the skeleton then it'll change lives by minus one because that's your lives going down by minus one so the thing is that the reason you need hit wizard is like say if there's a bat coming towards you like we've had this glitch so it's not really a glitch but like we've had this coding a bunch of times and it hits you you lose like what like 50 hp like 5 hp whatever how many times i was touching it so we want to make this hit wizard thing to make it better and it will only delete one life and now you need a if another if then statement and you put up or smack dab in the middle and you need a zero uh you need an equal sign if lives equals zero or if lives are less than zero zero is greater than your lives then it will broadcast game over so you lost if that happens to you game over we'll code the game over after we're done with everything and set hit wizard to a because you didn't hit him multiple times he only hit him once and when i received uh show dragon stop other scripts in this bite spray and delete this clone that's for a little bit later so if you don't mind coding this real scr uh real quick so you don't have to do it later a little bit later and now we're done with the skeleton now the bat is much simpler than the skeleton okay so um i'm gonna be doing the skill of the bat code so the bat code is just the skeleton rebound oh yeah i have to show you guys look as you can see look there's skeletons coming from all over the place and killing them and look they hit me i lose a life so yeah um that's basically the concept of this right now and right now we have to code the fat and we take this whole entire thing we need to make some changing but it's not much so bear with me and we take this whole entire thing and we take this whole entire thing it's not that much but like i'm just trying to and then we take this whole entire thing we have to do some changing when we get there so we should have four scripts here so let's see yeah we have four scripts i'm pretty sure this needs some changing so if you don't mind me uh i'll do some changing and then it's it'll go to this you know bats are flying right they fly so basically you want to pick the random by 50 to 150 because it's in the air and touching wizard yeah that should be fine delete this phone oh yes and this part it doesn't have hp right so i'm actually going to take out all like basically all of this in this so we're gonna redo this and then it'll have starts it'll have start sound owl because that's the sound that it has here and then it will change score okay let me just take out all of this i'll just change score by one because you kill that that gives less score and you delete this clone and then you delete this clone so delete this clone and you have this delete this button down here so that's what you have for the album i mean the bat so this you take out okay so i'm gonna so you take out this because it does not have any skeleton hp because it's not a skeleton so you have this and yeah oh and that's fun slower than skeletons and we make that a whole entire one and yeah so this is basically the bat code so now let's see see there's bats and skeletons coming right at us and we have to take care of them and yeah this is basically what i coded so let's move on to the dragon so the dragon has some code as well some actually pretty much the same code as a skeleton that may not seem good but a lot like takes around the same time to code so let's start the dragon and um the dragon so you when the green flag is clicked you have to make a new variable called dragon hp the dragon has hp too and it'll set it'll show i mean it'll hide the variable dragon hp in the beginning because you haven't fought the dragon yet it takes awesome score to fight the dragon and it will go to x negative 170 and negative 50. and it will go to no way i just did that and it will hide and set the dragon hp to 6 000 you can if you were looking for a challenge you can set it to like ten thousand or something but if you want it to be more easier decrease it to three thousand so it'll be easier for you to beat and for now i'm just gonna set this down to like maybe a thousand because i'm doing some testing in the end to show you guys that the dragon works and then when i receive uh show dragon then it will repeat until touching wizard touching wizard you know go next costume and wait 0.5 seconds and now we have that all right so i forgot to do something earlier and it keeps on changing costumes delete bat d and bat a so it'll just look like it's flying continuously so yeah and now we work on the dragon and the dragon so now we have the big script of code to work with and let's do this so we have two scripts finished and now we have when i receive show dragon it will show variable it'll show the variable of show variable dragon age speed it will show and it will repeat until touching the wizard and then you so repeat until touching wizard and it will move two steps for 0.5 seconds every 0.5 seconds it'll move two steps and now we have that finished we have another piece of thing to do um coding all the small scripts first so when i receive show dragon go forever and it'll play sound grunt which is a sound here and it'll play sound run until done and wait five seconds before playing the sound grunt again and now uh when i receive all right so and then now we uh do when i receive show dragon it'll go forever and you know if then uh it's touching the star it will change dragon hp by 10 and since it attacks multiple times the star they'll do more than 10 damage and you need it if then you need if then under that if then the dragon hp the dragon hp equals zero equals zero or less than zero oh yeah uh then we will um hide because it died right and oh broadcast you win and we have broadcasting with and it'll stop this script because it has a forever loop and we do not like forever loops to be all broken stop the script so we put it right under here this script and then under two of these it will be an if then and if it's touching the wizard then it will broadcast game over so you automatically lose once the wizard i mean the dragon uh gets you so oh it's already game over i was like searching for that and then it'll stop the script right here we have two more scripts to code here and then when when i receive you win then it'll stop other scripts in the sprite and then if you lose it'll also stop all the scripts on the spread and now let's try this game we want to stop the forever loops too so that it will stop and we don't want forever loops going forever and now we just have to make the you win you lose right so oh yes uh please copy down this code oh yeah and please do not set your dragon hp to a thousand i'm just trying to prove my point that you can win this uh uh game by killing the dragon i'll show you guys later so uh you guys change it to whatever six thousand three thousand you can set it to a thousand if you want but like i'm just doing this for testing so if you wanna be original to the game go six 000 instead of 1000 so copy down on this code feel free to pause and now let's do the you win and you lose sprite this was something different for me because instead of writing uh you lose i decided to write game over i don't know why but okay so let's write game oh this is i normally like to do handwriting for this so game and we i think that's big right is that good size that's good and then you duplicate this costume and you you shift and then you get the whole thing you delete it and write you win but instead you double click the uh you get all of it and you change it to the color you want but i decided to go a bright yellow because the background is green so we go that and we have you in so let's get the code done here so it's like every other game that we do so you should be able to follow along so when i receive this one of the green flags it's hide you know go to x0 y0 right in the middle and then when i receive game over it will go to the front layer switch costume to costume one uh show and stubble and you duplicate that we are so close to finishing you win go to the front layer switch costume to costume two and let's get this started okay so you see let's take get rid of these skeletons and uh bats so let's get rid of them and let's get so all right so i'm going to lose first let's just lose real quick and see if this works one two three four five and game over so i'm just gonna kill a bunch of things and i'll be right back i'm just gonna get to the dragon to show you guys you can win so i'm gonna change the score down to 50 to prove my point that this works so let's do this and let's go and i just have to kill some mobs and i think it's pretty much finished and you see my life live went down just then and you see the dragon was 1000 hp and you know we're about to kill him and it says you win so the concept of this game works right now and let me just change all this thing and remember guys change this to 250 so it's back to normal or if you're looking for a challenge should you like 500 or if you're not looking for challenges like 100 or something and here uh i mean the dragon you have to change this to 6 000 if you're going original with the game and we have everything done here and please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below what else games you want next and remember guys see you guys next time one more thing uh if you have any uh questions about the project or anything and if you want to compare the code to see if you're right uh go to my project uh go to my account scratch account gumball 098 and then go to my project i should have shared this one and you guys can copy the code down if you didn't get everything that we said in the video so any of you guys anyways guys see ya you
