so welcome back guys it's kidscodingplayground here today we'll be working on another scratch tutorial so we're going to make a game called keep it up so what you do is you don't need your keyboard or mouse or anything like that all you need is your hands or your head or something like that so the ball will be bouncing around the screen and you're supposed to use your hands and head and the video sensing will show up and you you move your hands and stuff like that to make the ball keep on bouncing and every hit you get increases the score right here and when the ball touches the ground it's game over so without further ado let's get on to the demo no face reveal yet so i'll be wearing this devil mask for now okay let's start okay so basically you just use your hands or something like that and then you just knock the ball up as you can see um and when it touches the green is getting over let's okay let me stop this one so guys we are going to delete the scratch cap for us so let's delete it and next let's go get the video extension go into the extensions and import this one so now you have the video okay and next we're gonna import some sprites so what i got was this thing it's just the ground i just drew a rectangle with green that's basically what i did okay so for the backdrops i have this is one white backdrop as the main one so this is the one with the video so we're gonna just import another backdrop i thought so all i did was just make it blue and right game over with it and center the game over okay so that's what i did for here so you guys can do that on your own and then we're going to get a soccer ball now so just search up soccer ball this one so just take that so you can see the soccer ball okay now we can work on the code so in the soccer ball we can get our one green flag clicked let's zoom in and we're going to get switch backdrop to the backdrop one first which is the starting backdrop we can rename this backdrop to start if you would like start okay and next in the soccer ball after you switch to start i'm going to make it go to a random position so let's go to pick random negative 200 to 200 200 and we're going to set the y to 100 in the beginning and then after that we're going to point in direction of 180 so let's do that 180 so 180 and then we're going to make a new variable called score for all sprites score so we can set the score to zero in the beginning and then we're gonna turn the video on and it's already on right now as you can see so like if you start a new project video on the previous one it will automatically add it for you and then we're going to set the video transparency like 20 20 so then it's easier um it's not completely like think so it's a little bit um faded as you can see it's a little less and then we're gonna make it wait two seconds before starting wait two seconds and after that we're going to get a forever loop when uh move 10 steps and if on edge we want to bounce okay so this is the ball as you can see let's play it the ball start bouncing around after that okay and next we're going to detect when you touch it or not like the motion okay now let's work on the motion of the thing so like when it when the motion is greater than 10 then the ball will start bouncing off your hand or your body parts and then it's gonna change the score by one every single time you touch it change score by one and then we're going to play the sound boeing in the sound library or we can just use the basketball bounce this one's fine as well pick whatever sound you would like and after that we're going to do point direction point in direction of the uh video direction on sprite okay and then we're going to wait 0.5 seconds so every time i touch this as you can just start playing that balance sound sound so like every time the motion is greater than 10 it will bounce as you can see and then i'm gonna get a one green flag clicked so i'm gonna i guess i can like take this out for now because like i'll put it back in later okay that's like it might be a little bit annoying for you guys so next we're going to get the score like we can know like this when you touch the ground we will get this so when greenfly clicked oh yeah and we can wait 0.5 seconds right here forgot to do that so then it's a little bit weight it's really hard to breathe in this mask and then we're going to get an if then statement so if if touching ground touching ground touching the ground which is the thing and i forgot to mention put a forever loop around this thing forever loop and if touching ground you can play uh we're gonna get a sound called drum bass too that's the one i used for the previous one drum bass to this one so if it's touching the ground we'll play this sound so start this and we're going to turn the video off once that happens turn the video off once it touches the ground and we're going to switch the backdrop to game over as you can see right here with the game over one so we're gonna do switch backdrop to game over and we're gonna stop all so now let's test it out so i'm gonna put this back in save let's play as you can see it's gonna be bouncing around and as you see i'm not gonna touch it i'm gonna move out of the way as you can see when it touches the ground it's game over so yeah that's it for this tutorial i hope you guys enjoyed learning with us please like share and subscribe and we'll see you guys in the next video bye you
