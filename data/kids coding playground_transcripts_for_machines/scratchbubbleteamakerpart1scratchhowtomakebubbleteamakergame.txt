thank you hello welcome to kiss calling playground channel so today we'll be introducing a brand new game called Bubble tea maker in this game the player will get a chance to run their own bubble tea shop creating and serving variety of delicious string to a customer and player will learn about different ingredients and recipe and art making bubble tea um so get ready to become a bubble tea Master okay all right so I guess you guys have seen the demo that we did last week so today we're gonna start doing the coding for it okay without further Ado let's go and start making our game okay so you can go to this uh uh game here this is like a template game but we doesn't have any code and you can just remix this game okay I will have all the links in the below in the description of the video so for now let's get on to the project so for me since I'm on my own account I will not be able to remix it what I will do is I'm gonna say save as a new copy all right so I am going to change it to maybe called teaching two okay okay so we have to uh start with creating some variable first so some of the variable we need uh so for this game so make sure this one is for all Sprite so we're gonna say uh change change color okay and then next one we are going to use a create as a customer counter so the first variable change color is for us too when we make different drinks for the different customer we can change the costume with color without drawing more costume okay these are the two variables you will need for now and also let me go through some of the Sprites for you guys so we want to custom here you have the standing that the cat this is like turn one turn two like the cat turn and this one is like give one so where we move the hand of the cat so that they can give the bubble tea to the customer later okay and we have the second costume we have the uh first customer second customer third fourth fifth so basically I just took the uh sprite from the backpack I mean from the library and copy and paste it here the third one is the uh this is like the tapioca scoop so here I actually uh draw this one so we have the wooden handle here if you break this apart and group you can see there's a just this is a lighter color brown I put it on top of here and then this is just a connected and then you have little little Black Pearl here and these are the uh you know just line that I drew and then using the uh reshape tool to reshape it you know in the you know the little scoop okay all right so you guys understand this part so next part this is the tap yoga Pearl so this is just a little black uh or a round circle I drew next is the cup so we have to custom the cup so the first cup is without any bubble and then second third fourth and fifth and sixth costume and then you have the tea pot so the teapot is from the online uh downloaded to the PNG file remove the background and we have the teacup so the tea cup is uh when we after when we start filling the tea we can fill up the cups and then we can change costume each time and make it go up you know to different costume right and then at the very end here we can start filling up the uh the syrup and then at the very end we have the cover on top and this is the tea so this is a tea Sprite so basically a 10 and then the same color as the tea and then we have the syrup surface the picture here I just added this little orange to the to the to the syrup and then we have the syrup as well this is also a little like a line 10 with a colored zero then I have a straw so the straw I drew the straw uh as a kind of a little bit sharp with the straw and you can see the rounded um in the reshaped to the arrow and then you can see that I made it go down a little bit so from top to down and then look like we can poke the hole through the bubble tea right so that's for that and then we have the table table just a table uh also I got it from online uh just remove the background and then I just draw another uh like a square box with a gray color kind of thing in the back so for that look like it's insane something like that up for the cat to stand on and then this is the icon so basically I just took the cup tea put it here and then we're gonna use that for the icon and then the rain so the rain part is uh it's like this so we just let me show you real quick so you have the color let's say I made I made this um blue you can see I go back you can see that line starts here and then in the second one costume you go back you can see that it's in the next line so basically we do one line so let's say we copy this line uh here and then I put paste it here you can see that okay the first line is like this the second line kind of a little bit overlaps the first line and continue basically uh keep going down down until we get to the very end so um let me delete the this one so at the very end you know we can actually see so here you have the uh and then the last one you see the three little longer dots so basically we drop down and we create a splash for the ring so we probably have a video later on to do like how to do the brain effect so you guys can learn from that all right okay so I I hope you guys understand all the uh subscribe for this game and then in the background the backdrop is just like the different let me just duplicate I don't want to mess up the one so here I just have like some bamboo I got from online so here you can just paste the bamboo like this just kind of designed it the the one on top I just rotated on top you know just rotate this like this and then just just drag it and place it in here okay so that's how I did it I made a little stand for the for the backdrop and that's everything we have okay all right let's start coding foreign first so here we will do uh when green flag is clicked so this is going to be a couple of series for this uh game so it's a little bit more complicated so I do a couple of series for this and I will say set the change color to zero so first I don't have to change any color so we're gonna go with the uh you know orange color with the flavor and then next one we'll change different color next uh we'll have something called um we switch to the stand so we'll switch to the First costume where he's standing then next we'll put in the syntax less like some bubble tea okay and you can do two second or three seconds I think original game I have three seconds so that you can see and then next I just say hey clicked to feel increase okay so this will click and then you have to fill the ingredients and then it will be able to make the bubble tea next will you broadcast a message called foreign so this one is where the customer walks in so we'll go back to the next we'll go to the customer Sprite so in the customer Sprite we just broadcast customer walkin so we're gonna make this customer can't walk inside so before we do that let's make a my block so make a new block called move customer so we use this my block so that we could use it later again so um when we use this in the next uh after the first Sprite you know that the drinks the next customer come in we can recreate this you know call this block again to do the same thing all right so next we say go to pack layer so basically we want the customer the behind the table and everything right so we say go to back layer then we say set the customer at this location we'll say negative 200. so negative 200 is somewhere like right here in the back here okay then we say show so we're going to hide the customer in the beginning so that's why in this show so let me create that first let's do this so switch so we're going to move it to the First costume first so when green practice click I do this and we'll say hi so we'll probably do this one first so sorry about that I got this one here first and after that we have something called we're gonna Glide the customer say Glide uh two seconds and we go to negative 50 and 25 so it will come like somewhere right here okay then next we're gonna broadcast a message call stop so this will actually start our game okay then you remember we broadcast a message earlier say what customer walks in so we're gonna have to do that so when customers walks in we're gonna broadcast we're going to call this method so now if I actually run this game you can see that the cat is talking say let's make some bubble tea let's click click and to fill the ingredients and then you'll see the customer walks in so you can see that right all right so that's what we have so far foreign flag is clicked we're gonna hide this one so we're gonna hide this uh Sprite in the beginning and then we we broadcast earlier we broadcast start right so we're gonna say when I receive start uh what I'm going to do is I'm going to hide again so that later I can use this to reuse took uh for the next custom so and then next I'll say wait one second and then I will say put down point in Direction 90 so that you know when the scope comes up you know how we have the scoop you know later down we will turn the scoop so in the beginning we'll do 90 so that way the scope is kind of horizontal and then later we'll we'll rotate it to the top to drop the bubble okay so that's why we need that then we'll say go to we're gonna go to 180 and 40y so somewhere in the right side around here next we're going to say show okay and we're gonna Glide in so we're gonna say Glide one second two zero and forty so basically this this little scoop will kind of Glide in from here it will glide into here okay then we have something called we can use this block called wait until so basically you're gonna wait whatever condition is here until that is satisfied and it will move on to the next block so we're going to say wait until Mouse down so basically when the user click on the mouse and hold it a little bit and then this thing will run then what we're going to do is we're going to move back a little bit like one second and we'll move it back to 65 and we'll keep it around 40 so that's where the wire is so we'll we'll go when you click on it it will move back a little bit then we're going to rotate It To The Top then I'm gonna say rotate repeat 10 times and then here what we're going to do is we're going to rotate to the left and we'll say rotate 5 degree okay then after that click on broadcast a new event so this is more of an animation kind of thing and some interaction but you have to keep all your events straight if not you don't have a lot of trouble so we're gonna say drop tappy oh okay so be sure you give a good name for all your events okay so now let's run it again so we don't actually have to run the whole code again we can just click this when the screen flag is start then we'll click this and just test our code you can see that the club the mouse down is waiting for Mouse sounds not doing anything so when I click on it you see it move back and it kind of rotate to the top all right so that's what we have so far okay next we'll move to the uh tapioca so for the tapioca we're going to start with when green flag is clicked okay or for this one we're gonna have to create a new variable so make sure you select for this Sprite only okay that's why important I make a lowercase so that I know it's for the Sprite only so this is where we use the counter so we can count how many of this little uh top yoga we're gonna drop so and then we can use that counter to do something later so we're going to say set the counter to zero we're gonna hide this right now and then we are going to hide the this type yoga Pro so earlier we have something called drop top yoga right from this scoop when we receive drop tapioca we're gonna set the counter back to zero as well and then we'll start the game so to zero so we always need this because later on when we call the game to we do everything We're not gonna call this anymore so that's why we need to reset it here so reset then we are going to say repeat 10 times create a column myself and then I'm going to do a little weight so that you can kind of see each little uh little top yoga drop down and we're going to increase the count so change the counter by one next uh we're going to do we're going to add an if condition here so in this if condition what we want to do is we're going to start when the counter gets to three we're gonna start broadcasting a message to change the cup and start filling of the tapioca okay so we're gonna say counter is equal to three then we broadcast a new message called field tab okay and then we're gonna broadcast a new message called start t okay and next we'll since we create a clone myself so I will need something say when I create when I start as a clone so when I start as a club I'm gonna go to zero zero so what the tapioca is zero zero next I'm gonna say show next I'm gonna say repeat until and then I'm gonna say touching cup so here make sure we're touching this cup and not the teacup so the teacup let's just hide the teacup for now and the cup let's open it up okay all right so we're gonna say change y five minus five so this will make the tapioca fall down and then when they touch the cup we're gonna start a sound pop to delete the Clone so whenever you use the Clone you have to delete the clock okay all right so now let's just try it out uh in a bit so we still have to fill the cups right so let's finish the cup and then we'll try it out so in the cup so let's go to the cup and then we're gonna stop the video later and then we'll continue next time so in the cup say when green flag is clicked we are going to hide the cup so I'm not sure the cup in the beginning uh and then we're gonna create a new block my block so cup setup so this will set up the cup every time you know uh the game start we'll have to call this and also when the new customer come with the call so for the cup setup I'm gonna say um go to front layers and the cup is in front of the table and we are going to switch to costume number one which is the cup without any bubble this one okay and then we are going to put it at this location and then we're gonna add the word show okay and then when I receive start so you remember we have an event called start in the beginning when the customer walks in and we have start then we have we call this cup set up okay now that we we had something called field tapioca here right field tapioca we haven't do start T so that's for you next time so fill tap yoga so when the little tap you could drop to the third trap you're gonna start broadcast how it feels happy yoga so here what we're going to do is when I receive Phil tapioca here I'm gonna switch to costume number one uh next I'm gonna say show and then I will say repeat five times and then next costume and then move to a weight uh 0.27 so I repeat five times because I have six costume one two three four five and then six so I start in here I report five times okay all right so let's try this out again let's run this again real quick so I'll say make some bubble tea let's click click to fill the ingredients so first the customer walks in and you see the cup comes here then you see the scoop here we'll click on this so you can hear that it dropped the cup I will drop the bubble and then start filling the cups so this is where we are so far so next time our next episode will work on adding the tea and everything okay so if you guys do like the video please give us a thumbs up and give a comment below so you like also really appreciate if you could uh go to my project and give a give a favorite on lights on the project all right okay thank you guys see you guys next time bye
