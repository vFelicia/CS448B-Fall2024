so welcome back to another scratch tutorial from kids coding playground today we'll be doing a video on making a game called sharks and minnows this is how it looks like so the objective is to you're the shark you control it with the mouse pointer and you try to eat as much fish as you can and there's a score tracking right here so in sharks and minnows you'll be learning these following concepts understanding broadcast messages using variables using the random operator block custom blocks and we'll need the and we'll also be using the touching color block so without further ado let's get started on the video so i would like to show a demo of how the game looks so you move with the mouse pointer try to eat the fish as you can see the you can only eat the fish if it touches the mouth of the shark some fishes travel faster than others so yeah that's our demo let's get on to our project let me make a new project right now okay so first we won't need the scratch yet we can rename this untitled project to maybe sharks okay so next we might need to pick a backdrop choose spectrum i would choose the underwater one under water yeah underwater too then we'll need to pick our sprites we obviously need the fish and sharks we'll need four sprites for the fish because we can add different types of fish at different at different speeds so first let me find the shark shark two and we will need the fish we can duplicate duplicate duplicate okay well all the fish will have the same code okay for the shark first we need to work on the artwork first we will need this c we only need these two costumes okay so let me zoom in and i have to fill up all the white teeth with red so the fish can sense the red and the fish will disappear because there might be some white in the background which could just can make the fish disappear even though it's not in contact with the shark i also don't want to use the if touching shark block because what if a shark the shark is touching a fish and the fish hit its tail that doesn't necessarily mean the shark ate the fish so let me work on the shark's teeth i'll just pick a red color so this is my shark i colored the teeth red so i also have to do it for this one too so okay now i'm done with the two costumes with the t let's move on to the code so first we'll need it if one flag clicked we need to set this we need to make a variable called score so we need to keep track of the score of the shark eating the fish so we can show the variable set the score to zero in the beginning obviously we can change the size to 150 in the beginning set the size to 150 so it could be a bit bigger than the fish we have to set the rotation to left right because if you don't then the shark can turn upside down if you move the mouse pointer up so you want to set the rotation style to left and right sorry okay next you want to switch costume to sharp to a which is the the regular one and then just the opening mouth one we want to keep it on the first costume shark a we'll need to drag a forever loop and it'll point towards mouse pointer so that means the shark will follow wherever you're not your mouse is see it's turning towards the mouse we'll need to add a next costume so it looks so looks like it's eating by opening and closing its mouth we'll need to move 10 steps because you want the shark to move around rather than rather than just look pointing to the mouse pointer and you need to wait 0.1 seconds so it won't look like this see look how fast it's opening smell it makes it not look that great so you want to add the weight 0.1 seconds right here so now if you move the shark it's a bit more smoother okay so now let's move on to the code for the fish so we'll need a custom block with the fish so we'll make a custom block called new fish we will not need to add any inputs boolean number text or labels for this so we need the fish to go to random position this is defining the movefish function this is not starting the game this is not one click you have to call the function in the beginning after this i've defined this so we need a show so the fish will show in the beginning because when the shark eats it it'll hide so we can make it switch costume pick random one to four because it has four costumes yeah so it can show up as different fish every time it generates a new fish we'll need to drag a forever loop this one can move five steps you can make it move however much steps as you want but i'll make it five so if on edge bounce that means if the fish hits the edge it'll bounce off of it and then we need an ifthen statement sorry if then statement if then it's touching the color of the red teeth we want to make the shark bigger a little bit so you can do this set it to like maybe 300 size for now we'll reset later so if you want to capture a color just press this button and then you can capture the red color because you want the fish to touch the red so let's touch and color that red so next you want if you touch the color red then you change the score by one we can start the sound chomp do we have chomp in here nope so we need the chomp sound so it'll make it look like the shark ate it with the chomps down so let's go to the sound gonna do sound chomp should be somewhere here you know i'm just going to search it chump it's like this so we can place the sound chomp and then it'll hide because the shark ate it then we can wait three seconds and then regener generate another fish after three seconds has passed we need to broadcast a message called fish start over fish start over so now we need to call the function to start this so we need a one clicked show in the beginning you can set the size to 50 so it's not that big then we can set the rotation to left and right so it won't flip over like the shark and then we can call the function bluefish and then when the fish start over when it receives the message then you can also call the move fish okay so now all you have to do is duplicate this code to the other fishes so if you wanted to duplicate it you drag it down here if you see a wobble then you can drop it it'll duplicate it to the other sprites now let me check if the other fishes have it yes and now we are all set now let's try out the game so i found out my error so the color wasn't exact to the shark so that's why the shark wasn't eating it eating the fish so you have to put it on here to get the exact color it wasn't it was like slightly off in it and it didn't and it didn't call us the same color even though it looks similar so you have to remember to select the same color like this okay so now after select this the game should work see so yeah it's pretty much sharks and minnows so don't forget to save your project and thank you guys
