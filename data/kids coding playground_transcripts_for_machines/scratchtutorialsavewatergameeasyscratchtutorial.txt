welcome back guys it's kids coding playground here and today we're back for another video called the save water game today we will be working on the save water game one of our viewer requests to make this kind of game related to social cause the point of this game is that each player will control its own bucket to catch the water from the dripping pipes save water game we'll be learning these following concepts in scratch variables loops broadcast message sensing collision and controlling sprite with arrow keys so i'm just going to go to my so um i just went to my scratch project and this is how it looks like so i use the takeout sprite so let's just click the green flag my brother's here to play with me right here so i'm gonna be the orange one on the right i'll be the blue one so the point of the game is to move side by side and to catch the water you have to hold the you have to press the uh down arrow key or the s key so as you can see it plays some music and as you can see you can't catch the water you don't if you don't crouch so you gotta crouch and then you can collect the water and you can you can only move if you don't crouch so that's basically a game first 100 points yeah and i'm gonna try to get 100 and each each uh uh what's that called the each raindrop is 100 points ten ten points i'm trying to one more okay so i got 100 it says player two wins as you can see so we're gonna jump right into this project so before i start please like share subscribe and comments in the comment section below to show me what uh else projects you want for us to make so i'm gonna make some variables so as you as you can see and when i demoed it you had to crouch using the down arrow key to for for or the down arrow key or s so you got to make a variable called crouch one you can make it crouch one and then the second one is crouch two because it's for the other one other player crouch and then you also have to make the player score for the first player and player score 2 for the second player i'm just gonna hide these two variables right here and we're gonna i already have some sprites in the backpack for me so i'm gonna just change the name of this and instead of using numbers you capital p capital p and the player score yeah this already has s and i'm also going to make that capital s and i'm also going to do it with the other one so you can see it better so there you go and i'm gonna start on the code so i already have the sprites for me the regular takeout and the orange takeout and also the water drop the water drop the pipe so you can obviously draw these on your own and when you win sprite so obviously if you're going to use the regular takeout you got gotta delete um b and c take out you only need d and a take up so yeah for the other one is the same i just changed the color because you can tell if the first player in the second player so i'm going to teach you how to draw the water drop so it's like a egg type of shape that's the wrong button uh paint and so you just need a regular circle that's a cyan color or a blue color you can just reshape it to make it look more like a water drop as you can see that's a little bit too small but that's fine so we can just delete this one and get straight into the code we'll also have to draw the pipe i can also teach you how to draw the pipe it's pretty simple you just have to draw a rectangle a few lines through and then draw another rectangle so it's actually pretty simple so anyways um i'm just going to start on the code so i'm going to delete the cat and then use a player one so you have to if green slide click because that's this green flag right here so everyone knows that um zoom in a little bit uh set crouch to end so uh so when you start the game it will not crouch it's crouch one because i'm working with player one and it'll go to a certain position so let's say right here and it'll switch costume to take out d so this t take out d is this costume where it's running so it'll when it spawns it'll be a take out d just which costume to take out d forever because you need a forever loop for if it's gonna to go up down all these simple things not up down side left right so an if then statement if key arrows key a press because that's the left key the left one for wasd that then set crouch to end because you don't want it to crouch so set crouch one to end while it's moving you cannot corrupt so you'll switch costume to take out d because that's like the regular costume when it's running um point in direction negative 90 of course you have to have this or also flip over so you got to click on this button right here and um you gotta put in direction negative 90 what i just said point in direction negative 90 and move 10 steps so it'll move and you can just duplicate this and do d instead it'll switch costume take out d but point in direction 90 instead because it's pointing the right and then a d and the s is for crouch so you gotta duplicate this again but then just change this to crouch moment so it's actually s i see if i get an s right there and it'll set crouch to y so then it will crouch and i'll switch costume to take out a i'm gonna put this right in front of doesn't really matter but yeah you can just do it if you want to you can put it in front of there it doesn't matter and then you don't need this point and direction thing so also need a for winning if then statement you need an or because if it's more than 100 points or equal to 100 points it'll win so it's equals if the player scored equals 100 so player one score says the first one that equals 100 then then you'll win but and and also if you get that one when player score one wins you win two so i'm just gonna stop that play one score equals a hundred they'll broadcast player one wins so it'll tell the um the the winning message to come out and yeah so i'm also gonna work on the second player so i'm gonna work on player two and it's basically the same thing as player one almost the same thing i'm just going to drag this over and i'm sure this one has it yes it's right here just the whole code instead you got to change the go to position and instead you need crouch 2 because that's for the second player so you need a goto position instead you got to use the other one this one right here wherever it's standing the switch costume to take out d forever if a is the left arrow it's the left arrow and d is the right arrow instead you need crouch two and crouch 2 for this one and s instead you have to use down arrow and then change crouch 2 instead to y so if player 2 score equals 100 or it's over 100 and broadcast player 2 wins says a new message and if i receive player one wins then it'll stop other scripts in this sprite and duplicate that and then if player 2 wins and stop other scripts in this fight we also need it for the other player so let's just drag this over and we're gonna work on the water so the water when the green flag is clicked it will hide in the beginning um forever i'll go forever oh wait and i'll pick random seconds actually that's really interesting so that's you can use that if you want to so you can wait one to pick random to two seconds and then you can broadcast a new message called drop and wait because it has has to have a little weight draw and then when i receive drop i'm just going to duplicate three pipes as you saw in my demo i had three pipes so i'm just gonna move the pipes let's just move it right here this one right here how about here yeah and then go back to water let's move this up let's move the player one score here player two score here and when i receive drop it will show because that's when it drops down and it will go to it'll go to a random pipe basically so it won't be random position and you got to join the pipes together so it's actually go to join pipe and pick random one two three so pick random pipe one two three there's three pipes here and you gotta repeat until so keep on going until it's touching the edge of the screen and it will change y by negative 10. and change y by negative ten negative 5 so it's going down and then you need if then loop right here if then and by end if then it's touching player one player one and in crouch equals y so so only it will only collect if it's crouching that's basically what it means if crouch one is equals to y that means it will collect the drop it will change player score player score one by ten and oh hot because you cuz player one collected it and we just duplicate almost the same thing it's almost the same thing just duplicate that and put it right there right under it not inside of it or else that would not work right outside of it but not an outside of the repeat loop so instead it's touching player two and instead it's crouch 2 and it will change player score 2 by 10 instead you know hide and know hi again after all the loops so we also have to we also got the player so we're also going to do the you win so when the green flag is clicked i'm going to add the backdrop in the medicine music later it'll set um player score i'll set player score to zero so player one score to zero and duplicate and then player score two to zero and then it'll hide in the beginning all the score will be reset and then when i receive player one wins oh switch costume to costume one so that's the first costume i have to cop soon right here so says play one wins player two wins so switch costume to the costume one go show and stop all duplicate the same thing almost the same thing he said it's player 2 wins um and switch costume to costume 2 instead and you also need the background music and also the background music so i'm going to work on the background music so when the green flag is clicked it'll go forever and play a sound but i used eggs i'm not sure why they called it eggs but i placed on eggs until done and i'm gonna also get a backdrop i use like a water type of theme type of thing i use water and rocks i think that's what it's called so i'm gonna duplicate the water so there's gonna be two at the same time so water two instead so here we go it's gonna be way quicker i'm gonna download the game right here so as you can see um so we're getting points so as you can see it says player two wins so that's basically the game so please like
