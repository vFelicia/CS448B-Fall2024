so welcome back guys in today's another kids coding playground video and today I'll be teaching you how to make a game called space adventures so this this photo right here is in 3.0 but the sprites are still outdated from 2.0 so we will be using other sprites when we're making the video so the point of the game is to survive and destroy the aliens we will be learning these following concepts keep rest I don't think we've learned that one yet position of sprite mmhmm pick random touch sprite and broadcast message use it again so this is the demo I'll be showing you the demo so you use arrow keys to move spaces shoot and a place a song and then if the bug hits you you lose health so that's like about the demo and before I start please like share and subscribe and click the notification bell to support our channel and thank you so let's make a new project and let's start so the first thing we will get is our sprites the first bite will get so I was using the spaceship but now they don't have the spaceship anymore so I'll be using the rocket ship I want to see if this one works then we need the ball sprite or you can draw it if you want to but I'll be taking the ball sprite then we also need the ladybug sprite I think they'd still have this one yes they still have this you can use either one they also have the and you also have to draw one so you can use any font you won or any color I'm gonna use black and then we're gonna change the font to marker this looks a little bit better and then you lost so you cannot win in this game it's just too um just trying to use survive I think that's big enough that's around the middle yep around there so there we go and the first sprite we're gonna work on is the is the spaceship sprite so or the rocket ship sprite first we have to always start out with the events if flag clicked I think you can see that better point in Direction 90 um we got to make two variables score and feel we have to go and set the score to 0 so then the score will be 0 and then set the shield to 100 you can do anything you want but I for a hundred then we need a forever loop forever forever loop if on edge bounce so you cannot get off the screen then you need so you can control it with your arrow keys or dub yeah yeah arrow keys we're gonna use WASD for something else umm right arrow if key right key right arrow is pressed that means change X by ten so we can put that in duplicate it we can make the left don't remember not to overlap it I change this to negative 10 because left arrow and right here are different to get the left arrow then we need to make the up and down arrow if then you know how to do this part if then up arrow change X by I change Y by 10 and then if it's the down arrow you got duplicate again don't remember not to overlap it down arrow you need it to be negative 10 it's up and down are opposites then we also gotta use WASD for something else actually ad we will only be using a and D so forever so do it forever if then we need if then a key a not W we need only a and D and then it will turn 15 degrees left then we can duplicate that change this to D and then change this to by 15 degrees so you can pick any backdrop you won I just sat well let's pick a backdrop that's more space related so we can take you can take anything you want hmm maybe let's say space this one I think we should make this smaller 7 D is fine I guess oopsies right arrow change X by 10 so we're moving on to the bullet or the ball and we can change the color if you want but I'll stick with this you know go to and then this is the tricky part you need this one okay two of these so when you get this one you always have to change the back one first let's change it to rocket you see and then this one shows up but if you don't change that one it will work so you have to change the back one first and then you can and then you can do it and then so what we need exposition of rocket ship and then you got to go back rocket ship but Y position because it's the Y and then go hide forever if then key space because that's how you attack then go to X I guess we can duplicate this move 50 steps in show so showing the tip of the spaceship then we need to repeat until remember do not overlap them we're off so the game would not work actually this one I think we have to overlap but some games you don't have to overlap but this one we overlap a touching edge and move ten steps so keep up moving until it touches the edge then we need a hide right here so hide again and oh go back to the spaceship go to X so it's the same thing right so I guess this code is right here and then let's move on to the ladybug code code so let's go to the lead book when star or rapper you have to show I'll go to X we have pick random one pick random negative 220 2x2 222 positive positive 220 and Y glide 1.5 seconds well I would say 1 5 seconds to pick random 1 to 10 so we can keep that and then about negative on baby stick with that one and then I can start forever well you can choose any sounds you want I guess we can choose a spacerelated is there any space Wow mmm let's take my Devo let's take this one if there isn't a space really play medieval one until done so we're still in the ladybug forever we need a forever loop and you know if then pushing spaceship touching spaceship rocketship then change field by negative one then we got also have to make the other code so good to go if flag clicked then forever if then statement touching bullet so that's how you get score bullet bull then change score by one by one hi we're almost done you just have to go through one more thing that you lost sprite so if flag clicked hide always have to hide because you didn't lose in the beginning yet wait two seconds this wait two seconds is really important because you if you don't if you don't put the way two seconds I'm gonna coat it without the wait two seconds and then it doesn't work because you have to click the green flag twice for it to work and that's not good so you'll so you can click it once with the wait two seconds because oh just keep on saying that you've lost and you lost so because it's already a because you already lost the last one so I'd say you keep on saying you lost so you gotta click it twice that's not good let's change in zero I'll put in the two seconds later and then this one 0 so the shield is smaller than zero like negative if it will still die so show and stop off so I just checked it again and based on the different sprites and stuff um the ball you need a point in Direction 90 or such zero or also a be shooting out of another place and so we can delete this block of code because it doesn't really work so we can move on to that you loss you can change the color because I thought this colors a little bit darker so I'm going to change this red I think red looks better so and um we can also I think we're almost yeah so we can add the wait two seconds right here I think we can make them forgot to change the shift so I Stanley took out the shielding for testing so he has let's see the ball is working musics a little bit loud so I lost see look it works but then we can also make the ball smaller because this is make a little bit too big to make it 60 I think this is freaking thanks for watching guys and have a good day
