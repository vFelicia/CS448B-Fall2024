so welcome back guys today and another kids coding playground episode and today we will be making a new game called the flying cat so the point of the game is for the cat to get the balloons and the yeah and to get the balloons to get points so and the flying cat game we will be learning these concepts in scratch understanding broadcasting messages using the variables when key pressed hoops pick random in the next costume so these are some things we'll be learning so this is the demo for the game so I'm just gonna make it larger there is music so and you might not be able to hear me as well but so I won't talk that so so you can move around and then catch the balloons in the clouds in and the points are going up in the clouds and buildings or decorations as you can see so I'm gonna make a new project and I'll be teaching you how to make this game before it start can you please like share and subscribe to support our channel please um so yes okay so first let's go to the let's delete the straight one the the regular so let's go to the background get the if the flag clicked then get the forever because we want the music to play forever we're letting the background play it so you go to the sounds you can use any music you want but I'm using um it's gonna loop so see I'm gonna use dance celebration yep this one so I'll be using this one and then you take place ound dance celebration until done so we got to get our sprites now so we can get the flying cats so let's get the flying scat sprite right there we need the buildings bright right there we need the cloud sprite let's see if I can search this oh it's right I think it's ready yes right there you can also get the balloon sprite so I search this up there we go so oh yes I forgot about the background so let's go to the backdrop let's see what we can get like sky theme related so let's go a blue sky so let's get straight to the thing and let's start at the buildings so if a flag click the zoom out a little bit as if flag click we always start out with this one control forever always set yeah yeah I think I can go one bigger set x2 250 so I'll stay there next costume so we keep on changing costumes like it's a different building and repeat a hundred times people punch it and then put change X by minus five so pause the video when you need it and if I'm going a little bit too quick so this is a code for the building now let's move on to the clouds the clouds you always have to start out with the green flag clicked forever because it has to do it forever set Y to pick random one one to 180 so I'll pick a random Y from 1 to 180 set X to 250 250 next costume so yeah it will keep on because the clouds has costumes as well so repeat 50 times change X by negative 10 so that's the cloud sprite so if I'm going to click again you can pause the video if you need it so we're moving onto the balloon spray this is what the scratch cat the flying cat collects so if green flag clicked that will show go forever goes always forever next costume go to random position because it's going to the random position set X to 250 so go set X to 250 repeat 32 times so we'll keep on going for 32 times change X by negative 15 so we're not done with the balloon right yet but then you will be going back to here later cause it has broadcasting inside and we want to do the receiving messages later so it's not that confusing so let's go to the cat now so always start out if the green flag is clicked go to the front layer say Oscar zoom a little bit 1 I think that's enough say time to flop in time to say anything you won but I because he's flying I would write time to fly so and then you need uparrow let's go here like you so you can move it with the arrow keys so we can use WASD if you want but let's do up here I'll change Y by 10 so we can duplicate that and change this to the down arrow and change it to negative 10 because the down arrow is the opposite of the up arrow so let's go the right arrow and left arrow so the right arrow just put a little bit here the right arrow is X because it's right and left is X so change X by 10 you can duplicate it that again and change it negatively and change it to a negative 10 so we're not done with the code here yet we have to do if then green flag clicked no if green flag clicked again and then we have to make a variable called points so the points will be like a score but today I decided to use points so set points to zero always in the beginning a forever loop but if then loop so two loops if then it's touching balloon because that's how how the cat gets points so it's been touching the balloon broadcast touch building let's make the message so you go to the balloon and we're not done as I said earlier because it's broadcasting messages when I receive touch balloon will change the points because that's how it gets bonds so change points by one so it's gonna hide after when you get it and it's going to wait two seconds and show again wait Tuesday and show again and I suppose that's all the code so let's always have to click the Save button and then let's rename this to flying cat flying hat so now we can click the music if you look the clouds and buildings thank you for watching and have a good day
