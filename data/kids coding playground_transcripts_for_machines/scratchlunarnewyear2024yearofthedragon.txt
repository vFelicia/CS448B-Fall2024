welcome back guys this play here today back another video in scratch and today we'll be making a Lunar New Year themed game for of a scratch and if you do not know today is Lunar New Year um it might be Sunday for you guys or another day but for me today is Lunar New Year and basically if you do not know what Lunar New Year year is it's basically a holiday where a family and friends gather up and they just give them uh exchange money in red envelopes so they have this red envelope and they have money inside and they give it to kids and other people to uh for good luck and it's just basically a holiday for us for a new year so this year is the year of the dragon so there's many different years um and it's all different like animal or Spirit but this year is a dragon so we'll be making a dragon themed Lunar New Year game today so I'm I'm going to show you how it works so first some Chinese music I mean lunar NE music is going to play and then the dragon is going to follow the ball basically and you have to gather all the money so it's a pretty simple game and it's just like you know you're Gathering money like uh in real life they'll have these red envelopes and stuff for luck and yeah you see the dragon okay so we're GNA make that game today all right so I have I already put all my Sprites in here but it's really simple the backdrop you can just get from online just download a backdrop and then the ball as you can see we can get a ball from here it's pretty simple and you can just delete all these and change the color so you can as you can see it's over here and it's just a two color variation so something like that or you can make this one you know orange or yeah so that's how we made the ball pretty simple and this is our just original ball the dragon we actually got from online and you can use remove BG as I see over here you can upload an image over here and or drop a file and you can remove the backdrop of you know um a Sprite that you can download from online and the Red Envelope uh we have many variations as you can see okay and these um images we got from Amazon and we just got the picture and use remove PG to remove the backdrop and if you need any help with the backdrop you can just comment down below for uh us to help you on how to remove backdrops and we can make a tutorial if you guys do ask for it so so let's start with the ball so when the green flag is clicked forever it will go to Mouse pointer so just follow the mouse as you drag it along there and we're using clones today so we're going to create a clone of myself to add the visual effect of the ball and then now when I start as a clone it will set size to 100 % repeat 10 times change size by minus5 and delete this clone so basically it'll make a whole trail of clones that are descending in size so I'm going to show you right here uh it gives that cool visual effect see look um the Clones are descending in size and are behind one another so that's the the ball now let's work on the dragon so the dragon's fairly simple as well so when the green flag is clicked forever also Point towards Mouse pointer it'll move five steps so now we have the ball and the dragon and it looks like the dragons following the ball and yeah as you can see over there now we're going to code the Red Envelope which is the hardest part of the tutorial so stick with me so when the green flag is clicked it will we have to make a new variable which going to name money it'll set money to zero and it will go to random position after that it'll set y to 180 so it's going to be up here and forever you need to change y by minus5 so it'll just descend towards the ground you need a if then statement so if then you need a less than sign if then y position it's less than 170 which is down here so if it's less than 170 then it'll go to random position and it'll set y to 80 180 so it just be back back at the top at a random position and it'll just continue falling down so we need to if then if then touching Dragon then it'll start S pop and then it will change money buy and we did use pick random 1 to 10 we can obviously alter that to more or less money and then after that we're going to have next costume it'll go to random position so as you can see when it falls down if it touches the dragon it'll switch the costume it'll go to a random position and as you can see we have all these costumes so we have six different variations in the envelope and it'll set y back to 180 so let's do that and I do have a song um you can just take some songs from online does it really matter so when the green flag is clicked so I got this um sound from online and it's on copyright so you can get this uh song you can just find a song online download it and uh when you click the sounds you can do choose a sound and then click upload sound and then you'll have uh your downloaded s in there so when the green flag is clicked so you can hear me I put set volume to 50% but that's optional forever and it'll Play the song so there we have our Chinese New Year I mean Lunar New Year game other countries just to celebrate um the new year uh the Lunar New Year so uh yeah that's why it's Lunar New Year so when the green FL is clicked as you can see I have the Lunar New Year music play playing and the dragon which is the year of the dragon and the ball as you can see as well as the money falling down and I'm going to try to get all the money and that's the objective of the game so it's a pretty easy simple game that you can make and yeah just collecting money for the Lunar New Year's so so we in the description below we also have a project project so you can take the Sprites and uh do all of that take the Sprites remix it whatever so anyway please like share subscribe
