so welcome back guys to another tutorial on kids coding playground today we'll be doing a math game so the players can choose any operation such as addition multiplication uh division and subtraction or you can pick a random operation so choose a random one for you to play and the player can choose a type of operation and they would like to play and the cat will ask the math problems for each um operation so let's say you click on multiplication the cat will start asking questions for multiplication if you click click on subtraction the cat will start asking questions for subtraction so today we'll be learning these following concepts in scratch variables custom blocks broadcasting messages loops and we'll be using a bunch of operator blocks we can later expand this math game into a math racing game which i did for my tech fair about like two years ago and i got third place on the tech fair so later we can expand to that but first we'll need to work on the regular math racing game math game so i'll demo the game for you guys so um so in the beginning i should say let's play a math game answer the following questions press quit to stop all questions that's just a stop all choose one of the operations or random so let me show you when you click on random it'll pick a random operation for you as you can see so i'm just going to um so when you get a question correct they'll say that is correct and let's say if i get a question wrong on purpose like it'll say wrong number and there's also a different modes today we'll be working on addition and subtraction i think that's all we'll have time for we'll work on multiplication and division in the later videos so let's see addition so 33 plus 20 that's 53 that's 40. so if you get it right you'll get more score as you can see in the top right corner you can get more score so yeah that's pretty much the game so let's start a new project okay so we can keep the cat for now and um if you want to make a backdrop you can um so i just made like a little green backdrop with like no outline um and i just like use the darker green on this side like that and i just drew a square uh you guys can do whatever you guys would like i'm just gonna make a backdrop so this is gonna be my backdrop and we're gonna keep the cat um i can rename the cat actually but in the old one i just still had a sprite one but um and then we'll need to make some buttons i already have them in my backpack today we'll be making the addition and subtraction ones and the quit button uh that's all we'll have time for i think so uh for the so for the addition um all we did is just drew a square a rectangle and then wrote addition and same for subtraction i just drew a rectangle and then wrote um the word subtraction and then for the quick bunch has a circle and that real quit so that's it for the um three buttons and let's go working on the code now so actually first we need to create some variables so we're going to make a variable called answer to problem sir to problem problem so make this answer your problem it's for all sprites and then we'll need to make another variable called guess so this is what the player guesses as the answer and then we have the random number one which is the number picking the random number which is the first number they'll pick and then we also have a second number random number two and then we'll need to create one more called random game and score let me create two more actually so random game so this is for the um so let's say you click the random button it'll pick a random game so this is what it's for and then you have to make score and then we can delete my variable this is not use so this is all we have for now so let's go to the cat get a one fly clicked so when fly clicked um we're gonna hide some variables so um we're gonna hide the variable score in the beginning actually no we don't need this we don't need to hide the variable we can just keep it showing i guess if you want i'm gonna keep the score on the right side so i'm gonna get a one fly clicked and then i'm gonna um show the variable score actually no we don't need to because it's already shown and i'm just gonna make it say let's play a math game math game so let's play a math game i'll say it for like two seconds and then i'll duplicate it we're just gonna tell them the instructions how to play in the beginning and then i'm going to say answer the following questions and then i'm going to do it duplicate two more one is press quit the quit button to stop all question stop all questions so this is just a stop all and then one more we'll do a choose one of the operations or random so these will be the instructions so if you guys want to make it um less less like less sane then you can just put all the instructions in one stay and just make it for a longer time so i just did it like this but you guys can do it any uh differently so i'm gonna make a new variable right now i mean new broadcast i'm gonna name it choose game so this this is just to uh select the game so choosing game so let's go into our addition and subtraction so for addition i'm going to get a when i receive choose game we want to show so it'll um show up in the beginning and in the beginning we want to hide when fly click we want to hide um sorry hide so i'm gonna zoom in a little bit uh when i when this sprite is clicked so i'm gonna do two more broadcasts one is called start game and one is called start edition game and we'll make another one called start edition letting the player know it'll start the edition start edition start edition and then when i receive start gaming we want to hide the button it is no longer needed after the game has started start game we want to hide and then um this part is not necessary but you guys can add it if you would like it's just to make your game look better so when you put your mouse on it it'll get bigger and smaller so just get a forever loop if touching mouse pointer then we can set the size to 85 percent uh else set it to 100. there are many other ways to do it but the other ways are a little bit more difficult so this is just an easier way of doing it um so now let's go back to the cat so for the cat we're gonna have to make some custom blocks so we're gonna get a new custom block let's name it edition edition edition edition i think that's how you spell it but addition so we're going to define the edition block so let's define the addition block right now let's get a forever loop and then in the beginning we want to set the guess to zero so the guess is zero in the beginning so we set it to zero and then we want to set the random number one to pick random one to one hundred so for addition it will pick random one to one hundred so um pick a random one to 100 so the first number we'll pick random one to 100 and then we want to set the second number pick random number two to also pick random one to 100 and then we're going to use the variable set answer to problem to random number one plus the random number two which is the first number which you pick random it could be like 25 or something and then the second one could be like 10 and you add them together so you get an addition operator so you add the random number one which is a random number pick one hundred and random number two which is a pick random one to one hundred so you add them up oops put that back in like random number one plus random number two and then i'm gonna zoom in a little bit more so you guys can see it better and then we're gonna get a repeat until so we're gonna repeat until guess is equal to answer to problem so it will repeat until the answer is right so the guess is what the player inputs and the um answer to problem is the um answer to the problem the random number one plus the random number two and then we're going to ask ask ask join random number one join the ad edition symbol random number two so it will ask what is random number one plus random number two so we're going to join and just pop that in there get in uh another join we need two joints and put it in here so we're gonna get join the random number one addition symbol and then random number two like that so ask that and then and then after that we want to set the guess to the answer which is the answer right here the correct answer and then if the answer is equal to random number one plus random number two so this is just to check if the player has got the right answer so if random number one is equal the answer is equal to random number one plus random number two so look at addition symbol if the answer is equal to random number one plus random number two then we can start actually this should be an if else statement because if they get it wrong then it should say wrong number so let's change it soon if else sorry about that so you put that in here and then when i get something right i'm gonna get a new sound so i got like a guitar strum sound uh guitar strum this one sounds like this uh and then i just put in here play sound guitar strum and then it'll say that is correct that is correct that is correct for two seconds and then we can change the score by one because they got the right answer else if they get it wrong oops let me just duplicate this if they get it wrong then we'll say something else we'll say that is the wrong answer and then instead of playing guitar strum um i got i got like a string pluck sound um from before just like kind of sounds like they got it wrong or something so i'm just gonna go to sounds put that right here and then say that is the wrong answer okay and now we have to call the edition thing so um we broadcasted start edition from here remember right here so we're going to go to cat uh when i receive start edition we want to call this block so edition so now let's try out let's try it out so it's going to say let's play a math game answer the following questions press the quit button to stop all answers choose one of the random operators operators for random so we only have one operation right now so let's click on addition so ask the answer as you can see right here so 54 plus 42 is equal to 96 so let's put 96 and they'll say that is correct so it is working and the score went up and i forgot in the beginning we have to set the score to zero so it will go back to zero because uh i forgot about that and then 60 plus 35 let's see if i get it wrong let's put seven or something uh they'll say that is the wrong answer so it is working right now so 60 plus 35 is actually 95 so say that is correct so as you can see it's working now so uh addition is working right now and we can work on the quick button but i don't think we have enough time to work on the subtraction like i said in the beginning um i think we'll work on that in the next video but so when this so for here i'm just going to do it when i when this sprite is clicked stop all because it's the quit button and then when fly clicked we want to hide and finally when i receive a start game we want to show show the quit equipment right there so that is it for this video don't forget to save your project and you can rename it with math game so that's it for this video hope you guys really enjoyed don't forget to like share subscribe and ring the notification bell see you guys in the next
