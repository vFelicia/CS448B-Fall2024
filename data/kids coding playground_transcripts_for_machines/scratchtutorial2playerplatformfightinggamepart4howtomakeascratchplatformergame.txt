so hello scratchers to another episode on kids coding playground this is going to be the fourth episode for the twoplayer fighting game in the last video I forgot to add the one flag clicked hide so if you haven't had that added that then please add it so it in the selection screen the sprite player 1 will not show and one last thing to duplicate this put that in here so in the beginning I'll switch to the idle costume well we're going to make three variables so our three variables are going to be player 1 hp I don't 1/8 already have player 1 hp player 2 HP MN 2 HP and one more player 2 character Claire to care so we have all the variables so in case you missed anything I'm gonna drag around this let you guys see code if you missed anything okay so that's all the code for the player one now let's show the code it's the code for the jam you guys don't have that it's the code for the begin button code from the character one select button this is the code for the dragon character to select button so that's all the code we've got from last time so we're going to be making the player 2 so I'm just going to drag it back pack clear to you so what let it load then move it up here so I'm gonna drag all the code into this glitter zoo so just drag all your code into players ooh okay so that's all the code for the player to I just directing all the code to get messy I like spread it out so let me just spread it out a little bit more so you guys can see it okay here we go spread it out okay so next for the run control we want to UM instead of greater than nine we want to do greater than seven because this only has seven costumes for running so one two three four five six seven actually there's eight costumes so there's gonna be eight costumes actually eight run costumes see one two three four five six seven eight so we're gonna continue with the code so we're gonna have to change it and incentive and set a player one character for all of these we're gonna do player two character run player one costume index so we want to change it to player 2 because this is player two and player two so we have eight costumes for the ninja girl on adventure girl and the teeny so you put seven right here and it starts at zero because we set it to zero right here so that's why you put a seven I'm gonna change this to GN which is a teeny so in the costumes you can see the genie raise GN and the genie doesn't have slide costumes and that's why we put the genie right there so next we're gonna things just change this code instead of player one character should be player two character and we should change this too so yeah you change this to player two character you have to change this to player two character what else if you change this to player two character and that's I think that's pretty much all you have to change these are already all changed so that's it for the player too so for player two we have two so then now we have to go to the start game over here switch costume to that and if it's touching so now we're going to work on the button so in the last video if you haven't washed it you made the two buttons so I taught you guys how to make it in there I'm just gonna drag it from the backpack because we have in the backpack anyway so let me just duplicate this code into here into here so this is the character one so we need to change the player one character right here it's a AG adventuregirl instead and change this to a Z also and instead of broadcasting clutter one select we have to broadcast player to to Silla and this has to receive player to select so now we can duplicate all this code into the beanie icon except we'll need to make a new a new we also have change this is 65 instead of negative 65 we didn't make new x and y position as well so move this here move this here and finally move this there as well so in this one we're gonna set the x and y position to 170 y 60 and instead of a G we're gonna be n as in PE and this we also change this to GN as in Keaney so now we have all the icons ready and the begin button so okay what oh I did in here sorry she just back to AG in this back to easy oops did it in the wrong thing 65 and this has to be the one that's changing to GN genie this has to go to 170 and this has to become cheney so you have all the code for the genie let's move on to the HP bar we're gonna be working on the HP bars today but before we can do the HP bar be able to change the x and y position this make it face negative 90 so the go face to the left side and we can change these arrow keys and the should be the right arrow key should be the down arrow key and the jump okay I found it so now we got to change this to up arrow key up just so have you guys how it works now I'm going to change these to play through character this should be good to clear to character this should be clear to character and so is this one so make sure to drag all your code into the other sprite or else I'll be wrong so now when you play it and now both of them can jump jump in slide so that's all the stuff for now and if you select these two but you cannot slide the food and I'm pushing down the down early in this so I'm gonna drag the player 1hp the bar and then the help so I already have it in my backpack but it's draw it I'll show you guys how to draw paint a new sprite you want to get the line tool make it black about four outline yeah and then you have to make it onto this cross like this one it's on the cross with that but on this one I'll drag this one into I've here this one in this one has to be opposite of the cross that the tip is like that so when you lose HP it won't lose from this side they said o get smaller from this side and to make it and this is also on the cross and this is on the opposite side so it's a drawl the healthbox you hold down the shift key to make a perfect line you can hold down the shift key right here and connect it up here can make make it like a black or Jilla and then write HP red or orange color I'm just gonna do bread HP of course you can use any font you want HP so you have to copy face this you can copy paste it to the health to compare of course this is way too small right now it's obviously way too small so that means have to make it bigger so I can like either expand it but that won't look good so that's how you do it you just have to keep on measuring until the tip matches the tip of the health bar so it's sure you just have to keep on trying until it's perfect fit just work on the code for it now so one flag clicked you want to hide in the beginning before the game starts we're gonna hide so next we want to get if when it receives the start game button the start game message then we can go to this x and y position we want it to be on the same x position I've same y position because we want to be at the same height but the x position can be different so this is that line x position we wanted to go to the front in the beginning so they'll go in front of the health bar okay show and for the p2 it health bar it's basically the same thing but we can work on the health first so when I receive start game resuming start game start game that we have we can go to this x and y position the same as the health box and we want to show in the beginning once it receives the message get her forever you set the color effect a zero in the beginning and set the size to player 1 HP set size to clear when HP what this means is player 1 HP we will set it with the win fly clicks so when flat clicks we want to set the player 1 HP to 100 so that means I'll set the size of it to 100 the size of the HP bar to 100 Guinea and you can hide her here so next we want to get it then statement so if the player HP is less than 51 so if it's less than 50 51 HP that makes 50 or under so if player HP player 1 HP just less than 51 then we can set the color effect to 170 so I'll become bread set the colour effect 270 so become bread and get another ifthen statement so if the HP is less than or equal to less than or equal to 0 the player 1 HP is less than or equal to 0 player 8 1 HP is less than or equal to 0 and we can hide for this player 2 HP we can just drag in the code from here to here gotta change the x and y position we had to change the x position though I want to change the x position to 66 does it have it written down right here 66 and the player to health is 2 when I receive start game then we can go to and I almost forgot you can just copy it from here actually and I missed this room so now if the code copy pasted you have to reset the X&Y position this one should be 240 and 7 negative 240 and this is all the same thing and instead of player 1 HP with to do player 2 HP for everything Claire 2 HP player 2 HP player 2 HP and player 2 HP so I'll show you guys I'll set their HP to like 15 and you will see it become bread so if I if I were to set it we hide these variables first I respect that HP to 50% and it will become bread at the high turn as you can see it's red because it's under 50% HP so thank you guys for watching please like share to your friends and subscribe so just recap we finished the player 2 today we made two other buttons and the HP bars and the HP boxes so see you guys in the next video and two clarifying game part 5
