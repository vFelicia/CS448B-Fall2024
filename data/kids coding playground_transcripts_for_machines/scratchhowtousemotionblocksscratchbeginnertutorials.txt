welcome back guys to kids coding playground here today we'll be doing a new type of video on the channel we'll be doing a video on an indepth explanation of all the motion blocks as listed here and this is like a video for beginners that just started scratch maybe you want to know what each block does so maybe you want to watch one of these videos so we might do some for all the other blocks as well in the future but first we're going to start out with the motion blocks so let's get started first of all we have the move 10 steps block so this is exactly what it says move 10 steps so um as you can see when you click on it so you can click on this block to make it like run or you can just use a one green fly clicked but that's not relevant right now so you click on it you see it moves ten steps you can see that it is moving yeah you can see that and if you do move negative 10 steps guess what it does move backwards of course so there you go move that's the move 10 steps and stuff like that and you can make it move a certain amount of steps as much as you want to move 50 steps you can move negative 100 steps yeah you can you can just play around with it whatever you want i'm just gonna make it go back to the middle and then here we have the turn degrees step uh turn degrees block so what it does is it also turns it just turns the cat so this is the right turn and this one's the left turn so you can see there's a difference between both of them since when you turn to the right this one you turn to the left you can also change this to whatever you want turn 90 degrees see that or you can turn this uh negative 90 degrees it will turn the other way see that yeah so turn yeah so basically it's just the turning it's really simple and then here we have the go to random position block uh when you click here you can either make it go to the mouse pointer or a sprite so let's say i get a sprite let's just get apple or whatever so you see the apple we have another sprite so right here if we do go to apple the sprite then it'll go to the sprite as you can see so if i move the apple right here let's let's see of course it'll just go to the apple so and then here if go to mouse pointer this will make it go towards the mouse pointer as you can see my mouse is on this side so it'll go this side so i'm going to put a wait two seconds to show you guys how it works so going to motion so you click on it my mouse is right here you see the cat it goes to my mouse pointer so let's try again what if i want to go here so you can see the cat follows the mouse and then we have another one which is go to random position exactly what it says just goes to a random position as you can see and then right here we have the go to position go to x and y so basically this is where it will set the position of any sprite so let's say you want to make this cat go to 100 100 well then i'll go to this position which is 100 100 and if wherever you drag the cat is wherever it will set it to so you see right here it changed so i'm going to show you guys that it changed so like it goes to this position as you can see so i'm going to set it right here so if you click this one it goes to this position so yeah so basically it just basically sets the position of the cat and if you want to make it go to the middle it's of course zero zero so you click that it will go to the center and then next we have the glide so glide to a random position is exactly what it says as well it'll just glide to a random position you can see and you can also change the duration of the glide like two seconds as you can see it will glide a little bit slower about five seconds uh to show you guys it actually is gliding slower as you can see it's gliding much slower yeah so that you can change the duration also apple you can make it glide to a sprite as well so you can see click it it'll go to the apple glide there and then finally we have the glide to mouse pointer i'm going to put another wait two seconds so i can show you guys that it goes to the mouse pointer so let's click it so my mouse is right here as you can see it glides the mouse so that's what the glide thing is there's also another glide block this is if you want to make it glide to a certain position so you can basically make it whatever position you want so what if you want the cat to glide right here so you'll get this so first you set the position to right there right so you can just click that it'll glide down there so it'll also glide to the corresponding x and y so if you want to glide back to 0 0 0 then look we'll glide there you can also change the duration of the glide like any other one so oops i need to change this so maybe 50 150 as you can see it's gliding pretty slow yeah so that's basically it for the glide next we have the point direction blocks so as you can see 90 is the default so it's already at position 90. so we can set this to whatever you want maybe 120 you click it it will point in the direction of 120. um you can also rotate this dial so wherever you want it so negative 90 it'll point the opposite way as you can see when it's point direction of negative 90 it is flipped upside down and what if you don't want that well it's uh luckily it's really easy to fix this you can either click this button right here as you can see the left right button so now it won't flip upside down or you can also use and block inside the motion and we'll get there later after we get we're going in order so once we get there i'll show you that it will also work as well so next we have the point towards block so the point towards block basically makes the cat point in a certain direction so first we're gonna have to make it go rotate all around as well right now so then it will be able to point towards something so the point towards your point towards the mouse pointer apple so as you can see you point towards the apple no point towards apple it's pointing already towards it and point towards mouse pointer it'll point towards your mouse pointer as you can see it will rotate that way so i'm going to put a weight as well just wait two seconds so you play it it's gonna point towards it so as you can see that cap points towards the mouse pointer so that's the point towards block and then next we have the change x block so basically this is um so first we have to make this uh go back to its original direction let's go back to 90 so and then you're ready to change x this is basically moving 10 steps but it doesn't uh it's it's not affected by like the positioning of the cat so the cat is pointing towards the left then moving 10 steps will move it towards the left but changing x will only change it on the xaxis so changing x by 10 as you can see it will just keep on moving 10. let's do 50 or something see as you can see it's moving by 50. and if you do negative 58 it'll move backwards so you see that so there you have the change x by 50 and then here with the set x so this is wherever you want to set your x position to so let's say you don't set the x for the cat to 150 maybe then you'll set it over there so you can see the cat gets set right there it's basically a go to block except it's only for the x position you can even do negative 150 it'll be right there and next we have to change twice that's basically the same thing as the change x you can see it's changing on the yaxis and you can do like maybe maybe 50 or something and it'll move down by 50 as you can see so yeah that's basically what it does and then here we have the set y this is also like the go to block it'll set the y of the cap so we'll set it to 150 so as you can see it gets set to 150 and let's say you undo 10 it gets set to 10. so basically also sets the y of the cat instead of using this maybe you only want to set the y position then you'll use that block and then if on edge bounce i'm going to make a simple uh script for this so um it'll actually work so right here we have a simple script to show how if on edge bounce works so let's play it as you can see the cat is bouncing all around it doesn't go off the edge it just bounces around like that um let's say you would want to remove this guess what happens it just gets stuck on the edge and it doesn't go anywhere so um it just gets stuck on the side so if on edge bounce is good for like some games where you don't want the characters to get off the borders then you can use the bounce and then next like i explained earlier we have the rotation style like remember i showed you that if you don't want your cat to be upside down like this you click this right well maybe you don't want to do that you want to set it every green flag is clicked you just do this and you can set it to don't rotate all around or left and right so if you send it to all around you'll be able to flip all around so now it's upside down and then don't rotate which is make it you can't rotate it at all and then left right you play it you'll just go back upright and then right here of the x y and direction so these are all three um very important for some games like platformers so we have x position this basically is the x position of whatever the sprite is so as you can see the sprite is at 16 so maybe you can try to detect the x position of some sprite in a platformer same with this this is the y position of the sprite is negative one except this goes into the decimals um you just have to know the whole number integer you just have to know the integer so that's the negative one and then direction this is the direction it's pointed towards as you can see it's negative 89 point something but right here is negative 90 it just rounds up to the nearest number so here we have the negative 89 rounds up to negative 90 rounds up to the nearest integer and then so that's what the direction is so let's say i change the direction to maybe over here as you can see the sprite direction will change as well well you can't really see the change because i set it to no road left and right rotation only so if i switch it back like this you can see that it changes so that is it for all of the motion blocks in scratch i hope this video really helped you guys on understanding motion blocks and if you're new to our channel please consider subscribing to our channel and leave a like on this
