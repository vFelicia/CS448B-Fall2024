welcome back guys it's kitchen playground here and today we're back with a video on Scratch and today we'll be making the farm Clicker now we announced last week we already had made a demo video for that and it's a pretty complicated game so I'll be walking you through the whole entire game starting with the no code game so um first of all you can just get remix this to make it yourself I will have probably this shared it's the farm clicker no code um after this video I'll share this and it's the no code thing so you can remix it for for yourself and then you can just get everything here because the Sprites are pretty hard to draw some of them and some of them you have to get online and all that stuff so you I'm gonna share this after the product uh for this video and you guys can go remix that or you can just draw your own or download it from my projects and so let's start with the money which is basically the numbers you might have seen in the demo before that are um up next to the world record you may have noticed there's no mega units either so no mega units in this tutorial so we're gonna start the money so I'll show you how to draw the money like the costumes for these things so you have to right click or not right click so we're just gonna pay a new one over here so first we're gonna get our text so we have our text right here I put out a handwriting because that's what we use for all of them we're gonna change it to Black because that's what our default color as the back you see that little Shadow we'll be using that peace and then uh on this I'll just write let's put a demonstration of let's put four so we have four here we click out and then we click over here and then now we can access the outline so we will have to make this black and we'll change this to six so it's really dark you see um it's really like condensed so that means we'll get another one and we'll change this to white instead and then put a four and it fits inside there like that and that's how we just made the Sprites with the little Shadow behind it so that's basically how we did that so now when coding you must name the costumes so this is number one is going to be one same with two three four five six seven eight nine but zero has to be the last one and has to be ten for this money uh thing to work so zero has to be ten and now let's move on to the code so when the green flag is clicked let's put that over here uh we're gonna hide and we're gonna set money so new variable we'll be using this variable so set money to zero and then broadcast a new message called dart game and we're gonna put this part so when I receive start game we're gonna go to a certain position so for this position we have it over here and it's over here around this place so just find a position around here and then we're going to get a new variable called number and this is for this Sprite only this is very important do not skip this step so we're going to get that over here and then so in our original game I think the x is actually 190 so I'm going to change that you can use our exact coordinates if you want and then instead we're going to set number to zero and we're going to get another variable money number clone and then this is for all Sprites and then we'll click OK for that and then set money number clone this is zero as well and then we're going to go to control place a forever Loop right here and then wait wait right here wait and then you have a less than sign right over here and then money number clone is less than length this one right here length of money so that's what we have over here feel free feel free to pause we have this part and this part so now we're going to continue and then wait I mean change number by one and it will also change money number clone by one and it'll also create a clone of myself and change X by negative 20. so this is basically keeping track of what numbers there are and all that stuff and this is keeping track of the Clones of the numbers and um this is basically changing X by negative 20 so this would just move by each number and now we're going to move on to this part over here so when I start as a clone here we're gonna show uh forever um if then else if then else um you need a greater sign if then else if the number is greater than the length of money then it'll hide else it will show and this is very important do not skip this step it'll have to so we're actually going to get a switch costume to and put it over here and now we're actually going to put all the operators together so we're going to start with this one so let's get a minus from over here number minus number minus one and then we're gonna get another minus keep this one blank and then we're gonna get length of money so we're gonna get over here length of money and we're also gonna get oopsies this one oh yeah so we're gonna put right here lots of money minus number minus one so that's how we're gonna put this together but we're not done so we have to get this one and get letter and then we're gonna put all of this oopsies all of this into here and then after that and then we're going to take money and put it in here so it's pretty complicated and throw them all in here so it's pretty complicated but just put the operators together so this block of code just shows if the costume matches the number over here so that's just basically what this code means it's really important do not skip this so I'm going to show you uh it says zero over here because I have no money right now but I can let's just go set money to 1000 we're gonna get one thousand so that's basically how we do it so now uh let's just go on to the glow this is pretty simple just the glow around for visual quality I'm actually going to show you the costume first so let's see this we're just going to duplicate just to see this better so let's paint I believe this one goes down here and then it's the opposite for the top so we're gonna actually swap these and it's gonna be like that for what we use for the glow around the chicken and basically it's the same for the other ones too so the gloat is optional it's just for some extra visual quality but you don't have to add if you don't want to you can just take it from my project Gumball 098 that's my username so after that we're going to go over here and then go to x00 Middle origin and then go to back layer and then it'll show it'll also go forever and it will turn right one degree so that just makes it move a little bit if you've seen our demo please watch our demo and you see it just circles around and that's basically the glow optional but it's better if you do so now we're going to move on to the chick so the green flag when the green flag is clicked oh yeah the costumes first of all so I just took the chick from scratch they have one over here and they have three skins but I deleted two of them and I just duplicated this one and I colored this one differently made it a lighter more mango yellow instead of the darker yellow over here so it can show a difference when you click it so it just makes it so you know that you clicked on the chicken so we're gonna go when the green fog is clicked it'll go to the middle as well as point in Direction 90. and it'll also switch to costume chick a and we have to make a new variable called CPS and that's basically how much you get money per click so we're gonna get that over here and then set CPS to one so let's just and get one for clicking on the chick and then now we're gonna go forever and then we're gonna have a little variable over here called turn and we're going to change turn by four and this is and we're going to use this over here so right like this and we're gonna get one of the more less used blocks you're gonna get this ABS one and then put it right here change it to the cosine of and then you have to take a division one cosine of turn divided by two that's basically what makes it turn like that and like that and like that like that it's really steady so use this code right here and then when this Sprite is clicked uh when the spread is clicked it will change money by CPS so because you can have the tools and I'll just see how much CPS you have or whatever and the switch costume to the chick A2 yep that's correct L weight 0.05 seconds 3.05 seconds and it'll switch costume to check a and then when this Sprite is clicked I when the Sprite is clicked it will start sound Sharp and it'll create clone of chick Club so that's basically the little background to the chick so and now we have the chick so you see it's tilting tilting same with the glow effect and then if I click on it I get uh uh the money and you can also hear the sound and now we're actually going to move on to Chick clone so this one is visual quality visual effects if you click on it there's gonna be a little chicken that falls down it's like a random color so that's just some visual quality for you and then so when I start as a clone yo go to the chicken and you'll switch costume to pick random one to three so this chicken actually this chicken actually is from the scratch library and it has the three costumes and it'll pick random from these three costumes and it'll go to the back layer and then also set size to 30 percent so it's just a little visual quality falling down and then it'll show and it'll set X to pick random negative 50. 250 and it will repeat until touching Edge and now it will change why by negative 10 until it falls to the ground and then turn like that to the right side pick random negative 10 to 10 degrees and now after that it will delete this one and we need this short little block right here when the creative flag is clicked it will hide and forever it will change color effect by 25 so that's just a little visual quality now we're gonna have this so whenever I click on this you see the little chicken falling down so and we're also going to hide the barrels real quick so the ones that we really don't need to be shown and we also have to go to the money and hide this one too so yeah now we're gonna move on to the heads so our first basic card in the game so hands right here when the green flag is clicked it'll go to okay so I'm going to show you how to basically make this basic hen costume so we're just going to get a button real simple get this little button right here and no wait wrong one I'm gonna go to this button go to the costumes delete this one and we're actually gonna get a costume so I use hen because it's a farm clicker so we're actually going to go to the hens HHH so we get this one right I think I use 10B if I'm not mistaken so I use this one you know my shrink this a bit group this all together delete then oh I didn't control C so I restored the costume and I control C the go over here and then Ctrl V now we have our head it's grouped together we're actually going to delete this one right here and then now we have this one we're gonna shrink it so it's like you can put it inside the button so put it like a general size and then I just use the text I'm not sure if I use handwriting I think I just used stand serif but that's fine and I just wrote 50 to indicate the cost of the head so now we have that now we're going to code the hen so when the green flag gets clicked it'll go to this position I just got some position to the right and then it will set hens owned so we're going to make a new variable Penzone and they'll get set hands own to zero and we're actually going to right click on this most people did not know that's a thing we're actually going to drag this over here so it can indicate how much hands you own so it won't be just one bunch of clumpy variables together so just right click to get this part so right click so and then right click to get this thing and not right click double click and then set hens own to zero and then when this Sprite when the Sprite clicked you if then else statement and you need another if then else statement but inside the if then statement like that and it will be like this so you need to or if then the player has money equals 50 because that's the cost of the hen or money is greater than 50. we're actually going to put in here so if then we need a less than so if then the hens owned is less than 150 because the max cap for hens is 150 so if then it's less than 150 it'll start sound glug so that's just the basic sound you can find that a Sprite Library right there put it like that and then change money by minus 50. change money by 50 so deduct your money when you buy a head and then after that it will change your hands own by one so you have another hen to the stack and then after that you'll have to broadcast bot hen right there else broadcast over here maximum units reached and we'll actually capture that with this one and after that a broadcast maximum units reached else broadcast you don't have enough money to buy this so if you don't have enough you know if you don't have fifty dollars then it'll be you don't have enough to buy this and now we have that when I receive bot hen for forever it will change money so it would change money depending on how much hens you have so change money by the number of hens you owned and it'll wait two seconds so now we have that code finished for the hands and now we're actually going to code this one though you don't have enough money to buy this right so actually there's two costumes here we have that you don't have enough money to buy this item and the maximum units reached so we're actually going to go over here and then when the green flag is clicked we're actually gonna go to the front layer let's see the project real quick go to the front layer and hide and then when I receive you don't have enough money to buy this it will switch costume to costume one and then also go to the front layer and show also start sound collect so we just have like some sound to indicate that you don't have enough money to buy this and then it'll wait one second and hide as you know the First costume is that you don't have enough money to buy this one and then we'll duplicate that actually and then instead change this to maximum units breached which is to costume two because that's the maximum unit reached one and then it's the same so we have that all set so I'm going to show you real quick um I'm gonna give myself fifty dollars real quick so we can I can show you so change 90. that's not right change money by 50 you can buy a hen and you see it's producing money for me and I have one hand this goes up and actually and if I don't have enough money I'll say you do not have enough money to buy this item so cool we have that all set up please like share and subscribe and comment in the comment section below what else games you'd like to see on our YouTube channel this is one of our subscriber ideas that we have taken and made it into our project so if you'd like to see any of your projects please comment it and the part will be coming out tomorrow so see you guys in the next part thank you
