hello welcome back guys to kids cooling playground so today we'll be working on the new ninja platformer i think i did that a while back maybe two years back so it wasn't really good they were having some bugs and stuff like that uh with the uh platform detection so we made a new one that is a lot better so so that's why i'm re recording the video to show you guys how to do that uh so if you want to uh start the project you can take look at this one called ninja platformer for class no code so this one has all the uh basic platform and stuff like that already there so you can go inside uh if you go inside you'll see like the uh the main character which is a black icon uh the ninja this is the main the boy ninja and then this is the girl ninja and then the ground so what let me explain a little bit so the black uh background i have uh both there's a taller one and there's a shorter one so the shorter one this is like a hitbox so we use that for the uh slide so um if you look at this right so let's say if i take this guy i take this i copy and i go to here and let me zoom out a little bit so if i paste it here you can see the hitbox and the ninja is about the same size right okay so similarly the uh the shorter one so i'm gonna take the short ninja uh the slide one so i'll go to the small one so you can see he's about the same size for the hitbox okay so that's why we can use like a ninja to slide under the spikes and stuff like that okay so hope you guys understand that part and then the next thing let's talk about the ground so basically the ground is like a design whatever you want to do so the design is the you can use it uh however you want and then the virtual ground is where we're gonna make the detection so so that way you know the ninja can jump on certain thing and not jump on other things so whatever you want to jump on to be able to jump on you have to put it in the virtual ground whatever decoration and stuff like that you don't want them to jump on then it can be in the ground sprite so for example let me take this so i take everything here so what you do is you let's say if you want to if you want to make a new one right so you can see if i post it here right you can see that my if i make everything go back layer you can see that the virtual ground is just the ground on top that way we can have the uh detection for the platform other than that everything you know you can jump on these so the spy cactus the break it you know the the the signs and all those are not a uh not something that the ninja can step on only the purple one this purple thing is where you can step up so let me go back you see that so so basically what you do is you can design your ground first after you design your ground however you want you take a copy copy everything and then in the virtual ground you create a new sprite and then you paste the uh the the thing that just copy on the ground and then you just make the make it look like you know however it is right so so let's say you see this is number three right so if you look at number three number three see this ground so what i did was i copied this and then i paste it here and then just adjust the uh the box so you can see right so if i take this do another copy go back over here you can see that see the the virtual ground and the uh and the ground is uh the same so you can see i have the the uh my purple box here that's where the ninja can stand on purple box here and purple boxes that's what the new skin stand on and then the tree stuff you can go behind all right so hopefully you guys understand that okay all right so that's about it so you can get this project and get this started so and then you have some more props here i added some props that you want to design your thing to be a little bit different you can add that and some objects here so you can use that for your game if you want to design different ground okay all right so i think let's get started all right so what you do is you can like make your copy of this project or you can remix it okay so for me i can say save as a copy okay so i'm gonna say i'm gonna change it to okay so it's gonna use this to teach you guys okay so let's go to our main character which is the black uh bar okay so uh the ninja girl gonna hide it i'm not using ninja go at the moment so we're gonna work on the main character so the main character basically is the uh the hitbox where we can do the control so let me go back to stage one go to the virtual ground stage one for now okay all right let's hide the medusa for now we don't need her okay okay and then this one let's select the standing up ninja for now okay all right so we'll work on on the black uh black black box all right all right so let's create some variable so here we'll create some variables so let's make a variable for offspring we'll call it level so this is like the show the level what level you're on okay and then let's make some uh more variable so uh right now i'm going to create all the variable in one go for this black uh icon character here okay so i can make uh for all the global variables basically all the variable can be seen by other sprite we're going to put g in the front okay so i'm going to say g gravity okay okay next i'm going to say g is player dead so this keep track the players dead or not make more variable so g um and then this is the mouse position what you can do is um you can use the uh use the mouse position to see where you want to put items so we can put that so let's have that and then next we'll go gee and let's go on ground okay all right let's continue go g speed takes another one g global variable underscore velocity okay okay so we have couple more variables uh this is the depth let's kind of keep track of how much that the ninja have uh so and then next one we'll do it for this sprite only and uh this is a deviation this is a basically a change in y all right so click that and then we'll make one more for the sprite only we'll call jumping so you can see all the one that with the global wearable doesn't have the main character and this one has a main character i use a long case okay all right so let's take out these things we don't really need them to show up on the screen okay except maybe level and death okay all right so we have our our basic uh variable so now let's try to work on it okay let's go back to the main character okay so when green flag is clicked okay i'm gonna set the size to 35 and then we're gonna set the level to one so here we're gonna grab the variable so set level to one so that's our first level and we're going to make a custom block called reset um this one doesn't matter you can run well refresh or whatever it doesn't really matter this is just refreshing uh this is just resetting the variable but others other things like platform detection we do need it so this one we are going to say go to negative 200. and zero so that will go to somewhere like right here and then we'll make it drop down later okay all right so all right then now let's set our variable okay set let's play it dead i'm going to say false you can use true or false or yes and no doesn't matter okay next we're going to say set the gravity velocity i'm gonna put it zero and then we're gonna say um on ground we're gonna put that at zero and then we're gonna say uh gravity we're gonna put minus one okay and then we have one more jumping we're gonna go zero all right so this is like uh when the game will be set or when the player dies we're gonna try to recreate you know put the same location put the player back to the left and then reset this variable so now we're going to call this function reset okay and then we're gonna broadcast a couple of message i'll broadcast the first one i'm gonna call it start game all right broadcast a new one new message we're going to call it start new level okay so we have these two methods so for start game uh what we're going to do is let's scroll down over here a little bit so when i say start game um what i'm going to do is going to change the ghost effect for right now let's uh let's leave it but later we do need to set the ghost effect so that you don't see the uh the character right so so you want to only see the ninja but for now let's keep it right here okay we're gonna put the ghost effect in first and then we'll we'll do it we'll do it later okay set goes effect right now we keep it at zero so uh when the actual when we actually got it working we'll make it as 100 okay so for now we're gonna keep it at zero show okay and then we're gonna use a repeat until here we'll repeat until and then we'll use the equal operator uh take it take this player dead so the player that you go to true when the player die then repeat until that so when the player dies we're gonna restart everything but if his player is not dead yet so we're gonna broadcast whatever is inside so i'll broadcast a couple of things so we're gonna broadcast new message start all control message check platform detection okay broadcast a new message called check player position okay all right so we broadcast few of these okay so let's go to the my block make a new block called movement control make sure you select this run without refresh click ok so let's do our custom block all the way on top here so we have everything together we're going to do the if and else here okay so for the if and nails okay so what we're going to do is we're going to grab something here we're going to grab it in and then we're going to grab our oil and put it on the first block okay so what we're going to do is we're going to make the um key let's go to get one key press so what we're going to do is uh left left and right arrow keys so left arrow right arrow and then we'll make one more down arrow sorry down arrow so what we're going to do is we're going to make it go inside this if if it's a left arrow or a right arrow and oops grab it and let me zoom back out this one down arrow put this here okay so let's zoom out again so if it's left arrow or right arrow and down arrow we're gonna go in here we're gonna try to use the uh we're gonna use the custom number two which is the uh the shorter one otherwise we'll use the custom number one which is the taller black black icon right here okay okay and then we have another if and else control so put another if and else here and then inside here we put another if and else okay all right so now let's duplicate this it is right arrow we're going to set the uh the g speed x to 10 okay and then we'll duplicate this and then duplicate that and then we'll put this as negative 10 okay and then we'll okay one more we'll set this to zero okay all right so let's make the new block run without refresh uh this one the uh the name we're gonna say move hitbox okay and then we'll add a variable called speed x okay okay so here what we're going to do is we're gonna say change change this change x by speed x and then we're gonna set the variable called deviation which is the change of y we'll set it to zero let me zoom in a little bit more all right so next we're gonna say uh repeat until and then we're going to use the o operator then we're going to use the equal put in the deviation check here put in five so basically just like it's a change of why they're checking if it's equal to five or if it's touching the virtual ground which is this box here the the purple one okay uh not touching sorry not not touching okay so it was deviation equal to five or not touching the virtual ground we're gonna say change y by one and then change the change deviation by one and then we're gonna have an if condition here put it in the bottom if the deviation is equal to five we're gonna say change x by i'm going to use the up minus sign here put 0 and then the speed x grab it from the and then you have to change y and you're going to get the operator again the subtract sign put zero and deviation here okay so this kind of move the hitbox and then uh making it go down within uh within certain points until it touches the virtual ground all right so what we're going to do is we're going to call the function so let me zoom back out a little bit so here where we have all these uh functions that we are calling right so um let's say when start all control we are going to call the movement control okay and then um event when i receive uh check platform detection um we have to call this moving um hitbox and then the g speed x i think i'm not sure it's gonna work exactly yet because i'm not completing all the code let me just test it out so let's try it out so what we had so far is kind of moving the box so it's not really detecting the platform so we do need to detect the platform so let's just try to finish this real quick it might be over 25 minutes but uh it will be a good stopping point after that okay all right so let's continue let's go back to my block create a new one we're going to call it check hit ground and we're going to use this on the boolean click the one in the middle is jumping okay make sure you have check without run while refresh okay so this is for the check move uh check the ground for the uh for the uh character jumping so let's go so we're gonna say repeat until repeat until okay let's zoom back in okay repeat until here inside here okay so now let's put in the operator knot and then we're gonna go to here i'm gonna grab that and say not touching the virtual ground and then we're gonna use some control here so if and else put this inside okay so we continue here so grab this one put this here uh go here say change y i minus one okay and then we're gonna say set uh the velocity to zero okay copy that and then this is plus one pushing the character back up and then we're gonna set the underground to one okay and then scroll down a little bit we'll get another if condition here put inside here we're going to use the operator equal sign using the jump if jumping equals to 1 and then we're going to set it back to zero okay all right so this so this is to help to uh check if the player is touching the ground or not okay so that part is done okay so let's go to my block again so make a new block so make sure you have this on so the block this time we're gonna call jump control okay so after that we're almost done so use the if condition here and then check put another if condition inside so here let's go uh sensing uh key presses up arrow key okay and then we're going to use the n operator here use a greater than and then use the equal okay um you can use an equal also but i think i had earlier greater than uh for the on ground i think it's only once in zero it could be one equal to one is working as well so that's fine so we can put that here okay and then jumping we'll hit it zero so basically if it's on the ground and jumping is not jumping then we're gonna allow to jump so i'm gonna set so set the on ground to zero uh that means it's uh no longer on the ground when it's jumping up i'm gonna set the jumping to one i mean he's jumping and then we're going to set the g velocity to 15 that's how high you can jump okay all right so then we have the jump control okay all right so let's go back to uh our code here where we have all the broadcast messages so on here okay so we're gonna finish it up right now over here okay so we're going to call this one we'll put this on top of that and then we're going to use the operator copper zero here and then we're gonna check the g velocity okay so this will if it's greater than zero the g velocity then it will call this guy uh so we'll call this uh uh this function saying if it's jumping then it will do this logic here okay all right so we're done with that part so next we're gonna call the jump control here and then we're going to draw the if and else condition i think we're almost done and then we're going to use the sensing if it's the arrow here okay we're gonna change change the g velocity by the gravity okay the gravity is negative one okay and then otherwise we're gonna make it a little bit faster so we're gonna say you can't put negative two or something like that i think i haven't multiplied before so we're gonna continue use that multiply by two and then we're gonna have another one here say uh change change y change y by the g gravity i mean g velocity okay all right so i think should be good let's check it out okay so let's check it out so let's save it let's run it okay so we can move the black box you can see i can jump on the black box okay so you see i can slide so when i slide you see the black box change the smaller black box so seems like everything is fine so the next uh maybe uh the next uh video what we can do is we're gonna put the uh ninja overlaying on this black box and then we're gonna hide this black box make it the ghost effect 100 so you'll not see the black box you only see the ninja will make the ninja follow the uh the black box okay so that's the end of the video i hope you guys like the tutorial give us a thumbs up if you enjoyed the video so we'll probably cut uh continue with this with a couple more tutorials to finish out this game okay all right thank you guys you
