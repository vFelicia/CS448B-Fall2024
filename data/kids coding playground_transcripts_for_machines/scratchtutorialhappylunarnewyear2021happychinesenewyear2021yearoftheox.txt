welcome back guys it's kids cutting playground here and today we're back for another video and um you're working on a lunar new year project so this um chinese new year is about coming uh so i'm pretty sure that uh in chinese new year people give envelopes and money inside envelopes and red envelopes to give to other people and they get money so yeah so i think this year's one is the bull yeah so we decided to do the bowl right here we made a chinese new year game so can we all appreciate how cool this blue looks it has all this wavy hair and it's really good graphics so whenever you touch a red envelope again uh pick random one to ten of money so and then yeah so it's basically collecting envelopes and if you die you see his firecrackers they put like a little sprite on you and that means you got hurt so uh if you can hear me that's good so there's the firecracker and i only have one life left and then it's on top right so i'm about to get killed it says sorry you're lost and everything stops so anyways i have to tell you some stuff um so first if uh many people are required they said that they have to request access for the sprites and honestly um the way to do it is use your not use your school account use your mom or dad's account or your account like your home account but not your school account so if you go in your school account they'll have to tell you to request access but if you don't have that um you can do that and if you do not understand you can watch our google sprites uh video links in the description so yeah and we also have other cows links in the description from the google drive and and this tab i just switched it so there's this cow oh so i'm gonna play it so it shows the graphics of all the moving tiles these don't move so you can use any of these cows but i i wanted this one this one looks the coolest like all the hair graphics so yeah you can take any of these links in the description this blue one looks cool too it's waving its tail when it's running this one is pretty cool the ones that don't move are still cool but you know you can i prefer the ones that are moving so uh let's get started so anyways let's keep on going so people told me to teach more slower so i mean like i'm going to teach a little bit slower i have everything in my backdrop so i have this just the backdrop right here i have that and then i also have the sound so uh the music the chinese music so that's basically the music and i don't need this right i'm going to put the bold the firecracker thing you can um go down the google drive links in the description and also have the firecracker the red envelope and the bowl let's reorganize everything is it loading that's oh it's over there so let's reorganize this just takes a while to use a bunch of costumes so first let's work on the bowl so the bowl is the most important it's the star of this project when the green flag is clicked uh let's make it go to around here and then so set rotation style to left right so it won't flip over while it's moving to the left nor the right um and they'll switch costs into bull one which is the first one so switch customers how much costumes does this thing have 132 costumes yeah i'm yeah 32 costumes anyways and never mind uh well let's just keep going so set money let's make a new variable money set money to zero and it'll set our life's lives um to five because five is a good number for lives i don't know why it's just good number and it'll have a forever loop this is the movement to make it look very wavy so it depends on what cow you're using if it's like a different cow um and smoothing then you might have to add some seconds into it so yeah one forever if then the key left arrow click then it will point and direction 90 i mean negative 9 90 is right negative 90. move 10 steps and next costume i'm gonna duplicate that to make right arrow just like that changes the right arrow one direction 90 at this time and then move ten steps next costume so we're gonna work on the red envelope yeah yes next so has some code and so when the green flag gets clicked it'll go to a random position it will set y to 180 so 180 forever and ever and ever i change y by minus five and there's a if then so if then you need one of these symbols if then the y position is less than negative 170 then i'll then it'll go back up because 170 is down here so when it the y position is less than that then it will go back up so it'll go to random position instead why the 180 just duplicate this oopsies duplicate right here i want to use that thing uh set y to 180 and you need a if then statement let's make this a little bit smaller so i can see better if then it's touching the bolt you'll get money so touching bull full one i'll start sound they have it for every single spray i don't know why except the scratch guy i think he has made me out so you know change money by pick random one to ten so it's a random amount of money because sometimes some people give you like 20 bucks some people give you like a hundred so but this is one to ten you know go to a random position and set y to 180 so i can just do this uh right there and then we're gonna work on the firecracker next so the firecracker has quite some code so it's a decent amount so let's start so when the green flag is clicked that's good nothing leave one out it will go to a random position anywhere random it will set y to 180 um forever i will change y by minus five so keep on going down and down and you know if then statement if then if the if the y position is less than negative 170 then it will yeah you go for the y position then it will hide go to a random position and set y to 180 after that oh wait i pick random a second so wait pick random one to five seconds and then i'll spawn in again if i'm not mistaken let's see uh one to five seconds it'll show so our next trip to code is and then the bowl if it's touching the bowl i'll broadcast firecracker hit bull so this is like the main component of broadcasts oopsies what is this called again yeah firecracker ball fire cracker hit bowl and after that it will hide a hide it'll go to a random position you'll set wide of 180 and i'll wait i'll pick random a second so white pick random one to five seconds duplicate this and no show now we have to do the sprite one which is really really simple and we also have to do the pull so let's actually do the ball first well i'm gonna show you i'm gonna show you this so the bowl the envelope the firecracker so my money's going up like 16 24. so pick random and then the firecracker isn't doing anything quite yet so let's just um continue in the bowl so when i receive firecracker hit the ball it will change life by 1 so now you can start losing lives and they'll start sound snare beatbox i think yeah this one um the stair beat box and i'll switch costume to bull one so and now it'll do if then the life equals zero then it will stop at the scripts in the sprite it will say sorry you lost because you did lose so um say sorry you lost for one second stop all and now we have to work on the sprite one so when the green flag is clicked it'll go to the front layer front most front go to the front layer hide and go forever and ever and ever and go to bowl so it's already at the bowl and now if the firecracker hits the bowl it will show over here wait one second and then hide and now we have to put in the music so so um i'm let's test out the so i'm gonna actually show you how to draw spray one first if you don't wanna use hours links in description but if you think hours is not as good as what you can do you can draw your own so let's paint it so you need thickness five so you can yeah so let's just draw so you can skip you can skip a lot if you don't want to draw and you want to do your own so it's just a bunch of messed up lines everywhere so that's basically how explosions are not really um so if you can skip to a certain position if you do not want to watch me draw i mean like it's really quick so yeah it's basically the explosion we have to color it yellow so we already have it in yellow yeah so i'm just going to delete this and we can also reshape it to make some larger than others why not so yeah that's basically explosion so let's delete this costume and now let's add in the music so when the green flag is clicked it'll set volume to 25 plus sent 25 this is abnormally large so forever i'll play sound chinese music i think i already uploaded that in the beginning yeah so let's test it out so yeah so sorry you lost it says that and then we're done we're done with this project so the the thing is to get as much uh score as you can so anyways uh we're done so oh yeah i forgot this oh yeah like and
