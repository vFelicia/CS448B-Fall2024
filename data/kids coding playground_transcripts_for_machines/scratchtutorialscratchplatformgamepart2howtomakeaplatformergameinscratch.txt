alright guys welcome back to the channel again two kids coding playground so today will continue while walking on this scratch tutorial platform game so this game basically you control this little sprite year and you jump around collecting the gym and what where we left off last time was we created these simulated gravity and getting stuck again those two custom block where you know when the player start what we want to do and you know keep making a player fall down to the ground so that's what we did so today we'll continue working on this too or make the play open so we already have the custom and loaded to my sprite so we loaded all the running jumping sliding right so we'll be using these custom so how do we do that we already created our variable last time so these are the variable we're fall speed jump costume index jump speed run custom index and run speed and then the score so these are the variable we'll be using let's put this all with you okay alright so before I begin the lesson please like share subscribe to our channel and bring the notification Bell to get all the latest update from this channel and now you know anyone who is interested please share our channel with them alright okay when we left off last time was the we're gonna make the ninja I mean not a ninja the treasure hunter sprite runs around and jump jump today okay what we need to do is similarly we have the similar gravity with dip and a new block so doing this kind of work doing the block create a new block define the block is actually good way to do programming this way you can separate your method this is called a kind of method right so you separate all your logic into one method or one block and you can reuse that block later on if you're doing a more complex game so that way you don't have to move things around within the you know all the start script for all the loops inside here so you know you separate out it's a little bit cleaner so instead we put all this thing inside here it's hard to see what's going on right okay so we'll walk on the run block so what we do is we pull the corner to run intro so basically this will control how the player run ok we'll move this block to the bottom on a scroll down a little bit okay all right what we want to do is we're gonna check the index so on because if the running index is more than 901 go back to 0 basically when we have 9 costume with the running index right so you have 0 all the way up to number 9 right as you can see room number 9 right here right so that's what we can focus on ok unitive brain is operated out so what we go to say is if the running index running custom index is greater than 9 so we will set it back to 0 okay all right so this is the first thing this block will do you would if this being called check the index and all seven back to 0 this is a greater than 9 ok next we'll check will say if ok and then we have a user sensing so we're going to tell what kind of what key the user clicked on right here ok so we click on the left arrow key what we want to do is we're gonna turn the player around you will say coin and direction negative 90 okay or you can drag that little circle or you can just type it in like that and what we're going to do we're gonna move and we're gonna we are going to use a variable yes we have already fine I'll run the speed which is then we can put it in here so I use a variable that way you know you want to change it slower faster you can change that and then what we're going to do change the costume okay so just like what we did for the ninja game if you don't know that's fine if your first time watching this video that's also fine sort of thing what we want to do is we want to get the costume so we have run right so let's look at our costume for run so you go down here to run you see that run we don't have to rename it if we don't want to what I'm going to do is I'm gonna copy just this first part here okay I'm gonna play in this joint so we'll be running on this one score 0 0 ok and this one will put the index in there the running custom index ok so that will change based on that will be run 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 0 3 and so on and so forth and we are going to change this by 1 okay all right so we have the left arrow done what we can do is duplicate this and we are going to do the right arrow okay so right arrow similar right arrow weather point 90 right so we'll delete that make sure it goes to 90 and more than speed same thing we're gonna use the run index ending and then this change by 1 also okay so let's test it out so just pay attention to this run indexes will change when I start moving so you can see oh I forgot to call it right ok my back ok so we have not called this right so we make sure we want to call the the call right you don't call the call you're not gonna what so let's take a look back a little bit and see where we are okay we have this we can use that what you can do is you can use both to work them together I think we can put it in I think maybe fine sometimes you know they do have problem with you have more than one of these things inside forever loop if you have a more complex code then you to split split away so now I added this run control P calling a forever loop so we'll keep on checking what we are going to do so that's it laughs you can see right kind of thing so when let me run this we can see it is channel table see some time doesn't work correctly or laggy so I would say I think when we were trying earlier was still kind of lagging because of this forever loop point two different sets of functions some time has happened so what I will suggest is break this in half so don't do this so you will just call one thing or the other stuff similar gravity right so let's say let me try to cannot just show to you so let me say run control here I'll stop it some time it does have this little lock you see kind of like Caliban Jana nobody lagging right so that that has that problem but if you break this in into to watch me walk a lot better so we'll throw this away I'll put this here so we'll only use the so two of them over when we're doing at the same time so different thread I guess if you would look at the programming concept so there's two different things doing here so I think this will run more smoothly you see see a lot more smooth alright with this person money so one thing is you see how this person running at everyone is running when I stop the key kind of gets stuck in this position right so what we can do is we can fix this a bit so we can kind of make the the you know the sprite can stand back on the original form so there's not moving or something so we have to make it look like it's you know standing back so what we can do is you can do this I'll stop this so you get this when stock is clean you can get it for you or loop again and then you can get it if statement here and what you want to do is you want to check if there's any key press ok we're gonna use all in operator and we have to take a not so we say if it's key press the UST TTT yeah key press that's any any yeah right here so if there's no key pressed or not any key press minnow key press and what to check the fall speed as well because the one make sure that okay there's no key press and he's actually on the floor right we won't change a custom if he's jumping in the air then we don't want chain him to straight custom than coming down right so that's why we need to check this fall speed so what we do is we take this fall speed and we take the variable fall speed here if it's less than zero meaning he dropped all the way to the ground then we will switch to costume or switch to costume the idol of stone okay so now let's try it again so if we were running around you we stop yes we can see he changed it back to the I go costume so he doesn't get like a stuck in there you know how how he kind of move and it got stuck right so as you can see change back to this original standing costume that's what we want okay all right so we're done with that piece so we got the ninja running right he's running fine going across right but the co here this is all running go again let's take a look so this is our running code okay alright so we want to make the jumping cop so for the ninja we want to make him jump as well right so what we can do is we thought did find another block we call it jump rope so this is the rock this is the method and you could say custom method a custom block and programming so this will help the player to jump so same thing similarly when we start we want to set the the jump this is a jump custom index to zero and since our custom for jump we have ten ten of them right you can see John 0 jump 0 0 0 John 0 0 9 9 so which is 10 time so what we can do is go after code we are going to use a repeat rate repeat 10 times right here and what we can do is we can switch to costume Mizanin Lopez I think I can see switch to costume so what do you think where they do so whether form some kind of expression like this right so we need to use the one in the join right join condition here so joining two things so we go back to our costume I like to copy and paste in server typing at some three mistis then it will be wrong so I copy and paste I put it in here which have no space it's jump underscore underscore 0 0 0 array 0 0 and what we need is the index right the the jump costume index here which is 0 in the beginning ok next what we can do is we are going to increase the John costume by 1 so it was the second custom look and feel and what we also need to do we can make the custom this unit this character here come on when it jumps and landed kind of balance it out so what we can do is we will use a change Y sorry got the wrong one or say change Y by minus 1 okay and then we have if so we have they have a customer a of touching platform okay similarly you I think we already had some coherent copy from right here okay duplicate this all right let me put it here or drag it down over here so it was touching a platform and it's touching this a cream color right then what we want to do is we will set the fall speed to the jump speed so basically it is actually on the floor then we are letting jump on the platform if he's in the midday HRH um again will not allow them to jump so no double jump but we can make in that that's double jump that will be a later time we can try that but for now there's no double jump so that's why we want to make sure that he is actually on the platform before he makes the job and then we can add the change the Y again I plus one kind of just balance it now so that it'll look a little bit better when it's jump okay let's try it try what we had so as you can see he runs around oh we forgot haha okay I forgot to code it the the code for John right so we haven't call anything so what we need to do is we will actually have to call this function I have keep on forgetting hmm that's bad okay so what we want to do we want the up arrow key to jump right so we can say go to this event so when when space key press R instead that went up arrow press and what we want to do we're gonna call this jump control so every time the arrow keys press it will call this function here okay now let's see how it goes save it let's run it again so if I jump you see whoa he's jumping really high coming back down it's like just don't get crazy so okay all right let me check our own on okay um I think there's something wrong here instead of exchange why I had set y21 so died trying to mess them up okay we have to say change Y by on so that says we've been very careful when you're making the code change sometime you know you just mistake that set Y and change Y you can see the wrong one and you pull it and you get some issue so now let's try so what we had let's see we'll start again so you can see jumping yep he is fine his jumping time so he is fine right yep yep you can jump on top you can jump over here so as you can see there's the that's this little thing you see how are you falling like this so we can try to fix that let's see if we can fix that a little bit better let me take out something variable here jump index speed we'll take out these I think we're pretty good with that so that we have more space you see so what we can do is we can add something in here so what this condition here what I'm going to do is add this before this so um if he's hitting this blue but I'm in this brown color will make him go back down so what we can do is do this right you click on this droplet and you can get this blue brown color here so that way let's let's see if this is better so let's see so we are oops so I can take this out right now let's see how it behaved and also I'll make sure that your your blog can't run without our screen refresh it's really important so will not be lag no lags on that so change really quickly so through that same thing for this run control as well as this jump control so make sure you have this checked they fall is not checked just make sure you check it run what else will refresh and also one more thing here this fall's mean don't say 0 less than 0 let's say less than 1 let's do that because sometimes the false Peaks would be 0 minus 0 minus 1 so let's let's try it again now so this one will come up blocks and we can't jump on top of that so I so now I'm the I can either change the platform just adjust your platform so that way you know he's so stable to get up there or you're the changed here so what you call it change the height that Jeong Jeong speed so what we can do is move this come on platform back down a little bit let's stop this thing so it just kind of just sit accordingly to the character let's just try now let's see if it's better we should you go back to the co if not you stop moving it'll move the platform okay let's try it again let's run this so we can jump up no yep spine won't fix the tree on top so can't jump up so so when you see this one when it jump it come up it kind of go through here because what happened is is checking abyss touching this cream color or not if it's not either moving up down so what we can do is add this back in here let's put that in here ok now let's try it again so make sure that does not happen ok so you see you cannot you cannot jump up like that so it's kind of pushing back down takes a little fast let's try okay okay so what justice actually because this is too high on here that's why that is not working okay so we're gonna try to adjust a platform once more to make it a little bit better okay oh there's ninja out of the way the platform up a little bit oops okay okay all right let's save it let's go to the coal let's move to push down a little bit okay and let's go back to the ninja let's try it again okay so it cannot jump on top okay yeah sometime you know they do have that small issue so we try to use that code of block and thumb jumping on top like that I think initially my game was working I don't know why thing here I think it because of this tree sometime it doesn't see that that's why okay alright so we have the basic of the ninja walking running around and jumping so we'll stop the video here and next one we'll walk on the sliding the ninja getting this gym okay thank you for watching see you guys next time
