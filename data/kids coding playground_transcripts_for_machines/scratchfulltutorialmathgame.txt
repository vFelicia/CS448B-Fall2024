so welcome back guys to another tutorial on kids coding playground today we will be doing a math game so the players can choose any operation such as addition multiplication uh Division and subtraction or you can pick a random operation so it'll choose a random one for you to play and the player can choose a type of operation and they would like to play and the cat will ask the math problems for each um operation so let's say you click on multiplication the cat will start asking questions for multiplication if you click on subtraction the M cat will start uh asking questions for subtraction so today we'll be learning these following concepts in scratch variables custom blocks broadcasting messages loops and we'll be using a bunch of operator blocks we can later expand this math game into a math racing game which I did for my tech fair about like two years ago and I got third place on the tech fair so later we can expand to that but first we'll need to work on the regular math racing game uh math game so I'll demo the game for you guys so um so in the beginning I just say let's play a math game answer the following questions press quit to stop all questions that's just a stop all choose one of the operations or Rand random so let me show you when you click on random it'll pick a random operation for you as you can see so I'm just going to um so when you get a a question correct it'll say that is correct and let's say if I get a question wrong on purpose like it'll say wrong number and there's also a different modes today we'll be working on addition and subtraction I think that's all we'll have time for we'll work on multiplication and division in the later videoos so let's see addition so 33 + 20 that's 53 that's 40 so if you get it right they you'll get more score as you can see in the top right corner you can get more score so yeah that's pretty much the game so let's start a new project okay so we can keep the cat for now and um if you want to make a backdrop you can um so I just made like a little green backdrop with like no outline um and I just like use the darker green on this side like that and I just drew a square uh you guys can do whatever you guys would like I'm just going to make a backdrop so this is going to be my backdrop and we're going to keep the cat um I can rename it a cat actually but in the old one I just still had a es Sprite one but um and then we'll need to make some buttons I already have them in my backpack today we'll be making the addition and subtraction ones um and the quit button uh that's all we'll have time for I think so uh for the so for the addition um all we did was just drew a square a a rectangle and then wrote addition and same for subtraction we just drew a rectangle and then wrote um the word sub Direction and then for the quit button just a circle and then I wrote quit so that's it for the um three buttons and let's go working on the code now so actually first we need to create some variables so we're going to make a variable called answer to problem answer to problem problem so make this answer your problem it's for all Sprites and then we'll need to make another variable called guess so this is what the um player guesses as the answer and then we have the random number one which is the number picking the random number which is the first number they'll pick and then we also have a second number random number two and then we'll need to create one more called random game and score we need to create two more actually actually so Random game so this is for the um so let's say you click the random button it'll pick a random game so this is what it's for and then you have to make score and then we can delete my variable this is not use so this is all we have for now so let's go to the cat get a one fly clicked so one fly clicked um we're going to hide some variables so um I'm going to hide the variable score in the beginning actually no we don't need this we don't need to hide the variable we could just keep it showing I guess if you want I'm going keep the score on the right side so I'm going to get a one fly click and then I'm going to um show the variable score actually no we don't need that cuz it's already showing and I'm just going to make it say let's play a math game math game oops so let's play a math game I'll say it for like 2 seconds and then I'll duplicate it we're just going to tell them the instructions how to play in the beginning and then I'm going to say answer the following questions and then I'm going to do it a duplicate two more one is press quit the quit button to stop all question stop all questions so this is just a stop all and then one more we'll do a choose one of the operations or random so this these will be the instructions so if you guys want to make it um less less like less saying then you can just put all of the instructions in one say and just make it for a longer time so I just did it like this but you guys can do it any uh differently so I'm going to make a new variable right now I mean new broadcast I'm going to name it choose game so this this is just to uh select the game so choosing game so let's go into our addition and subtraction so for addition I'm going to get a one receive choose game we want to show so it um show up in the beginning and in the beginning we want to hide when flly clicked we want to hide um sorry hide so I'm going to zoom in a little bit uh when I when this Sprite is clicked so I'm going to do two more broadcasts one is called start game and one is called start Edition game and we'll make another one called start addition letting the player know it'll start the addition start start Edition start Edition and then when I receive start game we want to hide the button it is no longer needed after the game has started start game we want to hide and then um this part is not necessary but you guys can add it if you would like it's just to make your game look better so when you put your mouse on it it'll get bigger and smaller so just get a forever Loop uh if touching Mouse pointer then we can set the size to 85% uh else set it to 100 there are many other ways to do it but uh the other ways are a little bit more difficult so this is just an easier way of doing it um so now let's go back to the cat so for the cat we're going to have to make some custom blocks so we're going to get um a new custom block let's name it addition addition addition addition I think that's how you spell it but addition so we're going to define the addition block so let's define the addition block right now let's get a forever Loop and then in the beginning we want to set the guess to zero so the guess is zero in the beginning so so we set it to zero and then we want to set the random number one to pick random 1 to 100 so for addition it will pick random 1 to 100 so um pick random 1 to 100 so the first number will pick random 1 to 100 and then we want to set the second number pick random number two to also pick random one to 100 and then we're going to use the variable set answer to problem to random number one plus the random number two which is the first number number which you pick random it could be like 25 or something and then the second one could be like 10 and you add them together so you get an addition operator so you add the random number one which is a random number pick one to 100 and random number two which is a pick random one to 100 so you add them up oops put that back in like random number one plus random number two and then I'm going to zoom in a little bit more so you guys can see it better and then we're going to get a repeat until so we're going to repeat until guess is equal to answer to problem so it will repeat until the answer is right so the guess is what the player inputs and the um answer to problem is the um answer to the problem the random number one plus the random number two and then we're going to ask ask ask join random number one join the add addition symbol random number two so it will ask what is the random number one plus random number two so we're going to join just pop that in there get in uh another join we need two joins and put it in here so we're going to get join the random number one addition symbol and then random number two like that so ask that and then we and then after that we want to set the guess to the answer which is the answer right here the correct answer and then if the answer is equal to random number one plus random number two so this is just to check if the player has got the right answer so if random number one is if the answer is equal to random number one plus random number two so we get an addition symbol if the answer is equal to random number one plus random number two then we can start actually this should be an if L statement cuz if they get it wrong then it should say wrong number so let's change this soon if else sorry about that so you put that in here and then when I get something right uh I'm going to get a new sound so I got like a guitar strum sound uh guitar strum this one sounds like this uh and then I just put in here play sound guitar strum and then it will say that is correct that is correct that is correct for two seconds and then we can change the score by one because they got the right answer else if they get it wrong oops let me just duplicate this if they get it wrong then we'll say something else we'll say that is the wrong answer and then instead of playing guitar strum um I got I got like a string pluck sound um from before plug sense of this just like kind of sounds like they got it wrong or something so I'm just going to go to sounds put that right here and then say that is the wrong answer okay and now we have to call the addition thing so um we broadcasted start addition from here remember right here so we're going to go to the cat uh when I receive start addition we want to call this block so addition so now let's try out let's try it out so it's going to say let's play a math game answer the following questions press the quit button to stop all answers choose one of the random operators operators are random so we only have one operation right now so let's click on addition so ask the answer as you can see right here so 54 + 42 is equal to 96 so let's put 96 and no say that is correct so it is working and the score went up and I forgot in the beginning we have to set the score to zero so it will go back to zero cuz uh forgot about that and then 60 + 35 let's say if I get it wrong let's put seven or something uh it'll say that is the wrong answer so it is working right now so 60 + 35 is actually 95 so it say that is correct so as you can see it's working now so the addition is working right now and we can work on the quit button but I don't think we have enough time to work on the subtraction like I said in the beginning um I think we'll work on that in the next video but so when this so for here I'm just going to do it when when this Sprite is clicked stop all because it's the quit button and then when fly clicked we want to hide and finally when I receive uh start game want to show show the quick button right there so that is it for this video don't forget to save your project and you can rename it to the math game so that's it for this video hope you guys really enjoyed uh don't forget to like share subscribe and ring the notification Bell see you guys in the next video so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding playground today we'll working the second part for the um scratch math game so in the last tutorial uh we learned how to make the addition and we made the addition button so today and the quit button um so we're going to work in the subtraction button um subtraction um the custom block and we're also going to work on multiplication so I'm just going to drag and drop the multiplication in here as well hold up I don't have it so let me get it okay so now I have the multiplication button I just got it from my other project so now I have the three buttons so let's start out from the subtraction button everyone um so everyone let's go to the subtraction button and let's code on here first let's zoom in a little bit so for for addition we can just copy paste everything just drag and drop everything into the subtraction except we just need to change up one broadcast that's pretty much it for the subtraction button so for subtraction button we're going to get um so we'll separate all this instead of here instead of start addition we have to broadcast a new message called start subtraction so we got to broadcast start subtraction so let's go back into a cat we have to define a new custom block so let's go to my blocks and let's make a new custom block and name it subtraction so subtraction click okay so let's define it now so let's get a forever Loop forever Loop so in the beginning we always want to set the guess to zero to zero and then we want to set the random number one and the random number two to pick random one to 100 and the um subtraction is a little bit different from addition that's why I didn't copy paste it because you need to find if the random number one is greater than random number two because if the random number uh two is smaller than the random number one and you're subtracting it we don't want negative numbers so we have to do that so so we have to set the two random numbers cck random one and 100 let's get a repeat until so we have to repeat until guess is equal to answer to problem so if the guess of the answer is equal to the actual answer so repeat until the guess is equal to the answer problem and then after that we want to get an if then statement if um we need if then else sorry put an if then else inside this repeat until Loop so we want to if r random number one is greater than random number two so this is where you detect if random number one is greater than random number two so if random number one is greater than random number two then we want to set the answer to problem of random number one minus random number two so let's set the answer to problem to random number one minus random number two so uh get a uh subtraction symbol put that in here random number one sub subtracted random number two so subtract the first number which is greater than random number two it'll be random number one minus random number two and then we'll ask a question ask we need to put two joins put a join here and put a join here so we want to say random number one in the first slot which is any number as from 1 to 100 then we join it with the minus sign and then we get a random number two and put it in here else if a random number one is not greater than random number two then we want to set the random then we want to just duplicate this and instead of doing this we're got to switch them around so instead of putting random number one minus random number two it'll be random number two minus random number one so it'll do it the other way around so then it'll always never be negative and then it'll ask instead here we're going to switch these two again so we're going to join random number two minus random number one and then we're going to set the guess to the answer down here let's set the guess to answer um and then if we're going to get another if then else okay so let's get an if then else and put it right here so if the guess is equal to the answer to problem guess is equal to answer the problem um then we're going to have to uh start the sound guitar shum I already have it start sound guitar strum and then we're going to say that is correct so I'm just going to duplicate this right here and then put it down here else we're going to do this string plug and say that is the wrong answer so as you can see subtraction needs a bit more code than addition because you have to find which number is greater than which so and then finally we have to do a uh we have to um call the function right here so we're going to get a broadcast when I receive start addition uh subtraction sorry about that we're going to run the subtraction call this custom blocker here so let's try it out right now so I'm going to save it and then play it let's try it out so okay so I have the subtraction button addition button so let's say if I click on subtraction boom now it will not be negative as you can see 90 49 is not a negative number so let's say I get right so let's say I get it wrong then it'll do that but if I get it right then it'll do this so there was a little bug right here so I got the answer correct which was 41 and it didn't work so I accidentally didn't answer the problem right here it should be guess so um you guys have to do guess instead of answer the problem that was a little U Mistake by me so don't do answer to the problem you have to put gu that's why it did not work so now let's see if it works now it should work so now let's go to subtraction so I'm just going to click on it 60 1 that's 59 so as you can see now it's correct back then I uh when I got the right answer it still didn't get it right because um there's a little bug in it so um so the answer is 22 for here let's see if it's right okay that's right and gain score and you get it wrong on purpose it'll say that is the wrong answer so now we have the subtraction and addition functioning correctly now we can work on our multiplication button so let's go to our multiplication uh just drag and drop all of this code into the multiplication we just have to change one broadcast just drag and drop all this and one more let's see if I got it all Oops I did not get one of them I think yeah I did not get the one flag clicked uh yeah this one so I'm just going to drag and drop over here and I don't know where this one went so I'm just going to give it to Hero as well so drag it from the front I think that's why so one fly click time yeah okay so now we have the code for the multiplication instead of broadcasting start subtraction we're going to have to broadcast start multiplication start multi multiplication I think that's how you spell it but that's just broadcast that and then let's go back into our cat Sprint and then so for the multiplication um I'm only going to do it 1 to 12 because um this is like for kids multiplication so I'm not going to make it too hard that you have to use like scratch paper and all that so to make a new custom Block it's called it multiplication multiplication click okay so we're going to Define multiplication so let's get a forever Loop um you want to set the guess to zero guess to zero and we're going to set the random number one and the random number two both to only pick random 1 to 12 so it isn't too hard so pick random 1 to 12 only you guys can do it any value you want and then I'm going to set the answer to problem to um random number one multiply by random number two so multiply this random number by this random number so random number one times random number two and okay so we're going to get a repeat until we're going to repeat until guess is equal to answer to problem so wait until the correct answer guess is equal to uh answer a problem and then once it is then we want to ask um ask we're going to ask two joins let's put two joins okay so we're going to since um you guys can do the star symbol for multiplication um or just use the X symbol I'm just going to do the X symbol so uh X letter I mean so we're going to join the Random Number One X or you can do the star symbol this one I'm just going to do the X random number two so it'll multiply these two ask what's random number one times random number two and then um we want to set the guess to answer set the guess to the answer put that in here and then we got to get an if L statement so if if the answer is equal to random number one multiplied by random number two that means they got correct random number one so if the answer is equal to random number one multiplied by random number two then we can just duplicate this this just to show they're correct I'll play start sound guitar strum that is correct and then change the score by one and if they get it wrong we will just duplicate this that is the wrong answer so that is the code for the multiplication and of course we have to call the code so going to go here when I receive uh start multiplication we want to run this code right here so now we have the multiplication let's try that out so just save it Go full screen so let's play a math game answer the following questions press the quick button to stop all questions choose one of the operators are random so I'm going to pick multiplication um so 1 * 11 so multiplication is working right now so as you can see when you answer it correctly it will say that is correct your score will go up let's say if I answer it wrong on purpose let's see if it works and it'll say that is the wrong answer so our game is working uh perfectly right now so that is uh I think we'll stop here so today we just worked on the subtraction and multiplication button tomorrow in the next episode I think we'll work on Division and the random so I think that's it for this video thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share subscribe and ring the notification Bell and I'll see you guys in the next video so welcome back guys to another tutorial on kids coding playground today we'll be working on the part three for the math game so I already have my division button from the backpack so what I did was just drew a a rectangle and wrote division so it's pretty simple to do pretty sure you guys can all do that so first I'm going to start on the code on division so I'm going to get a one flag clicked I want to hide let me zoom in a little bit one flly click hide and then when I receive start game I want to hide and then when this Sprite is clicked I'm going to um broadcast start game and I'm going to broadcast a new message and call it start division uh start Division and next um when I receive choose game we are also going to show when you receive choose game we're going to show and then this part is just for when you put your mouse on it it'll get bigger and smaller so when flly clicked get a forever Loop if uh touching Mouse pointer then set size to 85 85 else we want to set the size back to 100 so okay so that's all the code for the division button let's move on to the cat so for the cat we're going to be making a new custom block so let's go to my blocks so we can create our new custom block and we can just simply call it Division division and click okay division I'm going to move it onto this side so I'm going to start coding from this side okay zoom in a little bit so I'm going to get a forever Loop uh I'm going to set the guess to zero set the guess to zero and then I'm going to set the random number one to pick random one to 100 so I'm going to do uh uh pick uh random 1 to 100 but for the second one I'm only going to pick random 1 to 10 so it's not too hard random number two to 1 to 10 so it could be two digit divided by one digit or three digit divided by two digit so it's not too hard um so we're going to get a repeat Loop repeat until repeat until um we're going to repeat until we're going to get an equal sign and a mod so what mod is is basically the remainder of two numbers so let's say I have a 10 and I have a five so if you click on it the mod is zero because 10 and 5 do not have a remainder but let's say if you do 10 and three the mod mod would be one because 10 / 3 is three remainder one so the remainder is one so mod is simply put um the two um values the and the remainder of the two values so that's what mod is so we're going to get the mod so this is just to pick it so it'll be a um so the two numbers getting divided would be even so it would not have remainders so we're going to make the numbers not have remainders so we're going to find the mod of random number one and random number two and if it's equal to zero because zero means um that there will be no remainder then we want to reset set the random number one to one pick random one to 100 like that and then we're going to set answer the problem uh to random number one divided by random number two so right here going to put random number one divided by random number two like that and then we're going to get a repeat until so we're going to repeat until repeat until um guess is equal to answer to problem guess is equal to answer to problem um and then next we want to ask ask uh join we need two joins um um since there's no division sign on the keyboard I'm going to be using the slash symbol which also means division so we're going to join the random number one and then I'm going to put slash random number two like that and then I'm going to set the guess to the answer set the guess to the answer and then after that I'm going to get an if else so let's put the if else in here drag the if else right here and if answer going to get uh equal so if the answer is equal to random number one divided random number two um random number one divide that by random number two then we're going to play I'm just going to duplicate this play sound guitar strum say that is correct and change the score by one and then when you get it incorrect I'm going to duplicate the same thing play the string pluck and say that is the wrong answer so that's it for the division block so now we're going to have to call it so let's go back right here um so I'm just going to get a broadcast when I receive start division I'm going to call the custom block Division and one last thing we have to do the random so I'm actually going to I have to put I still have to put the random in my um backpack so I'm going to do that real quick okay so now I have the random block so what this does is if you can't pick either of the modes then you can just click random and it'll pick a random mode for you so let's get a one flat clicked we won't hide this in the beginning hide and then when I receive start game when I receive start game we're going to hide and then when I receive choose game we want to show then um we're going to get the same thing from here drag and drop this into here this is all the same like that and then for the random part we're going to have to do the random part now so this function right here will pick a random uh mode for you so when this right click we want to broadcast start game and then we want to set um the variable random game we made from the beginning of the uh videos from the first video we made the variable random game so now we're going to have to use it so we're going to make it pick random one to four cuz there's four operators addition subtraction multiplication and division and then we're going to get an if then statement if random game is equal to one if random game is equal to one then we want to broadcast start addition um so I'm going to duplicate this everything else is pretty much the same so if random game is equal to two then we're going to have to do subtraction and let duplicate all of this put it under here and when random game is equal to three then we want to start multiplication and then when random number game is equal to four then we can start division okay so I think that's it so let's play the game I'm going to save it and then for the cat I'm just going to um put this right here so I don't have to keep on listening to this so let's make it bigger let's play Let's play a math game so let's click random as you can see it picked a random one for me and when you get it right it'll say it's correct if you get it wrong it'll say it's wrong so I'm going to quit um and I'm going to do division this time to show you guys what division is so 44 as you can see it's a whole it's a a number that uh it has no remainders um so 44 / 4 is 11 see there's no remainders uh we use the mod making it have no remainder so that's that's the good part of this so as you can see there's still still no remainder so that's working so it's pretty cool so that's it for this video I hope you enjoyed learning the series um make sure to like share and subscribe I'll see you guys in the next video so welcome back guys to another tutorial in kids coding playground today we're going to be evaluating to the math game so we're going to turn it into a math racing game um we convert it from the math game so if you have not done the math game you guys should do the math game first before working on this one and the players will have to answer a math question and every question it answers correctly will move forward if it doesn't answer any questions correctly it'll just stay put and the dog is controlled by the AI it'll just move amount uh like six steps or something like every second and if um the dog touches the Finish Line before the cat then you lose but if the cat touches the Finish Line before the dog then the dog loses so you want to beat the objective of the game is just to beat the dog and today we'll be learning these following concepts in scratch uh actually we will not be using variables and custom blocks this is from the last episode so that's why it has these but we will be using the broadcast message Loops I don't think we'll be using operator blocks but we'll be using some of these Concepts in here so let's go back to our project so I'm going to change this music right here because um we don't want to get flag our video flagged for copyright so that's not a good thing so our video might get taken down if we do copyrighted music so I'm going to show you the game now so I added some modifiers to this game like credits and all that stuff but and I also added an intro you guys can add that if you want as well let going turn up the volume a little bit so I added an intro it was pretty simple to make so these we will not need to get into cuz I did uh music um so let's go with multiplication because it's the easiest so if you get a question wrong you'll just stay in put if you get it right then you move forward if you get it right then you keep on moving forward so I'm going to try to beat this real quick 81 so as you can see um I'm pretty fast right now and the score still goes up right here so let's finish this real quick and I made made it a little bit more funny so like when you lose it'll say that you failed or something um uh we're almost there oops uh boom I think we got there I win and then it'll just say great job you beat the dog press the flag to play again and I can enjoy the music so that's what I did at the end so that's what I have so let's go to our project we were working on okay so now we are inside our project we work we were working on earlier so this is the one I've been teaching you guys with so we're going to go to the cat and we're I in the beginning I set the uh I made it go to um I think 204 204 58 and I also set the size of the cat to 60 um set the size of the cat to 60 and I'm actually going to upload some uh um backdrops into this one so let's go to backdrops backdrops so I have the um this is the winning winning screen these are are the intros um and this is the track the race track actually I move this like right here this is the RAC trck so this is the RAC track for and this doesn't look very good is not very proportionate so I just moved it to the left a little bit so now it's covering the whole screen so now let's go to the cat put down the backpack again so I set it to 204 why fit 58 and I set the size to 60 so it'll be be between the tracks and then for right here for like every single right answer we're going to have to do this so when um after this when the answer is correct we need to broadcast a message let's call it correct answer correct answer so this will go to the um cat when it receives correct answer so it'll move forward so going to do that for here as well you're going to have to do it for every single one put in here and finally in here so that's it for here and then now we're going to have to receive the message so when I receive correct answer then we want to repeat 10 times move three steps so basically moving 30 steps move three steps and then I did next costume wait 0.1 seconds so it look like it's running wait 0 one seconds and then if it's touching the finish line and I have to get the finish line which I don't have so I'm going to get that quickly okay so I just got the finish line from my other project so what I did for the finish line is basically a uh rectangle just a long rectangle so if you show it I put it right there move it like right there actually I might have to like en longate it a little bit there you go Center it a little bit smaller uh and look that yeah that looks fine so that's going to be my um Finish Line just a rectangle so I'm going to go back into my cat let's go to the code and then um if get an if then statement if it is touching the Finish Line touching Finish Line then I will make it say I win uh I win for two seconds I guess I win and then I'm going to switch the backdrop to uh this backdrop um this one the back drops so tell them that they won so I'm going to go into cat and then make it switch to backdrop five which is the waiting backdrop and then I'm going to stop the script after you win or you can just put stop ball I'm just going to put stop allall um and then now let's go to the dog so from the I just got the dog from the Sprite Library so let's go dog this dog I just got this one so I made it go uh when receive start game which is a broadcast I made I believe uh start game right here then I want to show in the beginning uh go to front layer and repeat repeat until it's touching the Finish Line just like the uh cat um touching Finish Line so we're going to make it move six steps that's what I did move six steps and then I'm going to next costume wait one second so his two costumes are like sticking out his tongue so I'm going to make it wait one second instead and then if he is touching the Finish Line then I'll make him say I beat you for two seconds I beat you for for 2 seconds and then I'm play the sound dog so I just play the sound that's what I did and then I'm going to broadcast a message called you lose you lose um and then I'm going to hide and stop all so that's what I'm going to do and then I'm going to get a one flag clicked show and I made the uh uh dog go to 183 2 for the X and Y position and I made him hide and actually we actually don't even need this show I don't even know why I put it there but um when the backdrop switches to backdrop 5 which is the winning screen I want it to hide so one backdrop switches to backdrop five then hide got to do the same thing with the cat so backdrop switches going hide then finally for the backdrop remember for I made like a little intro of the end flashing in the back I know it's not a good intro but you guys can do anything else so when I receed start game in the beginning I want to switch backdrop to backdrop one which is the first backdrop this one so after that I'm going to one fly clicked uh actually no we switched to backdrop 2 sorry about that so when you start the game you switch to backdrop 2 and then we're going to get one flat clicked repeat five times switch backdrop to backdrop seven backdrop to backdrop seven which is the um the flashing stuff I'm going wait 0.35 seconds that's what I did 35 I just experimented until I found the right number and then I'm going to switch the backdrop back to backdrop eight and then after that let switch backdrop backdrop two actually no we're switching it right here I forgot about that so we're going to do backdrop one right here for now and then I'm going to get a forever Loop set the volume to 40% cuz you actually don't you don't have to do that but I actually had a medieval sound cuz back then I had another song that was really loud so I set it to 40% so I actually did the medieval medieval one sound you guys can pick whatever sound you want and then just got to play the sound medieval one and Sil so for the Finish Line I'm going to get a one flly clicked go to this position and hide 2 28 y 22 that's where it is right now um and then when backdrop switches to backdrop two then we can show which is backdrop two is the oops backdrop two is the racing backdrop so going to sh and then after that when backdrop switches to backdrop 5 then we're also going to hide so yeah so yeah that's the code for the finish line so it show on the racing backdrop and it'll hide on the backdrop five the winning backdrop so I think that's pretty much it see what else we can add oh yeah and a losing losing screen yeah losing so I'm going to paint new Sprite going to make it like a red color um put marker cuz it's easier to read remember you lose okay so remember we broadcasted fail on the um so you can hold on alts if you want so it'll keep the Sprite centered when you make it bigger so when the dog right here touches the Finish Line it broadcast you lose so we're going to get a one fly click right here I want to hide this in the beginning and I'm make it go to 0 0 which is the origin make it go to 0 0 and then when I receive um you lose then I want to show and go to the front layer go to front layer and show so that's pretty much it let's try out now everyone I found out a bug while I was testing so in the beginning you want to actually hide I actually got the uh backdrops incorrect I'm sorry about that guys so up here where it's supposed to have a one flag clicked you have to replace it with the switch when this backdrop switches to backdrop one then you will execute all this code under here so that's one mistake I did and the other is inside the um backdrop I think yeah and these two are backwards I actually did it wrong I actually did it as backdrop one earlier which is wrong so you have to switch these two so that was um wrong so and the dog one last thing I wanted to make this dog at size 65 I think yeah I said I 65 so let's try it out now it should work so as you can see the intro plays and it say let's play a math game answer the following questions press the quick button to stop all answers uh choose one of the operations are random so see so that's correct you move forward so it's working as you can see so I'm going to try to beat this dog real quick uh1 and after I beat the dog I'm going to let you guys see what happens if the dog wins I'm going to like set the dog at going like 20 steps every time so or like 50 or something like that so I can show you guys what happens almost there I think one more should do there you go so now great job you beat the dog oh yeah and I can also make this hide if you want to do that quit you can just say when backdrop switches when backdrop switches to backdrop five which is the winning backdrop then you can hide so yeah as you can see it is working right now so I will show you what happens when you loose so let's do that make it like 50 steps and yes I need to show this in the beginning when fly clicked hide and when backdrop switches to backdrop two I think is the racing one yeah so switch to backdrop two so we can qu when backdrop switches backdrop two then we want to actually show this so let's try it out this time I will let the dog win I put it at 50 steps or something like that let it finish talking random beat me already so looks like the dog is going pretty fast so it'll say I beat you and then it'll say you lose as you can see so that's it for this tutorial on how to make a math racing game uh thank you guys for watching
