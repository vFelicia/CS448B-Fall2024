hello and welcome to kids coding playground channel here we'll be teaching kids step by step learning the basic programming concept one of my favorite tool to use is scratch scratch is a visual or interactive programming language to develop MIT what kids can program their own interactive story games and animation so it is a really fun and easy tool to use let's get started now we'll go to here so we need to go to scratch that mit.edu so in here you can you can sign up for your own account okay after you sign up then you can see your stuff what are some other things that you could you have your project come here and then you can also if you don't like the online version you can also go here go down here into the download so this download you can download the offline version of scratch meaning you can actually run it anywhere but I do recommend the online version so that if you have online access then you can pretty much use it anytime the offline versions you know you have to save it locally on your file in the year to like load it up but it allows you to work online without internet access but the online version everything is saved to your engine to your project so let me get started so now that you have a little bit basic of about scratch where did it go and how to download the scratch and how that lock in and use it so once you log in you will see you can go to my stuff click on this and you'll show like different stuff what are some of the project you have for scratch so or you can also create your new project so we can do that by clicking on this button here create a new project so when you create this new project it will low into this editor so this is the editor for scratch so let me show you one of the sly I made about the scratch so here the scratch editor this is a 3.0 scratch recently updated to 3.0 so this is a menu so this is the menu while you have here this is the stop and start this is the button to run your game this is the script area when you put your toe here those blocks this is the Kohl palette so you can track and drag the code and drop into this group area and these are the extension extension is like other stuff like music pen you know or others thing that you want to use with scratch and this is the background editor you can put a background for your game this is the sprite editor where you can edit putting different sprite like the cat here for example you can have a dog or something else and this is the stage meaning like when you're going to see so when your game runs so this is the basic apart the laid out for the scratch next we want to understand about the X&Y position of the of the scratch so in the center of scratch will be 0 0 this side will be positive x right this I will be negative X and this size positive Y this down here is negative Y so as you can see this quadrant here is positive x and positive Y here is positive x negative Y here is a negative x negative Y and here's negative x positive Y so here to kind of understand the positions of 0 0 is kinda in the center of the stage ok so next we're gonna go step by step teaching the kids how to code the first scratch game ok here we go so this is the sample lesson we can I walk on today so we're gonna have the cat in the background with the music and the cat will be dancing okay so let's let's start with the program so first we have the cat right so what we can do is we can click on this button here and go into here say select a background and then you can type maybe dance let's say yeah see dance so you have this spotlight select this so now you have the cat have a background of the dance stage we can't move that catcon in the middle of that stage here so after that what we can do is we can do some coding to make this cat move so first thing we can do is you can see these here these are the different code block they have so we can start with the first one event so when the button is clicked what do you want the cat to do so the cat it's not doing anything right now let's say we want to make the cat move so we're gonna have to take a look at this costume so as you can see the first costume is the cat camera standing here second custom is the cat can I like moving his leg so you can what you can do is you can put a loop we'll go into more detail on this later on but for right now I just follow along so you can see here control we can't drag this for loop into the into this block here so it was kind of like a Lego kind of thing you slaps naturally so and then you can say go back to here look and look you can say next costume so what you do is when you click on this you'll see the cat continuously forever changing the costume so I can click on this once so you can see it cannot go really fast right that's what we're not what we want right you can stop it so what we can do is you can put a little bit of weight okay in the control I believe yeah that's it yeah here so you can track weight over here you can do like 0.1 second so this is like a fraction of a second right so let's say if you go start again so you see how you click on this green flag go that means they will execute this block of code here so let me kind of zoom in so you can see better I should do that earlier so now let's let's click on this code so as you can see you can see the cat is kind of running or dancing or what it's doing and you can see that this block of code has become yellow meaning this isn't running so you can stop this now we have the cat moving kinda thing so now let's same one add some music to their cat right so what we can do we can go in here and then we can this is the extension we can add music extension so once you have the extension music you see something like this so what we can do is we can go back to the event we're gonna draw out another start when start is click then we are going back to the control we had another forever loop here and then what we can do is we're gonna make the cat kind of moving forward a little bit moving back a little bit so this is a movement so you had to go to the motion so you can say move forward ten step and what we can do is go back to the music we can say hey play this drum sound right or point zero five two second for the beat and then play and then make the movement again and then we can use like moving back right put back here and then you send ten so here so you can have like the drum plane is moving forward I'm moving backward and then we can use another music like let's say you can put another sound here and you can choose a different sound maybe you can choose this one right and then you can also make it move forward I can or you can just duplicate the code you right click say duplicate so now you have a second set of holes playing some sound we can move backward and forward again and then maybe we can delete this part we'd only track it back in here we'll delete that this one we can just select another one here so what happened if I run this code now you will see that the cat will continue moving dancing moving forward and backward and then we're changing the costume and playing this sound so let me run this real quick or save our project so as you can see this is a really simple project we created so where you can make the cat dancing right so next we can do is we can also make the cat maybe changing color so there's another event you can use by different event let's go back to the event so when space key is pressed so what we want to do is when the space key is pressed we want to change the color effects so we're going to go back to the look you can see that here change color effect by 25 so what happened is they kind of make the cat change the color and also you can make the cat say something if you like and you can say hello right and we can say hello for maybe one second right so what you do is when the game is running you can push the space key and it will change this you see hello the cat is changing colors so so you can see that the cat is dancing the music is playing in the background and then you can push the space key or change the color of the cap so and also you can also like you know let's say if I want to reset the game every time so let's say I dragged the cat over here so let's say what I can do is I drag this here so every time the game start we'll move the cat to this position let's save the cat somehow playing you doing some other game I can't move to a certain position but when I click on this stop button it'll always put the cat back to this stage here so I click on this your character your sprite in the game next thing we can do is I think we'll we'll stop here for now so this is kind of the basic of the game so next we can go introduction introduce how to add that even spry into the game maybe making adding the dog having the bats that flies around so ok we're gonna try that next next lesson thank you so if you like what I'm doing here please leave a like
