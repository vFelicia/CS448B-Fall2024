all right guys welcome back to kids calling playgrounds so today we are going to continue our uh the center platformer uh scrolling platformer game uh this time we'll probably work on the enemy and then i think we might have one more episode for the item so this is the main character i have so far let's see i have all the code here yep let me just kind of zoom in just go over it a little bit so these are called uh for the uh for setting up the uh the game here to clean the list restarting this is detecting the uh the sprite uh jumping and then over here we have the uh hitbox moving basically this main character and then we have the platform detection here and then also these are the code for the uh making the scrolling uh doing the calculation here and this is for the next level when the center we made to the end where we see the eclipse uh then the center jumps up so that's what that's for um this is the uh starting the control that's the kind of the main thing that starts kind of all the control for the other movement jumping and all so this is the movement uh on the top here i think that's the same the reset so this is the jump on this side okay and then the movement control if you guys missed anything kind of pause the video just kind of copy it down make sure you get all of them okay and then we have the animated character um that's the animated character code i can already explain how what this means in the counter making the animated uh characters lie and all that and then the jumping and running uh this is the ground uh so the ground you all might be different so basically you know just whatever how many crown you have so i have eight eight ground so that's why i have a zero to seven here um basically zero times 480 will be zero so it starts at zero zero and then it goes like another 480 480 keep on stitching up the ground okay make sure you have this at the end to hide it okay uh sanding for the virtual ground very similar to the ground so uh but the virtual ground will go to the back layer okay and then you have the background scrolling so background scrolling we use a division here making the scroll a little bit slower okay uh we have the spike so this is like the spike if you like to put into your game where you want to clone it and i think that's about it and we have the mute sound so sound is where we like you know jumping getting hit or you know falling off the water and then this the igloo includes the code is to just like broadcast the next level when when you touch the main character basically going from level one to level two so now let's go on and work on the enemy so the enemy is gonna be a little bit complicated so let me just trash this code here i have some code earlier when we're doing some testing okay so we're gonna attract some of the stuff uh from let's say um this one uh the spike to the enemy and then we're gonna work on it so uh we're gonna get the reset so we always need that we need to set up okay we need to uh placing the clone at the place the position uh we don't need the moving ground so we're gonna use another thing and then we're gonna use when i start as a clone okay so let's kind of spread this out a little bit so we're gonna have to call all this out so it will not be exactly the same we're gonna have to make some changes to the code okay so let's see so so far uh you know you can put your tiger anywhere it doesn't really matter right we were just doing it earlier so what i'm going to do is i'm going to remove this don't need that uh we're going to make the tiger rotation left to right and then high okay okay next we're going to look at the reset code delete the clone that looks correct and then we have the position that is also correct within not doing anything much with that uh so next we'll go on to the uh placing the clone and setup so let me kind of move this thing around a little bit we're going to work on these things later these two so these these three on top is good so far they're good okay so these three so i'm gonna work on this placing the clone so i'm gonna change it out a little bit and also gonna have to change out some of these things so right click say edit here we are gonna add more um we're gonna add a label okay i'm gonna call it distance so adding a label you can actually easier to see if you want to add the label so for your game for your variable if you don't want to add the label it's fine it doesn't matter i just try add a label so label is just kind of like before the variable you can tell what is about distance and you can say next you can have next label so speed then you can add it speed and then add one more label type and then we have the variable type okay so i'm go it's gonna look like this okay and then we are gonna work on it okay so before we go we're gonna make the uh a variable for or for the monster okay so we already have this x and y uh which is for this sprite only right for the enemy so what i'm going to do is i'm going to rename this okay i'm going to rename everything with monster in it so that's going to be easier to see okay monster x i'm gonna go capital x here camo case uh rename this one monster y okay so where the monster x monster y uh what we're going to do is we're going to make more variable for the sprite only monster um animation with a new variable for the sprite only monster uh we did i think we we don't wait i didn't use it but uh you know going forward different game we can track keep track of the monster dying or not i think we we might not need this i didn't do anything with it you know like maybe another game we can like kill the monster and they die then you need that so let's not create it now for my main game i actually have it but for for teaching you guys let's not have it right now and that monster that let's create months the distance that is okay monster distance okay next um we're gonna use um for this sprite only again oh sorry monster distant counter so this is going to use this counter kind of like a delay we're going to count uh the monster moving uh the distance and then keeping track of that how far it's going to go and then this is a monster speed so everything start with monster we're gonna fold this sprite only okay then we're gonna make one more monster type okay so i think we have all of it okay so let's just take this guy out not showing up okay even the g position we can move that away okay all right so let's go back to the monster we have all the sprite here okay so we're going to change this up a little bit i'm going to use the if and else statement here put that here get the operator uh get the speed make it greater than zero so what we're going to do is we're going to make the monster either turn into a left or right based on the speed so for this one we're gonna make it point direction 90 and this is negative 90. okay all right so i'm going to put this under here and then i'll remove this i'm going to use that later so what i'm going to do is going to use the go to and we are going to use go to the monster x and monster y position of the monster now we are going to set up the variable so set up monster distant okay so we're gonna grab this drag this here okay duplicate this monster speed so you can make this months ago faster or slower you know okay duplicate that and then we have one more monster type okay grab this okay and then we're gonna have another one uh month the distance count we're gonna reset to zero and uh we don't have months the debt i don't need that so let's go on to the next one make it go the front layer show and create this clone okay so this is what i have so far for the for the placing the clone down okay let's work on the setup next to it we have set up i think i'll move this out a little bit so set up or level one where you want to put the monster at okay i already have to coordinate down but uh what you can do is you're gonna have to you know find your coordinate where you want to put the monster so for me i have uh putting it 400 and then negative 20 so for my first tiger and the distance i want him to travel is 75 this is kind of like a delay counter that we're gonna use and the speed is five meaning that's monster let's go on travel five and two uh this is type two monster so for me i have you see how this monster uh so type two is the running of the white tiger so type one is the yellow so we have more months so you can actually create more and put your costume here and then you can actually create you know different monster for your level okay so for my example i only show the white tiger and the yellow tiger so that's all i had but you can have many many more so let's say we want one tiger here and another tiger somewhere at this position oh one three four five and then this is uh i say negative eighty so that means it's lower on the ground so one two twenty i think it was up at the a little bit higher so this thing i want him to travel a little bit further i will give like 150 and then i say monster one that means the yellow tiger so for level one i have three tiger in my main game so i just gonna put this position 200 2800 this is the x position the y position and then i put another one this is two so meaning white tiger yellow tiger white tiger okay for level one okay okay let me drag this drop this all this delete all that stuff and level two we can have different one um for my level two i also have it i just gonna coat it up for now we can just take a look later okay so for level two i have um at this position negative eighty i made it uh 150 that's the distance five and one and then this one i made it is two i made 85 as a distance you have to kind of try it i'll show you what i mean later and then this is i had it as two one five zero uh so if your stages haven't gone too too far you might have to have it differently okay so let's just for now let's have this as the one and i'll show you later what i mean okay okay so we're gonna work on when i start as a clone so no i don't need this go to uh what we're going to do is if you touch the main character you're gonna die right so main character gonna so same thing make sure the main character is moving not dying and then if it if we touch it it will play this sound and then we're gonna mark it as hit it got hit okay so same code very similar okay so now we have this setup now what happened when we have the monster okay so let's see we have everything okay seems like we do so what we're going to do is not going to work yet so um if we're going to start you can see kind of like the tigers somewhere over here using these three tigers not really correct right then generate the right tigers not you have three tiger but it's not not correct you see we want two white and one yellow right it's not correct so what we're going to do is we're going to have to animate the monster so let's go on to the uh go back to the main character okay so in the main character so go look for the start game so let's go over here we have start game here uh you see after the move ground uh what we're going to do is we're going to get another broadcast message put in here and we're gonna make it called animate monster okay so this will will make the monster move and set up the correct position now go back to here okay all right so we broadcast the animated monster right so what we need to do is we're going to set the position of this guy so say when i receive animated monster i'm gonna have to call this position block okay and then we are going to use the operator the minus duplicate this put one over here and then we are going to use the x position the minus x minus the um where's the scrolling x and then we will use minus the y minus the scrolling okay and the original game have the gscore i don't think i have that right on the oh i have speed okay this is wrong need to get the uh scrolling right yeah so i got the wrong one so so many variable in this game so just make sure you grab the right one so it's the scrolling okay not the speed okay so answer x minus the scrolling x minus the y minus the square y so this is going to put the monster at this location so let's try to run it for now let's see how it actually look does it even put the monster you see we have the monster tiger over there but he's not moving you see he's not moving but if we jump on it we'll die and we'll go back to the beginning right and we lost one life so this part of the code is working right uh placing down the monster is working but it's not moving so we want to make the monster move right we don't want the ones in the state okay so what we need is we're gonna have to do another block of this so um when i receive anime monster okay so here we are going to use some if condition okay so grab this go to the condition here so get this even else okay and then let's grab this one delete this clone put that in the else block okay get the condition here oh okay so let's just create this monster dead actually i might need that because i'm actually using that in my game actually so let's create monster dead okay for this sprite only so let's use that just don't want to complicate it the uh the condition here so let's use it like that we'll we'll try next time another way so let's put this so if the monster is not that so it may be later we can make it months to die so uh you know you can kill the monster but for now we're gonna set up like this uh so since we created a new variable right make sure you put this back over here sorry about that guys so here um grab this just duplicate this one for now and select monster dead say no okay okay all right let's go back over here okay so if you notice so the monster want to create is not that right so move okay grab this uh change put it in here um monster distance counted by one so what we're going to do is you're kind of using a delay calendar keep going up and then we're going to use it to check against the monster distance okay okay so what we're going to do is if i get some if condition put it in here and then you're going to use the operator here what we're going to check is going to check the type of monster this monster type equal to one okay so what we're going to do is we're gonna we're going to for the first one the minus the one i have is a yellow type right so let's define a block yellow oops sorry tiger okay so select this run without refresh and then we are going to do it over here for now so here we say change change the monster animation and then use the device symbol make it a little slow here because we don't want this to go crazy so i'm gonna divide by four one divided by four and then we're going to use this switch costume okay then similarly that we're using the switch custom for the other one right before so what we're going to do is use this floor okay okay so grab this plus sign put this here okay then we have to get this mod uh grab the monster animation and then we can mod 10 since we have uh since we have 10 costume so if you look over here i have the yellow tiger up to 10 right so 10 before i change the white type so we're going to do mod 10 and then we're gonna put plus one since this is where i start at the first one so mark 10 will be like the the remainder of whatever plus one okay so and then we're going to take the flow of that meaning the lower number okay if it's a decimal then take a lower number okay so put that into here okay then if and then we are going to say use the end condition and then we're going to use the greater than and then we're going to use the less than okay and then we are going to get this costume i'll use a custom number we're going to say we're going to randomly put i mean i want to put something between the uh the middle of it so uh what i'm going to do is three between three and eight i'm gonna set the uh set the speed for the monster okay monster speed so we're gonna use the another operator here a plus uh sorry not monster speed sorry monster x sorry so we're gonna try to adjust the monster x actually made the mistake over there so use monster x plus the monster speed so whatever that was set so if you if you want the monster to go faster i think we have five right so we will try to adjust that um position plus five so this this monster every time the costume go between uh greater than three and less than eight will adjust the the monster x position okay okay so what we're going to do is we're going to call the yellow tiger so we don't have the white tiger yet we'll do the white tiger later okay but now we'll just test with the yellow tiger and then we're going to get the if condition put that under here and then we're going to use the operator here greater than what we're going to do is kind of check the monster distance counter if the amount of this encounter is greater than the monster distance basically um basically kind of got delayed keep on going but let's say you want the monster to travel it will saying the distance is 475 right after 75 what we want to do is we're gonna make the monster go backwards so to do that what we're going to do is say set monster speed uh we're gonna use the operator uh multiply so what we're gonna do we're gonna multiply by negative one so if there's a positive speed going to the right we're gonna multiply by negative one it will become negative speed so the amounts will go to the left okay so we're gonna multiply the monster speed take that out okay and then we're gonna have to reset this because uh we're gonna have to reset the counter back to zero so that'll start again so it will turn around and start running the other way and then to make it turn around use the opponent direction uh what you want to do is you can use the negative sign actually here and put 0 and then put the direction of the of that monster so if it's going to the right it will go to the left it's going the left will go to the right okay so we have the yellow tiger done now let's just check it out so i think in the beginning i actually have the white tiger in my first game but let's just try the yellow tiger and see how it works okay so let's say we move over here we should see a yellow tiger running you see it you see that so this tiger will run so so so he scratched me i died but anyway you see this tiger running right so if you want the tiger to be somewhere here or something like that you have to adjust it so let's say you click on the mouse button you have a 80 and uh negative 74 right i think i'll highlight it actually you need negative 80 to position the tiger to be on the ground so let's say if i want the tiger to run between the end here and i want to put it like somewhere you know here or whatever right so whatever it is so let's say you want the tiger to be here you can do like 180 you can try to change this right um whatever the position is so now let's let me move back so let's say i stop let's say i want to start again let's say i have my mouse here and i push the m so unless i want the tiger to be at this position so let's say i want that so let's say we'll put it 100 right sides 100 and then let's put it at negative 80. so the title will start running around here so the tigers running around this this area so if you want him to go further right because i i put 75 because it was on the top over there did not have much space and i did not want him to run and pass that past the ground right so you want the tiger to run more right you can put this to like let's say 1 200 or whatever right 200. so now i if i started again you see the tiger's gonna come back you're gonna run further away so he might run through so you see he's running through the uh do the thing you do not want to do that right so you're gonna have to just try to adjust it correctly i mean it i already adjusted but you're gonna have to adjust the tiger correctly so that you know it doesn't run off the screen or whatever okay so so there you go so really quick we're gonna put the uh put back the same coordinates uh for the tiger that i had initially for my game so i had it at 400 position x and negative 80 and negative 20 and then i have this thing was 75 and then i have number two as a white tiger so now let's work on the white tiger i think we are already a lot of time almost 30 minutes on this video so let's finish this up real quick let me find my code okay this is my yellow tiger here okay so we're gonna create something similar what we're going to do is we're going to make a new block called our white tiger okay so run it without refresh so what we're going to do is we'll take this code duplicate here um we're going to change this a little bit so since um you see my costume here i have 10 and number 11 is where the tiger white tigers start right so we're going to do mark 10 because 10 costume since inside one you put 11. and here um i earlier i was using 13 and 8 i mean 3 and 8 we'll use 13 and 18. so somewhere within this um within this costume number 13 and number 18 we're going to set the speed back the master speed x i mean set the nonsense position with the speed okay so now we have the white tiger now let's just test the game out real quick let me hide the mouse position for now okay so let's open the bigger screen so let's see so we have the first white tiger so i'm lagging a little bit i think it's because of the um because i'm recording i think let's see oh there's some issue with my white tiger actually let's see maybe i forgot to reset some variable let's see okay you know what i actually forgot to do this condition here right there's no white tiger so don't forget to do that put this over here put this back in here sorry about that throw this away call the white tiger here and call that number two okay so let's see now should work now i forgot to call the code okay so now let's test it out so even though like when you're making the code right the first time you did everything right but then you know when you're teaching it again sometimes you mess it up so you can see the white tigers here that was my first one i think i have one more over here so here this guy that this guy runs a little bit further you see he runs further than the white one because his distance 150 so as you can see we have the tiger two i think that's one more white tiger something right here see so we put two or three right so just depending on where you want to put and then on the second level i put the tiger at this position i believe somewhere here see so this tiger is running so there you go so um this is the animating the monster for this tutorial uh so so you can see right so um so the first level i have three tiger right at this position this is a distance this is the speed and this is the type of the tiger the enemy number two i have only two one at this position one at this position okay so this is pretty much all the code for the animating the uh the um we call it animating the monster okay so let's look at the let's i'm just going to scroll down i mean go around the code let you guys uh pause down if you miss anything okay just in case because this is a little bit more complicated than you know like a spike or something like that so okay hopefully you guys understand it and then this is the uh animating the uh monster which is uh broadcast by the main character okay and then this is uh making the custom switch custom for you know making look like it's running okay all right so that is it for this video uh so next video we'll probably work on the items and other stuff and then we'll be done okay all right if you guys like this video please give us a thumbs up that really help out the help us out and uh you know they'll push this video more to other people who are interested in learning scratch and stuff alright thank you guys see you guys next time bye
