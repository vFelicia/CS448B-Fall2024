so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding CLR today we'll be finishing up the um coin matching game so from last week we did the um check button the new button um the robot setup and the back drop so that's all we have for today today we'll be working on the arrows and add some more code to the Rob but so let's go to the first Arrow the down one for the one cent so for the down one I'm going to get a one flag clicked green flag is clicked zoom in well let's hide and then when the backdrop switches to backdrop too then we want to show because the first backdrop is the um the instructions backdrop and then the second one is the actual dis back drop and then after that we want to do when this Sprite is being clicked then let's get an if then statement if if selected one selected one is greater than selected one is greater than zero cuz this is going back that means minus one so if selected one is greater than zero that means anything greater than zero then we want to change the selected one byga 1 selected one by negative 1 so this Arrow all the left arrows are making it minus one and all the right arrow are making it go up by one all right so for the up arrow is pretty much the same thing but we're just going to um and the only reason we put the zero right here is to prevent it from being a negative number so um let's drag and drop all of this code into the up key we just have to change it a little bit like that okay so um we have all this code so for this one we're just going to take all this out just take all of that out and change selected one Nega by neg one selected 1 by one instead of negative 1 okay so for the down five it's pretty much the same thing as well going to drag and drop the same code from down one into down five down five pretty much the same thing except we have to change the variables since I've selected one it'll be selected five uh because this is the um five cent down button and then we're going to change this to selected five as well so that's the code for this down for the up it's literally the same thing as this one except for the variable we just have to change some variables so just keep on repeating this until you're all done with all of them so up we're going to have to do select five and change it by one so up you're going to have to do that and then for the down one I'm just going to drag and drop all of this into the down 10 instead we're going to do the new other variable select 10 instead of Select five so just keep on repeating this select 10 and this should be select 10 as well so now we have all of that let's go to the up one so let's drag and drop this this and this okay and you can actually skip this part if uh you want you can just pause the video and just do it yourself so selected 10 change that by one and then finally we have the last down button so let's drag and drop this into the down down down button so instead right here we're going to change this to um 25 um I mean selected 25 and this should be selected 25 as well so that's for the down and then for the up we're going to get this code instead we're going to have to change the variable this variable should be selected 25 okay now let's try it out so now when you click the up and down as you can see when it's uh zero you cannot keep on going down goes up as you can see as you can see it's working so now the arrows are working out and I also want to show the target when it switches to this backdrop so so right here show the target variable I forgot to do that in the last video but in this video Let's just show it show the Target in the beginning when you click space the target shows up so now let's work on the rest of the code for the Retro robot so we're going to make a custom block for the Retro robot so let's make a custom block we're going to name it calculate calculate so this to calculate um the least amount of steps or least amount of coins it takes to get the value so in the beginning we're going to set all the calculate uh variables to zero so we're going to set uh so calculate one calculate 5 Calculate 10 and calculate 25 all to zero and then we're going to set the remainder to like Target the remainder to the Target which is pick random one to 100 and then we're going to we're going to start from the biggest number the 25 because we want to find the least amount of coins so we're going to start from the 25 cent repeat until repeat until the remainder is less than 25 repeat until the remainder is less than 25 the variable remainder and then we'll uh if this is true then we will set the remainder set the remainder to remainder minus 25 so it subtract let me duplicate this remainder minus 25 and then we want to change the calculate 25 by one because you have one more so you want to change the calculated 25 by one all right so now now we just duplicate this and now we just have to change this to 10 change this to 10 and instead of calculate 25 we're going to do Calculate 10 and change by one like that all right let's duplicate this put this under here this remainder is less than five so now we have do five change this to five as well instead of Calculate 10 we're going to calculate five and then finally we have down here we want to set the calculated one to the remainder the value of whatever the remainder is all right so this is the calculate custom block code okay now let's continue so remember earlier I uh broadcasted the message um check check answer well now this is where the check answer comes into play so we're going to try to find the least amount of steps you can do this in so we're going to do when I receive check answer we're going to calculate on this custom block right here and then we're going to get an if L statement okay so if if the selected one is equal to selected calculated one so this is just to find the least amount of steps this is a really long statement right here so we're going to need three ands I think yeah so let's get three ands um and then so we're going to get an equal right here equal going to put it equal right here equal right here and an equal right here a really long statement so if the selected one so whatever the selected is is equal to the amount of calculated one so the amount you selected is equal to the calculated one and selected five is equal to calculated five and then you have selected 10 yeah this is pretty long selected 10 is equal to calculated 10 and selected 25 is equal to select uh calculate 25 then that means we have to get it say that's correct cuz that's the least number of steps say that that is correct correct that is correct and then let's say if it's not the least amount of steps we're going to get another F statement put that inside the else area so this is the code for the top just show it for a little bit if else inside the else area so if the target is equal all so we're going to need three addition signs let's put that right here wait um we're going to need this this oops sorry addition not subtraction uh like that and like that so three addition signs so if the selected one is multiplied by one so this is like if you get it correct but it's not the least amount of steps it will do this selected five multiplied by five selected 10 is multiplied by 10 uh I think we need even more we need actually we need one more addition sign so get an addition sign put this selected one um plus uh this selected one multiply oh sorry this should be multiply I'm doing this wrong sorry about that multiply so we're going to get this selected one multiplied by one plus selected five multiplied by five this should be multiplication not addition select five multiplied by five this is a really long one as well and then we need another addition uh selected 10 multiply by 10 multiply selected 10 multip by 10 and then we need a selected 25 multipli by 25 so we're going to get addition sign one last one pop that in the front and drag drag this over here selected 25 multiplied by 25 selected 25 multiplied by 25 like that put that in the front and if that's equal to the target number then we will say that is correct but that is not the least amount of steps that is correct but it is not the least amount of coins like that and if it's just completely wrong then we will just say that is incorrect all right so I think we're done now let's test it out all right let's try it out let's click the play Space Bar new 81 so let's do three of these 75 and then we do one of these 80 and then one of these check that is at least amount of steps so that is correct let's put a new one let's say if we do it slower so let's do like six of these and then two of these it'll say that is correct but that is not the least amount of coins so as you can see it's working and when you just get it completely wrong it just says that is incorrect so I'm going to do one more 86 let's see three of these one of these and one of these that is correct so as you can see it is working now so yeah that's pretty much it for the coin game so thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share and subscribe and I'll see you guys in the next video bye
