welcome back everyone to kids coding playground today we'll be making a basketball free throw challenge two player game so as you can see my brother made a uh another basketball game um we posted this tutorial a few days ago but instead um of using video we're going to be using just the mouse so like the last one like you use your video you try to like use your body parts to knock the ball into the goal well this time it's gonna be different so i'm gonna demonstrate the game so let's play it so player one starts out so however strong you however you hold the ball as you see the power is going up as you can see i miss so usually around 50 to 60 power it will make it in as you can see i made it in and i gained one score in the right side you can see and let's see uh i missed that see around from 50 to 60 it will make it in all right let's say you don't make it yeah just switch to the next player yeah so it's basically kind of like a basketball free throw each person gets five throws all right let's finish this game real quick all right okay so as you can see player two had three score and player one had zero score so player two won so it will display player two wins so that's pretty much the game let's create a new project all right so we'll start out with renaming the project let's name it the basketball free throw through all right and then we would not use the scratch cap we i'm pretty sure they have a basketball spread in here yeah we'll just take this basketball sprint um we'll name this p1 which since we're clear one we can duplicate it and then we'll just p2 yeah we'll just basically recolor it let's make it look a blue color boom so we just recolor this p1 is um just the normal basketball and then for p2 we will do just a blue basketball all right so for the code we are also going to uh for the backdrop i mean we're also getting a backdrop so i'm pretty sure that's a basketball backdrop basket yeah we're here we'll be using this one i guess okay so now we're going to make the target sprite um inside the game so we're going to know the backdrop and we're only going to take this basketball hoop we're just going to copy it and then we're going to make a paint and do spring paste it here or to ungroup this thing so that we can get only the white part we just need the backboard that'll be our target so we're just gonna delete all of this and leaving us with this and you can just drag it on top to fit it like that now we're going to rename the sprite to target okay target so inside the target and then we inside the target we'll just put a simple piece of code when greenfly clicked inside the target we're just going to make it go to the back layer all right that's it go to back layer that's it and then for the player one ball we're going to start off with make getting a one green flag clicked so inside the player one ball one green flag clicked we're going to show and then we're going to set the size to 100 because um as you saw in the demonstration the ball gets smaller as you get closer the goal is to simulate that it's going further away from you and for the old project i made it go to x zero and then the y is negative 110 all right and then we're going to make two variables for all sprites one is called p1 uh score and then the other one should be called p1 ball count so this is the amount of balls the player has all right and then um we'll need to make two more variables for this sprite only so you have to click the for the sprite only we'll name it counter so this is to count how many times you'll go through the loop and then we will make another for the sprite only and will be power power so it's how much power you throw the ball at all right so first we will get a when this sprite is clicked so as you can see we use the mouse so we're going to use sprite clips um also after this we have to set the p1 score to zero and set the player one ball counts oops ball count to five so i'll give them five shots and then when the sprite is clicked we are going to set the power to zero in the beginning and then we're going to point direction of zero which is pointing up and now we're going to get an if then statement so if if the player ball count is greater than zero so if they haven't ran out of tries then it will uh repeat until not mouse down so you'll keep on repeating this until not mouse down so not mouse down mouse down put that in here and then we're gonna basically when you're clicking on it we're gonna change the power by uh pick random one to ten to give it a little bit variability just make it a little vary a little bit so we're going to change the power by pick random one to ten right and then right here we're going to get an if then statement inside this repeat loop so we're going to get an if if the power is greater than or equal to zero i'm 100 equals 100 greater than or equal to 100 so basically once you hold on the ball too long and the power exceeds 100 we're basically just going to make it go start back from the beginning so so if the power is greater than 100 or equal to 100 then we're going to set the power back to zero so it'll keep on looping around right and then we're going to make it wait 0.01 seconds let's give it a little bit weight and then we're going to broadcast a message called shoot so this is the shoot the ball all right so inside the same sprite we're going to want to receive shoot um we can uh set the counter to zero so the counter will be zero i actually could have done all the code in player one and then do and then just duplicated the sprite um but i guess that's okay because some of the code is different from player one and player two all right when i receive shoot set counter to zero and then we're going to repeat until the counter is greater than power or that it's touching the edge all right so we're going to repeat and again or let's move this to the side of it or um counter greater than power um counter power the counters just like to count how much times it loops and then we're going to if it's touching the edge as well touching edge and then after this we're going to make it move five steps so it's going to be five steps towards the goal so move five steps and we're going to change the counter by one all right and then we're going to move but we're going to set the size to 100 and then we're going to go back to the original zero negative 110 after you've shot the shot shot the ball all right and then we're going to broadcast player 2 ready the player 2 will be ready once the player is done one is done shooting so to ready and then we're going to hide this ball once it is done once you're done all right so what else do we have to do oh yeah and when i receive shoot remember we broadcast here we have to receive something else when i see the message shoot now we're going to change the um p1 uh ball counter by negative one and we're going to repeat 20 times so it's just to make the ball smaller so it will look like it's going away from you repeat 20 times and then we're going to change the size by two negative two all right okay so and then we will get another one green flag clicked so i'm gonna fly clicked forever so if the power is between 50 and 60 then and touching the target then we'll change the score so if so we're going to need two and statements so and and operators put them like that and so if the power is greater than 50 and the power is less than 60 so it's between 50 and 60 because it's around the near the goal that's why we're doing that power is less than 60. then and touching the target so if it require if it's within all these requirements then we'll broadcast a message um called score and wait it used to wait oops all right and then when i receive score inside the player player one i receive score we're going to hide change the p1 score by one and then we're going to wait a point two second all right okay let's try it out for player one so so as you oh wait let me show the variable first show the variable power all right let me change it to slider all right let's play it in so as you can see when you hold on it the slider will continue um going back and forth and listen uh 61 that's a miss as you can see 46. so yeah that's um kind of what it is let's try overtime let's try again something within 50. oops as you can see that is score because it's touching the target and it's between 50 and 60. all right so now let's work on player two in player two we are going to just drag and drop all this code we'll have to change some of it obviously drag on the screen here all right i think we have all the code inside player 2. let's just split some of this code out all right so up here first of all we're going to make some new variables so we're going to make a new variable oh wait i think i made the player um power thing uh i made the power for um did i make it for all sprites i think i did because it's showing up right here so i think we're going to have to um delete power and then we're going to have to make it again we just forgot to set it for the sprite only sorry about that so power we'll just put this back power equal to 100 um so yeah you always have to remember to set this to um this sprite only set power to zero right where else do we oh we're using power right here as well where else do we have using power i think that's it checking uh all right i think that's all the uses of power oh yes and i forgot you also have to set the power to zero in the beginning that's one more and we have to um change the power by pick random change power i pick random one to ten give you a little theory all right i think that's all of it sorry about that i forgot to change it to this right only so inside here the variables what's oh wait it's already made for us oh okay i think i think when i um had this it was already with it so player two also needs a variable called power but you also have to set it to the sprite only so you just remember that i will also make another variable inside player two so we're going to we're just going to name it uh counter again but for the sprite only for this right only and then we're going to make some new variables called p2 ball count and p2 score for all sprites this is for all sprites uh score yeah there you go um okay so inside the player two we are going to change up some variables instead of p1 score we're going to do p2 score and p2 ball count and right here um power 0 this is all the same except variables power p2 ball count and right here same instead of shoot we're gonna broadcast shoot two because shoot is already in use so we're gonna make a variable shoot two because if we get a broadcast shoot from player two it's gonna use what player one is doing so we're gonna have to broadcast shoot two and right here player two score we're gonna change the player two score and then right here we're gonna do the player two ball count change that all right um anything else okay i think this power has to be for this sprite only the power for this one yeah so power already there all right so now what else do we have to do all right yeah and we also have to do this so in here remember i also forgot to drag and drop one more piece of the code so remember to get all of your code in here so let's zoom back in you guys have to change this one the counter is the same yeah uh counter um and then set size 100 go to that yeah and then instead of player two ready we're gonna um yeah so right now we're gonna do player one ready we're gonna make a new message called player one ready because the player two has already gone so we're gonna be player one ready all right so and then right here we're going to receive a message when i receive player 2 ready from the player 1 we're going to show this one and also we're going to just drag and drop this into the player 1 and player 1 instead of player two ready we're gonna do player one ready then we'll show and then also in player two we're gonna add one more piece of code so right here instead of shoot we're obviously gonna have to um broadcast shoot two same with all of this one this has to be shoot too and right here we're gonna have to make a new variable called score that new message called score two so uh where did we do the score um all right so down here we're going to have to broadcast a new message called score 2 and wait remember that and so then right here we're going to do score 2 and wait all right all right i think everything is now fine all right okay so inside the shoot 2 we're going to get an if then so what this does is like so since player two goes last we're going to have to put an ifthen statement inside of here so we're gonna get an if that statement so if we're gonna wrap it around this one and put the hide back at the bottom so if the player ball count is greater than zero then we're going to broadcast player one ready since player two goes last player one counts p1 ball counts all right now we can work on like the flashing thing as you can see in the beginning like when we in the demonstration like it'll say player one ready player two ready so we're gonna do that stuff so we're just gonna paint some sprites all right so let's get the text bright um just make it green i don't know just right um player when ready just to like let the players know that player one is going right center sprite and then we're just gonna duplicate this one let's just make it another color oops let me duplicate it again i have to change the color first that's my mistake player two ready okay now now i can highlight it and turn it right all right so we have player one ready player two ready and then we're gonna let's say both players tie so we're gonna duplicate this and we're gonna context and right it is a tie because it is still possible to tie in this game if both players get the same score well let's make it like a yellow color orange color you know yellow is kind of hard to see it's got a dark orange color all right so now we have our costumes let's go into our ready spray so let's rename it to ready okay so inside the ready spray we're going to make a block and the block is going to be named uh blink so we're going to make it like blink a little bit like flash so instead of having to redo the code over and over again we're just going to use a custom block to define it so we can repeat two times repeat two times wait point one second 0.1 seconds show wait just duplicate this and then right here at the end where it's gonna hide and then we're gonna also put a hide at the bottom like that okay and then when green fly clicked we're going to switch the costume to costume one which is the this one the player one wins and then we're going uh player one ready so and then we're gonna put the blink custom block under it and then when i receive player one ready just duplicate this and then when i receive player two ready oops we're just gonna use the same thing but we're gonna use costume two instead which is the player all right so that's pretty much it let's go to the wind spread so we're gonna make a new sprite let's make it like a blue color i guess dark blue color and then we're gonna write you win player one wins player one wins all right and then we're also gonna do a player two wins and so on actually wait the it is a tie is supposed to be in here it's my mistake player 1 wins and then we're going to switch this to player two wins and then it is a tie should be inside this one okay and then we're gonna write is a tie if the tie has to be in the you win um uh sprite so that's what we're going to do all right so inside the wind sprite we're just going to rename this sprite to win in the code we are going to um when green fly clicked hide and right now we're gonna have to wait one second so the reason for uh so we're gonna wait one second right here okay and then after this we're going to forever loop and then if the um player ball count is equal to zero and the player two count is equal to zero so we're going to put an and equal zero zero player one ball count player two ball count is equal to zero we're gonna wait two seconds and the reason for waiting two seconds is so the last player can finish shooting before all right so after you finish this code i'll show you why we will need to wait because sometimes if you do if you don't wait the player might be the player two might be like halfway done with shooting but it'll end the game and say player one wins even though player two could have probably tied up the game or something so after this we're going to get in if else so if put that if else in here so if player 1 scores equal to player 2 score so that means if they're both equal then we're going to make it tie so player 2 score then we're going to switch the costume to costume 3 which is the tie oops which is the thai um costume yeah all right and after this we're going to get another if else statement so if inside the else we're going to put another if else so if the player one score is greater than the player two score player one is greater than player two score then we're going to switch costume to costume one which is the costume for player one winning else we'll switch to costume two which is player 2 winning and then after this we're going to show and we're going to stop all all right now we're finished the code i will show you exactly why we would need that okay so let's move all the player two uh stuff onto one side and all the player one stuff onto one side so the player two power well i'll put on slider right so that's player two power player two score i'll just do it like that player one ball count player one power all right player two score and put this on top all right now we have both sides okay let's test out the game so as you can see i didn't i'm not making any of these shots right now yeah yeah so that should be a shot as you can see player 2 now has one point i overshot that one over shot this one too 59 that's a shot this might end up as a tie actually yeah so it's a tie so it will say it is a tie and obviously you can make these sprites go to zero zero if you want so in the beginning you can just make it go to zero zero so it's even and also for here you can also white green plug plates zero zero all right so i will remove this um wait two seconds and show you what will happen now okay so let's quickly finish this game all right so right now i made one with player two so as you can see player uh two has one more shot left player two has one more uh two more shots left player one has one more shot left player one will go one more time as you can see look in the middle of shooting player two will already stop even though player one already lost but player one could have had a chance to win so you do not want this to happen you don't want it to just randomly stop the action before the polish being shot so we always have to make it wait two seconds before we do it all right so that's that's why the wait two seconds is necessary alright so thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share and subscribe and i'll see you guys in the next video
