so welcome back guys in today's and other kids coding playground video today we normally make games but today I'll be telling you how to make a animation so we will be working on an animation a really short animation so it's about giggle C 5 she's like hiking and then she's lost she finds a bear inside a cave and she runs away it's a really short animation and really simple so we'll be learning these following concepts in scratch the understanding broadcasting messages goes in animations you need a lot of broadcast messages if you're gonna make it really long text to speech so you can say stuff changing background and loops so I will be demoing this game for you I'm not so she says I'm lost she's going walking she's trying to find her home again but then she goes into a mountain oh no it's a bear I'm like a man so he says oh no it's a bear and it runs mine ah run away it's yelling ah run away and then she escapes so before we start our game please like share and subscribe to our Channel and please support us that means a lot to us so anyways let's start so we have the cat let's delete the cat sprite then let's get the Giga the Giga let's get this price before we do the background the Giga walking's right then let's take the bear the bear walking not there bear walking and then let's let's change the backdrops so we need two backdrops let's delete it let's delete this one first we got to select one before we do any one so we have to take the heart the winter the winter one and we also need another backdrop which is the mountain this one so we have two backdrops so first we start on the backdrops we need but it Flags like we always have to start out then it flag clicked only if you're using cloning in all its type of stuff so which cost you I mean backdrop to mountain no not mountain a winter because that's where she walks in then let's start on the Giga spray so if flag click you need to show let's make her go to ram here go to around here yep around here this is pretty good point in direction 90 cuz it has to point this way and we gotta make her turn back so we gotta make her not to turn around so we need to put this you know click on that look at that thing right here right that thing right there this thing and then scare you then set you need texttospeech so you normally go and hear and get to the Texas speech then you gotta set voice to you can use also if you want but I I'll use squeak and speak I'm sorry caps lock is on and speak I'm so so say I'm lost and then you can also make her sing it as well that's optional but I'm gonna do it so let's say I'm then then do it repeat until love you until touching the edge so they'll touch the edge and then they'll broadcast a message to change the backdrop for touching an edge then move five steps he's got to make it a smooth and steady things so you got to do next costume so it looks like he's walking because the costumes will take a to walk three times and then it's what it looks like it's walking then it waits a little bit or also the feet will go away too quickly just make it wait not one second 0.1 second or else the feet will go too slow and make her go hide because we want to make her touch the edge and then she hides because she went to the mountain and broadcast and broadcast we gotta make a new message broadcast switch back so this is a battery so when I receive switch back drop switch back drop to the mountain listen this is where he meets the the what's that called again Oh bear so switch back drop this where he meets the bear so and then the bear spray the bear sprite yeah so when clicked when you clicked I'm gonna zoom in a little bit go to about right here go to around there and hide because in the beginning it has to hide so let's play this script so then I don't I actually now let's not play that script it lets to do when you switch back draw you can use the same broadcast message because it's basically doing it's a one message can handle few things so again let's do set size to 50% because it looks like it's coming out and it's growing bigger and bigger so let's set size to 50% let's first do this and then change it this way ninety degrees and then Glide okay glide around here let's make a guide around here glide around here like one second 267 negative 29 so change size by 20% so it's growing bigger 20 so it's gonna grow bigger and bigger like now I didn't play the animation yet so it's not growing bigger that's a second so glide one second let's say up to let's actually go more up because it's pretty small so let's glide like up to here maybe a little bit back around here yep around here 41 negative 73 this is close enough and then we got a do change size by 20 so it grows bigger okay and then if we need to do broadcast BAM attack that's when the bear attacks Giga well not really because she didn't scratch her anything but chases her bear attack so and also we need another one when I receive switchback drop repeat 15 times next costume so it's like moving up next costume 0.1 wait zoom let's good enough and let's go down here back to kick up so when I receive bear attack let's peek oh no it's a better and also say because yeah you can also say it if you want it's optional and then point in Direction negative 90 and remember you have to point in direction negative 90 remember what I said earlier negative money who goes this way as you can see this is you have always had to clip this or also flip over so that's why you got to always click this and then we need repeat until it's touching the edge sensing because it has a sense that it's touching the edge and move five steps move five steps next costume mmhmm now wait 0.1 seconds and then broadcast we need another message broadcast backdrop change broadcast backdrop change to okay so remember she's running backwards Giga is running backwards so she was running backwards cuz point Direction negative 90 so you also had to do it for her as well yeah that's it don't see if it spins over oh that's great so you also gotta do it for the kid goes well you know wait you got it with a backdrop in the backdrop again because we made a new doctor up change too and then switch back to the winter switch backdrop to the winter again because she flipped backwards basically she went the other way instead of the right side her face was pointing to the left side and then she runs back to the winter the winter that drop so let's go back to back to giggle so when I received back drop change to because remember a message can handle more than one one one thing so go to around here because she's like running back so go to here let's make it a little bit closer she isn't in soil go to here and then repeat repeat until her appeal until European Hill touching and touching move seven steps next costume wait 0.1 second so now she's running quicker because she found a banner and then hide I forgot to make her show so we need to make it backtoback SOT change because I switch back drop cuz that's the first one so go so guys I came back at just checked out my animation guys I just forgotten some simple moves to put a show here cuz the bear was hiding so remember go back to the switchback drop thing and put a show and right here the switchback drop I forgot this as well sorry guys um the switchback drop right here and go to X negative 169 it can be anywhere but I decided to go here and show it's working free frequently again so I'm so let's um start on where we were again I think we were on giggle right here yeah yeah yeah we're a so that trap changed to speak ah I like she's screaming and then speak run away and then you can also do say so broadcast we lost him we lost what up yeah redcap make a new message called we lost him we're not going straight there yet we've lost him so we got to do so yep we finished up this code right here this codes right here yeah we already finished this up and then now the bear when I receive after up change to go to X let's say 167 it's near right there and negative 105 give me anywhere but I decided to choose these exact things and then repeat until touching the edge move seven steps because you have to move the babe as well and then next costume wait actually we have to scrap this um backdrop change to go to X let's say 200 4184 like these hide wait 2 seconds show because that you have to show repeat 50 times move five steps slightly slower than giga next costume now wait 0.1 second and when I receive if we lost him because we already made that I receive when you lost him set voice to giant set voice to giant so just dude is giant then speak raw raw then looks we gotta make him say raw so that is all the code for today and thank you for watching and have a good day
