so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding playground today we'll be working on a coin matching game so the objective of the game is to match the amount of coins it takes to match the target number so 85 right here you're supposed to like select the amount of each coin you use to match the target number if um you have to do it in the least amount of steps but if if you do it in the in the least amount of steps then you get um a point but if you don't then it'll say sorry um that's correct but that is not the least amount of steps and right here it says match the value below with the least amount of coins so you have to use the least amount of coins so in this tutorial i'll be learning these font concepts variables broadcasting messages the custom block operators and pick random so before we begin our tutorial um 86 of you guys are not subscribed and only 12 percent of you guys are subscribed so please subscribe to make these numbers higher because only 12 percent of you guys are subscribed and 86 or not so without further ado let's get on to the video so i'm going to demo the game so let's try that so in the beginning i'll just say the instructions click the space bar to begin and then um 17 right here so you use one ten cent one five cent and two one cents so when you check it you'll say that is correct let's say you don't do it in the least amount of steps and you click the new to get a new number okay so new 72 let's say don't do it in the least amount of steps let's do this see this that is correct but that is not the least amount of coins so that is not the least amount of coins so that means you have to do this three of these and two of these oh sorry sorry um two of these and then you have to use um two of these and the two of these so let's say you get it correct so let's get a new number 29 let's say you just do this if you say that isn't correct try again so yeah that's pretty much the game and you have to match the target number so yeah let's start a new project all right so i started a new project so first let's rename our new project to coin matching coin matching game so i'm gonna delete the scratch cat because i don't need it and i'm gonna drag in some other stuff so let's go to the backdrop okay so now let's go to our backdrop um right here so i'm gonna go to my backpack i will not be needing this but first we'll get the instructions page let me delete this one and then we'll be needing this backdrop this is like the um match the value this backdrop with all the scents and stuff like that so that's the backdrop i'll be having and then for the sprites i'm going to upload the check sprite the new sprite um these sprites i will need to upload multiple of these but i'll rename them so it'll be easier for for you guys to uh read it so i need four uh four sets of them so down since this is a one cent i'm gonna like um put this as down i'm gonna name this down one and up one and then this can be named down five because it's five cents and then we have up five and then we have down 10 up 10 and down 25 up 25. so as you can see all of them are stacked on top of each other so what i'm going to do here is going to hide all of these um except for one set of them so then i can um put them where i want it to be just hide all of this so i have 25 one so i'm gonna put that right here down here let's put it also like right here like that move this in a little bit more like that okay so i'm gonna high i'm gonna show this one and show this one so the ten cent ones you know like right here and then put this one about like right here like that okay and then we're gonna show the five and the other five right here and right here and then finally the one cent ones put that right here and put the other one right here all right so now we have all of the arrows um it might not be very good so yeah now we have all the arrows um okay so i um put these two together so now you know that this is one cent five cent tencent and 25 cents group them together so we will be putting these in our google drive so you can download them from the google drive and so this is how i drew the backdrop by the way so i just drew a circle and one cent but if you want to put the actual send sign you have to do this so on windows it's like alt 0 1 6 2 and you get a sent sign so if you're in windows just do alt 0162 you get the send sign but if you're not on windows you can just write send something like that and then i just wrote match the value below with the least amount of coins so i'll put the variable the target number right here and then i'll put the amount of one cents amount of five cents an amount of 10 cents and the amount of 25 cents used in these boxes and these are just like blue rectangles i just drew so and then this i just drew a green backdrop wrote the instructions and press the spacebar to begin so that's what i did all right and let me delete this because i'm not going to be using that okay oops okay so now let's continue um i also got a retro robot from the scratch library you can just get it from here retro robot this thing and i just changed the costume this one and i just made it like 50 size because it's too big actually no it's maybe 75 okay so now it's a little bit better so i'm going to make it turn to the left do that select the don't rotate and then negative 90. so now it's going to rotate to the left all right now let's work on the backdrop code so the backdrop code i just made a music so let's get a one green flag clicked set the volume to 50 so it isn't too loud uh let 15 zoom in a little bit okay so i get it forever loop and i just pick the xylophone music um you guys pick any sound you want i just got one from the sprite library i mean sound library um cylo xylo one i took this one this one go to sounds and get a play sound until done and put in the focal loop okay so now we're gonna go to the retro robot okay for the retro robot i'm gonna start with the um making a bunch of variables so we're gonna make um selected one one selected one so there's like the amount of selected for the one cent variable one cent um and then we're gonna make selected five five and then i made selected all the way up to 25 so select selected ten i'm not going to put a space and then selected 25. select the 25 and hide these variables for now we'll show them later and then we also made a um a bunch more so this is calculated we'll need these in the future to find the fastest way to um uh do this fastest way to get the coins and we need calculated five calculated five and then we're going to do calculated 10 all the way up to 25. and then calculated 25 and then we're also going to make another variable called target so that's the target number you want to get and then we'll make one more called remainder that's to find the remainder target and remainder remainder so those are all my variables pretty sure okay let's work on the retro robot first so let's get our one green flag clicked let's zoom in a little bit let's go hide i'm gonna hide him in the beginning and then because you know why because we have this backdrop and i don't want to show right there so we want to hide the robot in the beginning so hide and then we want to hide the variable selected one so these are the amount of select um the amount each one is selected so i'm going to hide all of them hide selected 5 high selected 10 and 25. 10 and 25. so i'm also going to hide the variable target we'll need that later target uh right here so next we're going to get one green flag clicked again and we're gonna switch the backdrop to backdrop one oops backdrop to backdrop one which is uh i mean two i'm pretty sure backdrop two is my um this one i'm gonna name it to backdrop one and this one to backdrop two so i won't get that confused so backdrop one is my um uh the instructions page so i'm gonna go to batch one and then i'm gonna go to control wait until key space is being pressed so i'm gonna wait until the spacebar is being pressed and then when the spacebar is pressed then we're gonna switch backdrop to backdrop two which is the other backdrop and then we're going to go to events when backdrop switches to backdrop 2 then we want to show the robot show the robot and um let's show all of these variables right here show calcul uh selected oh yeah these should be uh selected not calculated sorry about that selected five selected 10 and selected 25 not calculated you should be all selected so we're gonna show the selected variables right here so show selected one selected five and selected ten and twenty five ten and twenty five all right so now we have all of the variables set let's go on to the um new let's go to the newsprint and before i uh continue into the new sprite i want to show you how to position all of them so i'm going to show all of the selected variables and the target so what you want to do is double click and it'll become like this and you just put it right here so that's not going to be a target one selected one i'm just gonna put it right here right here so double click so then it'll become smaller and if you double click again it'll become a slider like this but we will not need that so we're just going to use this one put that in here and this one so that's how it would look if you're wondering how and now let's get on to the new sprite so in the new we're going to get a one flag clicked we want to hide it in the beginning hide we want to hide it and then when the backdrop switches the backdrop too which is the um other one the the spectrum then we want to show and then when green flag is being clicked we're gonna get set the target to pick random one to one hundred so the target number will be a random number from one to one hundred so we're gonna make it one two one hundred and we're gonna set the selected to one zero sorry set selected to zero we're gonna set all the selected to zero sorry so then um in the beginning no coins should be selected select five should be zero and then selected 10 and 25 should also be zero okay and then when this sprite is being clicked the new button is being clicked when sprite is clicked and we want to set the selected all of them to zero because you're making a new a new number and then we're gonna also set the target i'm gonna duplicate this and put that down here so what the new thing is when you click it i'll give you a new number so when the spread is clicked it'll set everything back to zero and set the target to pick random 100 so that's from the new sprite and finally let's do the check spray so for the check sprite we're gonna get uh when fly clicked we want to hide hide and after hiding when the backdrop switches the backdrop to which is the coin backdrop this one then we want to show then when this sprite is clicked then we want to broadcast the message called check answer which we'll reuse later check check answer all right i think we're gonna stop here so that's what we did today the check new and the setup so um we'll continue on the next part uh tomorrow so don't forget to like share and subscribe and ring the notification
