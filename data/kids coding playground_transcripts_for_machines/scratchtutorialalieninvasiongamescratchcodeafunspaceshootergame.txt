welcome back to kids coding playground today we'll be doing a alien invasion game on scratch so the point of the game is you use like spin the turret around you move it left and right and you try to shoot the ufo up here so we're gonna play the game so let's start the game i'm gonna turn on the volume a little bit too loud um so you can move the turn only to the left and right as you can see and then you can use the spacebar to fire at the alien ship as you can see there's a timer up here so once the time reaches zero and you don't defeat the ship then that means you will lose and if you can defeat the ship within the time and then you will win so i'll show you guys what will happen if you lose so when you lose it will just say you will lose and then play some losing music um and each bullet does 5 damage so if you shoot it 20 times you should be able to take it out as you can see it says you lose and that should be game over and then i'll try to win this time okay so it's a little bit hard to hit the ship so that's what happens when you win it'll have a little explosion effect right there so as you can see it's quite hard to beat the game but it is possible to win okay now let's start a new project and get coding so we're going to start a new project i'm going to start off by renaming our project to alien invasion so alien invasion we're going to delete scratch cat i have everything in my backpack so we have the turret we have the bullets we have the alien ufo with the wind and loose so right here the alien ufo i mean the turrets so this is how we drew so uh first we have a circle so right here we have red on the outside and white on the inside then right here we have the glass so this is the glass like the thing on the turrets and then right here we have the cannon the gun and what we did was let me ungroup it here i'll show you so what we did was we got like some dark gray and then we stacked it on top to make it look more like a turret so as you can see if you put it all together correctly um it should look pretty good like that it should look like this so that's what we have for the turret and if you want to download it you can go into our shared project and you can download it from there and um our turret you can draw if you want um just draw a circle uh kind of like a glass and then draw tur like the gun right here we have the bullet so right here as you can see the bullet is not centered so the center is like right here but we move the bullet a little bit to the right it's because we wanted to make it kind of look like a shooting out of the barrel and not like the turret itself so like we want to move the bullet like a little bit forward so it's like up here and what we did is just draw a oval and just put different colors so it's pretty simple to make the bullet and for the ufo we drew this one as well so basically it's so we have two green things for the antenna with the yellow lines and then we right here we reshaped a circle into like a semicircle and then right here we have another uh longer semicircle and for the base of like the spaceship and then we have the three i don't know if this is i guess they're wheels or something like that so we just put three of these and then right here we have the explosion what we did for the explosion is we drew a bunch of like stars red orange yellow all these stars and put them just layer them on top of the ufo so it's pretty simple to draw the ufo so yeah that's pretty much an overview of all the different sprites now let's get on to the code okay so first we're going to start with the backdrop so for the backdrop um what we did was we had the um we had the stars backdrop and i'm gonna go ahead and get it for my backpack okay so i just quickly got all the uh backdrops so here we have our stars backdrop we're gonna rename it to the backdrop so this is like the backdrop we use so we use this backdrop for the game so it's just gonna be the backdrop and then right here we have the start and we have the ready so we're going to delete this one so we have the ready and then start so basically it goes like ready and then starts and then as soon as that happens you switch to this one and the game starts so right here we have the ready so like um in our last video i showed you guys how to make your text kind of look like this so if you want to learn how to do that you can go ahead and watch that video but if you don't want to do it then you can just write the text like start ready so yeah we just made our game look a little bit better by doing this and then so we're going to get into the code so right inside the backdrop we're going to get a one green flag clicked i'm going to zoom in a little and then we're going to have to make a variable we're going to name it timer so timer so we have the timer and then i'll just move to the other side because the ufo hp will be on the left side and then we're going to give them 30 seconds so the timer set the timer to 30 and then we're going to switch the backdrop to ready in the beginning which is the first one as you can see ready start that one so ready and then we're going to wait uh 0.5 seconds so it's going to wait a little bit before switching to the other one we're going to switch into the start backdrop and then we're gonna um play sound so we're gonna i have a pretty sure there's like a symbol sound or something but that's what i have for their single fashion yeah this one so i'm gonna be using this one um so we're going to use play sound crash symbol until done and then we're going to switch the backdrop to the backdrop like the uh game backdrop and then we're going to broadcast a message called start so this message starts is going to start everything else like all the other sprites we're going to broadcast it from the background start so start and then when i receive start here so this is going to be like the timer this is how you code time so when we receive start here so when i receive start we're going to repeat until timer is equal to zero so when the timer reaches zero then they're going to lose so we're gonna do timer so repeat till timer is equal to zero we're going to wait one second so it's gotta wait one second and then minus one because it goes down every one second so we're gonna change the variable timer by negative one every second and then we're gonna broadcast a message called lose so you'll lose if you run out of time so you have to lose and then right here let's get into the turrets so we're going to start coding in the turret um so for the turret we're going to get a one through flight plate let's zoom in again we're like flight we're going to go to so this is the position i had to go to zero negative 175 so about right here and we're going to point direction of 90. so basically for our turrets um we made it side uh up like up facing up and our bullet facing the side because we want our uh our turret to only rotate from zero to 180 degrees so we're gonna make it a point direction of 90 and then we're going to do a one receive start so this is going to be the movement of this art so movement we're going to go to start and then forever um if right arrow is pressed key right is pressed then we're going to rotate 4 degrees to the right and then we're going to duplicate this and delete just trash this and then if we're doing the left side then we're going to rotate 4 degrees to the left and then right here we're going to point direction of the absolute value of the turret so as you can see earlier the turret cannot flip upside down so we just want it to go left to right so that's why we're using the absolute value of the turrets um so there's no negative numbers so it should be only able to move from zero to 180 so this half of the circle so here we have the zero about zero right here to 180 so it should be only able to move the through these two quadrants okay so set it back to 90. okay so next after we get the movement done we are going to have to make it so the turret cannot flip upside down and go the negative direction so we're going to only make the turret go left to right like that so um as you can see uh so i'm going to uh play it so then it's at 90 so what we want to do is just make the turret from 0 to 180 so um and then we're going to take the absolute value of that so then it can't go negative so absolute value is basically just the distance from a number to zero so let's say you have negative five the absolute value is five just get rid of the negative sign same with five absolute value five is five so it's just the distance from zero and basically we just want it to go left and right so we're going to have to take the absolute value of the direction so we're gonna make it point in the direction point direction absolute value of the direction so we're gonna go motion and then direction so like that so we'll save it let's play it as you can see the turret is not able to flip upside down and it's just stuck so if i try to like press it doesn't work i can't go past this i can't go past two and i can't go past 178 so as you can see it is working and now let's go into the bullets so onto the bullet um we have some code for this one as well so we're going to go whenever if i clicked we're going to hide the bullet in the beginning and then we're going to when i receive so when i receive start so when we start the game we're gonna forever loop we're gonna forever if so we're gonna do it spacebar to shoot the bullets we're gonna do if key space is pressed then we're going to go to the turret and make it go to the turn and we're going to point direction at the direction of the turret minus 90. so the reason for that is because the bullet is pointed towards the side and the turret is pointed up so if we were to minus 90 so we're gonna so if we're to minus 90 it would be right side up so since the turn is already facing 90 and minus 90 it'll be facing zero which will be facing up which is the way the turn is facing so we're going to go to turret and then we're gonna point in direction and then uh we're going to get minus and we're gonna minus 90 and then we're gonna direction of the turret so we're gonna get this thing and then we're gonna select the turret and then direction so there we have it and then we're gonna next we're gonna show and then after that we're gonna start sound so i have a sound it's called laser so i went online and got it there so what i did was use the sound thing recorded it from the video and got this out so you can get that from online they have some laser sounds in the scratch library but i don't think it's as good as this one and then next we have the repeat sign we get the repeat loop so we're going to repeat nine times so it's going to move 40 steps so this is going to make the bullet move and we can move 40 steps and then next if the is touching the ufo so if it's touching the ufo we're gonna have to put that inside the repeat so if touching ufo the bullet is touching the ufo we are going to wait 0.01 seconds so it's going to stay there for a fraction of a second to make sure that's actually hitting the ufo and then it's going to hide okay so like that and then we're going to hide put a hide down here so let's say else the let's say the bullet hits the side it will also hide so that's why you have to hide right there so now we can play it so you can see you can shoot the bullet yeah so when you shoot the spaceship of course it doesn't do any damage or anything it just stops yeah that's basically what we have we have the shooting and the movement done next let's hop into the ufo okay let me zoom out so i can show you guys all the code okay now let's go into the ufo so inside the ufo we are going to make a new variable we can name it ufo so this is the ufo hp this is the hp for the ufo i move to the corner and then i'm gonna reflect lights clicked we are going to go to this position uh i i'd say 50 80 that's what i had last time so uh 50 80 and then we're going to switch the costume to ufo the first one not the explosion one so we're gonna switch to the first one and then we're gonna make it have 100 health so like in my other game i put it as a hundred so i'm using 100 and then when i receive the message start so let's start the game we are going to forever loop and then we're going to go glide it we're going to glide 0.5 seconds and then we're going to make it pick random so we're going to it's going to glide to random places make the plot pick random negative 230 to 230 and then for this one for the y we're going to duplicate that and i'm just going to make it go to 20 to 170. okay so now we have the gliding and then right here we're gonna do if the ufo has less than or equal to one hp then we're gonna stop the script so if the ufo has less than or equal to so less than oops let's put that in here less than or equal to zero so basically if it's lost all its hp then we are going to stop the script stop the script and then down here after this we're going to um do the shooting so if you get if the ufo gets shot it will initiate some other code so we don't want it to be interfering with this one so we're going to make a two different scripts so two different scripts we're gonna get the one receive start scroll down uh i'm gonna get a forever loop i could actually put this on this side actually so you guys can see both so forever and then we're going to do if then statement so if so if this thing is touching the bullet the spaceship is touching the bullet then we will um start sound screech i have the sound right here and then we're going to change the ufo hp by negative five so each bullet should do negative five five damage so we're gonna do by negative five and then after that we're going to repeat eight times and change the color effect so we're gonna make a change color effect just so you can see that it's taking damage i'm gonna repeat it eight times and then we're gonna do change color effect by 25 change color effect by 25 and then next we're going to clear all graphic effects after it's done put that under the repeat sign the repeat loop and after that we're going to do if so under the graphic effects we're going to do if it's if the ufo has less than or equal okay duplicate this and then so if it has less than or equal to zero hp then we will switch costumes to the ufo explosion and then we're gonna broadcast a message i'm gonna call it win so you win the game after you defeat the ufo oops broadcasting message and then we're going to stop the script once you win so we're going to stop the script okay so now we win we're going to make the win and loose um sprites work now so we're going to go into our wind sprite so inside our wind sprite i'm going to first get a lingering flag plate and green if i clicked we're going to go to zero zero that's the origin and then i'm gonna get a hide so it's gonna hide in the beginning and then when i receive win so when you win go to the front layer go to the front layer and then we're going to show and then we're going to play the sound explosion so i have the sound right here um and then next we're going to stop all so that's the winning and then right here we have the lose so inside the losing sprite we're going to get a one group like we can just copy this code right here and we can also copy this code right here but we have to change some of the stuff obviously so right here we're gonna have to do we wanna receive loose good front layer show and then instead we're gonna get another sound effect so we have the sound effect loose right here put that in so here we have all of our stuff and lose is from the scratch sound library so you can just find it here so here we have our game complete let's play it so save our game it takes damage timer is going down you can move you can't move your turrets like that you can't move it don't try beating it i don't think i'll win this time okay so i lost so you lose um it's still moving because i did a plane until done please until done because if you don't use it until done it will just stop the game so you can use a shorter sound if you would like and then i'm just going to like give the ufo like 5 hp so i can just show you guys how it is if you win let's see if it works let's see if you win the explosion and it works so yeah that's pretty much it for this tutorial i hope you guys enjoyed watching this tutorial on how to make a alien
