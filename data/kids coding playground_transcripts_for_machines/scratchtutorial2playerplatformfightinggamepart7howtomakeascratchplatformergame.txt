so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding Clara today we'll be doing the seventh part for the two fighter fighting game so we will be working on the force field today and the other platform and the magic gem so today we just got a new monitor but our wireless keyboard is not working so this is a new monitor or get getting used to it so let's make three variables to start with one call it the force field go to go to I think I suppose feels wrong feel okay force field go to we can just uncheck it get force field status take that out and the timer timer so now we have three variables let's get on to the code so for player one for the jump control we're gonna have to get to the color of the platform so let's switch the platform to the costume two real quick so I can actually get the color so for this one you're gonna get or so we can so if it's touching either this cream color or the dark blue color just duplicate this and I will just select it get the middle middle section that part that's the color so color 52 saturation 51 and 34 brightness so I'm gonna put this in here so that now the ground will actually stop the person so this makes it allowed to jump I said it wrong sorry so this allows it to jump when it's touching this color and now we're gonna actually add some more for the jumping if it's touching either of those colors let's get another or so let's put this just right here put the or put that right here and so if it's this is duplicate this duplicate this and if it's touching either the first layer of the blue so that color or which is 52 color 50 saturation 41 brightness or the center color like that one which is 34 brightness 51 saturation 52 color then it will run all this so we will need to add this this is for the jumping so now for the next one we're gonna do some more for that so for the simulated gravity this one's going to stop the player so we gotta get an or I'm gonna do it out here so I can duplicate it later so if it's touching either at this color or the middle color this color then you do this put that back in there and we can add this just duplicate it you can or so if it's touching either the brown color we have to add the dark brown color this one is blue so actually you have to change this one to the brown color it's dark brown color so we put that right there and now we just duplicate this and put it instead of this just put this right here duplicate it again take this out you can delete these put this in here and then we duplicate this take out this and put this in so next we're going to work on the Jenna we're gonna add some more code for the gym today so we're gonna get a one flat clicked we're gonna set our variable we're gonna set our variable force field go to so this is a set which character goes to but in the beginning we wanted to set it's a blank because no character is chosen yet so we want to go to front layer go to 85 X 130 why it could be anything but I'm just gonna do this so it'll be somewhere like up here 85 X 130 Y and high and then we're gonna get a nother so when it's start game so just right here instead of one flat clicks we're gonna get a one start game start game we don't need the score variable we remember we had to we did the simple platformer that's why we still have the score variable so and when we start game we want to show show the magic gym for add or change the color effects take this out so if no more treasure hunter so so if it's touching either this we're gonna just change it so if it's touching either player one use player one or player two and in here then we can move this all out I'm gonna ifelse statement so if this is touching if this is touching the player 1 if it's stretching Claire 1 then you can set the force field go to 2 player 1 so the force field will go to player 1 force fields go to 2 player 1 player 1 duplicate this else it will force field go to 2 player 2 if it is and you have to match the name of the sprite or what work so player 2 so if yours isn't name something else then you can make if that name so now we can just pretty much at this down here place our fairy dust then you put the hide and we will save for the rent random position for later so just keep that right there so we can broadcast a message broadcast a message called force field activating force field activated so when I receive force field activated we'll need that later actually we will do that later so next we're gonna work on the force field so I had it in my backpack so I pretty much just drew a oval oval shaped thing with a blue color so you could just put like an outline for with like a blue color inside just a light blue color so I can just show you that's how it looks like so I made the outline 10 and the fill this color and outline this color so outline is gonna be 58 color 67 100 brightness the fills can be 58 color 15 saturation and hundred brightness of course you make it any color you want but we just made it this color so when flak lights set the force field status force field status to off because in the beginning the force field will be off so in the beginning we can hide this and then when I receive start game hide in the beginning start game you hide hide right here so next you want to get the when I receive force field is activated force field activated then get an ifthen statement so if if not force field and status is equal to on so if not force field status is equal to on so if it's not on then set the force field timer to 10 so we may enforce real timer variables so this is just to make the how long the force field lasts for so we're gonna make it last for 10 seconds so then you can broadcast a message under it call start timer start timer start timer so next we want to grab a show we wanted to go to the front layer in front of the character so next we want to set the ghost effect to 50% to make it a little bit more visit visible so it looks a bit better it's like the ghost effect and get a forever loop forever just put it under here forever if the forcefield timer is greater than zero so anywhere greater than zero forcefield timer is greater than zero so you set the forcefield go to to the player so as you can see when you go to the magic gem we set the forcefield go to the player 1 and player 2 so that means I'll go to either player 1 or player 2 so next you want to get a start timer so when I receive the start time nerve message when I receive a start timer start timer right then when I receive start timer then you set the forcefield status on because there's forcefield in progress force field status to on and next we can get repeat the forcefield timer so it will repeat 10 times repeat forcefield timer times and then we can get a 1 wait one second change the forcefield timer by negative one so it'll count 10 seconds the forcefield timer by negative 1 and next we can set the forcefield status to off after it's over fortunate status it's off and next we can set the forcefield go to to blank forcefield go to because no one has the force field anymore so next let's hide hide the force field once it's over and we can stop other scripts in the stripe stop other scripts in the sprite and we can broadcast a message about display Jim again so the Jim will receive this and will come back so just play them again just like Jim again so go back to the gem so when I receive display gem again then we can get an ifthen statement if the force field status is equal to off if the force field status is equal to off then we can wait pick random three to five seconds just give it a little pause between three to five seconds and then we can ran a position next we want to get when I receive Start screen start screaming then we can hide make sure you did this when I receive Start screen in the force field because I forgot to add it so make sure to add it here so finally we have one last step we have to do so go to player one so where the player gets attacked so when p1 gets hit when you find it I think it might be on this side let me just find it right here fine fine so now you want to get a knot so this is to detect so you get it and so this is the force field for the force field so I won't take any damage not not equal to force field go to is equal to player one force field go to is equal to player one so basically when the player doesn't have the force field it will do this and we can just duplicate this or the other sprite instead of if to change it to player two just drag and drop it in here so P 2 cup got hit right here let's get them and put that right here track this right here instead of player one we do player two and we forgot the knot so let's put this right here put that in here so let me play it so so let's I'll show you guys the other map I think we forgot to add the colors for this one too so we can just add them real quick just add it real quick and that's it for their we're right here you have to do so let's finish it up real quick get the or put this in touching color live to do the this color and then just copy just an another or duplicate this get the brown color the dark brown color put that in here take this out duplicate it get it or I just duplicate the top one I'm sure it is the color gun take the or you can duplicate this whole chunk take out this throw it away and then the bottom here duplicate the color this thing and take that thing out we could delete that okay you just take this out so I can delete it okay so now let's play it and one last thing for the jumping you have to add this can or let's get two of these put them right here and for this one you got to get the balloon color and for this one get like the top color so now you have the two colors I think that's it so now now I'm also going to test the player one forcefield if it works pretty sure it'll work that's pretty much it so thank you guys for watching please like share and subscribe
