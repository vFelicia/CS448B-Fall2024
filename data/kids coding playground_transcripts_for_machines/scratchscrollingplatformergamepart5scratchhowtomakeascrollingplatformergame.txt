so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding playground today we'll be doing the fifth part for the scrolling platformer so today we'll be adding the traps in danger and uh we might possibly get onto wall jumping so before i begin i would like to scroll through the code just in case you guys missed anything so this is what we had from the last video so yeah um and then we have the platforms and yeah so let's get on to the code so first for the player let's add a new custom block maybe called trap guy click ok trap die um so if this is just a activate if the player touches a trap then he'll die so if touching so i have my traps already right here my danger so what you want to do basically is to duplicate your platforms and then you uh put whatever danger like a lava or something so i in this case i can like duplicate these spikes so what you want to do is go to vector duplicate whatever you want go into your platforms to the one i just duplicated and then you can uh drag it to where you want it and then delete every delete all the land so now you don't have the danger keep that only the danger and for the ones that for the levels that don't have any danger you delete everything on the whole level for the levels that don't have any danger you delete everything otherwise you will get like lava or something you duplicate your platforms put it wherever you want the lava and then you can um delete everything around it so i'm going to demonstrate one more time so like that ctrl c i'm gonna go to here duplicate it so it's already scaled for me i just put it right there and i delete everything else just keeping the spikes so now you guys know how to do the oops i actually did this in the platforms sorry you're supposed to do this in the um you're actually supposed to do this in the platforms too like i said right here so do you want to duplicate it oops so let me get that again so duplicate it into here then delete everything around it there you go so now you guys know how to do that let's move on so for the danger uh we'll need pretty much same code for the platforms so for the player i mean for the danger remember to delete your delete every everything for the levels that don't have any danger and to just get all the code just drag and drop your code into the danger sprite like that we'll have to add a little bit more code so now that i have all the code in let me just drag this last bit of code okay there you go so let me separate it okay so uh the amount of corresponding times you um do make clones for the platform you have to do it for the dangers as well so let's continue for the defining this trap die custom block if touching danger then we want to set the exit to dead to let the um this custom block know that the player is dead right here so if exit is equal to dead then activate the player die set the exit to dead and then next you want to add the trap die custom block you want to activate it right here so now when you play it we oh yeah i forgot we have to add some more code for the platform like i said we have to um so so now um let's play it so the spikes are showing right now we have not done the wall jumping yet so now when you touch the spikes you can actually die and i added an extra bit of level right here so you can just duplicate that right there and duplicate another one so i have an extra bit of level right here i added that so i figured out my bug i added something different so i forgot to do make another clone for this for the danger so it wouldn't show up to spikes so make sure to make the same amount of clones as your platforms so now you can get killed by the spikes and you can also die from falling okay so um i will scroll around one more time just to show you guys the code so just stop this and platforms danger so remember to you should duplicate this platform and then add the danger you have to make it the same corresponding size or sometimes it will not show like what happened to me so now maybe we can work on the uh wall jumping now so let's get take this out get an if else statement get two actually you need to put it under this one and get another if else statement put it right here and now you want to get if the actually i can just duplicate this if the up arrow or the key w is pressed then also if the s x is great is greater than zero then we can set the speed x to speed x negative 16. else we set it to 16. so what this does is um if uh walk jumping so if the player is on the left then it will um push it to the right by 16 so it'll make it another extra jump so you can wall jump and same for the right if it's a wall on the right side and you jump it will push it to the left so you can make that one extra jump to make the wall shut and we want to set the in air right here set the in air to zero and then next finally you want to go here set the speed x to zero add the repeat until loop under here right here now you have all the wall jumping mechanics and now you can die from spikes so so now you can as you can see you can wall jump on the boxes perfectly fine you can die from the spikes you can die from fall damage um and i will also and that now you can get past this part and i also added an extra bit of level like i said so remember to just duplicate it for this one like that and do it for the same for the danger and right now there's no exit yet and i'm gonna like make a line just to show you how the wall jumping is working just to show you guys get red maybe make it like 10. actually black might be fine as well just do this hold down shift so as you can see now you can wall jump so yeah that pretty much concludes our video for today please like share and subscribe if you're new to our channel and i'll see you guys in part 6 of our scrolling platformer
