welcome back guys it's kids coding playground here and today we'll be making a halloween game uh for halloween so we're making a halloween shooting game um basically the point of the game is just to get as much score as you can so i'll just show a demonstration okay so use target you just basically shoot these things on a shelf like that and there's a timer in the top left that is the like how much longer you have and in the top right is the score you can see so as you can see when i when you're finished it'll say thanks for playing your score is 770. so our final score was 7.70 also one more thing um the pumpkins you get the least points these you get a little bit more than a pumpkin and this you get the most points and as you can see um the pumpkins won't uh regenerate until you take them all out so you see this one that i just shot it won't come out until you take them all out and then once you take them all out they'll all come back so you have to um so basically you have to shoot the whole line before you can have them all regenerate at once um and when you shoot one it'll just be gone until you shoot them all yeah okay so let's get coding onto the game so let's start a new project all right so inside our new project we just don't need the scratch rename our project we're going to name it hollow bean shooting game halloween shooting game so we're gonna get some sprites in my backpack with the targets and the pumpkin and we have the backdrop so let me show this and then the backdrop we have just like this so what i did was let me just duplicate this to show what i did so right here is the shelf we drew it so we have uh let me ungroup it so we have the we have the brown this is just like a ground square or rectangle and then we have a darker line and then a lighter colored line right here as as like the shelf and then right here we have the frame of the shelf and then for the background we just pick some green and brown color like that so yeah that's pretty much how you drill the backdrop or you can just export it from our project in the link in the description so that's our backdrop and our pumpkin we actually made this remember last year's halloween game the smash the pumpkins game so if you have not watched that um be sure to watch it we show how to draw it in that video and we also have like the other sprite so when you destroy it you'll break this is a broken pumpkin and the normal pumpkin okay so we're getting we'll be getting the other sprites for this project so we also have the skeleton and the ghost they're both inside the sprite library so the ghost and then we have the skeleton okay and then so you saw when i shot the skeleton it would like break into pieces so basically what you do is you duplicate the costume and you just like drag all the pieces apart so i'm going to go to the costumes for the skeleton we're going to delete these and you can duplicate the first one and with the first one basically you can just like i guess break it its body okay so move it however you want so i'm just gonna do it like that okay so now let's start get start on the code so we're going to go to the target inside the target we're going to get a one green flag clicks let's zoom in we're going to get a set game timer so we're going with a new variable called game timer so we're going to set the game timer to 20 in the beginning um so this is the not to get confused with the other timer we'll have later in the video game timer is like the timer for the game so we're going to set it as a 20. make another variable to score so this is just the score uh for the game so we're going to set the score to zero and we're going to make another variable called show score so show score is basically you know how at the end it says um thanks for playing your final score was and we're basically just kind of set the show score to the score so we're gonna just set the show score to zero in the beginning for now and then we're gonna broadcast a message called start game again start game and then we're going to make the target go to the middle in the beginning and we're going to set another variable so we're going to make another room called fire shot so basically it's to detect if the shot is being fired or not so we're going to set hard shot to be in zero in the beginning we're going to wait 0.2 seconds before actually starting the game so i'm gonna wait for that a little bit and then we're gonna get a forever loop forever we're gonna get the go to go to x we're gonna go to x i'll set x sorry set x to the mouse x and then we're also going to set the y and that's why so it will follow your mouse as you can see the target's following our mouse and then we're going to make it go to the front layer so it's in front of the sprites those uh monsters it's going to go to the front layer and then we're going to do an if mouse down so if if you're like pressing down so if mouse down then we are going to get a sound this toy zing sound whatever this is sounds like that that's the one we had and then we're gonna broadcast a message after this and name it shot fire shot fired and then we're gonna set the fired fire shot to one meaning that a shot is being fired and then we're going to wait 0.1 seconds and then we're going to set it back to zero so one means a fire a shot is being fired and zero means it's not being fired okay so here's the first part of the code and when you click you just played that sound that's all we have you can see the fire shot is changing when you click okay so next we are going to go to the pumpkin so let's go to our pumpkin um so inside the pumpkin we are going to make a new block so this is just a setup block to set up everything inside the setup so we're going to name it setup game and click ok and we're going to define this block and we're going to set pumpkin counter which is a new variable sorry a new variable called pumpkin counter so this is basically how many pumpkins are in each row let me hide all these variables around set a pumpkin counter to zero i mean four sorry there's four pumpkins in each in the middle row there's gonna be four we're gonna evenly space them out by 100 steps and then we're going to make the first pumpkin go to the exposition of negative 155 and the y position of zero and we're gonna hide it and we're gonna make clones of it so we're gonna do hide clear graphic effects uh set the size of the pumpkin to about half the size of 50 percent and then after that we are going to repeat four times because we're making four uh four pumpkins so we're gonna repeat four times uh we're going to set the create the clone of myself and then we're gonna move 100 steps so the pumpkins are evenly spaced between each other so move 100 steps okay um if your pumpkin is like smaller or bigger you might have to adjust the number of steps and the number of clones you create because it's not going to be the same as hours ours pumpkin is um about 100 steps apart so you can actually just like export their pumpkin if you want but you can draw your own if you'd like as well so now we're going to get a when i start as a clone which is what the clones is like the code for the clones in the beginning switch the costume to costume one which is the nonbroken pumpkin as you can see and then we're gonna set the color so we're just gonna make it like the pumpkins pick random color so we're gonna change i'm set i'm going to set the color effect pick right here one to 300 so it's like a random color let's make the pumpkins random color and we're going to make a show and after that we're going to get a forever loop forever um if it's touching the targets and the fire shot is equal to one that means the shot is being fired so we're gonna get an and so we're gonna do if touching target and fire shot is equal to one fire shot is equal to one fire shot's equal to one then we're gonna change the pumpkin counter by negative one because one you just shot a pumpkin so we're gonna decrease the amount of pumpkins so since pumpkins are the easiest to hit we're going to change the score by 10 which is the lowest score i guess we can make the other ones with more and then we're gonna switch the costume to costume two which is the broken pumpkin and we're gonna wait one second and then we're gonna wait one seconds and then delete this clue so when you shoot it it's gonna be broken wait one second and then we'll delete it so you can see that the pumpkin is broken so you can see the pumpkin got shot okay and then we're going to get a one green fly clicked uh we are going to use call the block setup game and then we are going to forever if the pumpkin pounder is less than one so that means you have like no more pumpkins if pumpkin counter is less than one so like i said earlier um the pumpkins don't respawn until you take them all out so we're gonna do if pumpkin counter is less than one now we are going to broadcast and wait we're gonna wait because we don't want let's say you take them all out we don't want them all to respawn at the same time so we're gonna wait and make broadcast another message called start pumpkin again again and then in start pump spun start pumpkin again we are going to when i receive start pumpkin again we're going to wait two seconds before we set up the game again so after two seconds it will restart and when i receive start pumpkin again we're going to delete all the clothes so make sure everything is deleted start bumping again delete this clone okay and now we're gonna have to do um another when i start as a clone so um so if the pumpkin is not hit within a certain time the pumpkin will be hidden and then reappeared later so this is the script we'll be working on next so when i start as a clone we're going to set the new variable so we're going to name it timer fill this spread only so select this for the sprite only and then so we're doing it for the sprite only because each one will have their own timer so like i said earlier don't get confused with this with the game timer so this is not the same thing at all so this is just to check um if the pumpkins not hit within a certain time it will reappear later so we're going to get select the timer and then we're going to set it to zero in the beginning and then forever if not so if it's not touching the target not touching target then we'll change the timer by 0.1 to 0.5 so it'll go up by a little bit every time it is not touching the target so i'm going to change the timer pick random 0.1 to 0.5 and if the timer is greater than 3 so if it's so if the timer is greater than three so this is just a number we're using so it's not technically three seconds because um some it doesn't like let's say you like touch the target so you have to like not touch the like the pumpkin before it's like go up so that's pretty much it so we're just gonna use three and we're gonna wait a point one second right here let's just add that real quick so you just have to not be touching it for it to constantly go up that's what it is and then we're going to get timer greater than three we're going to high hide uh wait two seconds and then we're gonna like set it back to zero set the timer back to zero and i'll make the pumpkins reappear again so set the timer to zero and then show it make them reappear again okay i think that is it for this part let's maybe try it out okay let me hide these sprites okay so now let's play it as you can see the pumpkins are spawning they disappear randomly you shoot one of them they get destroyed yeah our game is working so once all the pumpkins are gone they all respawn again as you can see you shoot them all they all gone they all respawn again so this is exactly how you want it it's working perfectly fine now this is so this is working so now i'm going to zoom out so you guys can see if you missed anything so might be a little bit smaller but i think you can see and right here okay so you can pause the video if you want to uh check your code and then basically the ghost and skeletons are basically almost the same concept so we can basically just so inside the ghost let's go to the ghost first so inside the ghost we are going to basically we can just drag in everything from the pumpkin just change some small things so we can drag the setup game it's the ghost but obviously instead of pumpkin counters we're using ghost time so we're going to make a new variable called ghost counter and instead of setting the pumpkin counter we're going to set the ghost counter so since coasts are a bit smaller than the pumpkin we're going to six ghosts and then we're going to make the position negative 165 and then we're going to make the black position 100. okay and that should be repeating six times because there's six clones and it should be 65 steps instead okay next we are going to get a one green flag clicks uh this is like setting up the game setup game forever oh yeah we can just drag this in so just like drag this in and we have this right instead of pumpkin counter we're gonna use the ghost counter and we're gonna have to broadcast another message instead of star pumpkin again we're gonna call it you guessed it start ghost again again start ghost again and then when i re uh when i start as a clone drag and drop this um into the it goes okay so we have instead costume one we're gonna switch to ghost a and then we're gonna set the color that's the same if it's touching the target and fired shot is equal to one meaning this is getting shot at then we're to change the ghost counter by negative one and since ghosts are a little bit harder to hit i guess not really but okay we're going to change the score by 30 and we're going to switch the costume to go c which is the one where the ghost is raising his hand so and then wait one second delete this clip that is all the same and then we are going to get a pumpkin go back to the pumpkin we're going to get this so right here remember the timer is for the sprite only so you click it it's only for the ghost as you can see so remember set it for your this spring only so this is all the same we can keep this all and then instead of greater than three we can do four because there's more ghosts than pumpkins so we're going to do that okay and then remember the start ghost again we can just receive the message when i receive start start uh closed again we are going to delete this clone and then we can just duplicate this and when i start we can just do wait two seconds and then we're gonna set up game to restart the clones okay now i'm gonna zoom out so i can show you guys the code it's basically the same thing as the um the pumpkin but you just have to change some of the variables so make sure you have all the variables correctly or this will not work now to the skeleton finally so in the skeleton we just drag and drop the code from the ghost i guess oh and before we go on i forgot to show you guys the ghost so now the ghost and pumpkins both work as you can see they all disappear shoot them shoot the ghosts if you see all the ghosts as you can see they're all gone they all respawn together at the same time you shoot all the pumpkins they all respawn okay so now it's working so in the skeleton it's basically the same concept so inside the skeleton we can just drag and drop this setup code game into the skeleton so right there but instead of all this of course no ghost counter i'm going to make another variable i'm going to make the variable scala skeleton counter skeleton counter instead of ghost camera we're going to be using the skeleton counter variable and then we're going to go to that negative 155 and negative 100 instead one shelf lower than the um well the lowest shelf is where the skeletons are actually and then we're going to hide this is all the same except we're going to repeat five times and go 75 steps right here because we're only making five clones of the skeletons these skeletons are a little bit bigger than the ghost so we're gonna make five clones repeat five times move 75 steps okay drag and drop this into here so instead we're here we're obviously going to do the skeleton counter skeleton timer and instead of this we're going to make another variable i'm going to call it start skeleton again start skeleton again and in here drag and drop this into the skeleton and right here we're in the beginning we'll switch the costume to skeleton a which is the nonbroken one and then this is all the same um we're gonna change the skeleton counter by negative one once it's getting shot and how about let's change the score by 20 for your skeletons and then uh and then we'll switch costume to skeleton b which is the skeleton a2 or whatever which is the one that's broken so yeah okay and finally we have to drag and drop this last piece of code into the skeleton timer is for this sprite again and then forever not this is all the same except let's make it greater than five for here since there's more skeletons as well um so yeah that's pretty much it for this what else could we add oh yeah i forgot we have to do the start skills and again so we have to when i receive start skeleton again we're going to delete this clone duplicate this and then wait two seconds and then before setting it up again okay yep so now we've got it now one more um let's go back to our target so inside the target we're going to code something else so right here we still have something to code like the game timer and all that so when i receive start game inside the target we're going to forever um actually yeah we're gonna have to put something in front of that and it's not a forever loop sorry we have to make the timer first actually so we're gonna go to game timer and 20 so 20 seconds i'll give them 20 seconds repeat 20 times times and we're gonna wait one second before changing the game timer by negative one so this is basically a timer for 20 seconds and next is duplicate this remove that just take the start game forever so we're going to detect if the timer is less than or equal to zero so if we're getting or so the game timer is less than or equal to zero less than or equal to zero so we're equal to zero so game timer less than zero we are going to broadcast start game i mean a new variable actually no this is going to be stop game you have to stop game is basically when you finish when there's no more time you're gonna stop the game so we're gonna have to do stop other scripts in the sprite and we're gonna get a stop this script okay and since it's all done let's go into the pumpkin we have the stop game so inside here stop game when i receive stop game then we will um stop other scripts in this sprite and just drag and drop this if it goes drag and drop it to the skeleton all right they all have it okay and then we're going to paint a sprite let's make uh i don't know whatever color red whatever and then we're going to say let's see what should we write oh yeah let me just copy what i got from before so thanks for playing thanks for playing your score is okay and then we're gonna put the game timer right there let's see all right so inside the code for this thing we're going to get the code for it drag this here one degree five clicks i'm going to go to zero zero and then hide the variable we can hide the variable uh show score in the beginning and then hide the sprite and then when i receive stop game then we will set the show score to the score and we're going to show the show scored variable and show this sprite okay so let me show the variables we need so we'll put the score in the top right we input the game timer in the top left uh and the show score in this thing double click on it and put it right here okay let's go full screen yeah so it's working see how much we can get as you see the time runs out thanks for playing your score is 820. as you can see that matches up with the score up here so that is it for today's tutorial um the halloween shooting game please leave a like and subscribe if you enjoyed watching this video and happy halloween to everyone celebrating it today hopefully you can get a lot of candy i guess all right thank you guys for watching see you guys next time you
