thank you welcome back guys it's kids from playground here and today we're back with another video on Scratch and today someone asked us to make a clicker game on scratch so that's exactly what we did here and we made a farm clicker game uh it's just a really cool idea so we made a fun clicker game and let's just start so this is just a demo for the game by the way the tutorial will be coming out next week so we started the game we have our dancing chicken moving back and around a little flash over here to click and then you get one score this is your CPS basically how much score you get for each click which is one here so we're gonna try to get 50 here to get to like the sound is really annoying but yeah we're gonna try to get to maybe lower this out a little bit because I'm gonna try to get to 50 and once we get that we can buy chicken and then chickens uh you see the increased variable here so that's that's how much chickens you have and these are the default units these are the mega units and then after when you get that a chicken will probably give you one every two I think and then after that these are down here are tools to help you get this is a times two multiplier this is a times ten this is a times uh 100. so this is times 10. let's get this so objective of this game is to try to get really rich you see there's a world record thing over here that shows how much you get oh that's the world record so our goal is sure probably can't try to get the whole so I'm gonna do some off camera so so I did some clicking off camera and then I got the hoe and now I got the wheelbarrow but and now my CPS you see it increases so this is at times 10 and this one's Attack 100 so I hit 100 and off camera I also got some llamas I got a horse a dog and a few dogs and a few chickens so there is gonna be a cap for each animal so um Captain chickens is 150 dog is uh I'm not mistaken 100 and of course is 75 um llama is 50 and uh rainbow llama is actually going to be I think it's actually 25 yeah and then the Griffin is three yeah three and then the uh the king is the King Dragon is one so you see I'm just gonna spam the default ones right now and I'm gonna try to get one of these good characters off camera Maybe so yeah let's see so I maxed out the chickens the dogs the horses and now I'm gonna Max up the llamas so we Max them all out and we'll try to get one of these God units see if if you do not um if you this is the max cap so if you you can't go higher than that it'll give you a little text Max maximum units reached and if you try to get these it says you do not have enough money to buy this item if you do not have enough money to buy this item so basically the pens will give wonder if there's like three seconds this one will give one to ten yeah one no one to five every second and this will give 35 every three seconds and this will give if I'm not sticking 60 every two seconds maybe I don't know and these God units are really good so we're gonna try to get one and see and I'll try to show you how they basically do so off camera I got some more so I have enough to buy two God llamas maximum is 25 so let's just buy two and you see they'll give you only 60k uh 60k every I think like threeish seconds and we're gonna try to get a Griffin and experience around you see I'm about to get um I maxed out the llamas the Griffins and all the default ones as well as I bought all of these and I'm about to get King Dragon so spot King Dragon it has its own custom little buying effect and as you can see if I'm not mistaken it'll give like uh uh something like 60 million every second every two seconds or issue so it's basically a game I maxed out the game it's pretty fun not gonna lie and tutorial is coming out next week so you can go check out our project on Gumball 098 that is my name and I'll be sharing this project very soon and you can go check it out give us some feedback in the comments uh uh just give us your ideas and opinions on the project that we have made and also please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below what else videos you want as you can see this is one of the subscriber ideas and we turned it into one of these games so anyways see you guys next time
