welcome back guys it's kid tune playground here and today we're back for another video in scratch and today we're making a fun area calculator thing if you're doing homework and um you have homework to do and you're not quite sure and you want to check your answer you can just go to your local scratch project and code this for yourself you can see there's some backdrop that you can make reflect place a music emotional piano and then you can enter your choice one two or three one is a rectangle two is a triangle and three is a circle so so um you can go one you know and ask you to enter the length of the rectangle four and enter the width seven six and then the area is 24. you could probably solve that in your head but it also works with decimals too 5.65 two triangle enter the base four enter to the height three and you'll divide it by two that's how you find the area of a triangle and um you go three will be the circle into the diamond diameter to 45 and then you'll times that by three volts because that's how you find the area and now um let's make a new project so we actually need the scratch cat today and we actually have to make a backdrop so i have my backdrop in the backpack there we have it and we have our backdrop and we want to move like the scratch cat around here so it's really blocking anything and we have our backdrop and so all you need to do is make this rectangle and uh uh just pick random colors and you can make a pretty decent thing and then you can use the text and outline and then you have the rectangle yeah the text rectangle and then you draw a triangle uh you draw a rectangle you draw a triangle you draw a circle it's pretty easy you write the text down and i actually think this is a little bit lower than the one that we had before so let's just move this up a little bit that means we also have to change the positioning of this oh i think it's fine positioning is fine but now we have to um delete this backdrop and we have the scratch cat so let's work on the scratch cat so we have this so in this thing it has a bunch of my blocks and we're going to be working on a bunch of those today so you just drag when the green flag is clicked and you make a new my blog called setup game so whenever you finish the whenever the scratch cat finishes the problem it will set up the game again so then you can do it again and we have set up game and then we'll just define setup game and now we have defined setup game it'll ask us what you want like circle what do you want uh square so we have this ask said enter your choice one two oh yeah we need space uh or three or three and now we're done with that it will you need an if then else statement if then the answer equals one will it'll be the triang rectangle i mean so uh since this is the rectangle you'll find the area of the rectangle you want it to find so area you need operator equal if the answer equals one so answer then you will make a block called rectangle so as i said we're going to be working with a bunch of these my blocks today so we have rectangle we're going to put this to the side and then we're going to put rectangle over here else so we're actually going to code the rectangle first because i feel like we it's more organized so we have the rectangle it's going to ask you to enter the length so what's your one enter the length and wait oh i saw the wrong length and set length length to answer and now we have that because uh whatever length you need like four we'll set it to the answer and then it'll ask what is your width enter the width and now it's going to tell you and then now it's going to set a width and i was going to set the width to enter to whatever you entered and now you'll set area new variable and now you'll set the area to the length on your list because let's say you find the area of a a rectangle or square so we set that to length times width and now we say because we join the air the uh area so it will say join area equals and we area equals and we have a space and another space and then here we write area for any sections you want but i'm gonna say three because it's reasonable to write that down and set up game so it'll start over here again and so then you can ask whatever you want so now let's move back so i'm gonna yeah let's move on to the triangle first let's hide these variables and now um so let's see one into the left length uh eight with 3 24. so easy math and now we're going to look at the triangle so you need another ifthenelse statement if then the answer equals two answer equals two then it will triangle because it'll become a triangle triangle it will be a triangle and now we have the triangle let's work on the triangle and yeah let's do this so triangle ask enter base because base times height is the triangle method divided by two and so we have um ask enter the base and then it'll say set base to enter so we need another variable base set base to answer so whatever you want the base to be and now if you hear any piano in the background which is my brother playing piano uh i don't know what he's playing right now but okay whatever and i'll set base to answer um it'll ask enter the height the highest ball height yes and it'll set height to answer make a new variable always use new variable and then uh and then i'll set height to answer and i'll set area to base all right so let's break this down so we have two time signs we put one of them inside there we put them in here jamming them there and then we have a 0.5 because that's basically one half of something so we have 0.5 times base times height so basically base times height divided by two or base times height divided uh just one half of that and now it would we just have to duplicate this and instead of saying yeah and yeah that's just it and that's for the triangle so let's test that two three three four point five i'm pretty sure that's right three times three nine divided by two yeah four four five so and now we have to work on the um circle and if you didn't know circle is uh your um what was that circle is the radius and times 3.14 so we have triangle here so we put that under the else here and if answer equals three then it will circle as i said we're having a lot of blocks in this video so yeah we have circle it will circle and this drag it over there for now and other than that it'll say invalid choice because what if he said 84 and that's not a part of that so we have to say invalid choice choice for two seconds and then it'll set up the game again because once you have an invalid choice you have to click the green flag to do all that all over again so you have to have the setup game yeah if you didn't have this under the invalid choice if you typed in 84 because that's not one two or three that means it won't start over again so we need that over there and now let's work on the circle so you'll ask you to enter the diameter so he spell it yeah and um set radius so new variable a lot of variables in this uh uh video i'm just checking my spelling set radius to answer divided by 2. so area for circle is pi r squared and r squared is radius square so um pi r squared 3.14 and by that by 2. so the radius is the answer divided by 2 because you say like 4 will be 2 and it'll do that again because it's pi r squared so you have this division answer by two and um you'll you'll have to do this oh never mind and then you'll have to just delete this and so we're going to move that a little bit so he'll set the area to 3.14 times radius times radius because pi r squared 3.14 times radius and radius and we'll set the the area to we need times and another times and that would be 3.14 times radius times radius radius squared and it will say okay we'll just get this area equals area for three seconds and we'll set up the game again so we just have to work on the backdrop and get this done and then so we'll set the sound where's the sound set volume to 25 you know this is optional and then it'll go forever and we got some relaxing music this one and we just put that in so now we're done with our project so now we're going to show you the circle and the circle 3.14 so we're going to enter the diameter so diameter enter the diameter um let's go uh 10 because the radius is 5 so we're going to go so now um yeah i'm going to show you the code one let's just test this yeah i think i think it should work individual parts but let's show you um the cat sprite uh let's jam this all together let's see if we can do it yeah yeah if you can see this this is good but uh feel free to pause and um and copy down all this code if you don't have it yet feel free to pause and please like share subscribe and comment the comment section below what else projects you want us to make and uh see you guys next time
