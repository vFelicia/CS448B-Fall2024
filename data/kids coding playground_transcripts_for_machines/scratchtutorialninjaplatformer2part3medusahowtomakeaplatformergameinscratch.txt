mmhmm hello and welcome back guys to kiss coding playground so today we'll work on the third part of this ninja platformer the newer version uh so today we're gonna probably work on the uh matusa which is the monster so we'll work on that today so let's go over last time so last time we got everything working with a ninja able to jump it will do a slash it will throw the kunai and he can kind of fly up okay all right so let's get started so we'll work on the medusa today okay so be sure you go to the medusa so here we're gonna have to create some variable so for the medusa so let's make some variable so make it for the sprite only so we're gonna try to get all all the variable in one go okay so the first one we're gonna have is so the first one will be each character so we're going to use a list and then we're going to keep track of where the medusa is and then we're going to use a loop so we're going to have to use all these uh to get the data out of their list and pause it so so first one is each character so for the sprite only so next make another variable for the sprite only enemy enemy exists okay so next for this sprite only i'm going to call index another variable for this sprite only and we're going to say uh my deuce custom index okay i think on my original code i had it as all variable but i think it's better to keep it at the sprite only so that way you know we don't have to look at other variables when we go to other sprite so here with everything we're going to put it in the medusa hp okay for the sprite only okay so next uh we've got methods here we're going to do a medusa i'm going to copy this word so that way you know we can use it better so medusa left position okay then we're going to create another one called medusa position and we'll pick another one for this probably medusa position then we're gonna have some more uh we're gonna use another vehicle called position and then we're gonna have another variable x not a variable y okay so i think that's all the new variable that we had for the medusa okay so let's just can hide these um so basically we're gonna use it to go through the loop to find our position for where to put the medusa and now using the left and right position we can kind of move more medusa to the left and the right and then they can turn around okay so let's get started so let's go with the when green black is clicked so here we're gonna say hi okay i forgot to create my list also so i'll create one more variable the variable and this time make a list called medusa positionless okay i think my medusa already had it when i pulled her in so uh this medusa so if you guys don't have it make a list so you can say make a list and you can for this friendly or for all sprite doesn't really matter so uh basically we're going to use an adult position this i think i had it as a for uh this glass for this sprite only as you can see medusa colon so this is for the medusa position list so if you don't have this be sure to make one so you can just select this and put the name medusa position this here okay like this medusa position like that okay so since i have it i don't need to do it okay so let's go with this so delete all so we're going to clear that so what we're going to do is add some position uh where we want to put medusa so we're gonna put zero so wherever we don't want the medusa to appear for that stage we put zero okay so this is basically stage one so basically like level one so this this stage here so so let's say you want to put medusa on the second level and you want to put a certain position uh you can say uh the x position and then we'll get a pipe character a straight line and then we're gonna put in the y position basically let's say we're on the second costume here second stage and we're going to put medusa on the top here somewhere here on top here so that's why i picked that position but you can always find the position by picking uh by hitting the uh the m key so let's say we're over here say we want to put medusa here push the m key uh i think i haven't worked on that yet so let me do that for now okay so for the m key you can put in the background or the anywhere i think in my old code i actually had it in the main character so let's just put it in there so in the main character you can say when m key is pressed so basically this is the mouse so we're going to try to find the mouse position for this so i'm going to say set and we're going to say set global mouse position i'm going to use the join condition and then get another one and then we're going to get the mouse x i think it's in sensing so mousex i'm going to put a comma a couple of space and then i'm going to put mouse y okay all right and then you can put this inside here okay so when the m key is pressed we're gonna get the mouse position wherever it is and then we're gonna show the variable so we're gonna say show the global mouse position okay so let's say i want to put the methuselah here at this location i can push the m key you can see that is negative 5 negative 78 if i want to put it in here that the negative 200 negative 35 okay so that is how you find the position where you want to put the medusa so for me i already had some of those old uh position i had already so that's why i'm using it if you don't have it then you're to try to find where you want to put it okay all right so let's continue so we're going to add a couple so so this is stage 1 stage 2 stage 3 and let's put him at 15. uh let's go pipe uh negative 23 and that's what i have and i have like stage four and five so for now let's not let's not put anything else let's say we don't want anything at stage four let's say one two three number four we don't want the medusa to appear we can put zero okay so let's have these for now actually okay so let's go next part we are going to work on getting the position from the medusa all right so what we're going to do is we're going to try to uh get these uh variable uh get this position out from this list for each of the level so you can click on this or run and then set it up so i've issued to uh put a check mark at these uh variables we're going to try to use this to look at it so this our position position x and y okay so have these little check marks after this so let's go let's make a new block and we're going to call it get medusa position okay click on that so forget medusa position we are going to go to set the variable let's zoom in a little bit so i'm going to say set enemy access to false so we're going to use this to determine if we show the enemy on the stage or not then we're going to sell index to one so that's how scratch works is start the index by one and say each character i'll make that to blank so delete that so i'm gonna use this to pull the go to the loop and pull this each character out okay so next duplicate set uh position to blank okay duplicate set medusa position we're gonna use the list and we're gonna get one of the items from the list so i'm going to say get this one and then we're going to use the variable level so basically go through each level it will pull out level one will power 0 level 2 will pull out this number here okay all right so next we're gonna have the if condition sorry put the if condition here and then for this one what we're going to do is we're going to use the end join so you're going to use a not join and then we're going to use the equal not equal and then we'll duplicate that put this here and over here and then we're going to say um not methuselah position with methuselah position okay so methuselah position is not equal to zero or duplicate and or not equal to blank okay then we're gonna go in i'm gonna set the enemy access to true okay and then we are going to do the repeat loop so i'm going to repeat the number of times we're going to use the length and then we're going to duplicate the master position so basically we're going to go to the loop look at each of the position which is like negative negative and then 37 i mean three and then seven so on and so forth okay and then when you're doing the repeat loop you always have to increase the index right at the end so uh remember to always do that but for now we'll we'll call other stuff first at the end we'll add it okay so next we want to say set each character and then we're going to use the letters we're going to use the index here so okay and then we're going to use the medusa position here so it will go through each character pick up one letter from the whatever the position is and then it keep on going okay and then we're going to use the if an else control uh if an else statement here here we're going to check uh if each character is equal to the pipe symbol which is i'm using that the pipe symbol is on the top of your enter key you just shift and then hit that so that's it's going to match if you use a comma then you have to put your comma here okay so i'm using pipe so that's why i'm using that so i'm gonna say set i'm gonna set the x equal to position and then we're going to say set position it goes to blank okay so next we're going to say set the position else block kind of set the position we're going to use the join condition here so here we're going to join the variable position plus each character while going through so every time you go through the first time will be zero uh it will be blank blank join with the first character which is let's say negative and then the next time we go down and get three the next time we're gonna go get seven so until it gets to the pot first pipe symbol we're going to set the position to the x and then we're going to reset the position to blank and then at the very end we're going to set the uh the last position to y okay so here what we're going to do is going to say change index change index by one okay put that under the else block here and then at the very end we're gonna say set y so we're going to set y to the position and put that at the end here okay so let's take a look we should look at everything i hope we got it doing right so this is everything okay all right so let's go through this and let's try to call our block okay so our level is one right level one so when we call this we're not getting anything right because the level is one this is zero so now let's change our variable change our level so let's set the level to two so it's level two so i set it to two so it should pick up this negative 37 34. so i click on this you can see you pick up negative 37 34 then it goes through and it goes trying to find the position so you see that x is negative 37 this is 34. so let's say i go to number three set level to three so it should be 15 and negative 23. so let's click on this again so you can see it picks up 15 that's the x negative 23 is a y okay all right so let's drop this away so now that we had that done so next part we're gonna move the uh create another uh custom block so this time we are going to make a block called medusa stop start okay all right so click that so for medusa start this is making medusa to move uh we're gonna say set set the size to 125 okay and then we're gonna say go to front layer and then we're gonna say show then we're gonna say clear graphics effect so we'll make them blank when they get hit next we're going to set the medusa hp to 3 and then we're going to set the medusa custom index to one okay okay so next we're gonna have a forever loop and then we're going to use a operator i'm going to use the if first sorry so if and then this all operator we're going to use a n also put in the first operator okay first r so this is um if it's touching the kunai so this is gonna damage the uh the medusa or if it's touching the ninja and we're gonna say greater than so we're gonna call 51 so i'll explain why that is it so be sure to select the back first and then select the ninja custom number okay so basically uh what we want to say is if it's touching the ninja and the custom number is greater than 51 so the 51 is actually the custom number where the ninjas are doing the slicing using the sword so i put everything at the end you can see so 50 50 51 right 51 is starting 51 um so i think mine here is a 53 right so i should say greater than 52 because i think i have to slice so basically if it's greater than 52 which is uh this slice or this attack so any of these attack it hits the medusa will be uh it will be done damage on him on her okay so we're gonna say greater than 52 right because 53 is where the attack starts so we're going to say change it to greater than 52 i think originally my game had 51 but later we got we added the slide so so is it greater than 52 and then we're gonna say broadcast message and wait say got hit okay so next we're going to say on move say move three step and then we're gonna use the if condition again i mean if uh if statement put it under here i'm gonna say use the greater than sign okay and we're gonna say x position is greater than we got the medusa right so methuselah right position so basically if the x exposition is greater than but there's a right position we're gonna turn it around so we're gonna say point it through okay so here we are going to turn around so uh point in direction negative 90 and then similarly we're gonna do it for the other side and then we're gonna use the less than and we are going to use the x position and then this is less than the medusa left position we're going to turn it back around turn it back to the right side and also make sure your medusa is having this thing in the middle so it doesn't flip over otherwise you're going to have to use the set rotation style left and right okay okay next um gonna say if so i'll put that under here so if i'm gonna use the uh condition here and then we're gonna use the index i'm gonna do the custom index greater than four we're going to set the set the methuselah custom index back to one okay and then so you can see medusa here's the depth animation so here here we're using the walk so the walk as one two three four right so after it gets to the full walk we're going to go back to the first walk okay okay so next i'm going to say switch costume okay and then we're going to use the join operator i'm going to put block here so that has to match the name of the costume so i have walk right so you see walk one so that's why i put walk one and then here in cell one except the level one we're gonna use the index because they're gonna start at one and then we're gonna keep going right and then we're gonna put a little weight 0.1 and then change custom index jt methods are custom index pack one okay so this is for the methuselah to walk so what i'm going to do next is we're going to try to get this medusa 11 left and right um position okay so this is the code for the custom block if you missed anything write that down so next we're going to have the broadcast when i receive start new level gonna say stop other script and sprite hi so basically if you start a new level you want to kill the medusa right so high then we're going to call this block get the custom get the medusa position and then we're going to have the control here if we're going to use the operator equal then we're going to check if the enemy exists is equal to true you know once we found it we set it to true right so that's what we did here right so if you go back to this one right and we find it set to true so here that's what we did so if that's set to true then we're going to say go to go to uh we got the x and y right don't do the x and y here so i'm gonna use the x and y so x and y okay then we're gonna say set the medusa left position we're going to uh for the lap position we're going to use a minus so we're going to use the x subtract 70 and then we're going to get the right position i'm going to use the x and i'm going to use the plus so let's say plus 70 so basically i'll move left and right 70 steps after that we're going to call the stock medusa basically tell it to move okay we are almost done so next i know this is going to be a little bit long so it's a little bit complicated so next we're going to say got hit basically that's when the medusa got hit by the kunai or something like that so we're going to say change change the medusa hp by 1 okay and then we're going to use that if an else condition and then we're going to use the greater than sign i use the metusa hp if is greater than zero so that's greater than zero uh we're going to start the sound squeak ah this is just screaming mature screaming got hit okay he's not dead yet so what we do is we're gonna say switch costume so it's costume death number one uh weight uh 0.5 let's switch to death number two so this is not completely dead yet so medusa is just getting hit so you gotta go with this one and then this one okay so three and four she's about to die right so we don't want to do that so this is completely dead so we're gonna use these two for getting hit okay otherwise i wanna say stop stop other script in the sprite so so it produces no more hp we'll stop by the screen spray and i'm going to set here i'm gonna do the custom index back to one so we'll reset everything here and then we're gonna set the switch costume to the first costume which is the death costume so when it's dying okay and then we're gonna repeat five times so because they have six costume total right so if you look at medusa he has six costumes of death one to test six so we start the first one so we're gonna repeat five times okay um because the depth has zero okay that was one so we can either use a let's start at zero and then we start at one that's correct so one equal to three right so we're gonna say actually i think we can do two because uh what happened is the first one is def one right so we're gonna listen to two here i think my original one i have one i think we can do two here so we're gonna say repeat five times i'm gonna say change close effect close effect by 10 and then switch cost 2. join i use that death by the uh madusa custom index so the first one is one so we can say two and then three four five then we'll change t i'll change the uh i do the custom index by one and then ones that i'll repeat all five times and say play the sound okay so we have the magic spell sound basically that medusa got killed and then we can say hi i think in my old game has played sound until done but you know it doesn't really matter but yeah we can use that let's just i think it really doesn't matter i think we're gonna wait for this to be finished anyway and then we're gonna broadcast the message and then this is a new message called start medusa starting so basically we kill the medusa after some time you know we have not completed the station because i can come back again so i'm going to say so this is where we start again right so let's say when we do that start again um i'll use the if condition and we're going to check if the enemy equals now we're going to use enemy exists they call it true and we're going to say let's say weight you can put random i think on my original game i have like wait five to seven seconds you know whatever like oh you can do four to seven three if you want it faster and then you can call the medusa start again okay so i think we have all the code for medusa let's test it out let's see so let's say the first one let's say let's hide this variable right now hopefully it works and let's say number one we're gonna put the medusa here let's click on the m key we're gonna put it negative 30 and 74 negative 74. so let's go back to our list so let's say negative 30 and then put the pipe symbol 74. okay let's see what so you can see the medusa is walking this way after that she's walking the other way you can see right and then you can see if i hit the kunai some dudes that's getting damaged after three times she died and goes away so after uh if you wait for some more time then it will come back up so you can see the tools that come back up again we can use the slice so we can slice her and then she dials okay i think we'll stop here for now i think there's a lot of work we have done right today so we'll stop and see you guys next time thank you you
