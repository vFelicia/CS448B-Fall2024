hello and welcome back to kiss coding playground today we're looking at a game called ninja platformer I know these tonic m is really popular among kids who was coding in scratch so I thought I'd give it a try and trying to make one myself and teach you guys along the way so this is a simple game where we have a ninja you have control the ninja kind of jam across you can kill the Medusa and get to the box you can get the gym after you get the gym from the box then the portal open up you can go into the portal and I will go to the next stage so I'm trying to get really simple only two stages but as you can see this is just a concept on the platform again you can kind of expand on that and make it even better just a disclaimer this game still have a little bug because of the green green platform here and this ninja here sometime the ninja gets stuck in between the rocks here and the green back home because when we when we do the code that checks the ninja touching the green platform sometimes you know he's had this on top of this and it was still can't get stuck there so that's a little problem we had with the game I mean maybe later I can do a hitbox on the feet of the ninja only and making the ninja follow the hitbox and the player can show the small box so that way maybe it may be better but I think that would require a lot more work and you know on so let me just continue this with this game and just fancies you guys the basic concept of platformer and how we can get started ok so this tutorial we're gonna learn about these farming concept custom block how to use custom block custom sprite how to make custom sprite how to use them and how the link between the sprite of the main sprite where players controlling and how to use variable controlling the game how to do loops touching sprite broadcasting and other stuff so this game is really for advanced kids who has a good understanding of scratch and how it works if you don't have that I would not read and working on this game so it will be really difficult and you will not be able to follow along so let's get started let me demo the game for you guys ok already here ok let me start here so if you can see I'm the ninja I can move back and forth I can use a 1 number 1 to attack number 2 to throw the little knife number three I can fly down when I jump up some of jump is up left and right and you can jump and shoot the hitter 5 time so I come across I come down I got the gym so it open up the corner I can hold the photo once I come to the portal it goes to level 2 this is the timer here kind of to keep track of how long you are doing this stage when you complete the game so this is a multiple jump you can also use w SD SD as well I think like I'd like to use the arrow key here inside general cross okay I can attack them Medusa or I can come down at the gym now the portal comes down so you can also fly down like this with the glide so we were just trying it so the Medusa are still there the game so this is kind of how the game runs so this is a basic demo of the game as you can see you can make it a little bit more complicated and if you drop into the water you'll die I did not show that but or if you hit by Medusa you also die so let me just show you so if I drop underwater I came back to the starting spot and if I get hit by Tommy twosie this you can see I can lay down for a second and then I died the animation blinked okay alright let's stop this game we will start to walk on it before we start the game please like share and subscribe to our channel that will be really great that means a lot to us and give us a thumbs up on the video and comment down below what you'd like to see next so this is the first ninja platformer game part 1 we'll have more coming but this is the first one so I will show you the basic of how it how we work with the ninja platformer game how we get started okay alright so what you need to do I will start a new project you have to download your sprite okay so there's a couple of place that you could down this output in the link below later what you can do is go to hear how you can search up like the portal I had right so you can search up this sprite to the portal okay you can type in like in Google to search for image by sprite to the portal or something you can see something like this you can just say right click and save it once you save it this guy gives a gif file when you have a gif file you can actually load it or PNG or whatever so this guy's really good it has transparent sprite peer portal chip when you lower them to into a scratch it it will create different custom for you I'll show you later also you can type in not a search let's say sprite 2d you can see like these kind of sprite so this is the ninja when I use it is from either one of these site I think the like you can go to like the free to the set site here or this one anyway I'll put down the link below so this one this it this site give you some sub game asset you can download like this one is free some of them you have to buy so you can download these and you can walk with them if you like you know I see you can see there's a lot of different kind you can use the one that I was using this this site so what you can do is you over here the cycle came out to the freebie HTML I'll put the link below and you can download this sprite so what I did was just click on this if you like to grow you can click on the curve click on this and then say free download after you download I give you a zip file you can see that ninja adventure new leave that zip down the left corner right right here in the corner here when I hover my mouse so once you download that you cannot zip it and zip it up and then you can load them up okay so this is the ninja also you can download the platform so this is the tile you need tile set so this is the one die down low earlier the tileset for my game as you can see you can download this one the desert and something else these are free I know you can try it buy them and you know like if you want you can sign up and buy a better one so for us we just try to use some free one just to just to play around with it okay alright once you have download all that you have to zip unzip it out okay so once you unzip it you get something like this right the adventure ninja new this is the toy version as you can see a different attack right iffen you have a climbing also so we didn't do you have death that's the one that we used we have the attack we use that we have the kalaiy that is flying down and yet that I don't I mean he's standing there throwing you can use him his heads turn over around I think we're gonna use one of them then you have this jump you have a pack channel attack throw sly you know you're different kinda thing that you can use with this ninja so this is for the ninja so once you get the other one the other one is the let's say I think is the this one cow said yeah so power set here so this is the background it's called the PNG you didn't see background background was the this like a tree or something like that that's what we're using and then you can go to object knocked you get like tree the box the rock was still the sign right and you can go through the tile this is like how you just kind of put them together the water so this is the one that we were using okay so let's go back to our game okay so let's say you have yours cat you can delete this cat you say you can say paint new sprite what you can do is you can say upload here and you go to your costume for the ninja go to PNG you can see this ninja here so far ninja we need different one what we can do is we can use the death I think the death one that one is time or input all of them these cat so this one will give us all the ninja that died right and let's no more to this costume you cannot blow them all but I think you don't need them all and it will be way confusing and you can just take one of the idol let's say with I don't number 5 we can say we add that guy in and we need some more we need the who only that half yet use that later now we can use the jump I think the jump we can use for the sprite and to the jump this is jump throw so you know be careful see which one it is the run we also need let's get the run first so run run run zero the one run nine okay we got them all okay and we upload some more let's look for the run so which one is wrong let's see run Oh run we got we got we need quit it jump right jump oh here it is jang okjung 0 to jump ok alright so this is the basic thing that we have 1 inch we have the the one lady time right the one that he has the running and the one he is jumping wait and then there's one for idle I think somewhere let's move them up but I don't want we'll start with that guy ok run run okay here's okay let's move up okay all the way up to our first costume okay so we'll use this guy's our first costume for the ninja what you can do is you can like rename them if you want to show their name like I go to I five or something and this guy you can rename it to like the 0 the 1 and so on and so forth so you can just do more broke it okay as you can see I'm done with all the naming so let's go back up you can see i5 is a Idol 50 to the nine I believe that's one is time you have a are 02 or nine that's running and then J 0 2 j 9 which is jumping so this is our main sprite now we'll name a ninja okay all right we have our ninja what we can do is that we're going to set his size at 25 so this is our ninja a little bit small so this is what we are going to do also we need to set up like the platform the background sending background we can just go to upload the background and you can go back to the way you downloaded the tile go to PNG background and you can select your background so once you send it back okay you have your background here right then you can put in like other stuff you know the platform which will create a sprite okay alright so for the platform what you can do it you can create pain as a sprite and then you can just upload the costume same thing go back down find this tile and then can upload more you want or you can do it one by one let's just say we upload them all let's say we have all this not of water water will be a separate sprite less okay so we upload more as you can see these are different one what you can do is you can convert it to a vector let's say I want to use this one the converted vector select this thing you can select him now let's say I want to kind of change it right I don't this one of trash this so also this one I want to use this one convective vector select him and you can kind of build them next light like let's say this is your platform right so you can make it come on go up and down make sure there or line up nicely okay so as you can see right I can do this out not complete vector again select him and you can fill them out so and so as you can see this is my one of my platform right so you see little gap here in here so you can fix that just move this so you can see so you have a platform something like this right and you can adjust size making it smaller or larger so let's say I want this will be here you know right so it will be somewhere here and then you can fill up the bottom of water and you can also add like let's say this one I want to add some longer one in the bottom then I went to Viktor like this go back to my frost one put this here come on resize it also and you can add it here so as you can see I almost done with my first block right then you have to get this one in the middle convert to vector copy that and you can move them here and you make it smaller a little bit as you can see just child it takes some time to get it all in so let's see okay and we can get the last piece on here convective vector copy this go back make this smaller kind of fit to this right so you can use up an arrow key as you can see this is my first block okay so that's how you make the platform right so in order to make the video shorter what I'm going to do is the upload my platform die alright have with the game I made earlier but for you guys you know if you're doing it for the first time just trying to go through and try to create any kind of level platform you like and once you're done you can just drag this anyway you want right like maybe here or here and then you can fill the water okay alright for now we'll stop here don't want to make the video too long and next time next lesson we'll continue and create our platform for the year for the sprite for the game okay alright see you guys next time thank you for watching
