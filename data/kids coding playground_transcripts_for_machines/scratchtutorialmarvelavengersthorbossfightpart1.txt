welcome back guys it's kids coding playground here and today we're back for another video of well i mean like scratch because it's going to play grounds and anyway so we're going to start now many kids have requested for the marvel game so um we decided to make it today so uh yeah so you want to see my game well i mean it's called thor boss fight and i'm clicking look as you can see uh thor loses health he's 120 hp and whenever the bugs hit him he loses 5 hp and then to get rid of the bugs you gotta go like that and then the lightning comes out and kills all the bombs really cool in my opinion and then you just have to use them to kill the things and then if the dragon walks to your stone i know he's really slow that means you lose or if the bugs kill you and died as well so i mean like um the dragon uh is immune to lightning because he's a dragon and the ways to attack the dragon is use the slam with the hammer which or the throw with the hammer which i'm going to show you right now the throw hammer you can spam not really spam but like go it's more higher dps than the hammer the number one so but i honestly like this one better just because you know then yeah the dragon is mean to lightning so yeah so so if he gets the rocks and he so or yeah i've told you that so i'm about to die here that's because i was not trying in the beginning trying to show you guys how to die and stuff oh it says oh i died so look so thor's like i don't know i don't know like he's died like something hit him or something so it says you lose but i'm gonna speed up the process a little bit and see if you win so as you can see i'm in the middle of this right now i'm online it's hard getting the recording back up with them kill some dps bro and then light him up kill the peons the you win so the dragon can also get your stone and you lose so yeah you gotta i'm gonna show you that so i'm gonna upload my images now because i got a bunch of images two reasons why i did this because the dragon had too much files inside and also because you you're tired of me saying this eight letter word backpack so yeah so it's not backpack this time so i'm gonna upload all of these so so up to up to here and shift and then down to here so lip i got them all so it might take a while honestly and it might get a little bit laggy for your computer oh look there's a dragon the dragon has a really big file and so this is thor okay so we got him all in the lightning oh nice laggy um yeah so okay so um if you're if you don't if you can't get these things in our google drive you're basically doing it wrong uh so um so um you guys if it doesn't work for you guys you can just go to my shared project right click export this magical button so and there's two lightnings i'll tell you why in just a second so first i'm gonna do some stuff with the leaves i'm just gonna make the oh wow it's really laggy it's still saving my project and the thing isn't even showing up so i'm gonna make the elven stone next cup okay so now i'm going to upload the sprite the rock sprite rocks because i messed it up it was supposed to be on the costume so yeah i'm going to get the costume convert to vector ctrl c ctrl v and look it's bigger than that but i can delete the sprite but i'm just going to make this smaller the elven stone the elven symbol the elven symbol on the stone so that's great and it's fine and okay so now we can delete the leaves we don't need this and okay so we're gonna start out with the thor we have many costumes for it so we're gonna oh yeah we're gonna do the lightning first because we're gonna show you how to do the lighting so this is the big lightning i already have so this is how you do it for all the costumes so there's so many costumes for this uh so you just have to do control a so i was scrolling while doing control a so it just zoomed everything in so yeah um so this i'm going to do control a and ctrl a so gather all of it zoom out and make it larger so there we go it's larger we just center it so we have to do this for everything so all of these we have to do all of it so you get the point you just have to keep on doing this and uh do it for all this costumes so uh i'm gonna do one more for good measure ctrl a you get the point but just make it really big and make it go to the middle so it'll cover the whole screen so we already have it for the other one we already have lightning so we can delete lightning too yeah so we already have it enlarged in this one so i'm going to delete the lightning too and then i actually downloaded this from this lightning thunderbolt gif it's this one so that this is the where i downloaded this uh thing so just cost save images and just put it in so yeah um we're gonna get started on the thor we really have to get started in the code it's already been seven minutes and 27 seconds so let's do this so when the green flag is clicked it'll go to the position i have it in around the edge you just drag it around and figure out yourself so it'll set hp to any hp you want so first i'm going to make the variable hp to 125 so uh i'm gonna the size has to be 75 so if you make it 100 you could make it 100 but it's way too big in my opinion so make it 75. and switch costume to thor 0 0 and forever if if the if the key one is compressed key one is pressed then i'll broadcast a message called attack so broadcasting white so yeah broadcast message attack you just have to duplicate this make number two and instead of attack make a new message of throw hammer because thor throws his hammer too if oh if you want to yeah yeah you just yeah if you want to do that you can do it yeah so instead do for three on this one because it's lightning so let's switch this to lightning attack and then when i receive attack it will switch costume to thor zero zero this is this costume right here and repeat 12 times because on the attack costume we have 12 costumes so i think it's starting from 41 starting from 40 one two three four five yeah you get the point uh we made multiple costumes so it looks more smoother because look look this is basically the same thing right this is literally the same thing but if you actually do it like make multiple of these and what looks more smoother and it's a better animation in my opinion so and so we have that repeat 12 i'll move 10 steps next costume uh weight 0.005 so that's the thousandths place 0.005 um broadcast attack dragon so yeah you have to hit the dragon with the hammer so attack dragon so and also we have to do switch crossing back to the regular four four zero zero so we have him right here let's bring this a little bit more down uh and glide 0.1 seconds back to this position and after that we have to work on the lightning attack and throw hammer so i'm going to show you how this looks like so um yeah if you add extra costumes like if you add like more costumes than us you you have to make instead of repeat 12 you might have to use more so let's do this see look yeah um so now we're going to work on the lightning attack so when i receive lightning attack then it will switch costumes i i think i should do throw hammer first but that's fine i'm going to throw hammer actually because it's more i mean like this is number two and this is number one so why not just do throw hammer and then switch costume to 406 which is which is costing 14 for this one so he's about to throw the hammer he got his hand ready and stuff so door six oh six and repeat eight times and next costume so you always want to make it i mean not like next costume but like weight zero point zero zero five so no pre eight costumes from starting from four six so zero point zero zero five thousandths place remember south thousands now so uh switch costumes are back to the war zero zero so down here and now we're gonna show you this so one look two two two throwing nothing but air right now because we don't have the hammer coated so we're gonna go the hammer now cause speaking of hammer hammer hammer so when i was when when the green flag is quite hide in a little bit we still have some at bugs too i mean some sprites add like the bug so yeah we're going to get to that after when we're done coding some before so throw hammer the only big part of the code is probably the bug other than that this is the thor is actually not that bad so go to thor show repeat until touching dragon walking uh touching dragon walking or edge so you know or touching dragon walking which is the dragon or um the edge it might not be able to touch the edge but it's extra just in case if someone just tries to glitch out the game and mess everything up yeah no touch they'll touch the edge or the dragon watching walking so yeah so move ten steps you just have to keep on moving and hide so yeah really simple code for the hammer so i'm going to show you guys right now so you guys can copy that down two look hits the dragon bam we haven't coded much yet so let's keep on coding so let's go back to the four because we're gonna work on the thor the lightning attack so when i receive lightning attack which is also lightning so same thing but whatever uh switch costume that thor 15 which is uh this one so he's like raising up his hammer like rar or something like a viking i don't know so switch costume to thor 15 which will make him raising up his hand so we're going to show you that real quick but after we're done coding this of course repeat eight costumes next costume wait 0.05 seconds and then switch costume back to thor zero zero so yeah basically the same thing for all of them just a little bit different so we're gonna show you that three yard so yeah so nice uh now we're gonna work on the lightning because we are doing the lightning next because we just coded the lightning attack so actually i forgot to add the broadcast lightning on this thing so this is just a broadcast lightning and weight which i did not add quite yet i mean yeah we'll add it so like right now so uh lightning so lightning nice so next we're gonna work on the lightning of course because we just did that so you can see the whole entire jiff it's like bam bam bam lightning coming down from the sky because thor's a lightning dude if you if you didn't know you probably already know that because you knew that because it's avengers everyone knows about avengers so and then when i receive lightning it will switch costume to lightning no not 36 but one which is lightning and those show and go to front layer repeat 36 times because there's 36 costumes of next costume so because it's really quick we want it to be really quick or else the bugs will kill you before the thing's even done so and then hide and broadcast kill bugs which we will get to that we just have to upload the bugs uh from the sprite library so yeah another one where we're gonna work on next the thor if we have anything else to do yes we do so we might i'm gonna do this real quick so when the green flag is clicked it'll go forever if then the it i mean like if the hp is you know what i mean if the hp is like less than zero then it will um or equal to zero it will die so hp hp hp and then broadcast you lose so yeah broadcast you lose we also have some other things to code and you lose so and then when i receive you lose then it will switch costumes of thor 12 which is him going yar whatever that thing is like bending backwards is this costume this one your yard so yeah nice we are actually not done with the thor quite yet we still have one more thing but we will not do that quite yet because we have to do the dragon so the dragon should be great so yeah um we're gonna work on the dragon then we're gonna work on the a bug so i'm gonna move that right there i'm actually we're gonna do the rocks rocks are like the easiest thing you've ever seen in your life so it's when the green flag is clicked i'll go to i have a precise chord in it but i i don't want it to be that hard i probably like i'll say here or here here uh okay whatever that position is 96. negative 96 and negative 58 then go to back layer really easy simple so yeah uh you probably can already see that but you know it was easy to even do so yeah now we're going to work on dragon walking i'm so zoomed in now uh dragon walking we did the lightning pretty sure we did lightning we did the lightning and we have the dragon walking so when the when the green flag wow always too small when i want it big so when the green flag is clicked i'll go to i'm gonna make it a precise coordinate because i want it not to be that cheap okay so that's already negative 38 but i just already and then i gotta make a variable dragon hp because dragons have hp too you know well if they're actually real i don't know if dragons are real um it'll go forever five thousand you can make it like ten thousand twenty thousand if you really wanna challenge so that'd be nice if someone actually made like ten thousand or something that'd be a really great challenge i'll play that so when the green flag is clicked it'll go forever wait five seconds so this is where you make the dragon move and then it'll move five negative five steps because he's the wrong way right now so yeah so so yeah he's going backward so it's like this he's every five seconds he moves a little bit he just moves some steps so as you can see look looks like he's smoothing he's not moving quite yet but he's going to move in a few seconds he's moving see look he just moved so nice and then you can use three no there's not any bugs yet so yeah so we basically got the whole game coded not the whole game but like part of the game it's already looking pretty great in my opinion it's been 22 minutes actually so there might be a part two for this so bear with me if this is becomes a 40 minute video just bear with me uh winter i just donated the trees in the background we don't need those uh byebye and um yeah we can finish this bear with me if it's a 40 minute video watch it tomorrow if you want to let you watch videos for 40 minutes so yeah um we're going to work on the ladybug because no we haven't finished the dragon yet i just noticed that uh so when i receive attack dragon will change dragon hp by 100 so that's like the axe attack like where he runs up and goes the hammer so yeah and then when the green flag is clicked you'll go forever it will if then there's if then if then or dragon hp is less then okay i'll explain it later so if the dragon hp is less than zero or equal to zero then it will broadcast you win so we're gonna drag the dragon hp instead of hp for the thor cause thor is different from the dragon uh now broadcast you win you win because you killed the dragon and you need to if then if then touching the hammer which is the hammer sprite because when you throw the hammer hits him if then touching hammer then change dragon hp by 50. the reason why i made by the dragon the hammer weaker than the other one is because 50 is because uh i mean like the dr the hammer has a longer like a more faster swing i don't know like more spamble than the other one so if then touching rocks then you lose choose so yeah broadcast you lose because you lost and then um now we're gonna work on the bug yeah we can also upload the sun real quick um just extra decor you know who doesn't want some extra decoration so yeah i'm going to move the dragon hp on this side because dragon hp is on that side and then i'm going to make it like around here that should be green enough extra decor never hurt so yeah um we're gonna work on the ladybug next and then we're gonna work on the you and you lose spray so ladybug has a hunk of code so right now i'm out of time so yeah we got a lot done today um so i will be doing this in part two the bugs and everything else so see you guys next time oh yeah i forgot one thing i have to show you and also before you go please like share subscribe and comment i don't know comment anything like avenger common avenger so great see it's working look we got everything worked out but we don't have the bugs yet so but it's still i mean like it's still a game i mean like you can still kill the thing you know but you can still hit him afterwards so this is basically the game right now so i'm gonna lightning and show you the lightning so yeah um it's pretty nice in my opinion so anyways see you guys next time you
