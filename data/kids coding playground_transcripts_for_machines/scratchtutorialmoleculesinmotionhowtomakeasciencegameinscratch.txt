welcome back guys it's kids coding playground here and today we're back for another video on scratch and today we're making um a sort of scientific um molecule game called molecules in motion and um it's kind of like science because if you didn't learn this at school yet um let's just start it you start at one molecule you can add molecules it's kind of a scientific science if you're like a teacher oh you can use this material um well not really but like still you know uh you can start at 10. this is one it's really cold and i know there's a fire under it just ignore that and this is like when it's really cold the wall kills move slower like in real life if you're colder you'll move slower um obviously and if it gets hotter it'll get quicker and yeah so uh it can go really really slow like just really really slow this is like winter no this is like fall maybe no this is like fall and then this is like spring and this is summer so it's like um the molecules moving this is probably when you're boiling something like if you're boiling water or like um uh i don't know uh vegetables whatever then the molecules in the water will move and yeah so it's a kind of scientific material you can keep on adding molecules and they range in colors so there's plenty of colors you could choose from so uh yeah anyways let's get started so hey what's up guys i'm back and i just deleted the scratch cat that's it okay yeah you get the point you always have to delete the scratch cat unless if you're making something that concludes the scratch cap and this um we are not so anyways let's just um upload the things from my backpack you can come to my project and export them or you can download them in the google drive and my user's gumball098 so you can come in and um export my sprites so that you can make it for yourself and uh or you can just download it from the google drive and yeah let's just put this in so we got fire this is actually the one from the spring cookout um game not game animation uh so yeah you can get that and this is a little molecule um faster and stuff to make the molecules quicker and this is the molecule itself so the molecule itself is just easy to draw just a circle and then the color for this it doesn't matter what color but you use the swap function over here i'm going to try to draw one on my own just delete this real quick let's draw one of my own let's just oh i should do blue for a swap and then go for like red it's a very interesting color so yeah you basically hold shift and around this size i hope possibly oh maybe a little bit smaller but you get the point guys uh maybe a little bit smaller so yeah you can create customize your own molecules and i hope they all look really good so and next thing i have to draw on this list well you already learned how to draw the fire in the spring cookout animation well it's really hard to draw this thing it's just my dad drew it and so yeah you can just go to my project and export everything so and we have the molecule thing the molecule machine molecular molecular machine so and it's just the same um a circle thing and just paint draw a rectangle or and just reshape it i think that's how you supposed to do it let me try to draw the thing so um so first start out it doesn't matter what color it is just make it a random color and enlarge the rectangle and i'm trying to draw it here and just reshape the sides to make it sort of not a rectangle as you can see um that's actually turning out pretty well it's like one of those index cards or pudding pudding more like pudding so yeah click it and drag it out so yeah it's like make it look like jello maybe so the sides are like kind of circles not really circles like what is those like smooth smooth sides like like a id or something index card and then there we got that and we make the little table under it just brown color and regular fill and drag that thing back and possibly up the saturation a little bit and change this to possibly five as you can see we're putting that in here drag it behind it we're going to use the backwards thing back and we make the two little things other two little things that hold up the table so so we might have to put this thing back in front because i think it looks better originally so yeah you get the point guys and you make the little blue uh uh the little blue rectangles in the back little blue things that hold up it there's also a black line that like you know the back of a table the end of a table has that little thing so why not make it full black you have black there we go and we just extended a little bit blue so the little blue little thing it doesn't matter what color you put it at but the original project was blue so why not make it straight and then tilt it sideways and then tilt done and you just duplicate it make a second one so and you make it go back ctrl c ctrl v flip horizontal and put it on the other side make it back to there we got it our table but i think the original one looks better than this one honestly so let's just delete this and use the original one so remember you can export these sprites in our um my project number09a check out my profile um yeah now let's start coding so the first thing we actually lc'd is um a stop and a button uh adding button and another button this button i think we have to make it a little bit smaller i think it's 50. and we put it around here okay yeah around here and then we put a little edition thing on it so we can oh yeah where's this thing and then we just put shift and we make a line oh and we make another line there we have it we have the uh button the button to add the molecules and now we have to make the stop button so let's just delete this and get a new button and change this thing to here and right we have to change the thing wait a second and put it on black no white white white yes we've got white and then we write stop and yeah we have that we can let's put it in the middle and then yeah we have it and we might actually make the stop larger because it's maybe too small that's around the size and delete this and we're also going to make this 50 and move it somewhere reasonable so here there we have it we have our whole setup done finished and now oh yeah with the backdrop and we have the blue sky too and then finally we start working at on the fire so in my original one we have a fire sound where's the fire sound yeah here so yeah just a fire crackling um and you just have to make it louder so this should be around the good one and you can customize that sound and it'll sound pretty good you know and go forever and make play sound fire until done and then also when green flag is clicked i'll go to x0 negative 155 because i uploaded my backpack doesn't matter where you put it just put it somewhere reasonable and then we have a forever next costume and a weight 0.2 for a little weight you know it's better to have a little weight yeah so make it different costumes so look you see fire's moving is making sound and now we're done with that now we just have to work on the molecule generator which should be really simple when green flag is pressed just go to a position and then the molecule itself has the most code in this whole entire script and we might have to use some code that um you might have not used before some operators and i i myself haven't used some of these operators before so let's dive right in so when the green flag is clipped it will clear all the graphic effects because you know um it's just a regular color because you know it always changes color whenever you add a molecule so you want to do a clear graphic effect and set temperature to 20. so this is really tricky you got to make a variable called temp butcher this is how you spell it 10 pair yeah i'm right okay there's the red squiggly line and then for all sprites and then okay and then you see it over here you double click it and you double click it again and then you right click it and you do change slider range so i'm just going to do that again for you i actually want to do that again because so you you know when you make a variable it's always like that double click it double click it right click change slider range and then the minimum you can make 10 or 5 or 1 or whatever and make the maximum 200 or you can do 2 000 but your choice and then okay so you can now increase it and decrease it and the lowest is 10. so now and then you use when the clear graphic effects and you set temperature set temperature to 20 and then you create clone of myself and then you'll hide so actually i had a variable this whole entire time called speed because i've done this project before and i actually got it from the old project so i have a variable called speed and i will delete it and show you how to make it and do not make it yet because it's only for the sprite only so i'll show you in a moment once we get to that point and then when i start as a clone it'll go to x00 and then it will and then no point in direction um pick random so it'll like range so so when it starts they'll either bounce up on the left side or the right side so that's why we have negative 89 to 89 yeah so and it will bounce either left or right left or right left or right and then we have go to the front layer and then it will set color effect where's the set i barely use the set color effect uh um block because i always use the chain color effect so pick random 0 to 300 and it will show we also have a forever loop next and this is where it gets really tricky you add a set speed variable so let's make a let's just delete this variable right now delete and then make a new variable speed spent speed and then for this sprite only i'm using clone so that's why we only make it for this sprite only so okay and we have the set speed to temperature divided by 10. let's get the divide just close this real quick and then next we have to do if then um that you have you need a so you have this is the trickiest part of this whole entire place so first you need one of these blocks and then you put x position right in front of it and then oh at least i can never ride is that wrong you keep the exposition though and then you use abs and your abs means absolute value so if there's negative 100 what's the absolute value 100 so abs of x position is greater than 150. so put that in so the reason why you need 150 is because actually varies of how big your box is so if your box was bigger that means you need a maybe a larger number or a smaller number if your box was smaller so and the reason of this is because if you use a line and you put it so i'm gonna paint a line maybe like 10 thickness um and you put a line well shift it and then i'm going to get a line shift oh straight so and you move this to the molecule thing so side what is the position of the line negative 166. so that means you got a minus around 10 because of the um yeah you have to minus around 10 on both sides which is 169 the other side is negative 160 something so and that's why you minus 10 for the sides and so i'm going to delete the line sprite that's why you use absolute uh i that's how you use 150 so i'm going to delete this line sprite real quick go back to the molecule and let's keep let's continue and you need inside that you need a point in direction you need to multiply you need one direction negative one direction because it'll turn it negative i'll turn it to the opposite side because if it was this side it would go this side and it goes this side yeah so it'll point in direction negative one times direction because if you had 90 then it'll go negative 90. so it will just move around the molecule generator and then you have another if then statement if then um so it's the same thing as this except a hundred and and this is x y position so this is y position and then you have a hundred so abs of y position is greater than 100 and then you have to point in direction 180 minus direction minus direction and then so small numbers are up and big numbers are down so if you had the point in direction that means you had to go up so because look zero right and then you go back down that's 180 so you have that in 180 minus direction so it's something random and you have the one like up here it'll go back down and then if it's down it will go up so that's the um basically what this means oh yeah and it's a hundred because you have to draw a line and i'll show you this you need a ten and then you move it up 112 so minus 10 so it's 102. so about that uh size and look there's 114 so you minus the 10 and you'll make it to negative 110. now a hundred so yeah so that's that's the meaning of the molecule and now you go to the molecule and you'll give a little bit code left and it's move speed steps because i'll move the amount of the temperature so that means yeah because of this if it's higher it will move quicker and if it's lower it'll move slower so and then when i receive delete oh yeah yeah we have to finish something before we do that i literally forgot and then we haven't finished this when this sprite is clicked create clone of molecule that's all you have to do for this because you have to create a clone of molecule because you're creating another of these molecules so the button three and you have when this sprite is clicked and button three is the stop button so when this sprite is clicked it will broadcast delete all molecules and that's what leads back to that broadcast delete all molecules and we have that and go over here and when i receive delete all molecules if i'm not mistaken it will delete this clone and that is the game so yeah here's a minimize to rev up under code so here we go fire sound check uh molecule temperature slower quicker slower slower and we have another one another one another one another one another one another one so you can just spam this and it's like if it's 61 it goes at this pace but it feels like 200 would be whirring all over the place but if it was like 10 let's click the stop button there all the volunteers then you add one and it's a peaceful boy 200 yeah and you know there we have it so like you could like play around with this uh molecule uh thing and accelerator so you can like get a bunch of molecules and have some fun so yeah that's basically what this game is about it's scientific it's science and please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below other games you want to see on our channel so that we can make it for you guys so anyways um oh yeah one more thing uh so if you guys comment like really hard things i cannot do it like what if you like said a scrolling cloud platformer a maze whatever and i i cannot do that honestly so maybe one of you guys can do that and anyways um school is starting so we might post less videos but at least we'll try to post once every week or two weeks so anyway anyways please like share subscribe and comment down um ideas below so that we can make your games into reality see you guys next time
