welcome back guys it's kids coding playground here today we're back for another video called dress the turkey we are making a thanksgiving themed game where the player can dress up the turkey dress the turkey we'll be learning these following concepts in scratch keys to control the sprite broadcast messages spread directions and when the sprite is clipped so i'm gonna go demo the game so let's go full screen so there's music in this game so i'm gonna demo the game so i play some music i don't know what this music is i just chose it randomly uh so there's a glasses a hat and a scarf and then these are like a neck scarf so you can change the glasses and when you click on this it'll turn into the other costumes for glasses in the other costume same as the hat and the car so you just have to you can even choose any scarf you want and then you can put it on the turkey and you can choose any hat you want you can also use the hat use any hat you want the glasses you can also change the glasses you can move the turkey around so as you could see a while ago when it's moving moving it doesn't look at you but when it when you stop clicking it looks at you and it'll stop but then when it's moving it it really does like a movement and i'm gonna put it and all the costumes and everything follow you so you can run here and then it will follow you and go wherever it is and then you can also do that you can change it up a little bit a little bit so that's basically what this game is so so i just started a new project here um so yeah if you have any questions you can join our studio ask for a request and we'll invite you to curator i'm normally the one who invites people to curator so yeah and we can also um you can also post any projects you want unless if it's inappropriate so anyways please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below for what else content you want so let's get started so first you're going to name it name the project dress the turkey we're dressing the turkey and i do have this in my backpack and you can actually download our turkey and think but you can also make your own turkey so as you can see um right here rooster this is exactly the same thing as a turkey but i just retextured it a little bit i added another gobble to it and i took out the top i ungrouped it and then i took out this on top and then i just changed some colors so you gotta do this for all the all of them so um so i can just make it make this like a this color and i can just make like this this color and that's basically what this is and you also change this color and that's basically what is you know i also drew an extra gobble here because turkeys have two gobbles i think and you can just re raise texture a circle so you just retexture a circle that like that and um you gotta do it for all of them so you can just duplicate it for all of them oh so sorry about that guys that's just the doorbell some dude was just stringing on your door now and uh you can retexture this gobbler to make it a little bit different and you can just duplicate two gobblers so see i'm trying to retexture right here so i'm just retexturing the sides to make it more even and then you can also duplicate this doppler to make two so ctrl c ctrl v and you can just turn it around click the mouse turn it around a little bit and do this so this one looks a little bit worse than my other one so and you also have to rename it to turkey so let's go yeah like that that's like a gobble and rooster b you gotta do it for russia b and c and c you gotta change it up a little bit because he's looking at you so um yeah i'm gonna delete the rooster so i also have some other things in my backpack uh as the the button but we will get to that maybe later so it's just the scarf the next button for the scarf the hat and the um glasses just to duplicate it and change it up so i'm going to show you how to draw the buttons so it's just a circle and then a um and then so we have a circle choose a color and put no outfield so no outline so uh this is the circle click shift to make a perfect circle and then center it and then you have to put a square and make it a darker color you want to make a darker square and also you can duplicate that and there's a trick you can cut half of it by clicking the reshape tool and then clicking the backup space and select the corner and then change it up a little bit and drag this over to make one of these um scarf buttons and the rest is easy just put a text called scarf on top choose a scarf and use any font you want but i use i think i use handwriting so handwriting so yeah you can also do that it's really easy that's how you make a button so we can duplicate all the buttons so let's do it right now so make three and then this one i'm going to change the costume so when i had my thing i the outer one was a lighter red so right here and the other one inside was a darker red so that's basically how i made the emoji i mean the square and then oh my god this and over there that's basically how you do it and you just drag the scarf pointer and then change the color there it's basically how you do it it's basically how you make a butt so you got to make the hat and glasses so hat center this and then we can this one was the other one and this one was the glasses so the glasses was a green so turn up turn down the saturation like that and then you can make the that thing then also turn up the center saturation and then you can make so um i'm gonna change the color just the scarf glasses and then i'm gonna drag that inside but first i'm gonna change the color to darker green maybe higher saturation do it and then we can also put the pointer the glasses inside center it correctly and there we're done with the glasses button and we can change the glasses choice and then minus the three and then the hat choice and minus the two so that's for these two things so and you also need the hat the scarf and the uh glasses so these are all the things that you have to decorate the turkey with so i'm gonna work on the turkey right now and um let's check this out and let's put these somewhere so let's put these somewhere else that's not touching the turkey so um let's start on the turkey so when the green flag is clicked it will oh yeah we can also do the backdrops right now so i use jungle i'm not sure if our turkeys live in the jungle but you know why not so when the green flag is clicked go to back layer and forever it will if then if then the key left arrows clicked because we can make a move then point in direction negative 90. so we got to set the rotation down left right it's already on so point in direction 90. so negative 90 and then move 10 steps broadcast which costume and wait and also yeah right arrow if then the right arrow is pressed we'll point in direction 90. so i forgot to add a weight 0.1 seconds over here so or second because it's only one in the point direction 90 move 10 steps broadcast switch costume and weight and also wait 0.1 seconds so we're going to work on the scarf but we're not done with the turkey yet so we are going to work on the scarf in this part so the green flag is clicked it'll go forever and then if then it's not touching any heat press so not key and you pressed because when you're not holding a key down then it will look at you like he's saying bro or something so he's basically looking at you so switch costume to rooster c see this is rooster c rooster b rooster a so when the green flat i mean when when i receive switch costume and you need if then else if then else if the costume number equals one so costume number equals one so the costume number um thing is right here hustler number equals one so this is costume number one rooster a so costume number equals one i'll switch costume to rooster b because it's either one or the other because he's moving else it's rooster a so i'm gonna work on the scarf in this part so i'm gonna show you if it works or not because it probably does work because i coded it so so uh as you can see i'm moving him he's moving he's putting the two costumes swapping from those two costumes and the third costume is the one where he's looking at you so i'm not clicking any keys right now so it's like this so yeah and i'm gonna work on the scarf because um this part i think we're gonna do the scarf and uh and i think that's gonna be it for this part so when the green flag is it clicked i'll switch costume to scarf a and go to x 174 so i do have coordinates but this i just dragged it somewhere random so i wouldn't touch the turkey so i already have where it should go 174 why 110 go into front layer so always make sure it's on the front layer and then when i receive switch costume next costume so i was just kidding about this uhhuh i was actually wrong so the scarf choice and the scarf so i'm going to finish coating up this scarf so when the sprite is clicked you need it if then else if then else the direction of the turkey so this is the tricky block direction of the turkey is more than zero then it'll point in direction 90 and glide one second to to um you need a plus so glide one second to x position i'll describe all this later and i'll show you what it means exposition where's the exposition of turkey right here so the other turkey block of turkey exposition is already there and then the y y position and inside here you have to write 30 so that's a coordinate so that's for that and then pointing direction negative 90 right here and it'll glide one second to x position minus minus 30 and y position so feel free to pause the video whenever you need it and also you need it forever so i'm gonna change the rotation style to left right so right here and i'm gonna show you what this means so um as you can see i'm my turkey is walking and i'm pointing to the left side because i walk to the left side and then when i click on it it'll be on the left side so this is the left side code this is the left side code event and this is the right side code and then as you can see if i'm on the right side it will move to the right side and then if i'm pointing this way i'll move like this so that's basically what it is so i'm going to show you guys what i mean so i'm going to take out that block put this on top and as you can see the x position of turkey if you do not have that it will glide to knot on its neck because you want it to be on its neck because it's a scarf so that is why you need the plus 30 for the side so that's basically why you need it and see look it's not on it's on the tail who wears a scarf on a tail exactly if you wear the neck so that's why you need a plus 30 for the x because plus 30 for the x will move around there so that's a coordinate so yeah so as you can see it doesn't work because i have to do negative 30 because it's on the left side and left side is always negative so yeah so let's do this see and it doesn't work if you have positive 30. so i'm gonna um delete this script and then we're gonna keep on working so in the forever you need a if then else if then else the the direction of the turkey so just duplicate this the direction of the turkey is greater than zero then it'll point in direction 90 which is the right side um because 360 is a full circle full circle i think so it's pointing to the right side so set x and we'll set x to um you need minus so set x to uh x position plus let's say you set x to x position plus 30 mn not minus i meant plus a uh x position plus 30. so that's basically how you do it and then you can just duplicate this and do it on the right side so point in direction negative 90 and then instead it's minus so we have it right here duplicate to minus x position of turkey and then it'll set y to y position of turkey so that's how you code the scarf so i'm i'm gonna post second part tomorrow so so i'm gonna do scarf choice in this part too to make it really quick so when this sprite is clicked it'll broadcast scarf choice and then when the green flag is clicked it will go to a coordinate i have already written down so go to x 155 y negative 139 so it's around the same spot but i already have it like that so and then when i receive when the scarf receives the message when i receive the message i'll go next costume so i'm gonna show you guys this project right now so i'm gonna show you the game so turkey walking frequently scarf changing so scarf changing click scarf change so that's basically how this game works right now because i don't have the glasses and the hat right now so yeah so on your own you can go you guys can try the cat and the glasses on your own it's a little bit different so it's pretty similar but just a little bit different and a number two could be going out tomorrow so please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below for what else content you want see you guys
