thank you tell us what you think about our new intro and please comment your thoughts down below and also please check out our Easter game from last year which you can find in the video description and we hope you enjoyed that tutorial as well welcome back guys it's kids home playground here and today we're back with another video at scratch today we'll be making the Easter themed game because it's Easter Sunday today and we have our Easter game over here so there's some music playing and there's this rabbit find where I hide the three eggs so here there's gonna be an egg here there's gonna be an egg and here is going to be an egg so basically we're supposed to find or all three of the eggs are um where the rabbit has hidden them so there's one over here there's one over here and there's one over here so good job you found all three eggs so it's basically a memorization type game so then you can like find all the eggs and win so that's basically the game that we're working on today and it involves lists so of uh there has been some questions on Sprites on the usage of our projects uh so you can just come into my project I'll be sharing this project Easter egg hunt 2023 go to my profile gumballs098 and then you can open your backpack like as so and drag the Sprites in so then you can use them on your own and also uh there has been a lot of requests for Google access for our Google Drive um and you should be using your personal account not your school account so we don't get all these requests but um there is a video on Google Drive and how to use it so we'll be linking that in the description so then you can also use the Google drive as well as you can also drag the Sprites so let's get started so I'm gonna get my Sprites here we only have two Sprites to this project which is the hair the hair and we also have no scratch cat goodbye and we also have the eggs so we have our two um Sprite situated and after that we have our backdrop which is actually going to be the Garden Rock this one so this is the thing that we used but we actually covered up the thing so it wouldn't cover up the rock so then it wouldn't be on the the eggs won't be on the grass so basically we just take a section of that and then we just like uh paste that control C control V and then just just try to cover up the rock as good as we can so then young the eggs will be on the rock for visual qualities and maybe take a snippet from the flower and we can just cover up the rock a little bit over there for visual quality so that's basically what we did to cover up the Garden Rock so when during the egg positionings during the egg positionings the egg was actually not on the same elevation as the rabbit so it didn't have the same so you would want to control C control V the hair to the egg and then try to align them as best as possible to um make it the best quality you can so the best alignment possible and then the egg does not have to be in the center it's just off to the side a little bit so now so it's basically down a little bit from the um Center so now let's get coding so first let's make our variables so for our rabbits we have an index for our rabbit and then this is for this Sprite only so we have that and now we also have egg found how much eggs you have found for all Sprites and then as well as rabbit finish talking oh just hold it right now talking so basically we need this rabbit finished talking variable so then um there's no cheating in the game because the rabbit will be going to each of the places where he's placing the egg so the rabbit finish talking is basically going to be so you can't click on that rabbit when he places the eggs so then you cannot cheat so let's get coding so I have the green flag is clicked when the green flag is clicked it will go to x I have coordinates so negative 190 y 120. and it'll switch costume to the First costume which is hair a which is the sitting position like this and after that we need a list so we make a list over here and then we name it egg X location so this is what basically this decides where the egg will be located on the x coordinate plane so we have the egg X location so first it'll delete all of X location so then there won't be any extra like places where the eggs could be and then we'll also need an egg Y location like why so and also delete all of egg y locations so it's our two lists over here and basically it will do add thing so it'll add pick random negative 200 to negative 90 to X location so I'll explain this after when I'm done so we'll do this again and instead instead of pick random negative 200 negative 90 will be negative 90 to 70. and then for this one we will have 70 to 200. so basically this is determining the three zones so there's basically three zones to this map and that's where the eggs are going to be placed in either of these three zones so it the reason we did this is because the rabbit could select the same spot and not move at all and then say this is the second egg where it is and they're both in the same spot and it can get people very confused as they have only found two eggs not three so that's basically why we need the zones to separate the eggs so it's actually not confusing so they're like not right not next to each other so for y it's going to be different so since we already separated that X we need to repeat three uh and it'll add to use a ad it'll pick random negative 120 260 and this is the egg Y location the egg Y location does not need three zones either because it would be it doesn't need three sets because it's only separated by the X so now we have say uh find find where I hide the three eggs remember the location find where I hide the three eggs remember the location for three seconds or more if you want and then it'll broadcast start game start okay so let's move on to this part so when I receive start game um those set egg found to zero because you have not found any eggs yet and then it'll go forever um and say if then if then the egg found is equal to three so operator equals egg found is equal to three um so if egg found is equal to three it will say good job good job you found who found all three eggs okay for three seconds so we have that and then it'll stop all so that's basically after when you win and after that we'll have uh when uh another start game so when I receive start game it will set rabbit top finish talking to n so basically the rabbit's not finished talking yet so you cannot cheat and we'll set the index to one and then after that it will repeat three times and it'll broadcast animate so it will go to three different spots for the X so repeat three times broadcast animate so show is basically running and to place each egg and then you'll Glide one second to where the list determines so Glide one oopsies collide one second to X so we need to go back to our list place over here and say item uh index item index of X location so it already determines where the x of Y locations are so basically this is telling them to go to the places I'll show you the list over here so we have this so this already determines where all the lists are and this only determines where the X and Y should be located and you see so now we're going to go back to here and then we're gonna have item of egg Y location and then so item index of egg Y location to go to the Y position of the Y location so and now we're gonna say here so I'm just going to say here for one second and then it would change index by one so basically going through a number counting type of thing so the first one go to the second one and then now under this you'll go switch costume to Hair A and it'll go to go to where it was originally at negative 190 y120 and then after that it'll say now tell me where I hid the eggs by clicking on oopsies so much typos the screen now tell me where I hit the X by clicking on the screen all right so now it's gonna be three seconds and then after that it will set set rabbit finish talking to Y so this is when it's done talking and then you can actually interact with the game so now we have over here when I receive animate so when it starts and this animation it's blocking thing it'll repeat four times four times and it'll switch costume to hair B and then wait 0.1 seconds and then switch costume to hair see and then wait 0.1 seconds now for that you'll switch costume back to Hair A basically the whole entire animation sequence thing uh I'm trying to put up these as best I can so basically this is all the code oh no basically this is all the code for the um hair determining where the list is and what placing the eggs so this is basically so I'm gonna play the game for you oh shama remove the list real quick and then so variables kind of blocking but it's saying something and after that you're going to where the eggs are and it'll go to where they are so basically it goes here here and here so you click on these and that will be uh where the eggs are gonna be so uh we're finished with the egg uh here so feel free to pause over here and now we're going to move on to the eggs so when the green flag is clicked it will hide and then when I receive start game it will set index so over here set index oh yeah we need an index because that one's for the hair so we actually have to write do another index do not skip this part for this Sprite only for the eggs as well and then you'll set the index to one as well as repeat when you repeat over here repeat length so length length of egg X location so there's three so it'll repeat that and then it'll create clone of myself you know also change the index by one and now over here uh we're gonna work on the when I started the clock so when I start as a cloud so when I started to close when I start as a clone it will go to X um item index so where is that item index of X location and then item index of egg Y location and then after that it will set ghost effect so basically it'll be hiding it but it's actually not hidden set ghost effect to 100. and then after that it'll show and then you'll wait until there's a big hunk wait until don't wait until you need two add operators so we did an end over here and then end up here so you did wait until um it's touching not spoiler and mouse is down so you click on it and your mouse is touching it and you need an equal side over here and rabbit finished talking is equal to Y so this is until you can carry you can get the eggs so basically you wait until it's touching the mouse pointer the mouse is down it's click on the thing and the rabbit is finished talking after that it will change the egg found by one and then set goes to effect to zero so you can see where see you got the egg so say ghost effect zero and then say you got it you got it over here for one second and then we'll also wait one second as well as it'll now delete this club so now we have the egg situation done so trying to get a big view of this so feel free to pause oops feel free to pause over here and copy down the code and now we're moving on to the backdrop so when the creative flag is clicked it's very straightforward um we're gonna pick a sound for this one I used eggs because it really matched the theme because the tags and you'll set volume set volume to 25 percent and forever it will place out eggs until done so that's basically the whole entire game we have over here except we have to hide the variables so uh for the hair you hide index we hide rabbit finish talking the egg we hide index we'll keep egg found and we'll move it up here so basically that's the game and so I'll demo it so let's say fine when I hide the three eggs from the location and then you'll stay here and hit it like over here and then hit a head over here so that's basically where the three eggs are so so I think there's one over here I'm not sure it might be one over here and over here now here okay so yeah so I found all three eggs and that's basically a whole game so everything is in order so please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below what else games and you might uh end up on our channel one day we might make your project and uh comment in the comment section below if you celebrate Easter and uh if you went egg hunting or any of those really fun activities on Easter so anyway have a great Easter
