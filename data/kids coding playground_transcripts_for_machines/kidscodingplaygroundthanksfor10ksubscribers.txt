so welcome back guys to kids coding playground here and today we'll be doing a 10k subscriber special so right now we're at 10.1 k subs um we reached 10k subs about like a week ago so thank you all for subscribing to our channel and helping us reach 10 000 subscribers the last time we made a special video like this was when we hit 5 000 subscribers which was like about 11 months ago so and almost a year we grew 5 000 subscribers so thank you guys all for subscribing and if you're not subscribed please subscribe to us and then we can reach your next goal which is 15 000 subscribers okay so in this video we'll be doing three different things we'll be doing the q a we'll be doing a project review and then we'll be also doing a channel announcement so right now let's start out with the project review so we have a project here that we found in our studio called potion of platformer so let's play it and see what it's all about pretty sure it's just going to be just like a generic platformer but they have some cool trail effect as you can see that adds some points to it also you have the friction so pretty cool and you have spikes like any platform would have okay lava lava yeah we have lava here and they have the wall jump wall jump yeah mechanics yeah i can't even get that of hardship i don't even know how i can't get past here okay there you go maybe it's because there's two overlapping things right there so maybe if they didn't have that it'd be easier to wall jump oh a little closer there you go we got it so yeah try to get me getting past this lava i don't even know how you can do this i don't know how it's possible yeah how is this even possible it is maybe you have to go run and jump let's try it is possible you still don't do it that's right not stopping until i beat the game i'm not gonna beat it oh yeah i don't even know how this is even possible how'd they even get past this one oh there you go yeah yeah there you go okay that was a bit hard yeah so just like this level yeah so pretty much regular platformer just a normal platformer pretty cool let's give it a favorite right here we have another platformer game i'm gonna try to find less platformer games most of the projects in our studio are actually platformers so let's just see let me turn on the volume a little bit okay right here yeah it's just like a jack that's the cool trail i don't know how you play i think it's just like a uh you have to get out of the black box yeah it's kind of hard to see though maybe in the snowflakes are pretty cool yeah yeah the timer and lot oh you didn't get in there yeah so maybe make it a little bit easier to see this would be a better project much better project if you could see yeah so that's pretty much it i guess those are all the levels so overall pretty good project so we right here right here we have a river rafting game this is kind of like a dodge game you know how like you try to dodge blocks like it's kind of like that so at least it's not a platformer so we don't have to look at reviewing the same type of game yeah so like you just try to avoid the rocks and you're inside the raft or the kayak yeah pretty cool so this is a really good beginners game to do so if you're a beginner on scratch we actually have a project on our channel called like block dodge or something and you can dodge the blocks or something so it's kind of similar to this so good job to this person right here we have a clicker game called monster click so i already played it a little bit so basically you just like it's pretty cool how they have that little sliding bar on the side so pretty unique so what you do is click on the monster you take it out when it goes to zero health and you get money for each kill yeah and then you can buy upgrades but yeah so they said like auto is like 100 or something like that so um yeah pretty simple click game but it's pretty cool like you could use an autofocus for this game yeah i like the little slash effect i like it it's uh definitely a more unique clicker game than the other games for our final game right here we have a soccer game so we played it it's actually really cool i like the physics the gameplay is pretty good so i'm gonna play it two player my brother is going to be one of them so press space okay so i'll be wasting so i'm blue and you're yellow so like you can kick the ball look it kind of spins that actually looks cool like the uh the ball physics looks cool so let me try scoring a goal and see what happens oh yeah and and the good thing is that like you can't score goal from the side or anything yeah see oh that's actually really cool this is a really good project very unreal it was really good nice maybe maybe you could uh add like an actual soccer player instead of like two balls or something but pretty good let's give it a favorite okay so now let's hop into our next segment which is uh q a so let's get into these questions okay our first question in this q a segment is from a viewer from a channel named irvin aravindjay and they asked us do you play roblox um maybe i played roblox maybe when i was younger three four years ago like uh yeah maybe three four years ago yeah how about you yeah yeah yeah around three years ago we i deleted it though a long time ago but yeah i used to play roblox my favorite game on roblox back then was this game called wait wait lifting simulator three or three yeah i was like grinding that game with like an auto clicker and like destroying everyone it was so fun back then but no i don't really play roblox anymore our next comment uh slash question comes from a person named bina tawat okay sorry if i mispronounced that but okay so anyways they said how did you find scratch and how did you learn it so we found scratch maybe i found it five five years ago five years ago five years ago so december 20th december something yeah just some it was just five years ago so five years ago we found out there's a tech fair and then my dad told me to sign up for the tech fair and then they're like oh you maybe you should try scratch for your tech fair project or something so we use scratch and i made an animation so we made the animation sadly we didn't win or anything but that's how i found out what scratch was uh from that uh from the tech fair so back then it was like in 2.0 yeah so yeah it was a really long time ago when i found out scratch was my first project it was an animation so that was the first project and i got into learning it uh from myself on youtube watching other people's tutorials and my dad taught me some scratch coding as well when i was younger our next question comes from a person named jaden and they're asking us for a loyal subscriber shout out okay we'll give that at the end when we will give our like our channel announcement and all that stuff yeah we will give uh be sure to give a loyal subscriber shout out after that okay so now let's go on to our next comment uh what is your age so i think it's from one to like 100 yeah yeah yeah okay i'll give you a hint it's for either from one to 100 years old yeah that's all i got to say okay so our next uh comment comes from a person named james johnson and they're asking us how many subscribers have you lost in your youtube career okay so i'm actually going to show you guys like i'm going to record it later but i'll show you guys how many subscribers we lost in our total career i think we lost well over a thousand at least like almost 2 000 subscribers i'll get a recording of it later and put it in right here okay so our next question is from a random knob thank you for the tutorial my question to you your 10k sub special is what is your favorite scratch project you made of course it's rock blaster because rock blaster was the video i made and it got like half a million views so that was thank you for the views that was our like literally only successful video that has like more than 100k views oh yeah we have another one i think but that was our most successful video for sure so that's why you say rock buster right yep rock blaster for me i would probably say sorry scrolling platformer because i spent a really long time working on that project especially with the tile sets and all so that took a long time to make so i like that one the most okay now next question comes from uh our ravi p okay so ravi p says very helpful video i think he commented on a youtube video of ours and then he asked us also can my question in your q a is can i get a shout out please bro okay here's your shout out i guess we'll put your name onto the screen here you get a shout out thank you for being subscribed or at least watching our videos so yeah so thank you robbie p for being a part of our channel okay now we're into our last segment we're going to be doing our loyal subscriber shout outs and please join our discord server also the link is going to be the description below and also please follow our studio you can put your projects in there and sometimes we might review games from the studio if you put them in there in our new scratch review videos scratch project review videos and yeah please join our discord server we'll be doing other stuff in there too uh we'll think about what we should do in there and now let's get into our loyal subscriber shoutouts okay so here we have our loyal subscribers shout outs uh we didn't show the first like two pages because the first two pages are like all family and friend subscribers so we don't want to like show them so starting from here we have like all like all pretty much all real subscribers so these are one of the these are some of the oldest subscribers to our channel so thank you all for sticking around in our channels thank you all for subscribing still being subscribed to our channel and some of them obviously probably don't watch our channel anymore but we still really appreciate them for subscribing to our channel so thank you guys all for 10 000 subscribers you guys helped start it all okay we actually forgot one question from a person named adam smith for our q a we forgot to answer the question um sorry about that um so they asked how do you grow a channel so we really don't know honestly how to grow a channel we just made one video the rock blaster video and it got popular um so we just like kind of just like made a few like you just have to upload very frequently for like the first few months and i think that's how you grow a channel because we used to upload like three times a day back then in like june of 2020 when we just started our channel okay yeah and so after like the first few months of uploading like three times a day we started going to like three four times a week and now since we're back in school we don't have as much time to upload videos every day so now we're about like once or twice a week uploads sometimes we upload a little bit more we have a lot of time so yeah i guess that's how you grow a channel um we're actually not really sure ourselves we just made some videos and our channels somehow blew up so yeah unfortunately our channel is kind of like going down right now because we've already hit her peak which was like a thousand subscribers in a month and five thousand views a day but now it's not as much maybe like two thirty thousand views a day and we only get like maybe like 300 subscribers a month so it's like after a while after like a while your channel will start like going down a little bit we just have to be lucky with the youtube algorithm and hopefully they'll recommend it to a lot of people here we have some extra bed wars gameplay from the video like you know how we had some minecraft this gamepl you
