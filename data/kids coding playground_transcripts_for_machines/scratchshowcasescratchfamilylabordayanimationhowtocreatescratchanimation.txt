so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding playground today i'll be uh showcasing a animation we made this we spent many hours on this project it took us a very long time to make this because we had to like draw a lot of costumes and we had to like code a lot and the um animation is about two brothers spending their labor day weekend so in the comments below you can tell us what you did over labor day uh if you live in the u.s i know some other countries do not celebrate labor day but if you do not live in the u.s maybe you can tell us what you did over the weekend so without further ado we will start the animation so let's start the video i'm gonna go full screen so you guys can see it more clearly and yes there's music but it's very soft so at first the two brothers are at the bus stop thinking that they have school and labor day um and they're just like talking to each other you can read it uh where is everyone else they're confused why no one's at the bus stop um because it's labor day and they forgot it's labor day so they wait they wait for like 15 minutes and the bus still does not come as you can see uhoh looks like the bus isn't here and then after this they decide to walk to school they forgot that it wasn't labor day remember it was labor day we need to get to school before it gets too late as you can see we also did the type text um i think i taught you guys in the indie cat maze game it makes your animation much cooler so they walk off screen 30 minutes later they are at school so this scene they are finally at the school he says i hope we don't get detention because they are late so they go to the door they try to knock and ring on the doorbell but no one answers and he says the door is locked and his brother says let me try so the brother decides to knock on the door but there's nothing nothing happens the door won't budge the lights are all off and then they and then they finally remember today is labor day no school today and then they and then they head back home they walk back home after this and then the great brother says that all the time was wasted and then that's their mom okay their mom's just like working around the kitchen and their mom also forgets that labor day was today their mom also forgets in the description below i will also put all of these um cats and all these sprites so you guys can um download them and make your own animation and then their mom says if there's no school then they'll have a family clean up day first it tells them to clean the room then to mop the floors and finally if you guys do well then we will have a barbecue family barbecue yeah the two boys do not like that well that's just great sarcasm intensifies i just made it a little bit more funny and who doesn't work on labor day says the orange scratch cat our day was similar to their day we had to do a lot of chores today and their mom says the faster you get your chores done the faster you can play the grey cat does not like that either choking intensifies law it kind of made it a little more funnier i guess this is her dad cat the dad cat comes into the scene and their dad tells them to follow the instructions when their mom said and then the dad notices uh um thinks that i hope she doesn't tell me to do anything as you can see he's thinking yep now go through the chores telling the kids and then the mom remembers to tell the dad to do some stuff oh yeah i forgot dad please mow the lawn the grass is getting long and then the dad doesn't like it either and then the dad just walks off the scene to go mow the lawn and then while the dad is mowing the lawn the kids are cleaning the room a little cut scene as you can see there's bits of trash around and just to notice note this thing is not the takeout box we just like edited it it's a trash can in our thing so they just throw all the trash into the trash can i made a fish phone cause cats like to eat fish and at this part this cat throws the trash to this other brother and then they throw in the trash can and they say score now we are done cleaning our room and then they move they get out of the scene now and now that they mop the floor looks like our mom already left us the bucket so they go pick up the go to the bucket and pick up a broom i mean a mop and they begin to mock the floor as you can see they switch the costume i mean switch to another sprite and they mop okay we are finally done and then he says yeah at the same time and then finally their dad is happy that they finish all their chores so he's cooking a fish on the grill as you can see the food is almost ready and there's a side of cheese puffs right here and then they'll sit down or more like stand up and their mom comes to pick up the fish food is ready come in over and pick it up gets the fish and puts on the plate as you can see there's a plate right here the mom drops the fish right there the food looks great thanks mom and dad that orange cat says great food dad thanks mom what a great day at labor day and that's the end of the animation happy labor day okay so that's the animation the end thank you for watching please tell us what you did over the labor day in the comments down below like i said earlier and now i can show you some of the code inside so remember i said we had type text and there's actually three different cats so there's the cat with the mop the cats of the mob the cats with the book bags and then the cats with nothing on her and the mom and dad that's it and then we have a bunch of other sprites so the reason this took us so long so you have to like broadcast a lot of messages think of what to say think of a storyboard make them move around so it wasn't it was like i knew how to do it it's just that it's too tedious and then we had to like draw some of our own sprites and then we got some of these from online like this book bag and we had we had to edit it on the um scratch cat then we also have the mop we had to edit that onto the scratch cat and this plate we got from online these fish bone and all this stuff we got them online so overall this this was a pretty good animation i think and it was pretty long i think it was like five minutes took us a long time maybe like five hours um maybe even more since we had to um since we had to like draw all the sprites and clean up all the sprites because some of these were like jpgs to clean up the back background and if you wanna i said this earlier but if you want to um make your own animation and the link in the description below you can download all of these sprites like the all the cats the cat the book bad cat the mom dad and like the mob cats so yeah that pretty much concludes this video so thank you guys for watching don't forget
