welcome back guys it's kids coding playground here and today we're back for another video in scratch and today we'll be making a game called raging bulls and it's actually um a pretty cool game all the artwork is not copyrighted and is actually we got some of them from the internet but most of the artwork is drew drawn by my dad so yeah um let's demo the game my score is 130. you see there's fences here so um you see there's fences here and you have three lives in zero score high score is 130 and these fences change every so often to block your view to getting to the red cape and yeah you have all this stuff and you try to get as much score as you try not to lose your can if you lose your lives one to five noob uh less than 10 is a loser uh less than 20 is an average less than 50 is a pro and uh less than 100 of the hacker and 150 plus is a god so i'm an average okay okay i'm a noob okay anyways um let's get started on the project so let's make a new project so yeah uh you don't need the scratch cat and i have everything in my backpack so download the google drive script uh in the description below we have everything uh there and yeah you can just get everything we have in the google drive and yeah i'm just gonna upload all these sprites in and the fences are actually drawn by my dad and then we have this and we are done so the three so we have a bunch of fences we're gonna make the backdrop and everything so export you can export the files in in my project and click export and get the project uh um sprite so um yeah so i'm gonna put in the black around so there's a background i'm gonna use and it's this background so we have the whole setup finished remember if you can't go in the google access the google drive go into my project and then download and export the sprites or you can draw them on your own if you were creative so um in the backdrop i'm going to try to attempt drawing the backdrop so we got these flowers from the mother day card game not really a game a mother's day card and we got this kate from the mongos imposter sassy imposter sassy sexy stuff whatever uh um a mongoose animation and this farmer actually have a hand up here so i think we got this from google and um and so um we actually have a hand on top of this one because in the original google one there's um just you know a pitchfork in the farmer and it's just not good i'm just saying and then so i just put a hand on top so his hands and on top of the pitchfork so you can download the sprite export it inside your um uh whatever your project and yeah so we're pretty much set and we're i'm gonna try attempt drawing the fences and the backdrop so i'm gonna make the backdrop backdrop one so first thing we need is a green shade of so fully almost green because we have a little beach area reshape it to make it look like a beach area so yeah i'm trying right now so yeah this is the beach is a little bit big maybe oh yeah i'm gonna extend the other side yeah let's see so there you got it and the beach is uh fine i guess and then we just need that color and make a square uh yeah yeah copy the saturation color and stuff and we now we just have to make a square so yeah we just need this color make the square and you actually have to make it go back so it will be behind it and you will see this well actually i just misproportioned this thing so uh proportionate again yeah and then now i'm gonna get the flowers oh it's a little bit out just make it bigger yeah why not and then yeah i'm just gonna get some flowers you know flowers the mother day card uh if you if you made that project this would be a breeze for you because you can control c ctrl v oh yes and put it over there and you can just uh be creative with your flower amount and your um daisies and there's marigolds and everything and yeah you can just be creative put whatever you want it's really just creativity at this point so when you put it over here you need to group them so it's easier to move if you ungroup it the panels will be all messed up so yeah it's like a different sprites into one so yeah so yeah i advise you to group it so yeah you have to put flowers all around if you did the mother's game decent game this would be really easy for you or you could just export the backdrop for my project so yeah uh so now it's time to work on and make the bowl so this is the bowl and it's idle form when you're not sending anything out no bowls are coming out this is on its idle form and this is like uh when it goes out a new one comes in and then one more goes back so we actually need to um make the ball rotated to the right to make sure uh because it has to go up um and we're using moving steps and you know how moving steps is to the right you have to make it go up so we have to point in direction zero and um keep it to the right so then it'll move up steps while actually moving so yeah i'm gonna try to make the ball by copying it so it has a body and it's like a circle but you just have to reshape it a little bit it's like an oval the hooves are just a square just reshaped with yellow on the bottom and then the tail is just another circles shaped with a tiny little circle and the horns are i think they are circles with just reshaping yeah so that's basically what you need to know about the bowl i'm going to try to attempt to draw the bowl so uh it might not look as the original one look as good as the original one and it's just a circle with this brown color and just a reshape a really a nice reshape we'll do it so and you make and i'm making the whole body so that comes with the ears and everything else and the potato shaped body so this reshaping would do the job kind of looks like yoda and you're moving body everywhere to making um bull so i'm gonna try to make the [Laughter] foods and uh stuff like that you know just the same brown colors or some reshape so i'm trying to speed run through this so we can get to the coding part because it's already been eight minutes and 55 seconds so yeah we can hurry up a little bit yeah and you got who just changed them yellow color you get the point and if you don't want to draw it yourself just go to our project and export the files and feel free to skip this part if you do not want to draw it so yeah hoof yeah you can just duplicate the whos duplicate it to make a second hoove and then yeah i this one has a group and there we go there's a bull with his hooves and now you gotta make its horns the horns is just um this color some dark almost black color and it's dark just really dark brown you just change the color again so i'm going to show you the color of the bowl 6 26 42 and the horn is 777.24 and there you go uh make a circle just fine reshaping will do the job really fine reshaping a little bent middle there we go uh horn and then we just have to put this on ctrl v and then flip horizontal put on one side put this one on the other and make it go to the back so i don't think this looks originally the same but you know let's just delete that costume and you yeah the tail literally forgot about it it's just um a really thin uh cube or circle and so yeah just be running through it's already been 11 minutes let's go let's go uh just group it and put it on you get the point you get the point and yeah reshape a little bit so i'm gonna put this back on group group group this might end up to be like 40 minutes because of all this artwork and we're done okay let's see the total views and minimize minimize minimize so this is our goal okay now delete costume and you also have to make an idle animation just two bowls yeah rotate it and just put two bowls together so now we have to draw and that's pretty much it oh the fence defense defense so this will take a while it's just a diamond which is um 8 53 66. it's a diamond and it's a square with um it's just a square with fine reshaping and of course uh yeah circle and yeah reshaping this will take a while but there's two light parts so as you can see i'm trying to draw and um it doesn't look that much like a kite but i think it's a kite and then and then you need a little square rectangle on top which is just some fine edited um and you need a lighter version of the diamond put it behind the original one and yeah make a bunch of duplicates stuff like that you know and make a thing in the middle okay okay okay whatever um back yeah so yeah we have it um how you make your fence gate and how to make the fencing the long part is just a rectangle with fine reshaping that's it so yeah um just some fine reshaping just make another one and then put it in the back you know you know the drill um just put the eye dropper the eye dropper and yeah whatever i'm gonna change the color of the back piece so there we got it look that's the mail so now i'm just going to delete this costume so now we're actually going to get started with the code it's been 14 minutes and almost 15 now so so we have to make the green grass and the little smoke so yeah i bet you guys can do that on your own pretty easy now we're going to start with the farmer which is going to be the first thing we're going to code today and the only code it has is to go to this position just in case if someone moves it and now the cape the cape has very simple code as well so when the green flag is clicked it will go forever and oh yeah i have to make it go to here and then you need a if then statement if then touching charging bull change score by one and you have to make a new variable score you know every single game we basically make a score inside so change score by one and wait 0.1 seconds a little delay is good inside the code so when the bull touches the cape you don't get like seven points because they'll just glide through the cape so low delay is good and now we're gonna work on the ball this bolt yes this bowl and when the green flag is clicked it will switch costume to costume one and costume one is this costume because there's a new bowl coming up next and it'll go to this position yeah i already have it because there's backpack and everything and i'll point in direction zero because it's pointing right now i'll point up because element i have to make it move steps so you need to make it point in direction zero so when the green flag is clicked forever if then touching mouse pointer then wait until mouse down so the reason we used uh wait until mouse down and stuff like that is because um if you do uh whatever um the uh when the sprite is clicked it will just you can still shoot it after when the game is finished so we do not want that to happen so we're gonna use this and i'll broadcast this message called charge forward so remember feel free to pause if i'm going too quick or i'm going too slow you can like speed it up and wait 0.2 seconds and switch costume to costume one now we're going to work on the charging bowl because once you shoot the ball like once you click it you'll go that way right so and a new bull comes up you can already see its horns in its head so that's why we did that and charging bowl so now we're gonna work on the charging roll uh sorry and it's gonna be depending on clones and stuff like that to make it move and uh stuff like that so you can send multiple bubbles at a time so when the green flag is clicked it will hide and set score to zero you'll also set lives to three which is a new variable because you want three lives right or you can make three million lives no one's here to judge you so so i'm just going to change the name of this because one of its capital one if it's not capital so let's just score and go forever if then uh operator lives equal zero yeah you know the point we've done this so many times already so you probably know the point right now um if the lives equal zero or the lives are less than zero which is like negative lives it will broadcast game over and i'll send that noob chart to you so yeah we'll work on that later and now we have to work on the one this clone so when i receive charge forward it will create a clone of myself and now we're gonna have a whole entire space dedicated to that so when i start as a cologne it will go to bowl because of course you need to go to the bowl because once you click it it has to look realistic and hit the flag so so the charging roll has to go to the ball as expected and it will point in direction zero as well because you wanted to go that way so yeah uh and switch costume to costume one which is at this point uh this bowl and this is like the stunned bowl once it hits the fence so yeah switch costume costume one show and start sound gallop like this type of sound called gallup look because it's running at the uh running at the red flag so we actually found in this sprite library and you can cut it to make it uh uh smaller so then it would be really fast see look fast and easy so repeat until touching cape touching the cape because it has to keep on going until touching the cape or else oh move 10 steps keep on moving and don't touch the cape but if then if the um you need two or statements so or and then another or if it's touching fence one fence two or fence 3 it will stop and become stunned and go back so fence 2 and fence 3. there we have it you know switch costume costume two and wait 0.1 seconds because small weight is good so the costume two is when the ball hits it and i'm trying to move this a little bit let's move this so you can see the whole script oh oh there we go and then uh wait 0.1 seconds so if it hits the fence and hide and last of all delete this clone so if you delete it in the end because if you use clones you have to delete it at one point and then the end hide oopsie hide delete this clone so we're halfway finished and now we have to use the fence and so i'm going to show you the uh what i have right now so i'll show you so you can send multiple at the time so this is what we have coded so far and fence one when the green flag is clicked oh yeah we forgot to name this raging bulls oh as you can see in my if you saw it uploaded in my profile already so yeah you can check that out and when the green flag is clicked it will go to this position already there and it'll switch costume to costume one the only reason i did this is because it's on the right side and one of them is the left side and they clash in the middle at one point so switch costing the costume one and then go forever if then else so i did two variants to make the fence look better so it's going to rotate so on the first time it will be this fence second time it will be this fence and for this one the first time it's going to be this this fence and the second time is going to be this fence so it's just opposite looks cool it's better you need it if then else if then the costume number equals one equals one because um it's the first costume right so if the costume number equals one it'll glide one second to i just picked the random number that actually was reasonable to me it has to stay the same why because you know of course so it'll glide to that position and so yeah look at the number it'll go around here right so so yeah it'll move there and the y is at 60 so then it will not move so the wa so the fence will go up there and it's like around 70. but i just did 71. why not so 71 i mean i mean 70 but it's 71 so well you can just do 7d because just round up you know and then duplicate and then else it will glide 250 no i mean not 250 30 because the longer fence the shorter fence glides longer because it's shorter than the longer fence so that means it'll go glide more than the longer fence so it'll glide around here like about here maybe yeah about there and the longer fence would glide around yeah around 33. see and this one would glide like back like here or so as so so yeah um yeah and now wait 0.5 seconds so make sure and it'll glide so it'll go back and it'll glide one second back to the normal position as you can see it's already up there and now it will wait a pic random to 0.5 um seconds so 0.5 to 2 and next costume and when the green flag is clicked it'll go forever and if then touching the charging ball it'll drop lives by one so if then you know the point touching charging ball you'll drop the lines by one it'll wait a point five seconds change lives by minus one and zero point five so we're doing this on the fence because if we're doing this on the charging bull it will just get messed up and it'll lose too much live so that's the reason why we're doing it on the fence and not the charging bowl that's because we're using clone so that makes it easier for us to see the point here so yeah so i'm gonna bring this down to the fence one and fence three i mean fence two and fence three and then i'm gonna and it's about the same code for all of them but you just have to change the x and y and toggle in and off with them so i'm just going to work on this one so let's zoom in a little bit and when the negative 250s would be on the left side right so it would look a lot better on the left side so yeah switch costume costume one and copy number equals one it'll glide to a different position negative 100 you know you can toggle in and out with these x's and y's to make sure so this one's negative 125. and this one instead of writing nega it'll glide negative 250 instead of 250. we already got one done and this one we just have to drag this to here and bam we're almost done in like 30 minutes and in the third fence it'll be a little bit lower so that y has to go down a little bit so it's negative 25 and the x is negative 250 like the right fence and it will move like this consistently and it'll go forever and yeah this is all correct it'll glide one second negative 15 25 so you just have to toggle in and out i mean negative 25. toggle in and out with these numbers and negative 25 and here it would be negative 15. so yeah um and we can also change the glide seconds if you wanted to well yeah i just did that and wait 0.5 seconds one second and instead of negative 250 it would be 250 and instead of negative 60 it would i mean 60 will be negative 25. you know pick random and all this i pick random seconds so one two three so the third fence is less buffed than the first and second one slower worst so now we're going to work on sprite one which is the scoreboard and the um thing that tells you if your new pro hacker god whatever so yeah let me show you the fences are moving first so we haven't done the music either yet so yeah there we go fences are moving and we're losing lives rapidly so this is actually working so when the green flag is clicked you'll go to x0 y0 of course and then it'll hide so the costume is one to five noob less than ten loser uh less than twenty average and uh yeah i use text i use handwriting so handwriting is my favorite see uh and yeah that's pretty nice and less than 50 is pro so this is actually and the high score is 130 for the main game so that's actually pretty good and um go to x x00 and then when i receive game over it will go to the front layer so it would be on top of everything the farmer everything the cape everything so and it'll go show and if then you have to make a cloud variable a high score if then you need the greater sign on unmake the if then the score is higher than high score and you have to make this a cloud variable and you click ok um and then you put high score over here then you'll set high score to score of course because you just won the high score so you're the new champion and it'll stop all so there we have it the whole entire game oh yeah we have to also have to add the music and i think it's pretty much very simple i've done this so many times forever get a nice song guitar towards one oh my god how do you spell guitar guitar guitar chords run this one guitar chords one and play sound and there we have it our brand new game is crafted and we can also move score down and stuff high score wise on the other side so it looks pretty good and you try to make it to the other side without screwing up no so i died one to five is new less than 10 is loser less than 20 is average less than 50 is pro and less than 100 as hacker 150 plus is gone so the high score right now for my raging bull game my original raging bowl game is 130 good job guys i don't even think i can reach 50 yeah good job and someone said he got a thousand they got a thousand and so they said that they got a thousand i use four hours to play this but it isn't in the high score so i'm really sorry for you jensen six six seven seven so anyways um uh re make this viral please we're poor guys and uh we really like rock blaster and anyways please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below um any new ideas that you guys have uh anything new and yeah i guess i'll see you guys next time so i'm please make this one last thing please make this more viral than rock blaster comment all your comments below share to your friends so that we get more views and yeah see you guys next time
