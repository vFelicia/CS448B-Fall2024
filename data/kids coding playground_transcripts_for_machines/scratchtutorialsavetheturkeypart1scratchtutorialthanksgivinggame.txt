so welcome back guys to another video on kids going to playground today we'll be making a game called save the turkey since thanksgiving is coming up at the end of the month so we might we thought we might make a thanksgiving themed game uh we had many requests on um making a shooting game on our channel so um so i hope you like it guys so we're gonna be making a game called save the turkey and then we're going to be learning these fallen concepts in scratch using variables to control an action loops broadcasting messages controlling sprite with the mouse and sensing blocks so let's go on to demo the game so let's make a full screen so the point of the game is to get 20 score um without losing all of your bullets so you're supposed to shoot the bats before not letting them touch the turkey so um and shooting a coin will give you score as well killing a bat will also give you score as well one one point um shooting a bat will give you one point so when you get to 20 score then you win without losing all your bullets so this is pretty much the game um and you don't want to let them touch your turkey because if the bats touch your turkey then you will lose three lives on three points sorry three points so um and if you have less than three points then just go to zero score so yeah let's uh start a new project so new projects um so we're gonna rename it to uh save the turkey save the turkey and we're going to delete the scratch cap we don't need it and um we have some stuff in our backpack so right now i'm going to go to the backdrop and then i'm going to put that this thing in so i got this backdrop from online and oh yeah one more thing so we will be uploading all of these sprites that you will need in um our kids coding playground google drive so you can just download them and we are still having a lot of people asking for access in our email um you guys do not need access you guys can access it just don't use your school account because the school blocks it from letting you use it so you have to use your own personal gmail and also if you want to learn how to do that just watch our video on how to accessing the google drive so yeah and by the way this this coin looks a little bit bad because i made this game back in 2.0 so um it converted everything to bitmap that's why it's a little bit pixelated so we have the the target uh aimer i guess the cursor with the bat this bat you cannot get it from the sprite library anymore so we'll be putting this in the google drive um it wasn't 2.0 but it's not in 3.0 anymore um and then we have the ground sprite so this is just to detect so when the bat when you shoot a bat it'll flip over and fall onto the ground so it will detect if it's touching the ground then it will um disappear and then we have the uin and you lose sprites and then these two this is just a score just put the score right here and the bullet and then we have the turkey as well so yeah these are all of our sprites we'll be using so first let's start out on the target i'm gonna name it target first so target what i did was just draw a circle right here draw a thinner circle right here and then draw four lines like that to make it look like a target you guys can draw it any way you'd like but this is how we drew it um so let's go to the code it's gotta go to events when green flag is clicked let me zoom in when the green flag is clicked we want to make the target or cursor go to the middle go to zero zero and wait 0.5 seconds so you cannot move it for 0.5 seconds just like um to wait a little bit just give a slight pause and then put a forever loop um so we're going to set the x to the mouse x and set the map y to the mouse y so set x and y so go to sensing set the mouse x to mouse x set the y to mouse y so then i'll follow your mouse and then we want to make it to go to the front layer go to front layer and then if it's got an ifthen statement if there's mouse down so like when you click down and the mouse is down then i have a sound called 9mm it's just like the gun sound so i'm just going to put that right here um and then we're going to make another broadcast so we're going to make a broadcast message down here so we're gonna broadcast a message called shot shot fired so this will signal um the uh target to fire i mean the bullet to fire and we have two sounds right here you can either use the blast or the 9mm so and so we have a blast at 9mm you can use either of them so shots fired then that means they'll broadcast the gun to shoot the bat okay and then we're going to make some variables we're going to make two new variables called bullet oops bullet and we then make another variable called score i'm actually going to show this so what we're going to do is double click right here so then it'll be like that and then so this is bullet and this is score as you can see now you can just double so just double click and then it'll just become small okay so now we put these inside the boxes okay so now let's continue let's go back to the target um after this we want to change the bullets by negative one after a shot is fired change the bullet by negative one and then uh we're gonna wait 0.2 seconds okay so this is the code for the target so now you can actually kind of move around like this and when you click down it'll make the fire sound but you cannot do kill anything with it because we have not added the code yet so next let's go on to add the bat for the bat we'll need many variables so we're going to make a not a variable called bat shot so this is to detect if the bat is being shot with the badge shot yet and then we're going to make another one called bullet shot let's make another one a coin shot so to check if the coin is being shot and then we have to make the offset x and offset y for the bat so set x so this is just to detect if the bat this is just a pick random x position for the bat and we'll make another one from off set one for the pick random for the bat as well okay so now we have all our variables let's continue on the back so in the back we're gonna start by getting a one green flag clicked zoom in a little bit and then we're gonna set the bat shot by to zero meaning that bat is not shot not being shot at and then we're gonna set the score to zero in the beginning and then we're gonna set the amount of bullets to 25. you guys can pick whatever number you like but we're going to do 25 bolts and then we're going to get a forever loop forever forever loop if but if then statement if the bat shot is equal to zero that means if the bat is still alive equal to zero bat shot then we want to point in direction of 90 point in direction 90 to the right side and then we're going to switch the costume to bat 2a which is the first one because we're going to make the bat flap at the swings that's why we want to set it back to the normal bat 2a and then we're going to set the offset x to pick random so this is just going to be pick random of where the bat is going to be pick random negative 160 to 160 so it'll be like somewhere from this side to this side negative 160 oops negative 160 to positive 160 and then we're going to set the offset y i'm just going to complete this and set the offset y to pick random negative 50 to 150 105 sorry not 150 150 would be too high so 105 is like about right here and then after that we're gonna get a go to so it'll go to the offset x in y it'll go to the corresponding numbers and then we're going to show we're going to show the bat after it's at the right spot and then we're going to do something right here to make it even more random so let's get an if else statement um so if the offset x mod 2 that means if the offset x is equal to zero so we're going to get a mod we use mod in like another video so if you don't remember what mod is it means um it means the two numbers divided the um the remainder so if the mod is zero that means there's no remainder so when the offset x and the mod two is equal to zero which means there's no remainder then we're gonna um if it's a that means if it's an even number we're gonna um go positive and if it's an odd number we're gonna go negative so we're gonna glide one second and pick random we're gonna get an addition sign so we're gonna add offset x plus the pick random 30 to 100 so this makes it even more random so if the number is even it would make it offset x plus 30 to 100 and then we're going to duplicate this plus the offset y pick random 30 to 100 as well so um and then if the number is odd then we're gonna do this so um glide one second instead of adding we're gonna do a subtraction okay so let me take this out we're gonna use subtraction instead of addition if the number is odd so subtraction sign subtraction sign offset x minus 30 to 100 offset y minus pick random 30 to 100 all right so now we have finished the placement for the bat now we're going to make the bat flap between so we have two costumes for the bat one and two to make it look like it's flapping its wings so for the bat we're gonna do when flag clicked um forever if bat shot is equal to zero meaning that if it's not dead bat shot uh over here then we're gonna next costume and wait 0.1 seconds so that it'll switch the costumes okay and we do not want to put this inside because we don't want to block the forever loop we don't want to mess up this area so we put this in a separate um forever loop okay so we're gonna so remember we broadcast the message from here shot fired so we're gonna have to broad uh receive it right here so let's go to the bat so okay so when i receive let's go to events when i receive a shot fired we're gonna do an if to detect if the mouse pointer is touching the bat if touching mouse pointer the bat's touching the mouse pointer then we're going to set the bat shot to one meaning it is dead and then we're going to broadcast another message called bat dead so the bat is dead bad dead that dead and then in the back we're going to say when i receive bat dead we're going to do change the score by one so every bat you kill you will get one score uh score by one and we're gonna broadcast another message called check score we will need later uh we won't need it right now but we'll need it later so broadcast check score check score and then we're going to switch the costume to bat 2b which is this one uh switch costume to bat 2b and then we're going to make it flip over by pointing in direction of negative 90 and we're gonna make it repeat until touching round so a point direction of negative 90. and then we're going to make it repeat um repeat until touching ground touching the ground the sprite and we're going to change the y by negative four so we'll keep on going down by negative four until touching the ground changing the y by negative four and then we're gonna start a sound called drum bass we had this sound you guys can pick whatever sound you want we're just going to use this one sounds like this so we're going to use this one and then we're going to hide it once it touches the ground and then we're going to broadcast another message called start again start starting again and then down here we want to get uh when i receive start again we have to wait one second and then set the bat shot back to zero so it is going to start a new bat that is alive so now let's test out the game of what we have right now oh yeah and sorry i accidentally set the bullet shot not the bullets so right here to set the bullet sorry about that so that's why i was going negative bolts so now let's see 25 bullets and now when you click it the bat will die and disappear and you get one score for every bat to kill like that and the bullets will constantly go down every bullet you use so much shooting your skin from losing bullets so that's what we're gonna do today we're gonna finish the rest in the next video so we just finished the target and the bat so tomorrow we might as well finish the baby turkey and the coins and then you win so that's it for this video hope you enjoyed please like share and subscribe and ring the notification bell as well see you guys in the next video
