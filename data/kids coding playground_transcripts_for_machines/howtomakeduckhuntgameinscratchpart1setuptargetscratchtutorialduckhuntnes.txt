hello guys welcome back to kids calling playground channel so today we'll be working on this game called duck hunt this game i used to play when i was a kid you know in the 80s 1980s so i remember i have like the yellow and white laser gun that i used to shoot and you know it was really fun so you can shoot the ducks and you can do also shoot the clay pigeon back then it was uh on nes so that was a nintendo really old game but it was really fun game so i thought of making this game i already have worked on it at this game in the past a bit but didn't didn't really complete it so i had some time over the two weeks ago so i was working on this so thought of sharing it with you guys okay so uh so what we're gonna learn so we will be learning these uh following concept in scratch uh mouse control uh we have some uh broadcasting messages between the sprite custom block variable list sensing and operator so we'll use some of these uh concept to make this game okay without further ado let me show you the game how it looks like okay so this is the duckhunt game so let me play this so you can you see the dog is kind of slipping around looking for the for the ducks so the ducks kind of fly around i'm missing so when you get one done you get this red mark here so it's blinking for the second duck and you get three shots so so so if you let's say if i miss all the shot then you see the blood that fire flies away and then the dog kind of laugh at you so but if you get all the stuff and you get the ducks then the dog will come out wherever the ducks drop and they'll pick up that duck so you see so i miss one ducks right so so you just get some points so at the end you know we'll just say oh you did good or you did that and if you did good then you just continue again you can make it harder you know like maybe like a second stage you can make it like let's say uh you know uh the duck flies a little bit faster or you can maybe add more ducks so this is my last stop here okay so i missed and then the flies away and then you know it resets and it starts kind of start over and you know that's how the game works so uh you know that's it that's how the game works right now so let me kind of show you how how we code this okay all right so um so this game i downloaded some sprites so this is where i downloaded the uh the sprite from this website uh sprite resources and now you can use other downl i use this tool this is a game maker studio too that we use you can actually make other kind of game so i use that to cut up all my ducks you can see i have different ducks here so different ducks the dog you know you can cut up the different dog and then you can stitch them up together you know to form the animation so you see the dog with one duck the dog with two ducks and dog with three ducks i'm not really using these these other one the dog with three are two ducks and three ducks because uh you know uh we only have one ducks right now uh if you have more than one that's a little bit complicated it will be a little bit harder maybe later we can do that to expand the game but uh for right now it's just one duck mode so and then you have the dog laughing at us stuff like that okay and then you have the background and kind of like that so i cut them all up for you guys already so you can you can just kind of use it as it's okay so let's go back to our game here okay so we'll create a new game new okay all right so i already have some of the uh stuff in my backpack uh so just so i just gonna drag them in and i'll upload this all to our google drive also if you uh you can just i'll go down who drive to to download and also the uh if you don't know how to do that you can just go to the share uh share project and then just export the uh the you know are the sprite that'll be good enough so i'm just gonna drag them all in and i'm gonna show you how it works okay so we have to come out the background as well okay so for the background we just go back to the background we are going to grab this uh this is our background for the duck hunt and then this is the pink background where the ducks flies away okay so there's two different color okay all right so i'll show you how it works okay so the target is pretty easy so you can just draw the circle okay and then draw the cross i think this was the old one that i had i mean it doesn't it's not even in the center let me just make a new one so i think that was the old one i have done uh the bat game using similar oops using similar uh sprites so i just took it from there so let's just paint a new one here so uh we'll use this pink uh color as well this orange color let's just use the same one okay so let's just paint this real quick so i will paint it with this actually we need this color the outside so let's go back over here let's use that color what is this 100 hundred okay 10 100 100 okay so just let's do a no feel just hold the shift oopsie always mess that up okay so and then you can just draw to kind of hold the shift key and draw a straight line hold the shift key draw a straight line you can just move it there you go so we have our target so let's see how it looks like if we put it in the zero position let's put it zero zero okay so that looks okay so uh if you want us shorter longer you can do that you can do a little bit shorter okay okay all right so we have our target so let's trash the oh and the old one actually looks worse so let's take that into one okay all right so we have to target so far um the dog as you can see the dog has like custom the dog all of them are done and the dog that jumps in and then the ducks and everything and then you have the ducks you have the ducks flying different custom flying and then this is the duck when you die falls down okay the ground the ground sprite so the ground sprite is just this so we're gonna use this to kind of cover the dark in the background so it kind of blend in with the uh with the project with the uh with the backdrop so the backdrop is like this as well so i'll create another ground sprite basically just the backdrop piece here so this ground you can see i can move it right so basically we are moving putting a ground sprite on top of that so later we can hide the dog when they pick up the ducks so you see how this dog like this so you can see the dog like this so we can kind of hide his body like this so that it doesn't cover a little bit of his body okay that's why we had that uh ground and then we can use that to uh detect touching and then we have the uh this is the shooting the how many shots you have so you have three bullet two bullet one bullet and then no bullet and this is the ducks with the white ducks okay so let's see let me see where this white duck is let's hide okay you see the white ducks and then you have the red ducks okay all right so this is all the sprite that we need okay so let's start the coding okay so let's put it put some code on the ground first and we're here so let's just go um when green flags are clicked we're gonna put it at zero zero position so so let's just do zero zero so that will just keep him you see i put it already over here because since that one is in the bottom here so it fit perfectly so put zero zero okay okay so when we uh go to the backdrop what we can do is uh when green flap is clicked same thing what we want to do is we're gonna switch to background number one okay number one which is the blue sky and then the pink sky okay so number one when the game start we'll use that okay all right and then later we'll call some more okay let's go back to the dark okay so for the dog we are going to use the uh when green flap is clipped uh what we're going to do is we are going to do the weight and then we're going to do the height first actually we're going to hide the sprite in the beginning i'm going to wait for a half a second okay 0.5 uh what we want to do is we're going to switch to dark one dark one which is this dot right here okay so dark one and then we are going to move into a position so let's move them like somewhere like right here okay so you can see right um around this this path or whatever or you can move it a little bit further and you'll kind of walk through here and then we'll jump here so what we're going to do is we're going to move into negative 182 and negative 95 so let's just start let's see how it looks so you can see the dog but we have high right so we must show it okay so we have to show it back so make sure also we want to go into the front layer okay so that it will come up in the front of this uh ground block then we have to say go to front layer and then show okay so now we run this you should see the dock now so you can see the dots over here okay all right so we're going to make the dot kind of walk and then jump here okay so next we're going to use a repeat loop okay we want to repeat twice two times and we are going to start with the dark custom one anyway we already at one here so one just in case you know in case we change something but really this one may not be needed but it's kind of easy to see when we're doing this so that way you can see how how we just kind of copy and paste the code so we're going to say move 10 step and then we are going to say weight 0.1 okay so what we're going to do is we're going to change the costume first time then we are going to use the second costume okay then we are going to use the third costume the third costume and we'll do the fourth costume okay fourth class two so these are all the four so one two three and four they're all walking right so we do full costume and then we have the some sound so we have the laughing sound this is caught in the duck this is the dog sniffing and this is the dark blocking so we're going to use some of this sound so it's already loaded preloaded to the so i added to the to the sprite for you guys okay so what we're going to do is okay so click on this so play sound sound here play sound okay we're gonna say play sound sniffing sound so the dog will walk walk walk over here and then do the sniffing sound twice okay after that we are going to switch to the costume so dog number five so dog number five is when the dog kind of see it so this is outside the loop so just kind of zoom out a little bit you see the repeat two time so this one is outside so and then we're gonna do another weight uh 0.3 and then this time we are going to play the sound of the top barking okay then we're gonna switch to costume number six okay number six that is the dock when you kind of look up number six you can see number six okay number five look up so number six it's kinda like he's gonna jump in okay number seven also jump okay so we are going to use number six and then what we're going to do is we're going to make the dot kind of glide here and then we're gonna glide here twice so so for the first time we'll glide like somewhere in this position so kind of i have to position down but um just kind of glide so we kind of see where we want to glide so we're gonna do 0.2 second and glide to actually negative 66 and negative 58 okay and then and then whatever it is and then i'm going to try to glide one more time like higher so after that i'm gonna switch to costume number seven and then we're gonna apply a little bit higher so for negative so we're gonna go more a higher will be positive a little bit higher right so it'll be a negative 41 okay and then negative 17. so you can kind of just move them like this and then like this so it doesn't really have to be exactly the position okay but uh this is what i had in the whole game so it looks pretty good and then after that we want to hide the dog so we jump into the grass we'll hide him and then we will broadcast a message okay and then say start game so this will start the game this message will help us to broadcast that game for other people to do okay so let's run this real quick so you can see the dock sniffing twice and then the dog block and then he'll jump into the background and then hide okay so after this point we're gonna start and then the ducks can be flying around okay so next thing we are going to do is come to the target first so when green flag is clicked uh what we're going to do is we're going to create some variable actually let's create score okay okay after that we'll create shot that is actually getting when the duck gets shot and then we'll make one more call bullet okay all right so we're gonna hide these we don't really need that we can keep the score maybe on the bottom here doesn't really matter okay so what we're going to do is when the green flag is clicked we're going to reset the score real quick and now we have the dog right the dog's broadcast stop game so what we're going to do is i'm going to say when i receive start game um and then we're going to say set dot shot to zero so zero meaning the duck did not get shot the duck is still flying did not die yet okay and then you pull it we're gonna put three so we need to put it here instead of here because you know when we kill the ducks we'll have a new duck flying and then we have to reset this variable so we can broadcast start game again so that's why we reset it so we'll put it over here okay not in here so only the score will reset it one time so these will get reset every time the ducks got killed okay so position we're gonna position to zero zero so put the this guy in the middle and we're gonna do a little wait so just before the game start we'll do a little wait and then what we're going to do is we are going to create some custom blocks actually so we call it control target so using a custom block one thing is we can reuse the code so we're going to make we are going to make a code for moving the the target and we can use it in the uh you know when the game start and later when we when the when we go to the next level or when the auto ducts shot you can call the blocks again we don't want to repeat the code so so on this you say okay forever okay and then you say set set x and then we're going to say set y uh we're gonna set it to the mouse x and mouse y okay and then we're also going to make it go to front layer so that you can go on from everything and then we will check if they actually have the bullet around the fire the shot so if all it is so we're gonna use operator check create at zero so one two three is greater than zero right so so bullet greater than zero and then we are checking if it's actually have the mouse is down so if it's have the mouse down mouse down then we will start the sound so what we want to do is we want to start sounding not use it until done so that way it wasn't will not block the next set of code so we are going to cover a new event um event called shot fire so this is fire in the shot and then we're going to change the variable since we used one of the uh bullets right we're going to say minus one and we're gonna put a little weight here so that you know it doesn't kind of span through it all right okay so let's just try real quick what we had so far so we have the control block here and then this is starting with the game so let's see so in the beginning we cannot really move yet so you see it's kind of in the middle we're not moving yet so once the dock kind of jumps in okay so i forgot to call the method so so even though there's so many times or sometimes you forget so here you go we forgot to call the control block so that's why this thing wasn't following me okay let's go again so let's see all right so once it's done it jumps in so you can see the control is following me okay so if i click on the bullet you can see it's okay i don't have the uh picture yet but you can kind of see right if i open the bullet you see two one right so you cannot shoot anymore when you have normal bullet but if you have more bullet then you can shoot you can see right so let's start again so you can see the dog kind of go into the back and then you can fire there you go so this is what it is so far okay so uh we will actually add a little bit more and then i think we'll call it uh done for this uh first first tutorial so let's finish it real quick let's work on this piece here so uh this one is when we start uh what we want to do is we're gonna put in some way here you can see he's actually behind this block so uh while making go to the front layer so let's go put into a position let's put them around here so 175 155 in the beginning we're gonna hide and then when we receive uh skin start game where we broadcast when the dog jumps into the woods uh we are going to say switch to costume number one which is shot we have three bullets and what we're going to do is make it go to the front layer and then we are going to show it so that in the beginning we don't see it after the game start or see it and then when we say um receive where is it when i receive shot fire so this time we are going to say next costume okay and then starts so far so uh okay so we're gonna add more coal later on but let's just test it real quick so as you can see the dog kind of sniffing his way and then jump in and then you can see the oh what comes here you can shoot see they have one bullet too then no more right okay so so far this is what we have so far okay all right so this is uh we'll end the tutorial here and then we'll create another tutorial so i don't want to be too long so uh if you guys enjoy the video please give us a thumbs up uh put in some comments for us and share it with your friends all right thank you see you guys next time bye
