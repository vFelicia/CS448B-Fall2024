hey guys it's kids Korean playground here and today I'll be showing you a new project it's called the animal racing game so today we are gonna be working on this twoplayer all racing game basically each player controls one sprite hitting the arrow or D the arrow or D key on the keyboard to move the sprite the first sprite touches the object on the other end of the screen wins the game so animal racing will be learning these following concepts in scratch variables forever and repeat one I don't think we learned that yet one key pressed touching sprite and broadcast message so I'll be showing you the demo so let's do this so it's actually a twoplayer game so it says one through three and it played some music so won't let you move what you're doing with one two three and then you control and control most right wins or number wins it says the cat wins and then you cannot move the dog while the cat says the Catlins so let's do it let's make a new project so we can delete this right in the beginning we can choose a backdrop you can just any of your backdrop you want but I'm gonna use blue sky so we can use some sprites you can use any sprite you want but I'm gonna use the cat line let's move it around here and you go to but we also might need another one so I thought the bear had too much costumes and it's too big for the thing so I decided to use the dog so we also need the back for the coach or the referee or whatever you call it the bat so you can change the costume anything you want but let's just the bat to 75% you want it to be more similar so we can also change the classroom to bhakti we can change this you might you might change the dog we could change the dog a spice too so let's we can move this around the same spot that's around the same so let's make it go to here so you can pause the video whenever you need it but right now we can take the tennis ball and the blues right yeah we can use this balloon sprite we can make the balloon smaller because it's a little bit too big so about the same size make it to 65% we also need the tennis ball the tennis ball so the tennis ball is really small to start out with so we can change it to a little bit bigger let's do let's make it around the same place you're out there yes I think that's correct but I have to make a variable called count the count bear will help us pop the bat count so we can so let's go to the bat we have to start out with the if green flag clicked it will set the count to zero we can hide the variable count later but we can do it now so we can so you cannot see the count or you can use the hide variable count on a block so I'll repeat three times it will change the count by one so keep on counting one two three or something that I know say count like you'll say one two three the tip of thing because it has to repeat the recess right those three times for one second or else two seconds to walk up to one second and thus a count and then you also have to say go afterwards because out of the thing so then you can so then they'll say go and it won't if you put in here I'll say it like three times so when I broadcast you need a broadcast message let's make a new message so we need the broadcast message named star and then the next thing we're gonna be working on is the cat flying so when I receive star trace oh go forever they'll wait until you need a wait until block the key right arrow you can use D for this one but I'm gonna use the right arrow is pressed then no and then you also need another way until and then you need to operator not can you write it press because you cannot spam the on right arrow so it won't be so spammy so it will last that so last longer so you cannot spam it so and then I'll move ten steps we can make it go to the next costume to make it look like it's flying as his two costumes the flying and then you can also make it do if then yeah if then statement touching the balloon or yeah the balloon or whatever you got for it just think balloon then it will broadcast cat wind they're going to be getting back to cat when later so we can broadcast so dog is exactly the same code well not exactly but a little bit different so we have to is this 4d we can use the D key whatever you want do you keep her this who not balloon what we need the tennis ball cuz dogs like tennis Bruce and then we also need a new message instead of gonna made this dog so next next ones back to the bat and then when I received cat wind and it'll say the cat winds and then I'll stop everything you can duplicate that dog win and say the dog and then for the dog and cat you always have to do when I receive cat wind that means they'll stop other scripts so you cannot move when you're when we stop some scripts in this right not stop all they're also back you're not safe and winds so we got to do this I'm cat wind and then we often eat dumplings we can move this into the cat so I got someone to play this for me on we can play it together so you click this one good reason and clicking it won't work so I'm the dog right now we click do to make it move and I'll get the tennis ball and the dog wins so that's basically how it is before we're done we also have to add the music when you can use any music you want but I'm gonna use the simple music eggs and then you'll go forever and play sound eggs so that's basically it please before I go so please like share and subscribe and comment in the comment section what you want thank you for watching have a good day
