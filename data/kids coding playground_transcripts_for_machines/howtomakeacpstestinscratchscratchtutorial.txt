i'm pretty sure most of you are familiar with the cps test or clicks per second test it is used to measure how fast you can click in a second so like many gamers use this like test cert clicks per second i don't know why but like today we're going to be making our own version on scratch so before i begin i'll show you what it is for the ones that do not know so basically you have five seconds to like click as fast as you can i guess i'm not a very fast clicker but i'll attempt to get a pretty fast clicks per second i guess all right so i got octopus which is not that good i guess but yeah that's pretty much what a clicks per second is i think i like set like a 7.4 i don't think that's really good okay so that's basically what it is i'm now going to hop onto here i'll show you what this one is so our version you can select a five second game mode or a 10 second game mode uh let's say five seconds so basically just click this circle right here i'm not going to click very quick okay so let's so as you can see my clicks per second is 3.8 and the highest clicks per second on five seconds is eight well well for any of them is eight now let's do 10 seconds then the timer goes to 10 as you can see i'm just clicking normally all right so this time in 10 seconds we got 4.8 clicks per second so what clicks per second is is the number of clicks divided by the number of time so 48 divided by 10 seconds is 4.8 so our cps would be 4.8 all right so now let's start a new project and apparently 91.1 percent of you that are watching this video are not subscribed so please subscribe to our channel it really helped to support our channel and leave a like if you enjoyed watching this video so first we are going to delete scratchcad we're not going to be using that we're going to rename this project let's name it cps test all right and then we're going to get some sprites i'm going to get the button this one this is the button we've been using and then we're going to get a two more buttons so i'm going to get the this one let's duplicate it and then we've got the other one but one is gonna be orange so let me know that's all the difference all right let's delete this one and get the orange let's delete in the blue one we're gonna delete the orange so now we have blue and orange and inside and we're going to rename the sprites first blue one's going to be select one let's name it select one this one should be named select two so select two and then we're going to put some i guess like text over it so right here i'm gonna make turn it to black and then write uh five seconds five seconds uh let's put it like that a little bit closer to the middle something like that and then we're going to write 10 seconds all right also let's put this somewhere near the middle of this sprite all right so now we got 10 seconds so 5 seconds and we got 10 seconds also we might want to group this up group and let's group this as well group all right now as you can see in the beginning when you start a project it would say like choose your game we have to choose your game of text we can easily just paint that sprite by just writing just make a black text and write choose your game mode all right of center the sprite hold down alt then you'll you can make it bigger without moving around then we have choose your game up right there so this is where i want it to be let's put the circle at zero zero yeah okay we will organize this later but first let's work on the clicks okay so we're going to get that one green flag clicked on the button so the green flag is clicked we're going to go to zero zero which is the center of the screen the origin so going and we're going to make a new variable let's name it clicks uh clicks for all sprites i can make another one and we're going to call timer we'll need this later but for now let's just keep it like that we're gonna set the clicks to zero in the beginning and hide the variable clicks and we're also gonna hide the variable timer in the beginning and then we're gonna hide the sprite in the beginning because we're gonna let the player select five seconds or ten seconds first all right and then we're going to get it forever forever if it's touching the mouse blender and mouse down so like after clicking on it make sure it's getting clicked on uh touch the mouse pointer and mouse down then we are going to change the number of clicks by one the variable clicks and then we're going to wait until not mouse down so then you can't just like hold the clicks and then to click individually like one at a time like that all right and then we're going to wait until not uh mouse down and then we're going to change color effect by 5 so when you click it's going to change color this is just for fun you don't have to actually add this i'm just going to add it because why not and then we're going to uh create a new variable let's name it cps we'll need this later as well and we're going to make another variable for cloud variable this is called high highest cps high score i guess all right first let's now let's go back to the select one let's go to select one all right and then in select one i'm going to duplicate this so i'm gonna make it so when you hover your mouse over it it will change color like what i did in the demonstration so i'm gonna make it like a let's say orange color or something orange maybe orange yeah let's do that all right let's do the same thing for this one as well oh maybe not orange because like this one you can't really see it uh maybe like a yellow color i guess maybe like hello okay let's change the color right here yellow just make it more yellow okay there we go all right let's duplicate this boom okay so now we have the two costumes all right and then first we're going to get inside select one we will get a one flight clicked when green flag is clicked we are going to switch costume to button to a the first one i'm going to switch it to the first one and i'm going to set the position to x negative 100 y 0 and i'm going to show in the beginning show this sprite and then we're going to forever we're going to do an if else so if touching mouse pointer then we're going to switch costume to the button a2 which is the one with the yellow else we're going to switch that one the first one so then we have like a little cool effect as you can see changes color when you touch it and then uh when when the sprite is clicked let's do when the sprite is clicked we're going to make a new variable let's name it game mode seconds so like we have two game modes right so we're gonna need different seconds for each one so we're gonna set the game mode seconds to five because of the five second one and we're going to broadcast start so we're also gonna have a start two for the second one so first we're gonna broadcast start so here and then uh when i receive start when i receive start then i'm gonna hide so that means the game is started so we're gonna hide so we're gonna go back to the button oops let's go back to the button for a second all right um on the button we're going to when i receive start we're going to show the variable clicks make sure the variable clicks and we're also going to show the sprite let's show the spring all right now let's go back to select two let's go to select two now first let's go to select one actually and then we're going to drag this stuff into here and we have all this duplicated over here all right first we have to change some of this so costume uh we have to first in the beginning set it to button to be this one and this one we're going to do this one and like that so since they're different we're going to have to just change it so it doesn't get messed up so touching the last pointer we're going to switch to the second costume alice is gonna switch at the first costume so button2b is the first one button to b2 is the second one um and when the surprise click we're going to set the gamemode seconds to 10 instead 10. oops 10 and we're going to broadcast another message called start two and then when i receive start we can hide we can also duplicate this when i receive start two we're also gonna hide and that's pretty much it right here we also want to duplicate this when i receive start two we're also gonna hide all right and instead of negative 100 obviously we're going to change this position as well so we're going to do 100 instead all right so now that look when you do this it's like that and when you click on it you can like game mode seconds but yeah nothing's happening right now yet so first we have to go back to the button again let's go back to the button um we're going to have to get a actually first let's uh go to the timer so okay first we're going to do the timer let's just do it in the button okay so in timer we're just gonna do uh when i receive start we're gonna show the variable timer show variable timer and start is the for the five seconds and start two is for the 10 seconds so don't get that confused so the first one we're gonna set the timer to five because five seconds five i'm gonna repeat five times because five seconds repeat five times and we're gonna wait one second and then we're gonna change the variable timer by negative one so it's going down every second and we're also gonna stop all once the timer goes to the end we're just going to duplicate this and when i receive start 2 we are going to show the variable timer set the timer to 10 instead of 5 and repeat 10 times instead all right so now we have the timer done let's go back down here into this forever loop script so we're going to do an if then seaman if the timer is equal to zero if timer is equal to zero then we are going to broadcast a message called calculate cps calculate the clicks per second so cal cps and we're going to get an if that statement so if so this is going to check the high score so if the cps is greater than the highest cps then we are going to set the high cps to the cps all right and then right here inside the button we are going to receive that message um okay also for here we have to duplicate this and when we see start two we also have to show the variable clicks and all that forgot to do that okay and then we're gonna do when i receive calculate cps calculate cps we are going to get a forever loop forever um we're going to set the variable cps to clicks divided by the keyboard seconds game mode seconds is how much seconds each one is so like i said earlier cps is simply put the clicks divided by how much time you're going up by so we're going to get the divide factor deadline we're going to get cps divided by game mode seconds all right now let's go to the sprite let's rename this to text and let's rename this to click click and i'm going to set this to like some position i remember i set it to like one group like click we're going to set this to we're gonna have to also hide this in the beginning i mean hide this when we start the game so we're gonna get one reply click so let's go to x0 y120 and let's show and then when i receive start then we're going to hide and duplicate this when i receive start two it's also gonna hide all right and finally we can actually just create a backdrop as well let's just like make some cool i don't know color oh we can do this actually so then it looks a little bit better we can like do an orange this is what i did all right let's do this boom looks pretty good right this is what i had in my other theme so i'm gonna do that and i'm going to move around these variables so uh we can actually just hide keyword seconds all we need is the clicks cps and highest cps okay and do that all right and i'm also going to set the high cps to zero first because it got saved from the last one let's go in five seconds as you can see the cps is going up click click click look like the high cps is also going up as you can see timer goes to zero you can't click anymore it shows your clicks or cps let's do try 10 seconds same thing except 10 seconds as you can see i see this is 5.6 still saves for my last try see if i can beat that up in 5.3 all right so that's basically it for today's tutorial thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share and subscribe and i'll see you guys in the next video
