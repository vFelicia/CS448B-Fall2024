hello welcome back to kids coding playground today we'll be working on the continue working on this ninja platformer game where we will be working on the ninja attacking with the sword and also throwing the small knife out and now if we have enough time we'll work on the ninja gliding down as well um okay so before i begin please like share subscribe to our channel and uh share our channel with your friends and tell them about our channel that'll be really great thanks for your support okay all right let's uh before we stop the coding let's review what we have so far so if you guys have missed anything just kind of look through here and make sure that you didn't miss anything and you can just check your code okay so let's go to variable we have these variable here uh we have some of the my block here right and these are some of the code on the ninja okay so we'll go on the top start again run control simulate the gravity then we have on this side the start when green black is click okay so if you miss anything please just kind of pause the video and add that and on the bottom we have the jump control for the ninja okay all right okay let's go to platform platform we don't have too many code just uh setting up the level okay the sign i don't think we're gonna go the crate no code yet the water some monocle and the hitbox way monaco okay most of the codes on the ninja so today we'll work on the ninja attacking with the sword so how do we do that um what we can do is um similar to this ninja right you can duplicate him or you can create a new sprite it doesn't matter okay so we are going to create a ninja for attacking so how do we do that so the best way to do is you can create a new sprite okay so um we'll say we cannot really copy from him um right now because they have a lot of code so where to clean it up delete the costume so what we can do is a new sprite okay and we can say upload uh what we do is we go to our png another tile we'll go back to the ninja right this is our ninja okay so we will take the attack so we'll take the attack so from zero to nine just say open so you see you have a big ninja right here right so we'll for first cost two multilayered we don't need them i will rename all this to uh just the a so attack zero so a1 a0 a1 a2 a3 i mean you can you don't if you don't want to change it you can but uh then you have to match the name but i just can use it for only one it's just a letter and a number for me okay so delete that should be very quick we only have nine so i think we're almost done and number nine accidentally click on the paint sprite i'll trash this okay so we have nine costume for the ninja here uh what we're going to do is we're making the same size of this guy is 25 so we're going to make him 25. okay all right okay so how do we do the ninja so to do the ninja we have to have some of the coal from the other spray as well because what happened when the ninja jumps and all we wanted him to follow him and this one also followed that one and now if he fall back down had to use the gravity so we have to take the gravity code so that's really important take this drag this kind of drop it into the ninja okay so now the ninja has the gravity code uh what we can do is we're gonna lay him up on the second one uh you can rename him to ninja attack so that's what his sword uh what we can do is we don't need this to drop because um the first ninja already has the code but we want to check make sure that the you know this ninja um does fall into the background the green little stop so we'll just check that so we'll change this if and else we'll change it just the if we'll take this out let me zoom in a little bit and we'll take this co out here then we'll delete this piece and we'll connect it here snap it back on so we have the gravity and we have the touching green platform okay same thing we had um so we need the uh when green flag is clicked we need to uh have a forever loop and calling this um this custom sprite a custom block so that you know when it's falling down with a check if it's touching the ground if it is then you know we'll stop the fall make sure it gets stay there okay that is done the way now we will work on another green flat click here so this time when the green flag is clicked i'll move this over here so this is for this code maybe i'll put them on top pull this a little bit lower okay so this is the um code here so what we want to do is we want to hide this ninja so you will not see him only if he attacks then this ninja shows up so we'll hide him and then we'll have to have a forever loop and what we want to do is make this ninja always follow this ninja so that wherever he does the move you know we can hide him and then show him okay here's a goto here select that and say go to ninja so this guy's gonna follow him and we also need um point in direction so point in direction you see this drag that over here and then you go to sensing and whether pick up this block here put it here you have to select the back one first so you have to select ninja first then here you can say direction so it's going to point to the direction of the ninja okay all right we'll put this over here and then what we can do is we can go back to our main ninja guy so we're gonna add some code to call this other ninja here okay so the code we need is um when green flap is clicked we'll have another green flag here let me zoom in a little bit okay we are going to take a forever loop and what we can do is uh we're gonna use some if condition check here and we're gonna use sensing uh you're gonna sense the key that is pressed so let's use one two three so the first one first attack will be one which is the uh the slash with the sword so when the player hits this what we want to do is uh we are going to hide this uh main ninja guy then we gonna broadcast a message here so that we can send that message back to the other ninja so say broadcast message and you can say new message and you can say attack one okay this is number one so i'm gonna show you guys what's the difference between broadcast and broadcast weight so if you're actually doing like a regular game most of the time just use broadcast right you will not really care about broadcast weight but if you're doing a more complex game broadcast boy is very important i'll show you why it will have some problem if we're just using broadcast but what i can do is just show it right now with broadcast and then we can go back and change this to broadcast way so we have broadcast one so basically when the ninja broadcast attack one we want to show up this ninja so let's go here say when i receive attack one and we also have to check if the player is actually dying or not so make sure he's not dying when he's doing this move uh we have to get this uh condition check same like what we did for the other one right we checked dying before he can run the jump so same thing here so what a check buying is no okay and for this part we will actually um add the code for that now i will say show so it's not dying and pushing the tag will show and what we can do is we can use a repeat 10 time because we have actually 10 costume if you see 0 to 9 that's 10 custom right so that's why i repeat 10 times so repeat 10 time next costume so we only want to repeat only 10 times with the next costume and that will stop okay and then what we can do after that we'll hide it and what we can do is we're gonna broadcast again uh we're gonna this time we're gonna say broadcast show so this one actually doesn't matter with the boycott you don't have to actually have a weight you can say four cash show one okay so this will actually tells the ninja to show himself and this is hiding himself so after he finished do the attack move uh who will hide himself and they'll tell this the main ninja show so the main ninja here will go back to the main ninja here we will say show okay when i receive show one so what i want to do i want to go to so i want to go to the ninja attack which is the ninja that we here right i want to make sure these guys go back to here and then i will show this ninja okay so let's test the game out real quick or save it while we give a name to the our project okay okay all right okay so when i start this game uh you can see let me just hide some of these variables we don't do it neither we got it working already okay we'll just show only the level it says level one so uh you can see when i hit one you see that ninja kind of attack with the sword so why is it going to the back you see this is going to the back there might be some problem right you see so we want to make sure that this guy is always in the front leg just like the ninja okay we'll have to go back let's go back here okay let's drag this go to front leg just snap it over here okay now let's try it again so let's go up here okay he's still okay okay these rocks are in the front i think interesting okay i figure out what the problem is uh with my ninja going kind of go to the back when it does the using the slash with the sword so the problem is um the platform here we have a go to front layer so um what what we want to do is after going to the front leg we're going to push him back all the way to the back since we're a different sprite here uh you know one two three four five six kind of thing so you cannot push it in the back uh make sure that it doesn't block any of these sprite um what we can do is first we make some to go to the front left and we'll push him layer back what i'm going to do is um going here i'm going to drag this out go back i'm going to say go back 10 layer so i'll make sure that it goes to the back even if we add other custom later on so well i added this block here so that will help fix the issue of the ninja okay let's test it out one more time so let's use the slash as you can see it kind of move the because of the uh difference costume we kind of move um a little bit down i think not much i can do since you know scratch here they don't actually have those uh collision uh box that you could actually do only on the ninja's foot um it's a little bit harder unlike like game maker studio two or something you know that you can have more control of your sprite and how that work i think even these sprites are not really from scratch and this platform some more for like gamma studio or something you can put like you know like a collision box around different things so anyway we do whatever we can with this it's just a simple uh platformer game we're trying to do just showing you how you could do it okay all right so we'll go back to the ninja uh also uh there's one bug with this game we can fix so let's say you are doing this attack right and you're moving at the same time you see how the ninja falls off so you can fix that i mean what i did is i create a new variable called action in progress basically something is in progress to action and we want to make sure that the ninja doesn't do any of the attack move because while we're switching this it could fall them off to the to the ground so what we can do is here we'll create after we create this we'll put this in and we'll set the action to end we know no action is happening in the beginning and then in here we can set this on top here set the action to y when it's actually attacking and we have to reset it also we want to change this condition here using the n join here so um it's not dyne and the action is and the action in progress is no so no action in progress then we'll we'll try to do this and then in the code here where they change it out for the um let's see for the jump okay we're going to change this out here instead of dying equal no we have to add an end joint basically this is the end joint so let me just kind of drag and you can see so basically just grab one at the end from here of the operator this end and then we just kind of put this inside here and then we'll move this back in here so we'll delete this so that will fix the jump and we'll have to fix the run nozzle so the run nodes have similar code here we already did that i prepared it so okay okay now we have this in place now let's start again so uh while we're attacking let me save it okay um let's go back away let's remove this actually i think it's going to cause some problem for us just this let's try it again so as you can see we kind of slash it doesn't kind of fall but it won't fall off now and there's still a little bug with this slash you see sometimes it could go under here uh but cannot do too much with this right now uh as long as you're not because of the loop here this costume change and if you're jumping sometimes this loop is not done this thing will not be able to check to make sure you stand on top of this and since our platform have multiple color this is really bad uh for platformer game uh you know you have to check color you know different color and then just uh when the sprite is big it's not a square so it's really hard for getting all the color right uh anyway next time we'll make a new game upload platform just a square box i think it will work much much better um so whatever we have currently let's just finish this okay so we got the ninja attack uh working now right you can push one so you can see switch the custom for the ninja so only thing is if you're doing attack up in the air it would have some problem like this and the hitbox is also not a problem that kind of push him away so i mean i mean if you want you can just take this hitbox off but i think that will you know because that will make him go in as long as you're jumping and uh if you're not hitting the the attack button while you're like near the ground then you're fine uh like if you just up here like that is fine but if you're like near the ground and then you're trying to hit it then it kind of get into the hitbox and the hitbox kind of push him away not really we can do anything because you have too many costumes change maybe you can delete some of the costume it might help you know with the code so that it doesn't have too many costumes to loop through uh anyway um this um we do have a little problem but uh anyway so we got this attack working so um what we're going to do next is doing the knife uh you can throw the knife out okay so we'll stop here and then we'll create another video for the knife so that you know you want to see the knife you don't want to see through all the attack one okay all right we'll stop here thank you thank you for watching bye
