hello guys welcome back to kids calling playground so today we're going to work on the center i run uh part six of the video so the last time we were working on the scrolling for the ground so i play the game you can see that you can kind of move the center and then they scroll forward so that's what we had last time uh what we're going to do is we're going to put some background scrolling on it so that will look a little bit better um these are the code for the main sprite here okay so uh you can quickly kind of get it down if you're missing anything okay if you missed anything just pause the video okay so that's all of it on this side and then this side this one is a little long for the movement okay and then this one is the jump and then if you guys miss anything always go back to the share project on scratch you can take a look over there as well okay all right and this is the animated character here okay all right and then the ground that's what we did last time and then we did the virtual ground as well okay so now let's do the scrolling background so i'm going to show you how that look so this one is the screen background you can just draw whatever you like if you want more you can draw more actually so i only have one uh what i'm going to do is i'm going to flip it over so that way you know it can look like it's different so now let's go to the code the scrolling uh code so what we can do we can take some of the stuff from the other uh code here uh so uh when we copy the stuff so so we're gonna have to have to create x and y variable for this as well but since when we can copy the code called map with create voice so as you can see in my go to scrolling it doesn't have the x and y variable so what i'm going to do is i'm going to drag all this over here okay first one second one okay the reset ground movement and then the setup so it might have been so there we go let's take a look so we have set up here movement put it here position let's put this here okay and then let's start so start backward on top okay so we're gonna have to change a little bit uh on this uh okay throw this away we don't need that let me zoom in on top a little bit so we'll do one at a time so here we're gonna put the show here okay uh let's see let me put the reset here where's the reset i'm using reset okay i'm missing reset so i need to reset to delete the clone so i missed that reset here okay all right there we go so reset right here okay all right so let me put the position here okay so for this one we actually don't need this so throw this away before i do that i'll take the show out put this here okay throw this away all right i want to place a clone here same thing here we're not doing the white scrolling so why same thing here click on myself no costume we don't have next custom because we only have one okay so throw that away now let's take a look at the setup so setup we're gonna do a little bit different uh here okay so um in the beginning that's correct level one that's correct so switch to costume one uh we don't need to go back later actually uh background scrolling that's the only yeah that's the costume okay so we'll select the background scrolling okay put this away so what i'm going to do is i'll make it face forward and then i can switch it around so that way you know so i'm going to put the first one and do like this and then we can say change the direction so make sure you're scrolling here uh make sure you select this okay so that doesn't move around and then just make the show okay so um if you want you can add this right uh rotation style okay and put that on top that will make sure that it always go to here but if not make sure you select this okay okay here say we're going to go negative 90. i'm going to place the clone here okay and then let's say we want we don't want to uh rotate the second time we'll put it like this and then let's say if you want to rotate third time you can put something else let's see oops drag this back to 90 and then we can do the third time so you can just time it uh so we don't actually need exact same amount of uh clone that we have for the platform as a background so what we're going to do is we're going to make the background go slower so it depends you know um maybe i think four is enough so it depends when you play the game and we'll just watch how it goes so this is my uh level one so far okay i'm going to add this to the end okay and here we're going to change the movement a little bit so like i told you right we're going to make it slower so um so that looks better so you're going to use the division sign here okay take this guy out uh we're gonna use some math function here around okay so we're gonna round this guy and then we're gonna divide this by ten okay it will duplicate this here and put this here so you see round off g of x divided by 10 same thing we'll do the for y but since y is zero doesn't really matter but you can just do it the same way so later you actually want to do something different with the scrolling you can do that oh i have this already sorry okay i need to round my back okay all right so you have this put that here you have this put this here okay so it looks like this so now let's save it let's try it out so you can see this is in here let's try it out i don't know it's gonna work so you see it's kind of in the front so i think when i created i didn't have the go to back uh because actually i was creating this the last sprite so let's try to put the back layer go to the back and see if that will help okay so go to back layer let's try so you can see looks okay so you can see the background so this is a background slope scrolling you can see that is moving so you can see the water right see there you go okay so you can see the background scrolling so you see it's kind of moving so if you want to make the background looks better you can have different costume and switch costume but that's good enough it looks it's just give a little visual effect so you see i have more than enough i need so so four is already more than enough because we're moving uh dividing by 10 right so we don't actually need that much costume okay all right so or you can put this outside here is fine as well doesn't matter okay um okay so that's what we have so far for this okay so we're gonna work on the sound a little bit okay um over here um we have the sound already if you don't have the sound you can have a different thing so it won't play forever uh sound play sound i think i have this one yep so i got this from the youtube studio you guys can pick that up uh from there i'll show you later how to do that um and then i say when i receive when i receive uh start sound i have something called starts down okay i don't have okay so i'm gonna go back to here to my main character that way i did all that so i go back to my main character where i did all this sound let's see let's go back over here go up on top with the broadcast okay here so let's stop this so broadcast after this new message start sound okay let's go back here say uh start sound so here what we're going to do is we're going to we're going to you remember when we jump right we put the um put the sound in here right here so you remember when we jump um we okay this is when it died right place number three so number three when it died number one when it jumped right so we put it on the arraylist here this list here so we're going to check okay so we'll say if go to variable i'll put this one first say equal for the variable um item so we want to pick the soundless stimulus if one of this is equal to one meaning is true it's on then we're gonna play the sound so we're gonna play uh say start sound and then take jump okay so number one is jump that we're doing and then after that we're gonna replace it with zero so that way we know that we play that it won't play again so let's say where's that replays using replace replace here select the sound okay with zero it's like that just like that so what you can do is duplicate this uh you can see already you can hear that sound right so two if it's two replace two with zero okay and then here we're gonna say ouch i haven't made that sound i recorded that so you guys wanna change your own sound put your own ouch sound just record it you know i'll do that i'm sure if not let me show you in a bit okay number three so let's just call it all up plunge that's when you fall into the water so that one is already came with the uh uh you know the sprite in the game uh we call it the scratch okay uh this is number four you can put one here again okay and then this number four i think i have a things down or something like that that's like when you collect the snow uh and then i have another thing sound for another snow so number five you can have many so as you can see i have five of them okay number number replace five sorry i forgot to change this four so just make sure you got it so one replacing one two three three four five okay good so far i think we got it correct okay so um so this this sound is all here right so you can go to the sound tab you can hear so thing two is this the thing one is this and then this is that the song that way long song this is the plunge it's the ouch and this is the jump okay so you want to record like the ouch and make an alt sound just click on this say record and then you can talk here you see it is recording like you could click on the record button it will talk and then record and you say stop so this is where you have it and you can cut it or whatever or you can save it so you save it you know record one just rename it to out share okay i'm gonna delete it for mine so that's how you get that uh you record your own sound and then for the other thing uh the music i'll show you guys how to do that you can get a lot of free music from your youtube studio so it's really good i think everybody has that if you have a youtube account you can create your own youtube studio i'll show you so here is our youtube channel so if you go here you can see right here on the side here you see this audio or library click on that so you see this audio library you have all this different music here uh you can play it or have a music and then you can click on this you say download so you can download your music and then whatever sound you like there's a lot of free music here really nice music you can download and then you can just upload it back to your um you know in your game so i'm sure you guys know how to upload but if not let me just show you one time so if you want to upload the sound right so go to your sound sprite go to the sound tab click on this say upload okay when you upload you you will see uh a sound right just select download like some sound or something like this some mp3 you see this you can just select and then let's say i want this select this open then you see this is 5 mb so we're going to take a wall so click on this say open what it does it's gonna load to this here and then later you can use it in your code here okay so this is about uh this is about the the sound and then we did the background scrolling um this is about uh all the uh all the things that we're doing today it's a shorter video um so you can hear right you have sound so you can jump you see you have the jump sound so even if you hold down the jump it will not have like jump jump jump jump sound you see i only have one sound hook so it's a lot better with this way so that unlike the among us one right among us we when we so oh i have not caught it yet so in the plunger i think um i had to call that so i have the plunge sound over here already done so i'm not sure why it's not working correctly um let's see so replace item did i get all the g sound correct that looks correct oh sorry item three one no no that looks correct item three okay so we have some mistake uh so what you can do is uh you can open these uh variable to kind of check what happened okay so i'll show you guys how to i know what the mystic is but i'm going to show you guys how you could actually find your mistake so you can open the like the sound list right uh what you can do is you can disconnect this so let's see so uh let's say my character is here it's uh it's moving right you see when i jump it has the one over here right and then we play the one uh jump sound we'll replace it back to zero right so okay i put down the uh system sound a little bit it's hard to hear me if it sounds too high so as you can see um let's say we remove this we can see it so if i have this on right so if you let's say if i make a jump you can quickly see that uh that one to zero you cannot really see it right so just take this out just making sure that it is setting it correctly so let's say i'm moving my character right i jump you see there's a one let's set the one service one will play the jump sound set it back to zero right so let's just check the uh falling off the water if you can see right when i fought the water it did not set that number three which is the plunge cell so there's something wrong with that so what you can do is you can take a look right go back to my main character where they're falling you see this one is wrong so i put it into the wrong list so if this is the item list so that is incorrect you just select the sound list and select the sound list just like how we did it for the jump right so the jump is the soundless right so this is a plunge sound for the water also the soundless so let's save it now let's go back so let's say we disconnect this let's run this again so if i jump you see a one over there let's go over here if i fall off the water you see there's one here so it will play the sound now so let's test it again let's uh run it so you see you hear the the sound with the jump sound and then fall the water so you can hear the water drops down okay so
