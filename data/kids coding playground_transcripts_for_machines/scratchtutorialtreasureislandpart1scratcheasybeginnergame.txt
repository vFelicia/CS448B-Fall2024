welcome back guys it's kids coding playground here and today we're back for another video it's called Treasure Island today we're gonna work on this Treasure Island game so the player controls the sailboat and try to avoid hitting the island so or otherwise the ship will be wrecked the partnership and the cannonball can also hurt the ship you can also get you can find this idea and code your own games book it's a really cool book you can also check out so we'll be learning these following concepts and scratches called Vanderpool's forever loops pointing direction touching color and sprite and broadcasting messages let's get to the project let's go demo the project make it fullscreen and as you can see you can get you get wrecked when you bump into the green land and you'll also have to avoid hitting the pirate ship because it can also hurt you and as you can see the lives are going down you should try me do it and it stops all the music and everything stops so so if you win they'll say you won just way too low as you can see you can get the yellow treasures dollar treasure on the dots so you one basically goes make a new project so we can delete the cat sprite go to the backdrops control the backdrops get the backdrops um you can turn it to a blue color in the beginning and make it make it not no outline so this is that part is the whole entire screen which I just covered and that is the whole entire ocean basically so let's change the color to green you can also make like little islands on the side like look at that Island but you can you can make like several islands you can also use the reshape tool make it look more like an island you can reshape the tool using the reshape tool to make it look like iron so I have a backpack and it can help and our I already have all the backdrops loaded in so as you can see already have the backdrop we can delete the first one if you don't have a backdrop yet pause the video and make a island like mine so it's three dots of treasure on it so let's also delete the regular backdrop so we can go to the code of this thing and let's loaded our sprites first so first we have to get this sailboat sprite so the sailboats bright you had through the costumes you got a convert to bitnet confirm bitmap go to use the eraser and erase the top off to make sure it's not that close and touch the green so easily yeah so we'd also upload some other rights so I already have the pirate ship sprite so I'm gonna drag it in I got it from my backpack you can go to the pirate ship images and search it up on Google and get any pirate ship you want as you can see these are some other demonstrations of examples and uh you if you want to edit it and it has like a backdrop you can watch your video sprite editing on scratch 2.0 because it has a magic one background remover they can remove the background and take what the part you want so you can also rename the project to Treasure Island so we can choose a sprite we can choose the ball sprite so uh we can make it a grey color with the fade in it's on eraser mode right now it's yeah so you can make it like a like a fade in like type of thing and make it like a brown color up gray color goes color right brightness a little bit higher and the bottom the orange part white yeah run that color so that's gonna be my cannonball you can also make it a little darker mmm and let's get to the coding so we have all our sprites here first things first we have to change the size of this so it won't be so big so we got to make a block and that block is called start sailboat so it defines so you gotta put a forever loop better for the forever loop it'll go to your mouse pointer because it says we have to use point towards mouse pointer move three steps to your mouse pointer per second not per second but basically so and then you need a if then statement if it's touching the pirateship that means it will make a new broadcast message called and you'd also duplicate that and make and you have to change said using this you have to use the touching color there's something called the eyedropper where you can take whatever what color you want form when it shipwrecks or whatever so let's duplicate this we can take out this saw so if it's touching the cannonball or the ball it will also broadcast shitbrick so we can duplicate this one because this one's similar to touching the yellow color use the eyedropper again and take that yellow color instead of broadcasting shipwreck because you don't want to die when you get your treasures it'll brighten us a new message you can name it so we're still working on the sailboat so when the green flag is clicked it will set the lives just two three you can have as much lives as you want we also have to make the Venerable lives real quick then you have as much life as you want but I'm going to use three so you know go through this position just make it go around up here you can drag this lives thing up there yes we can make a fast move it around here around the middle because that's more better and then I'll define the start silver so when it will call the this script so let's test it real quick as you can see it's following my mouse pointer there's no dangerous yet but so as you can see it's following your mouse pointer and we have encoded everything it so you can go on top of land but when I receive got treasures go to stop all the scripts in this bright other scripts in this bright and then say you've got the treasure and then I'll stop everything control so let's have to work on the shipwreck so when I receive wreck so when I receive the shipwreck thing it will stop other scripts in this right say your ship has been wrecked ship and change lives by minus one she's one second uhoh go to back to the same position wherever that was earlier wherever that was earlier and if that else not if anything else cuz if then it's less or great if it's equal if it's lives are equal to zero or or if zero is greater than the lives because it could go into the negative and you could still be alive if you don't put this function then stop everything else they'll struck the sailboat again so I'm gonna add the sound for this thing you can make it if then you need a forever look and then you can use whatever sign you want so you go to the loops these are where all the sounds are let me use bossa nova because it just sounds more oldtimey so I'm gonna test the game and you can see the music is playing if you bump into stuff ship I'll break you can also gather the treasures and you win so right now we haven't done the ship and the cannonball and all that stuff yeah so in the next part we will see you guys thank you for watching everybody and please like and subscribe to our channels
