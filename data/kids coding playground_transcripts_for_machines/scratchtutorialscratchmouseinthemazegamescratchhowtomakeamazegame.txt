it's kids counting playground here again today we'll be doing another tutorial on our channel uh it's a maze game so you're the mouse and you move around using the arrow keys or wasd if you prefer and you collect the cheeses right here to gain pick random one to ten points and this is plus five right here when you grab it you get more time so i'll give it a little demo of the game so you use the mouse to move around i'm using the arrow keys and when you grab a piece of jesus it's a good job and brings you back to the beginning um so then i'll try to grab the plus five as you can see my timer went up by five getting the cheese pick random one to five points and then um i removed the tail of this mouse because it often got stuck between walls like maybe right here so that's why i took it out so yeah that's basically the game you guys can try it out yourself i'll share this project soon you guys can try it out okay so let's get a new project file new i'm gonna rename this project let's rename it to maze game so maze game we're gonna take out this cat let me import some stuff into here first so i have the cheese and this thing the timer thing so i'm also going to get the backdrop which is the i'm not backed up the maze i forgot to get that i'll get that in a few seconds okay so i got my maze sprite so what this means is i had three costumes so every time you get the cheese it'll switch the costume so you have a different level to play so uh this is just a little maze we drew so we just used some boxes we drew some boxes around um so yeah it's basically how you draw it so we have we'll have this in our google drive so you can download it if you want so i'll ungroup it so i can show you that we drew some individual boxes as you can see just drag them around you guys can make any level you'd want or you can download it if you'd like so yeah that's basically what we have right here some random like lines and we'll um okay so now let's go into the code so we're gonna set up um the mouse right also let's go the mouse this is the mouse thing i'm going to edit this so we're going to have to delete this tail because it messes up the game sometimes so if you want to see how you can but then your game might uh feel different it might be different like it might get stuck there might be some problems so i'm gonna keep it like that for now okay so then we're gonna set up the mouse by putting a little green flag clicks when green flag just clicked let's show show the mouse in the beginning and then we're going to do um point direction of 180 so it points to the bottom of the screen when we just start the game and then we're gonna go to this position so this is the position i set it to back then negative 90 165 so you'll have to like set this to according how your maze looks like if you're going to draw your own but for this maze right here it's negative 90 165 so it'll spawn right here okay let's go back to the mouse move this up here and then for the mouse we're going to set the size to 50 it's going to make it a little bit smaller so it's nice to fifty percent let me see if that's look it looks good looks a little too small let's do it 75 75 yeah that looks a little better let me see for a sec i need to see what my old one how big that was okay so it looks like i said it's a 35 so i'll show you how that looks like yeah so that's 35 percent that's how big i set it to so you guys can set it to how big your map is okay and then next we're gonna um for the backdrops we have like a backdrop let's make a backdrop actually so i'm gonna make just like i don't know maybe a red backdrop let's just draw a box as the red backdrop so you guys can do whatever you want you can upload your own backdrops as well do whatever you want with this okay and remember you guys can fuse two colors together like this as you can see it looks pretty cool as you can see maybe we should do white and maybe like that color i guess purple i don't know maybe let's just do this okay i add a little color into nothing so like okay so that's going to be the backdrop so in the beginning we're going to make it switch backdrop to backdrop one that's because we're gonna have a losing screen i mean the game over screen and then we're gonna do switch costume to mouse a okay now we can work on the cheese so this cheese we just downloaded from online so we're going to broadcast a message from here and into the mouse to make it move so we're going to start here and then we're going to get into what green flag clicked inside the cheese let's get some reply clicks gonna set the size to 75 percent 75 we're going to show the cheese and we're going to make a variable let's name it score score okay so we're going to set the score to zero okay and after that we're going to go to a random position so this is us uh making the cheese go to a random position but we don't want the cheese to be inside the wall so we're going to do something about that and also remember to make your maze the size of this thing the backdrop like that so we're going to have to show this so we can get the color so repeat until not touching this color so then the cheese won't be in the middle of the wall so you can't get it so that's what we're going to do repeat until not not touching this color so we're going to use this eye dropper thing and get this color okay and then we're going to go to our in position again so go to random position and hide we're going to hide it because we don't want so if you don't hide it it will like see you'll see the cheese teleporting all around so we just want to make the game a little bit more cooler a little bit more better makes it looks better so we're going to put the hide so then you can't see any of this happening and then down here we're going to show after this is done and they're going to broadcast a message called run so what this does is we don't want the cat um and the mouse to be moving around while the cheese is getting uh placed so that's why we want to do this run let's name it run so up here we're going to uh we're going to get actually no let's go into the mouse and finish the mouse and then we'll go back to the cheese so let's go back to the mouse real quick and we're gonna code the movement so when i receive run we can forever forever if then statement if key up or w touching a key up or w so w up up arrow key or w then we're gonna change the y by four so i just found that four is the perfect amount of change so we're gonna change y by four and then we're going to put a direction of zero point in direction of zero which is facing up and then if on edge bounce so when you're look when you're moving up it will point up and if it's touching the edge then we're gonna make it bounce we actually don't need this anymore actually we can do it because like there's some empty spaces right here but like back then when i had this this was a little bit smaller so you could actually touch the edge but yeah let's add this anyway so like you can't go in off the screen a little bit so we're gonna make it bounce on edge bounce and control if if the touching is color if you're touching the color of the wall of the maze let's get the color then we're going to change the y by negative 4 so then they can't go through it so we're going to change y by negative 4. let's duplicate this entire chunk of code and we're going to put it right here in the forever loop but not in the other if that statement so we're going to get if down arrow key down or key s is being pressed s then we're going to change y by negative 4 and we're going to point the direction of 180 which is facing down and if on edge bounce and if touching color this blue color then we're going to change the y by four so when you're looking down and you're going down then we're going to push it back up so we're going to change y before let's duplicate this again put it into the forever loop okay if right arrow is being pressed or the key d is being pressed d then i'm going to change the x instead of the y so we can take this out change x by 4 x by 4 and let's put this back in and point direction of 90 which is facing the right side and if touching this color we're going to make it change x by negative 4 so that is facing the other side when it's touching this side when it's bumping into the ball this side we're going to push it back out duplicate this oops duplicate this put it in the forever loop and if the left arrow is pressed or a or wasd i'm going to change the x by negative 4 and point direction negative 90 which is facing the left side and financial bounds and instead we can do 4 right here okay and right here if it's touching the cheese if the mouse is touching the cheese we're gonna make it like say good job or something like that so if touching cheese we're going to say good job for like one second good job one second and then after that we're going to change the score the cheese will give you a random score from pick random let's do score pick random uh one to ten let's do that okay and then we're going to broadcast a new message from next me so we'll use this later next maze is just to switch the level maze so we can broadcast message next maze next maze okay and then next okay so everyone i'm gonna demo the game so when you play it you can move the mouse around the cheese goes to a random position and when you grab the cheese it says good job as you can see the mouse is not going back to the front and as you can see you're getting basically infinite score so we're gonna work on that later so i think you just move around right now okay let's continue working on the code so we're going to go back to the cheese let's go back to the cheese okay and then when i receive next mace inside the cheese we're going to wait one second go to a random position and so when you switch the maze we're going to have to do this again let's duplicate this i have to duplicate this part again so repeat i'm not touching so once it's touching the maze we're going to find a new position for the cheese and then we're going to do the same thing okay all right so let's play it and we also need to move the mouse back to normal place i think yeah so as you can see when you touch the cheese it finds a new position as you can see it moves right there but your mouse is not moving back to the beginning when you're touching it so we're going to have to change that so when i receive okay so actually we are going to go to the mouse actually so we can make it go back to the beginning so let's when i receive next maze we're going to stop other scripts in the sprite so then it can't move while that is happening while that is in play let's stop other scripts in the sprite and then right here we're going to do when i receive next maze we're going to move it back to the beginning so when i receive next maze let's move it go to negative 90. so we're going to go to negative 90 165 up to the beginning and then we're going to point direction at zero i mean 180 which is the bottom so we're gonna make a point bottom and then wait one second and then we'll start so okay let's move this up and play so save the project going to get the cheese so it says good job three points so we also want to switch the costume for the maze so when i receive next maze we want a next costume so then it could switch the costumes so next we're going to get we're going to set the position of the maze so we're gonna get one green flag clicked go to zero zero and we're gonna show okay and let's uh start let's make a timer so tyler for the the scheme so we're going to make a variable statement timer wait um i don't know why you can only do cloud variables right there but okay we're gonna use this for all sprites timer okay so for here we're gonna get a one green flag click we're going to set the timer to 60 timer to 60 and then forever wait one second change the time by negative once and then the timer has been going down i get one and if the timer is equal zero if timer is equal to zero so if timer equals zero then we're gonna broadcast endgame to end the game okay and then when i receive end game when the game ends i'm going to switch the backdrop to a game over backdrop so we're gonna make one let's paint it um i'm just gonna do this or something like this make like some green backdrop i don't want any outline so i'm just gonna do this so yeah i'm gonna take this out okay and then we're gonna get the text make some red text and i'll use this one i guess game over so we could write that make this bigger more visible okay okay so now we have the game over so when i receive end game we're going to broadcast so i'll switch back drop to the backdrop point which is the game over i mean backdrop two let me center this i'm not sure if i have centered this yet uh yeah i think i have okay so now switch back drop to two and we're going to stop other scripts into sprite stop other scripts in the sprites it's right here so after ending game we're gonna stop the timer okay and then the maze we're going to get when i receive end game hide we can hide the maze okay and then in the mouse we are going to when i receive endgame when i receive endgame stop other scripts in the sprite let's duplicate that and hide okay so this should work i think i'll save it okay so we're gonna get the cheese okay i think we still have to make this go back to the beginning so when green flag clicked pretty sure i already said it right there right okay so to fix this we're gonna move this over here so to make it go back to the beginning so see so i did a mistake right here put this over here making it stop everything so you put it into one script see so as you can see the mouse goes back i'll show you guys one more time as you can see it goes back to the beginning and it switches the map so now we have to work on the timer which is like you get plus five time so just duplicate the code from the cheese some of it is similar just duplicate this oops duplicate this and this and let's zoom in a little bit okay so when i receive end game we're going to hide this okay then one backdrop switches to backdrop one backdrop two i mean which is the game over and we can hide as well i don't think this is actually necessary that this is my old code i guess you can just delete it doesn't really matter i have this already okay and then next we are going to uh what else can we do oh yeah so for right here in the next maze this is all the same except we can take out this run we'll take out the broadcast run so this thing is all the same for this one uh we can okay so let me see how big this is yeah okay that's a fine size i don't think we need this this is going to make it even smaller so we're going to make it pick random 10 to 15 seconds for it to start spawning it so that's what i did i'm just gonna do five to ten so for testing purposes and then we're gonna so this is supposed to be down here and then we're gonna hide in the beginning so i don't wanna make it spawn every time it's a little bit rare and okay so after this we don't need the score thing so go to random position repeat until and all this is correct okay now we have this all done okay next we can go into our mouse our mouse has the we add a little script right here so in our mouse we have to add an ifthen statement if touching the time so if it's touching the timer the plus five time time then we'll change the timer by five so you get five extra seconds change timer by five and we're gonna broadcast a message called bonus time bonus time bonus time let's go back to the timer the time sprite wait when i receive bonus time so let's go to the time and in bonus time we're just going to copy paste duplicate this code into here so yes i think that's it and i'll save it and i'll demo it so let's play so as you can see the timer is still constantly going down so let's see if i get the plus five as you can see the timer went up plus five like i got five more seconds pick random five to ten seconds it'll spawn one as you can see one spawn and they will move around um time to time because every single maze will switch i'm just going to play this one time so she's actually spawned in my spawn if you don't want that you can like maybe make a hit box or you can like make it max spawn height as this or something like that let's get cheese cheese remember the cheese will give you pick random one to ten points for the time plus five time you can also add a high score like in my other game you can add it if you want so i'm just gonna let the timer run out and i will show you guys the game over once the timer runs out okay the timer is about to run out so as you can see when the timer runs out it's game over oh yes and we can hide the cheese as well when it's game over we just broadcast so i forgot to do that when i receive um end game we just hide i'll just do that for everything okay so yes that's basically the project if you enjoyed please like share and subscribe and bring the notification bell if you like our channel and we'll see you guys in the next tutorial
