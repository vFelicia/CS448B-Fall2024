hello kids welcome back to the channel today we will continue with our party animal team that we have left off with the scratch introduction so what we're going to do we're gonna make a few change to the game today well we're gonna make the at the dog the bat in the background for this game so that you know make it a little bit more animals right because this is an animal party kick game so also we're gonna change a little bit with the music don't like this music playing in the back it's really loud with this drum and cymbal so we're gonna try something different we're gonna change the music out so what I'm going to do is I don't remove all this as you can see there's a little weight here in between so we're gonna have to put them way back into the the step so that it will look a little bit better okay so we'll move the weight here back 0.25 which we did right and then we can kind of move these back in now maybe we can duplicate this here and then we'll change this forward and step the whole wood ten step we'll duplicate this again whatever ten step so let's let's remove that this so let's stop this so we have a moving forward ten step we 0.5 to 5 seconds moving forward 10 step way again go back so basically going back and forth okay so we start again you can see from the cat going back and forth on the stage a little bit okay so we're gonna add our music back so this what we can do in pecan Sam here we can say select choose a new sound and maybe you can type dance or something okay so here we are about different pencil over so you hover over they can't place the sound book so you can choose any pencil that you like you can choose this one for now so this is more energetic so let's check after we choose that we're gonna go back here we're gonna create another when green flag is clicked because actually it is song playing come on mom so you don't want to add it into any of this block if you do it kind of messed up again so I can show you that in a bit so let's go to control again or add a forever loop so and then you go to sound and as you can see right it says something like play the sound then energetic until done so that mean like the sound will play for how many ever second or minute this this song has so you actually put this in here it will actually blocks the cat for moving until the sound is done so let me just kind of show you that let's just play this for once so as you can see the cats kind of anything with the music in the back so let's say if we did not have it as separate forever loop and we put it by say in here or something like that so you won't be a problem as you can see so it's kind of getting stuff that's why you don't want to do that so you do not want to put that into the same forum because this song may be longer here to keep it on the side so now that we have fixed it the cat movement and then added a different song so now we're done with a cat so now next what we can do is we're gonna add the other sprite so what you can do is go back here let's do a search so now we're gonna add the doc type top so we have this top we're gonna add him to the just to the screen so let's say we move him over here so so that what we can do is we're gonna make him kind of run back and forth in here right so we must start with this go back to the event when green flag is clicked meaning that we'll never play a click on this green flag this toe will execute so we're gonna have another forever loop so put in here so let's say we're gonna move the dog 10 step and then what we want to do is when it get to the edge we want to bounce so uh if on edge bounce many of the dot run all the way over here it will bounce back so while we try this and see what happened also before we do it let's change the costume as well so we're gonna create another one here I should make this bigger actually sorry about that let me make this bigger I always forgot about that so it's easier for everyone to see so here we're gonna make it another forever loop here so this time we're gonna change the custom just like how we did with a cat or a check in a costume so those look like a dog is running so we can put out a little bit wait here go back to here control you can say wait 0.2 second okay so now if we run it you can turn a quick look at the dog see what happened you can see this new stuff right incorrectly is so you see how the top is flipped over so that's not what we won right so I'm sure that dark is actually kind of run correctly right so what we can do we can fix that so we can do move the dog back to this position so maybe before we start we're gonna move into this position as you can when you track this you can see this change so what you can do is you can first track the dog and then you can move this over here so now we're gonna make the dog start at this position one more thing is the doc is are rotating right so we don't want him to do that click on this here click on this you see this there's a one button in the middle select this so this one will not make the dog rotate so the top only bounce back and forth so now we're done so let's save it run it again so which is what we want okay so we got the doc going so now let's try to add the pad when we can fly' the bad around the stage as well so let's try that will type in back okay we have this back tear and if you want a different custom with the bat maybe you can choose another one Oh again we don't have another one I think the old scratch has a different bat looking bad but I think this one does not let me just try again okay so we only have this bat perfect oops okay so I only have this bat so we'll go back okay so in here we have the bats the bats what we want to do is we can become a little smaller to want can't put 50% so the bad is are the smaller so what we're gonna do is we're gonna make the black pad chemical eye around so again what that's starting from this position so in here I go back to event on clicked we can say okay more the back to this position okay and then say we're ready set the size if not you can also do this right here you can say set set size here if let's say you did not change it here you and change it over here as well so let's say you say change it to 157 let's say we put this 100% back so you see how the bat is small but when we click on this it will actually make the bat smaller so the bat actually is smaller so because of this code you can do it with a CO or you can do it over here so same thing so what we're gonna do is we're gonna have a forever loop okay so what we're going to do is we're gonna point the bat at 90 degree so that you know the bat will be flying this way because if the bat is uh you see how he ate this way he's come like this way I think some of the yeah the bats like this is not a good example actually well let's say let's let's change the the sprite because I'm gonna show you this now let's change this brightness use the bat let's use the butterfly okay let's use this putter fight and this is better so what we're going to do is we're gonna copy the code actually over so we can do is drag this tone you see how it's kind of moving moving just let go so now the code get copied over here so you know what they're typing and so he can now can trash ahead so now we're the butterfly so what we're going to do is we're gonna make the path I go up and then back so what we're going to do is we're gonna put him into it direction so we got a point to 90 so as you can see you see here 90 and then you can go negative 90 you see his hats in the front so what we gonna do is we're going when he's flying this way his hat is gonna point this way when it's flying back this way we at some point this way so we're gonna set that right now 90 so which is pointing to the right so gum stay glide let's say we want the butterfly to start here right this is 161 let's say negative 161 as you can see the negative 161 right so we can find make him go up so you see this one changes up now to say cry one second to here and then maybe we're gonna say over here that was a cry one second to this location and then finally we're gonna over here and it was a cry one second to here so now the butterfly will be moving like this right so what we're gonna do is we're gonna make him go back so what we can do is come on turn him around say opponent Direction negative 90 so as you can see it's pointing to the left now so we're gonna fly him back all the way over here where he stopped from so unless a glide to this one you can change it to two seconds if you want so now I run it you can actually see the bad it's kind of cold out there so up or cross up down and he'll turn around and come back here okay so let's say this and let's run do you remember what we did with a doc actually turn around because we put negative 90 point interaction which is left side so what we have accomplished this is a really simple game where you have a couple of sprite on the screen we added some music and we kind of learn about the direction right how the point left and right and depending on where you're facing from right so that's about it for this game so thanks for
