so welcome back guys to another tutorial on kids cooking playground today we'll be doing the second tutorial for the tank game we've been working on so first we would like to go to the click and then we want to change a little bit we want to make it hide in the beginning so basically it won't be like this on top so now when you click play and stop the white will not be on top so and the game is still fully functional you can still click so yeah all right so i'll go over the code a little bit so this is like the movement so you can put any that you have not put yet so movement losing um taking damage to the cannon the boss we have not coded yet the enemies you can pause the video if you'd like and then these are just decorations nothing really the click so then click a laser alright so that's it so now let's go to the tank so inside the tank instead of putting stop all right here we are going to get broadcast broadcast um i'm gonna broadcast a message game over so the game over we're gonna repeat a new sprite and then i'm just gonna do red or something uh text and then we're gonna write game over okay game over we're going to make this a little bit bigger put it in the middle centered all right so inside here we're going to reflect lights inside the game over we're going to go to zero zero we're gonna hide when i receive um the message game over then we will show this thing we're gonna make it go to front layer show and then we're going to stop all all right and then so now when you take enough damage you will actually lose yeah so return can see when you go to zero lives don't say game over and you'll lose all right so now let's go to the boss so inside the boss we're gonna start coding in here so inside the boss we're gonna get a one green flag clicked zoom in we are going to hide after hiding we're going to make a variable and we're going to name it boss hp so boss hp i'll put that in the top right so we're going to hide the variable boss hp in the beginning and we're going to set the variable boss hp to 20 so if you want 20 lives we're gonna wait one second wait one second and then we're going to go to uh pick random on negative 240 to 240 and then we're going to do 150 for the y and after that we're going to wait until we're going to wait until so we're going to wait until the score is greater than let's say 2 000. so wait until the score is greater than 2000 so for the demonstration i might have to like decrease the number so for now we're just going to put 2000 so it's going to be like that and then we're going to show once the score's over 2000 and then we're going to show the variable boss so we don't want to show the variable boss hp in the beginning and then after um the boss appears then we'll show the variable and then forever forever we're going to point towards the tank point towards the tank and i'll make the boss move 0.5 steps instead of 1 so it's a little bit slower and then we're going to do if touching tank touching tank then we will um get an if that statement and we're also going to check if taking damage is equal to n so which is no so we're going to check we're taking damage is equal to n and if it is then we're going to broadcast taking greater damage because the boss does more damage so we're going to be taking later damage uh and after that we're going to then if that's even if um if boss has less than zero or uh equal to zero hp so loss hp is less than or equal to so oops it has to be or sorry or less than or equal to zero so boss hp less than or equal to zero then we will hide hide the boss because it's dead and we're gonna play the sound uh whatever this is alien creek until done alien creek two and then we're gonna broadcast a message called you win once you kill the boss so in all right right here in the box we have another script to code in so when the green flag clicked this is like if it's touching the laser and stuff so forever if so we're coding this in a separate block because if we code it in here it will the boss will keep on stopping because it has to run this code all over again so that's where we're going to put it in a separate place so if forever if touching laser touching laser laser then we're gonna change the boss by negative one change boss hp by negative one and then we're gonna start scr sound alien creek one yeah this time and then we're gonna change the score 300 change the score by 300 every time you hit the boss and then repeat five times change color effect by 25 and we're going to clear the graphic effects and after that we're going to wait a point five second before continuing so it's gonna wait a little bit before ending the game all right so inside the tank remember we broadcast the taking greater damage we're going to code that right now so taking greater damage when i receive taking greater damage if it's taking greater damage we're going to get if that statement if we just duplicate this we have to change of the variables so tank taking damage is equal to no then we're going to set the tank taking damage to y and then change the life by negative two instead and all of this should be the same all right instead of one we're going to be minus two because the boss does more damage all right pretty sure that's it oh yeah and also here we have to make a new costume duplicate and then we're just gonna change this you win center let's make it green all right and then we're gonna when i receive um game over we're gonna switch costume costume one which is game over and we're gonna duplicate this when i receive you win then we're going to switch costume to costume uh to this costume one sorry all right so now let's try out the game so i'm trying i'm gonna try to get 2000 scored so then i could try to get and the boss boston has like 13 hp that's not that good for us uh it's kind of hard to control all right as you can see we killed the boss you win so yeah that's pretty much it for this tutorial um if you
