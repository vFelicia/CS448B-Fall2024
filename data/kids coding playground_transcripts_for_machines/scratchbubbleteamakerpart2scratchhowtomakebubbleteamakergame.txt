thank you welcome back to kids clothing playground channel it's time to continue our exciting Journey with the bubble tea making game so in today's tutorial where we deep dive into the code for the teapot the tea the tea cup Sprite and start our bubble tea creation process so get ready and take your bubble tea making skill to the next level all right without further Ado let's go back and check on what we had last time so we had the cat let me just zoom in a little bit so pretty much here some of the code we're going to go through a little bit so if you guys miss anything be sure to click pause the button pause the video and check yourself okay so this is the cat this one is the customer okay and tapioca scoop okay tap your scoop and then the tapioca pearl okay and then I don't yeah we have some on the cup okay while we fill up the tapioca I think that is everything okay so today we'll be working on the teapot the tea the tea cup okay all right let's get started okay so what we're going to do we're going to start the teapot so you remember last time on this tapioca after it's done dropping topic oil we had a something called star T right so we're going to use that broadcast message so let's start here so let's start in the teapot so when green flag is clicked okay then we're gonna set the teapot to whatever position you can have any other position but here's where mine is at the time and I'm gonna make it point in Direction 90 so because later when we turn the teapot we're going to make sure that you know when we start the game it's always on the same position it's not flipped over right and then we're gonna say show okay and then we have the message that start T right we had so we're gonna say when I receive start t I'm gonna do the same thing make sure I close here again so that way I can use this later on to uh you know when we make the second T and the dirty okay I'm gonna use the Glide one second and then we want to Glide it like somewhere on the top here so for me I think I had that down negative 75 and 50. so as you can see you can do whatever kind of whatever makes sense so just I think this one was a little bit better for me it just kind of looked a little bit uh you know uh when it flipped over it looks good so I kept it over there this time and then I say um repeat 10 times and then here what I'm going to do is going to change the rotation 5 degree and then we'll wait for the mouse down just like how we did the tapioca Pro drop we'll make wait for the mouse down and then we'll start pouring the tea so same Midway four miles down and broadcast a message so this time we broadcast something called a message and this is called poor t okay and then we can play the T sound until done okay so when we broadcast party we're gonna go to our tea and then we're gonna make the T drop to the cup all right so next let's move it to our tea or we can try to do this first so let's say if I run this right at the beginning it's here if I click on this you can run it just to check so you can see the teapot gonna go there and then turn and then waiting for my mouse now when I put the mouse down then we will have another 14 in them right okay all right so that is good that part is working so let's click this and get it back over here so let's move on to the t uh Sprite so the tea Sprite as well we're gonna make the tea drop so let's go to the tea spray um one green black is clay I'm gonna hide that t so that we don't see it and when we receive quality that we just did 40. then we're gonna we're actually gonna create a variable first so make a variable called counter so this what we're going to do is we're going to use this counter to count how many T drop in and then when when when there's certain part of the T drop after certain amount we're gonna broadcast and start filling the cup so that's what we need to counter for that and make sure you create it for this Sprite only so if you see this T it has a t colon something right so this is for the Sprite only versus if you see something like this one change color change color does not have a Sprite name in front so this is a global variable and this is like a local variable to that Sprite okay all right so just hide that for now okay 40 we're gonna set the counter zero and we're gonna make it go to 20 Mega third so somewhere on top here so we just show it so it's like right here you see where the t is so I try to align the T where the tip of the tea part is after the teapot go through so let's say if I push this right so you can see so I want to align the T maybe it's something right here that's what I did okay all right so let's go back to the T put it back down okay so now let's go back to our cup okay so let's hide this okay all right so next what we're going to do is uh we're gonna say um repeat uh here we say repeat 25 times and I am going to create a clock myself so that will create more tea drop and I'll give it a little weight in between uh 0.1 seconds okay and then I'm gonna change the counter so change the counter by one okay and then I say if and then we use the equal sign in the operator here and then go to the variable grab the counter if the counter is equal to 10 then we're gonna broadcast another message so this one will broadcast a new message called fill t so this will fill the tea as of the tea will uh you know we can change the customer on the cup and then after the field and then at the very end in broadcast another message called fill a salt syrup so this is for us to start the syrup bottle later on so we don't have to worry about that right now we'll use that later okay look at this kill again so we're at the Portico pause if you need a little break okay and not continue so next we're gonna say whenever we create something when I create a clone you have to make sure that you have to say when I start as a club okay and when you use clone and also you make sure you have to delete the Clone as well so next we're going to use this thing so if so here I'm gonna add some code that is not going to affect the game right now it will affect again later so here we have something called change color so what I'm doing is uh I check the chain colors greater than zero so basically before my chain color is zero so when I change the cup color it will go on like different colors so that we can like don't need to draw so many Sprites so we can just change color variable to change the cup uh you know this bubble tea color each time the of the one customers serve to the next customer okay so I'm gonna say set setup color effect and we are going to set it to this variable change color so we're going to change it by 50 or whatever next time so you can see it I'll show you later but right now for now let's just continue with the code we're going to say uh go to so here we're going to say go to negative 20 and make it okay still around that and then I cannot say show okay and then what we're going to do is we need to repeat until okay and then we're going to use all condition from the operator sensing we're going to say repeat until it's either touching the cup or touching the teacup so basically this is the cup you see that no no this is the teacup with the tea inside okay foreign if not you know um scratch will have problem of the 300 chrome okay so we have that so far so right now if I play the game you'll see the Tea Party can drop T but then it doesn't change it to the teacup so we have to do that later so let's just play it for now and see how it looks okay so we have make bubble tea so the the player the customer will comes in and then we have the tapioca Pro we click on it so this will drop the Pearl here and then you see the teapot comes up I click on the teapot you can see the t is coming down so let's say this is a the t is a little bit low you can start it high so you see my T is kind of low right uh you can move it up like maybe like right here I think maybe my original code is a little bit different so maybe we can change the Y maybe negative five or something so instead of negative 30. let's change it to the negative thought maybe my original code is a little bit different than this one so it could be different so negative five so I'm going to start learning so now let's try this again so uh go back to the uh go back to the teapot I'm gonna say star t right so now you see my T is kind of there right so let's just hide a highly uh okay all right so when when I say start T it's gonna be waiting for a mouse down so I click on the mouse down you can see that he is flipping down right okay but right now you can see it doesn't fill up the T but we still have to make the tea fill up in the cup right so what we're going to do is we're going to broadcast a message to change the color okay okay so let's go back to our cup so our cup here when we receive a new message call it a portee then we're gonna say wait one second and then we're gonna broadcast a message new message called change default okay and then hi so basically we're gonna change the tea cup and high and so that this teacup is no longer there we're gonna change it to this teacup so now let's go to our teacup so in our teacup we can say when green flag is clicked say go to so go to the to go to the cup so that whenever the Cup start this key cup is going to be the same place and we are going to hide in the beginning okay and also when I receive a start is where the game start we also want to hide it so that way you know we don't want to show it and when we get our feel tea that's when we were filling up the tea what we can do is let's let's do it over here actually so let's say you feel tea here we're gonna say uh repeat ten times and then we're gonna say next cuts too and we're gonna do a little bit of weight 0.2 seconds then we also have this change tea cup that we did right so change tea cup so for change take up we're gonna say go to thank you to the cup okay and now we're gonna say point in Direction 90 so because later I'm gonna shake this bubble tea cup so we don't want to put it back on the original spot and also uh we're gonna put in this code for color change we don't need it right now but we will use that later so we're gonna say when the chain color is greater than zero double set the color so that way we can have like the green bubble tea the but you know um I don't know red or blue or whatever okay and then we're gonna change the color and then we are going to switch to the costume number one so that one has like no uh a little bit I think and then starting to fill up and I wanted to add the word shell okay so now let's see so now let's play the game again okay so you can see just zoom out a little bit with the code so you can see the tapioca pearl comes down so it drops down to the thing and then the teapot comes up and then it drops the T as you can see it starts but as you can see our our our our little um you know the scoop is still here those things were to take care of so now let's go back to the tapioca school so we're gonna have to hide it okay foreign happen I'm gonna hide it so hide this guy okay and then uh maybe we can do something else in the customer as well as a little change a little bit of uh you know costume stuff so we're gonna say when the tapioca drop the drop tap yoga we're gonna switch to uh costume number one we should change one let's duplicate this and we're gonna change this to Quality then we switch to costume number to the change one so let's see if we have everything okay so we need one more thing let's go back to the tea part so when we fill up we have something called fill the syrup later start the syrup so we're gonna put the tea light back down right after the tea is finished so we're gonna put the Pea part back down let's start start syrup I can change the teapot position back to 90 as well so that it will face to the right and we're gonna Glide one second back to one negative 160 and negative 25 which is the starting position so now let's test the game again okay so let's make it bubble tea let's see make sure everything once okay here the the customer comes in and then we have the bubble tea cup here we click on this to fill the cup with the bubble here so the next part we have to work on is actually filling up the syrup and then we're going to get the straw I don't want to give it to the customer and then we also have two at this uh the icon so that it will show up how many how many persons you know to to give to to you to so what we can do last part is for this video we can add the sound so let's go to our backdrop clicked uh just say forever and then we can say yeah the sound a Rain Sound here that we can use rain until done and said so we test your game now you should hear some background music with the rain coming down and it should became a little bit interesting than the music and everything alright so you can click on this again and then once the tea is finished it Glides back and then next part will add this syrup and then add the lid and then shake the cup and then add the straw and give it to the customer and then make the icon appear finish and then go with the next customer and so on okay so this is where we're gonna stop the video for now and now make sure you tune in for the part three of this tutorial and I'll see you guys next time thank you bye thank you
