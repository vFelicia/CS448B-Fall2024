welcome back to the channel tickets quickly route today we'll be doing a hangman game in scratch um so hangman is like a game where you try to guess um words and try to guess the word and you try not to let it drop draw the man if it draws up the man that means you lose so we'll be doing that in scratch so without further ado let's demonstrate the game so green flag let's click new okay so in the beginning you get eight attempts okay let's guess usually in hangman you want to guess the vowels first let's get some a okay it looks like there are two a's in this thing so let's see what else maybe a c nope no c so as you can see if you get something wrong it will draw the circle in black so the gray is just the outline so it will just draw each of the things on top of the gray and you'll lose one attempt if you get the right answer then you don't lose an attempt so let's go g nope i mean i okay there is an i so what could this board possibly be let's see oh a something i okay let's go for a b i'm just guessing nope five more times l okay there's an l oh a let's see t nope n and animal yes animal okay there you go see as you can see i got i got the word right so it says good job you won so if you get it before the attempts gets to zero then you win so that's pretty much it for the game and if you want to start a new game just click new and the word will be completely randomized to a new word i'm going to show you guys how it looks like if you lose so i'm just going to spam one letter i guess okay so what if you just don't guess anything right it will draw the entire man so you can see and then you have zero attempts and at the end i'll show you the word um that you had and you'll say sorry you lost okay so that's what we have let's start a new project before we begin on this tutorial here's your friendly reminder to subscribe to kids coding play run because only 6.6 of our viewers in the last 28 days are subscribed to our channel and 93.4 are not subscribed so please help us increase our subscribed viewers to at least 10 that's our goal before we start coding in our game um i would like to ask you guys a question so we have a we were thinking about doing a uh christmas themed coding like project competition on our kids coding playground official studio in scratch so let us know what you think about it in the comment section below or you can join our discord and vote there if you would like if enough people say yes then we might do it and we might have a prize for the winner so yeah that's pretty much it what i have to say okay now let's start coding let's rename the project to hang man or let's make it capital h hang man and let's delete the scratch cat we'll never need it then this one i guess we never really need it and then we have uh all these sprites we need to get so we have the process logic this is basically the you win and lose and all the logic behind the hangman game and then we have the new sprites this is starting a new game you click that and then we have the hangman itself right there and then right here we have the backdrop and then we just drag this one in so you can just download this or you can draw it yourself so what we did in the background was we'd have let's duplicate it i'll show you what we have so right here we have two h's so as you can see we have two hanging ins the gray one just looks like a little shadow behind the black one and then right here we have the remaining attempts we have a box and then we'll put the variable inside here and then right here for the sections for each letter there is we just drew a rectangle and then we used the reshape tool and rounded out the edges so i'm going to show you what we did so just draw like that reshape unlikely one like that that maybe like that that just like pull out the edges a little to make it a little bit round yeah so there you go it's not the best but some like something like that we just did something like that and then we just duplicate ctrl c ctrl v six times uh five times for each one and then we get all of that so yeah that's pretty much how you do the backdrop so we're gonna delete that and you see this is the hangman thing is a little bit overlapping this so we're just going to like move this up a little bit you can just like here you know it's a little bit too high like about right here should be fine right okay now let's go on to our other sprite our hangman so what we have what we did was just draw a straight line of 10 using this color straight so you hold down shift to make a straight line and then we made another line right here and then another line down same thickness hold down shift to make a straight one and then right here we just have a box with the same outline drew box like that like a rectangle and then right here we have the costumes for each one so costume one and then we have the each hangman costume with a gray outline and we'll just color over it with the black and then right here we don't you don't want to make so as you can see when you like do this um it's like you draw something like this um you don't want to connect it like that because it will change the color for the entire thing instead oops like that instead you want to do this like that and then just get the select tool and drag it on like that or drag it on like that something like that so then it doesn't change the color for the entire thing uh yeah so basically you should draw the gray before you do the black because you want the black on top so remember to draw the gray first okay so it's basically the same thing for all these you just go over in black yeah so that's pretty much it for the hangman and then right here process logic we have the button we got the blue and orange button we dragged it out a little bit and then we just wrote good job you won for the blue one and then sorry you lost for the other one and then the new sprite is just just box reshape and then new in the middle okay and we also did some readjusting of the um all these sprites off camera so it looks a little bit better because as you could see this thing was overlapping on that and maybe if you move this all up this will show up in the bottom so it will look better so now this is our full thing we just moved it up a little bit so it's not centered now okay let's start coding in the new sprite so inside the new sprite we're going to start when this sprite is clicked let's zoom in a little so when this right is clicked we're gonna change the x by two so we're just to make it look like when you click it there's a little bit animation so i change the x by two change the y by negative two then we're gonna wait until not mouse down so you can spam it so we're gonna wait until not mouse down not mouse down no not messed up and then after that we're going to change the x back by negative 2 and change the y by 2 so it goes back to its original position let's duplicate that and then we're just going to change the x by negative two and then the y by two and then broadcast a message and name it new game so it'll start a new game new game and then right here let's save it um i'll show you when you click on it as you can see it moves down a little bit like that looks like it's being clicked on so that's what we want and then we go to the process um uh logic sprite okay so when we receive the new game inside here and receive new game we are going to make some new blocks so we're going to make a new block we're going to make uh four new blocks actually we'll define them all we're going to name the first one initialize initialize like that and then click ok we will make another one process answer and aw and sir and then process answer and then we're going to do process uh correct guess so this is if you get the correct uh guess and then we have another one process wrong wrong guess process process wrong guess and then we have the four custom blocks and then first let's define initialize okay so inside initialize we're going to hide in the beginning we're going to hide this right in the beginning and then we're going to make some new variables we're going to make a variable called display word so this is the word that's going to be displayed and we're going to name it six question marks and must be six because we're doing six letter words and after that we're gonna set each each uh let each little slot right here the variable to assign to a different letter so we're gonna display word to exactly six question marks like that six question marks and then we're gonna set the remaining attempts which is another variable we're gonna name it renaming attempts okay oh forgot that oops tenths i think that's right um and then we're gonna set the remaining attempts we're gonna set it to eight so we have eight remaining attempts and then we're gonna set the secret word which is another variable i'm forgetting uh secret word and it's gonna be for this word for the sprite only so secret word anything we have the first letter and lowercase will be for the sprite only okay we're going to set the secret word secret word and then we're going to make a list so we're gonna make a list we're gonna name it word list for this sprite only as you can see you can notice that the first letter is lowercase and then uh we're going to put words into the word list so you know we could just do one green file clicked and put all the different words like that but we're not going to do that because people can just look inside and see inside the code and see all the words and it won't be fun so what we're going to do is just going to put the words so i'm just going to go open up the list and we're going to fill out some of the words so okay so we just got five words so you know how you just click the plus and you type whatever you want right there we just got five sample words you can add as much as you would want so what we just have five right now and then right here we just want to set the secret word and then we're gonna do item okay so we're gonna get the item of the word list right here we're gonna have to pick random one to five because we have five words so it's gonna be item pick random one to five of word list and then we're gonna broadcast another message we're gonna name it update so it's gonna keep on updating um what to do next we'll need this after oh update and wait sorry i forgot about that has me to wait and then uh after that we have to broadcast another message and wait and we're gonna name it reset okay and then inside the new game we are going to initialize and we will need to add more code to it um but first we have to define all of these guys so let me move all these guys down leave this up okay now let's define um process answer we will finish um up this new game thing after we finish this these three first i'm going to start on this one okay so let's make some new variables we're going to name a new variable this is for the sprite only as well we're going to name it got letter got letter and then we're just going to do another one this is also for the sprite only question mark count make that capital so first one is lowercase for the sprite only question mark count and then we're gonna make another one called temp this is a temporary variable it's gonna be an attempt for the sprite only because it's lowercase and then another one uh index and then we're just going to put it lowercase for the sprite only and click ok ok so now we have all our variables let's get defining on this one so we're going to first we're going to set the got letter to zero and then we're going to set the question mark down to zero so and then we're gonna set the temporary to nothing for now temp to nothing we're gonna set it to blank and then we're gonna set the index to one so it's on the first first one on the index okay so now let's get a repeat so we're gonna repeat um and then we're gonna do the length of the secret word which is six letters so we can just go repeat one of the secret word length of the secret word like that so it's going to repeat six times and then we're going to set a new variable i'm gonna name it character for the sprite only as well so character we're going to set character right here to the letter position i mean index of the secret word so we're going to set the character we're going to get the letter and then we're going to get the index and then secret word so what this says okay let's let's put the secret word first okay all right so we're going to set the character to the letter of the index so the index is one right now so it will go to the first letter of the secret word so assuming we had bridge as our word right it will get the first letters because the index is equal to one right now and you'll get b okay and then we're going to get an if else if else statement inside here so if the character is equal to the answer of the person like whatever the person puts in so if the character is equal to answer of whatever the player puts in then we're going to set the a new the variable.letter i thought it was gonna be a new one so i said they got letter to one so that means they have got the letter so assuming the uh word was bridge they type in b it's equal to the character so you'll get the letter else if you do not get the letter we're going to set the variable character to the letter letter index of the display word so the display word is a question mark because up here remember we set the display word to six question marks well it's gonna be down here so it's gonna set the index a letter index or one of so the first slot is gonna be a question mark if you don't get it okay and then we're going to get a set the right here we're going to set the temporary variable and then we're going to join the temporary plus the character so the character could either be this one or this one so we're gonna join it uh with the temporary and the temporary is nothing right now so let's say you don't get it then it'll be blank question mark but if you do get it then it'll have a letter plus the question mark so we're going to join uh these two variables so it could be either blank question mark or blank a letter and after that it'll just keep on putting question marks at the end until you get the letters so remember we just have to put the temp we join the temp with the character and then after that we're going to get an if then statement so if the character is equal to question mark if character is equal to question mark character if the character is equal to question mark then we're going to change the question mark count by one so if the whatever the player puts so what this is used to is to check if there's any question marks in the word so if there are question marks the game will continue running else if there are no no more question marks left then the player should win so we're right here we're going to change the question mark count question mark counts by one and then we're gonna change the index by one so it'll go to the next letter of the word so the index we're gonna change it by one and then we're gonna set the display word to temp whatever this is temp is gonna be the character joined with that thing so the blank plus the letter or blank plus the question mark so that's what it's going to be so at the final at the end it'll just be some question marks or some letters and so it could be just like question mark question mark a question mark question mark question mark so at the end it will change it to that so we're done defining our process answer so this is the hardest part of this project and then next we have the project correct yes and the project rhonda so let's code these two so for the project correct guess we're gonna broadcast and wait a message called update oh wait we already have update sorry uh update and then if then so we're gonna if so if the question mark count is equal to zero meaning the player has gotten all the letters correct so if the question mark count is equal to zero if it's equal to zero we're going to switch the costume to win which is the costume that says you win good job you won and then we're gonna show this sprites and then we're gonna stop all and then if you get a wrong guess then we're gonna broadcast and wait a message called wrong guess and we're gonna change the attempts by negative one so you'll lose an attempt for getting a wrong answer i'm gonna change the remaining attempts minus one and we're gonna get an if then else statement so if else if the remaining attempts is equal to zero so you have no more attempts left remaining attempts equals a zero then we're going to set the display word set display word to the secret word so let's say you out of attempts it'll just show the word just to show you guys show you what the word is after you lost so the secret to the secret word and then we're just gonna update we're gonna broadcast and wait update so it'll update uh the new sprite we'll have to code in there after and after that we're going to switch the costume to loose which is the sorry you lose costume and then we're going to show it and then stop all else we're still going to have to update it regardless so we're just gonna put the broadcast and wait update okay since we're done defining stuff we can go back into the new game area and then we can finish uh coding here and then we're gonna get forever loop that's forever and then we're gonna always ask an answer so we're gonna ask guess a letter guess a letter and then we're gonna go to my blocks and process the answer which is this entire chunk of code used to process whatever the answer the player puts is we're going to put that and then we're going to hit if statements if then so if the got letter is equal to zero i got letter got header is equal to zero so for us zero is false one is true i should have told you guys this earlier but um so basically if the god letter is false then wait this is supposed to be if uh else even sorry about that uh if else so if it's like that then we're going to wrong we're going gonna process wrong answer so it'll go down here to run this code right here else it'll run the correct guess right here okay i'm gonna zoom out so in case you have anything you do not get you can put it down in your code you can check your code okay so now let's go to our new sprite i mean not the new sprite we have to make a new sprite yeah new sprite yeah okay all right so we're gonna have to paint a new sprite we're just gonna rename it display typing display and then we don't have to put anything just go to the code okay so inside our display sprite we're going to receive the update thing update message and then we're going to make a few new variables we need six for each slot on the hangman thing so we're going to use c1 for the sprite only c2 for this sprite only c3 for the sprite only c4 for the sprite only c5 the sprite only and finally c6 for the sprite only okay so now we have all the variables for all the letters we just have to um let's hide the word list for now let me hide that real quick so we can go into our display and then we can basically just double click and then get the c1 c2 double click c3 uh c4 and just put all the variables into the box uh c3 let's move this down a little bit i move this inside a little bit c4 c5 and c6 there you go and then right here uh we can just uh double click that put that in here and then next we can do set the c1 to the letter one of the display word which is going to be the question mark so in the beginning it'll in the beginning it'll be question mark but when you you'll always update so let's say you get a question right then it will set the letter one of the display word as c1 so we always want to set it as whatever you put here so we're gonna get the letter one of display word and we can just duplicate this instead c2 we're going to change the c2 instead we're going to get letter two so what you do is just duplicate all this and we need six of them so i'm just gonna do that c3 c4 c5 c6 and then we have the 2 3 4 5 6. okay so in summary these are the six letters of your word so assuming you get bridge it could be like b question mark question mark r question mark like something like that it could be like that so that's what we have here and then so i think that's all the code we have let's hide all these variables so let's go to these hide all these variables okay oh wait we have to show this one there we go let's save our project and show our game click new we have a new word so let's guess s that's not a word oh yeah and i forgot one last thing so basically for this one you have to make it go to the next costume so remember we broadcasted the message reset well basically right here when you reset you just want to switch the costume back to the first costume and and then when we get the wrong answer we have to draw the hangman receive wrong and wrong guess we're gonna next costume there we go now it should work save stop the project let's go full screen okay new let's guess a okay that is one of them i think this is animal i think yeah it is animal okay i think we have to get another one okay okay let's let's just like yeah see as you can see if he gets the wrong answer i put k it's wrong so we'll do that so a a so let's say you do let's see let's say you get all of them wrong okay so as you can see you get them all wrong okay so you get them all wrong you draws the entire man it says sorry you lost it shows the word which is shaman and your remaining attempts is zero so our game is working completely so this is our hangman game in scratch don't forget to like share and subscribe um thank you guys for watching um don't forget to join our discord if you guys want to see more videos like this please like and subscribe and i'll see you guys in the next video bye
