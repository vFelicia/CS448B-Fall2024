so imagine you're in a garden so this game the objective is to catch a mouse so you imagine you see a mouse in your garden you want to catch it you want to catch the mouse before it moves away it disappears every time you click on the mouse which is basically catching it you get one point see as you can see when I click on it the variable score goes up by one place like share and subscribe and bring the notification bell to receive the latest updates from this channel you've seen the demo of the game catching the mouse like we showed earlier so now we're gonna be working on the game catching the mouse so in catching the mouse we'll be learning these following concepts in scratch broadcasting messages using pick random variables using ifthenelse statements now let's get started okay so that as you can see we have a new project first let's rename it to catching the mouse okay so we'd really don't need to scratch cat right now you can choose the mouse pray we can also rename the mouse just regular Mouse and we might want a background to garden rocket as a background we chose so first we want to make two variables the two variables wanna make is catch and score cache is is for the catching the mouse and score is to count the score every time you catch the mouse so cat and you want it for all sprites and we want to make score and this one's also for all sprites and we want to keep the check for score so then it'll show up on there but since we don't want cash to show up we can uncheck it and you'll be gone and can move the score up here next we'll be making the code for the mouse so we always need a wonderful I clicked we always want to set the variables to zero in the beginning so you won't have like a scorned in the beginning so when set the score to zero and we also want to set the cache to zero next we want the code for the mouse again okay so this time well I don't wait for point five seconds to give a game a small pause then we will bring in a forever loop everything inside the forever loop will go on forever until the stop is clicked so we want to wait point five seconds to let the player know the game has started and we don't also want the forever loop and now we want we want to code for the mouse so we need to ifthenelse statement does anyone know to if then else statement is I gave you some time to think of what if then else statement is you can pause if you want more time so since it's kind of hard to see the point five I'll add the zero to make it zero point five so it's easier to see so is anyone order if then else statement is if you know if you guessed it right and if then condition if then else condition means if the condition in here matches then it will execute the code right here if it doesn't then it'll execute the code over here so now we'll move on to some more code for the mouse so we'll need to go to the operators will be picking the pick at random and the you will need this operator the pick random one to ten and also the equal condition operator so next we want to we want to bring in the condition the equal one insert here so we also want to use the variable catch so if cat is equal to 0 which means hasn't catched and that means it will go to this random position maybe we can go to this position we need the pick random we can go to we can go to maybe negative 116 and to 160 and for the lie we can also go to negative 160 160 okay so next we will be adding some more code to the else statement and the ifthen statement so if it goes to that random position it will show so you can see it then it will wait 1 second so you can have a chance to catch the mouse and then it'll hide again and go to a new random position else if they catch it then wait one second so next well 1 Oh if the sprite is clicked this is the command so if you click the mouse this is what will happen under ok so if you click the mouse it'll change the score by one so the score will go back up by one if I click on it it'll change the catch by one letting them know that you've caught them you can set the catch to one so I set the catch to one letting them know that you caught it and it can say you got me for one second to let you know that you got it and we can hide after that and then broadcast a new message may be called show again next we want to who else are there what else is in the code what is the difference between jinx score by one and set catch two one I'll give you some time to think about that cushion time's up so a change score change means it'll go up by how much number you put into here and set is how well set to right here that's the number it will set to in here in this variable so finally we need to add we need let it receive the show again message wait one second we can set the score I mean the catch back to zero now after you're done with the code please click the green flag so you can you can start the game you can try out your game and you can add some soundeffects other sprites in the game to make it more fun as you can see when you run it I guess you got me hides show again and the score goes up back up by one every time this function right here is restarting the catch so then it will disappear and come back again and it will go set it back automatically set it back to zero and this part of the code so thank you guys for watching and please
