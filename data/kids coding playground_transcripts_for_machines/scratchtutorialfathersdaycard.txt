so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding playground today we'll be making a Father's Day card cuz tomorrow is Father's Day you it doesn't have to say Father's Day on it it could be for a birthday card I guess so that's how it looks like so in the Father's Day card today we'll be learning these concepts custom sprites like like art like if the draal sprites sprite animation like switching costumes and broadcasting messages so like let's start a new project here so let me show you guys how this project what's up so in the beginning there's our robots witches costumes and you move your mouse on here it wobbles around and you click on it and the robot will mince and music will play in the background and I'll say you see on the right side let's start a new project so in a new project we need to get set up with the sprites so we'll need to delete the scratch cat so let's get some sprites so we'll need the robots stick both of them beat both of them so for this one we don't need these two costs because you can just delete them so we don't need them and one more sprite another robot this one this one's for the inside next we'll need balloon it's a balloon you can duplicate it cuz they have two balloons so one balloon can be orange one to be blue I guess orange and yellow yeah so those are sprites or me to make the some other sprites painters to paint two sprites once that says happy Father's Day and texts take a beating marker Seabury happy day sorry happy Father's Day okay let's move this it's in the middle system so this is the Happy's Father's Day let's make it a bit bigger put like right here so happy Father's Day right here we'll need to draw another sprite the click here to open the card that's right so you'll need to make an arrow so just use the paint tool just get a green color make it about 20 size 20 size that looks fine draw it like that like that like an arrow like an arrow and then we can right click here and text so when you get the text I put a red color put a red color right click here so click here an exclamation mark or you can make a bit bigger I think yeah I'll turn it I love them like this so this week a group of sprites together so you can get this like to put them together okay it's now they're groups you can group them together so that's good now we want to add a party hat on this robot so we can get us breakfast right library called Corby hat tick the balloon we have balloon take the party hat yeah so the party hat we want to just delete this we don't need these just take the first one you want to put this together controlc puppy it and go to this bot the bot and controlv now you can put this on his head so using it like in the party look we're here and then now you have to group the robot and the party hat together so you can drag it around hold down the shift key so you can get the thing move down the shift key and group so now it's grouped together and I can move it around like them so now we have the setup done let's move on to the background so the background we will need to make the party cards so we need three backdrops so let's get the square sprite don't you don't want filling in in the beginning just don't feel it and you want a black outline so the best is for output port I've tested it and for is the best for this thing so you make like rectangle shape get the selected drag it like right there so duplicate this twice so you get three costumes um and we'll need to draw the first costume so you wanna you want to feel it actually first so so to get the Select tool select this fill it's like a blue color so there you got a light blue color next you want to make this card closed this is a closed card so let's zoom in a little so you do it like that well it's not that even this make it a four and you want it off for right here maybe like right here like this far hold down the shift key when you're going down so you get a straight line see the straight line right here oh no we want it to be for change that so you want to hold down the shift key to look right here like this for its kind of difficult okay so we got that now we need to maybe a little longer actually and then we can do this connect it down here so now we have the closing garden you want to select this box this rectangle not the other one and fill it with like green so you know it's green the clothes card is great so now let's work on the other cards so we need to fill this one fill this with blue kind of a light blue color like this color like that color so no kill this and now we can take the line tool yen for and we can make it open a little bit more this time like maybe up here it's opening and then from here you hold down the shift key so you get a straight line until like right here and drag it down into the edge like this okay now you take the Select tool select this rectangle and fill it with green there you go so that's like the opening card and this one is fully open heart so we want to take the select tool color this light blue color and you take the tool and crack into the lock right here hold down the shift key so you get a good no this is too short let's make out a bit longer can make it a bit longer and select right here I hold down the shift key so it goes down and drag it back to the town to the corner so now we have the three backdrops but yeah I left the color fill this with the blue like this blue star and so like this one fill the greenish color drink okay so now we have three backdrops as you can see when I click through them there it looks like they're opening up so now let's work on the ratio robot we want it to duplicate the costume look you know how they have them in the beginning they have confetti I guess use a pen I mean the line outline you pick a color choose red I guess shoes it red you want to add 20 um you can just right okay so you can just drag a couple random lines DRO like four or five of them then you can make another color like green like a dream green and we can do like a yellow and orange yellow i don't you do it work a couple orders lines and we can actually make this green a bit and fill it with a bit darker green because the background is green so we can fill this you can actually just make a couple more let's make it over this that's I think that's good enough for now I don't think we need this one this too much just erase this one so now we have that we can duplicate it and we already have the duplicate so all we have to do is just trim you can just duplicate this one X this one out and we can just arrange he's arranged these it doesn't work it doesn't it doesn't allow us to do that so like that can import it back in sorry for that go back to the robot sorry so get the robot um the referee robot and get the lines you can put different colors this time I guess just different pattern color you can do blue this time I guess we can do a darker green so we have a darker green you can do like a pink oh yes purple thing okay that looks pretty good I guess we don't really need this party hat you think you still good now um so go back to the retro robot so we now have all the art done this is epic we'll be working for the code on the robot or so when the backdrop switches to backdrop one we do this so that drop one is the closed card backdrop so all we have to do is put a forever loop under it under the Patrick one we want it to switch your next costume next costume wait 0.2 seconds they'll have a little pulse I guess so it will change colors like this it would change colors and its are just backdrop to so a1 sorry okay so when it opens the car let me see these backdrops so this is 1 2 & 3 ok so we need to work on the back now let's work on the back background coat so if we will work on the background coat then we'll go back to the Russian robot okay so one click do you want to switch the backdrop one always watch the backdrop one so next you want to you want to get um to click the click here thing so when they switch is the backdrop one we want to forever Li if then touching mouse pointer so if it's touching your mouse then next costumes would wait 0.2 seconds so I'm here making new costume forgot about the sprites let's make a new costume for this one just duplicate this select and you can just turn it down a little like this so go like this yeah it's so it's like like that assessment centre of Novi Center so now it looks like it's tilting up and down I think we can actually change the color because it's green he doesn't really fit it yeah just make it work so that's great now let's go back to the code someone clicked when the mouse is clicked when the flag is clicked we wanted to show in the beginning okay so we'll need a win sprite clicked we'll need to broadcast a message called open card so the card will actually open open card open card so whenever it's eaves open card when this sprite receives open card we can hide because we don't want to show anymore so when when the backdrop will receive the open card so when the backdrop receives open card oh it's a regard switch backdrop to backdrop and wait 0.5 seconds 0.5 seconds and switch backdrop backtoback shrubs 3 so open and also when it receives open card forever loop it can play a song I'm gonna get the dance dance celebrate song in the sound library ants and sound this one so put this until done into the four active so next you want to get the code for the Red Room robot 1 when it receives open card then you'll hi is this until in the front and when clicked it will show in the beginning so next we have the robot this one the robot this one what when the backdrop so just a backdrop 3 this will show slow show and forever loop next costume weight 0.3 seconds so it looks dance it'll look like it's dancing 0.3 seconds yeah like this see it's like dancing and one clicked it will hide in the beginning hot so now we'll need to get for the balloon 1 and the happy Father's Day this is the last piece of code there is so when backdrop so should sit down for up 3 show and one clicked hot you can just drag this into each of them balloon crack it into here here right here so we can put this click here so we can take out the code for the click here first so we can move it wait on they also change the color for this one color ok move it here it's making a bit smaller like 75 75 is good sighs yeah and you can move the robot robot we can decrease the size for like 75 monster yeah that looks like a good size so now we let's put the code back in can you click it let's play it again okay we can move this on the other side these balloons we can move on this side but this you can make the balloons like 75 size also both the balloons like one overlapping the other with this that looks pretty good and it says happy Father's Day on top of the balloons we can make the happy Father's Day sprite smaller like 50 sighs yeah people can see that maybe six feet so it's 60 yeah so 60 and then the robot can be right here you can decrease its size to 75 so just play it and we can also add the party hat to all these costumes already hat so you can just duplicate select this delete these select so see they do this robot control feet so just give it to all its costumes yeah grip it group it together with a bot get it here quick bot okay so now oops sorry control we only need the Hat sorry I don't copy button you'll see you know we can control these here yeah the Hat group it urn are these fully yeah I think so so let's play it now again you can delete the party hat click here just zoom in because it's kind of there happy Father's Day and bot starts spinning around so I hope this video helped you guys you can make this for a birthday card also so
