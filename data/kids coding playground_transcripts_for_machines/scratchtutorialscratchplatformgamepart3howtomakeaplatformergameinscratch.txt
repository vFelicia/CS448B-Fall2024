alright guys welcome back to the kiss queen playground Chino again today we'll walk on continue working on this platform scratch platform again we'll try to address on the issue encounter last time with the treasure hunter jumping through the platform here so we'll see if we can fix it now I think I might have missed some of the coal earlier so that's why I messed it up so we'll try to see if we can fix it and also before we begin please like share subscribe to our Channel and you know if you know anybody who's interested please pass our channel along to them alright so let's get started okay so the issue we have was jumping through a let's try and say we can fix it let's go to this Co here I think the last time we did not have to go for this where the at this code so basically what it does is we're trying to add the make this a platform called the front and then go back the layer so doesn't block anything in this platform and also we will add this go for the tree so when it green flag is clicked make sure the tree cannot go in the back so let's see this will help a little bit and also let's add this back to thee to this ninja here to is touching the brown color we'll move it down then we show where this a run without refresh on for this and this pay and okay alright I think those are the only one that's running on the loop without refresh that will help okay let's try it again so okay so here you see it does does get block him down I think somehow you know like I'm here because of the side or that little little side shall move them up that's the problem because of that little no side here because that's not not brown which having this brown line so unless you do like brown or this brown with some that and all don't walk a little bit better but for now we just try to just simple platform Jim for this new treasure hunter so we'll try to just adjust this you know so bacon can't land on the have enough space between you know each of the platform that he's jumping and so so we can we're going to suggest it so that you know your game basically just move so that would fit a little bit better so I've been no space to move okay all right okay so um basically fix the toe to toe so make sure that you have similar course I have you know what the color and everything so uh looks like it's fine now Oh have the or the Ronco here let's just go through it so you should have something similar like this the junk oh okay and then this is an arrow keys pressed welding the jump control will go here this simulate gravity we have the touching a brown color moving back down this is the cream color of the platform right here okay and now you get the main piece of code this will put these two together things somehow this works better for this one I don't know sometimes it has problem so I put it back seems like it's okay right now and this is the checker piece that doesn't have any key press and they should stay in still okay let's just try one more time so let's go so you can see this balancing is not moving him up so we can't jump we cannot jump straight through down it seems to be fine so that is seems to be a walking point so this one is little high I mean it's kinda hard to jump but a running jump but you know you can kind of move it back down a little bit so you see I can still do it if I run and jump depending on how you want that platform you can just China move back down a little bit adjust it as you want so let's finish this piece so we're almost done so through this slide so we have the same thing right we have within the costume yeah or the sly alright sly here so what we're going to do is we're gonna copy this L copy this control C copy the name out and let's go back to the code and similarly we'll duplicate this set of code here we'll say down arrow press we don't need the directions or wherever the direction is facing that will be the direction is going to slide toward and we can change the move speed in that move speed with the lock run speed it could be really fast or we change it to five so we'll put that here and then we'll change this to the sliding costume and we can use a run reuse that run reintroduce the run index here okay all right so we'll put it hard to run index costume okay let's try it again so push down as you can see slide really slow if you push to your left and right arrow key and sly it will go faster you see okay so we're pretty much done with the slide now last thing we want to do is we want through the skull and the chimp okay all right we'll be on the tomb so what we're going to do we're going to make a new block call a random position so we'll put the gym in a really good position okay okay and now what we can do is when you say when this call to call the random position and you can never repeat until and you say not we use an end one here where you can use sensing and we are going to use the not Raider so we don't want him to touch the platform we're gonna use another in operator here so let me zoom in a little bit okay we want to use the Y position of the gym so mission isn't Jim doesn't generate more than this Y position so the Y position has to be greater than 9 negative 9 negative 95 so it has to be credited so use the operator and use the back here say Y position and should be greater than negative 95 so somewhere on the top and it should be maybe a right here right so 140 ish maybe and it should be less than 140 so we'll put and the Y position is nest and 140 so which are generated Jim pitch in these two area here and repeat until is not not theirs and career than the disposition in less than is efficient else will want to go to random position and then we'll show okay and then we'll add the call for the start so when green flag is clicked or say set variable can set set the score 20 and then we can use a forever loop to make it kind of flash so what's a forever look say change color effect by 25 then we are they use a sensing if oops if touching the this this treasure hunter so we'll say if touching treasure hunter okay whoa what changes name why I have two here then I was testing something earlier so sure it's correct I don't have anything okay all right so with touching treasure hunter okay we'll change the score change change the score by one going up and we'll play this sound I have the favorite aspect yep already loaded so we'll say sound place down fairy dust and then we'll hide it hide us Jim and what we can do is we can like wait for three seconds or something like that however one many second you want to wait and then we get well going to call the random position again so move the ship to another location all right and initially you can set that Jim maybe right here or something like that if you want then you know this Jim will always go here right okay now let's start you can see the Jim is flashing i catched it it went away so let's get up you can get that right in running sly so let's lie and try to catch this gym here so you can't do that so so this is pretty much it we can add the sound in the background you can use whatever sound you like um you can use a forever loop and when the flag is clicked we can say control forever and what we want to do is we can upload a sound or you can use one of the random sound I had one of this down I previously done so this one will try to play this one so place this song sound here say until Dunham's will repeat okay let's say this let's test again one more time just take some time to say because the wav file is kind of big I'd be one you can just use any kind of file here at you and you know music they have a lot of actually you can go here you can find here say let's say you say search there's plenty of loop music you can use you know one up this down or not anything that's fine okay alright so let's start this game again we'll save everything oh whatever rename it call it media scratch platform game okay alright let's make it big let's try to run this right now you can see decorations I think one decoration the table everything facade to our house that might not work well this because of the white is white little light thing so it kind of mashed a cream color match do you like the stall and so just depending on the situation you can use the up the taxes and the portion all that you can add to this game so this is I don't have anything that way you can see some have level one right so but as you can see just like the ninja game you can create multiple level and hopefully something out for this again okay alright alright alright see you guys next time
