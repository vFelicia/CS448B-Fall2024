so welcome back guys to kids cutting playground today we'll be making the second part for the space shootout game so i will be um i will be sharing this project so if you have any confusion on it you can just check it out on my scratch account so i'm just gonna review the code so this is the movement code and setting stuff in the beginning for the player one this is for player two the movement for player two and laser one over here so this is the code for the player one laser and this is the code for the laser laser for the second one laser one and laser two are pretty much the same thing except for some different sensing you just have to switch it switch it around and one more thing we have to add so this is if this is for if the player will die so if the shield will need this later so if uh the shield is less than or equal to zero the player one shield this is for player one so if the player one shield is less than or equal to zero then we can broadcast a new message we'll need this message later called hide player one shield hide player one shield will need the same code for player two if if the uh player two shield is less than or equal to zero player two shield is less than or equal to zero then we'll broadcast another message we'll call it hide player 2 shield so let's go here hide hide player to shield hide player two shield we'll need those broadcasts later so let's work on the shields right now so this is the outside shield the player one shield one so when flag clicked i want to show it and get a forever loop forever i want this to go to the player player one this is for the player one shield and i i made this uh outside shield turn five degrees at five degrees to the right and if it's touching if touching the player two shield one touching player two shield one so if it's touching this outer shield player two shield one so this is to prevent them from going near each other because i found it a bug where if you uh you um if there's no bounce if they don't go bouncy if they touch each other and they don't bounce apart then one player can get on top of the other and kill them immediately so we need to broadcast a new message called bounce we'll need that later bounce and right here from the player one we broadcasted hide player one shield so when i received that we want to hide and then for the player 2 shield it's pretty much the same thing except we do not need that last bit of script of the bouncing part we do not need this this part right here this part we do not need and instead of five degrees instead of turning right five degrees we can turn left i made it turn seven degrees to the left you guys can make it however slow or fast you want the faster it is the harder it is to get it through both the shields so i did um turn left one of them and for the right i did turn right on them so um we can so now you have to turn right and turn left so it's opposite and for player one when it receives bounce then we can like change the x by negative thirty so they cannot come together okay and then for player 2 it's um we also have to do the same thing for the bounce just drag and drop it into player two and instead of negative 30 we're going to do 30 since it's already pointing to the left so making it go even more to the left wouldn't make sense so we have to make it 30 since it's already pointing to this way and then finally for the um and then for the text we have text this for winning and losing so from the uh players we broadcast i mean the lasers we broadcasted a message called player two and player one dead right here so i already have the costumes so player one wins and player two wins i made one in red and one in blue because this one's blue and this one's red so i'm just gonna add the code so when i res when i receive player two player one dead when i receive player one dead switch costume to costume one which is the first costume which is player one um i'm sorry sorry um switch to the costume two because when the player one is dead we want to switch to the second one noting that the second second player has one and then we want to show and stop all and then we need to duplicate this instead of player one dead we'll use player two dead player two dead instead we'll switch costume costume one since the player two is dead that means the player one is winning and then we want to show stop ball and then when flat clicked we want to go to zero zero which is the center go to the front layer and hide in the beginning okay so next finally we have to do the ladybug alien code okay so first for the ladybug alien with whatever you want to call it we have to create a custom block called create alien create alien click ok and then for this one every uh every time you'll clone two of them so repeat two times create a clone of myself and then for uh get a one fly clicked when flag is clicked we want to set this variable we made in the beginning set the alien set for player 1 that variable to 0 in the beginning and then i want to set the size to 50 percent the alien should be 50 so it's not too big and then i'm going to wait one second and then and then it'll start creating aliens after one second so you call this block this code right here create alien and then in the scrolling platformer i also did this so we want to set the x to negative 99999 so then the actual alien not the clone will get off the screen sometimes the hide does not work and i'm just going to put the hide here just in case so after that we want to get when i start as a clone when i start as a clone let's make it soon a little bit when i started to clone i want to go to pick random i want to make it pick random negative 200 and oh no you don't need this one negative 200 to 200. so the aliens will spawn from this x position so like this one somewhere in between and then for the y i made it 150 so it'll be like spawn like above here and i want to show after that show and then after that um we we need to make a variable called flying to spaceship name in the beginning i told you there's one in the first video i told you guys there's one variable for this spread only so since i already i got this from a backpack that's why it already has it but this is for this sprite only make this variable called flying to spaceship name and it should be only for this sprite so remember that and then we want to set the flying to spaceship name to blank in the beginning to nothing and then if get an if else statement if that uh alien set her player player one is equal to zero alien set for player one then we can set the flying to spaceship name to player one player one player one and set the alien set for player one to one else we will do set flying to spaceship name to player two so this is just to pick random which spaceship the alien will go for and you have to spell it exactly how it's like or it'll get messed up and then we need to get a point towards point towards the flying to spaceship name so it can be either the player one or the player two and then we wanna get a repeat until repeat until the um is touching the flying to spaceship name whichever one player one or player two and then we move three steps move three steps if touching edge if it's touching the edge touching edge then we'll move it back to pick random pick random uh go to pick random negative 200 to 200 so if it's touching the edge we'll make it go back somewhere up here and the y is 150 and duplicate this so oh my god oops duplicate at this right here get an ore if it's touching the laser one or laser two laser one or laser two so if it's touching either one of those we want it to disappear um so we'll make no not disappear but make it just respawn somewhere up here to make it look like the laser will kill it or something and then next we want to get if touching if if it's touching we need three oars actually we only need two i think so and then we'll need it to do um if touching player one player one or player one uh shield shield one player one shield one or the player one shield two then we wanna broadcast player1.hit and wait player1.hit and wait and then we want to make it go back to this random position and then we want to just duplicate this whole chunk of code put it under here instead of player one we'll do player two instead of player one shield one do player two shield one and instead of player one shield two we'll do player shield two uh player two he'll to and then we'll broadcast player 2 got hit and then we'll make it go back to random position okay so now we are done we can save our project and i will show you guys and i also forgot to do one last thing add the code for these so i'm just going to drag and drop it for the red red shields forgot about that drag right here so for here instead of we'll do hide player two shield instead this one's hide player one shield this is hide player two shield and instead of go to player one we wanna make it go to player two and if touching player one shield one instead and then right here hide player two shield go to player two and turn instead of turn five degrees we make it turn we do not need this piece of code as well make it turn to the left seven degrees there you go so now let's play it so as you can see oh yeah let me show the variables of the shield so that you can see the health go down so i'm just going to move this on this side move this on this side i'm going to double click on it so then i'll be like that so my dad will be playing here so it's wasd and spacebar and then i'll do i'll be playing as player two so as you can see you can't go together and actually shot he actually my dad actually shot me through here so yeah that's pretty much the game and i also forgot one last thing to add the music so i actually download a noncopyright music from the youtube uh audio list so i need to get the sound it's just i'm just gonna upload it you guys can do get whatever you want i just got a short song i guess i'm just gonna do that and the song is kind of soft so i'm gonna turn up the volume a little bit so okay um and also i'm gonna make the hp for this a little bit lower maybe like 500 just so i can show you how the shield disappears at the end when you lose all your health and then so i'm just gonna destroy one shield oops i actually shot through it okay i might as well also change the bullet damage so then i can have like maybe 50 negative 50. let's see so as you can see i just destroyed the enemy shield as you can see boom it's already gone so i'm gonna show you guys one more time oh i actually went through see now the shield is gone and you can just one shot them so that is the game the twoplayer a twoplayer space shootout game and um
