hello welcome back guys to kids coding playground so today we'll be finishing up the center run platformer game finally it's been a long long one for this one so this is the last episode of this uh game uh in in this episode we'll do the high score just simple high score and maybe a thumbnail drop down in the snow that's about it so um next time maybe i have some time i'll do like a table you can actually see like what is the high score of the uh people who got the lowest time or whatever maybe later when i have some time pretty busy right now so let me finish this uh this last episode for the center platformer game okay so i think you guys have probably if you have already watched the video from the first one to the ninth episode so this is the 10 one so this will be the last so in here we'll quickly go through how we're gonna do the uh snow effect and then the thumbnail and then high score okay real quick we will paint a new sprite oh yeah also i changed the sound i think got one of the kids who's playing he didn't like this ouch sound i made so i actually download i'm going to delete it i download a new one actually so i'm going to delete it i'm going to upload this one here uh so i don't know if this maybe it sounds better i don't know like that like like a chrome sound like that so i'll change it out i think the kids like doesn't sound good so let me just switch it out just reset this making sure so let's just test it out so let's see yeah so okay maybe it sounds better than what i'm recording so anyway okay so let's work on the snow um so that with that out of the way let's paint so painting news right really simple uh which is one white color so and then we don't want any outline i just kind of zoom in a bit oops sorry select the circle you can hold it so that way you know it kind of paint a perfect uh sprite uh you want to maybe make it smaller a little bit i think originally i have like around 12 or 11 or whatever so you can see while moving you see like 13 out of 13. so let's see so this is 11 now 11. i think it's 11 out of 11 that's still enough uh maybe you can rename it to snow doesn't matter okay so let's go uh click on the green flag okay when green black is clicked uh what we're going to do is we're going to set the ghost effect looking at light uh making it uh um appear okay so we're going to set it make it disappear for the ghost effect so if you click on this you'll see this white dot disappear when you set it goes effect to 100 see it kind of goes away so to reset that you can always use this clear graphics effect right so i'll come back okay but uh for now we just don't need that we're just gonna go with the codes effect uh then we are going to make it go to it doesn't really matter i think i have it like 220 so we can go to the center on the top next we'll use the forever loop sorry okay we need to make a variable so make a variable uh for this sprite only called wind so this is the wind speed for the snowflake uh you can set set win okay and you can say pick random negative one to one then you seems called uh create a clone myself and do a weight sorry wait then use the operator again just pick a small number here 0.005 to 0.001 so fraction of a second okay next we will say um when i start as a clone with this column the clone right so you are going to have to say when i start as a clone okay it's in this control block okay so here we will set the size of the snowflake so whenever create one we can make a random size so you can say set size and you can pick a random i did like 60 and 100 i mean you can make it a little bit bigger a little bit smaller depend on you okay and then i will say go to all right so i can go to the top uh but uh i'm gonna pick a random here so uh negative 240 to 240 so basically when they create a clone it will be like between 60 to 100 percent so either bigger or smaller somewhere on the top here for the win variable we can kind of hide that we don't really need to show that what we're going to do is we're going to repeat to a repeat loop four let's say change the ghost effect here by negative 20 okay so a little bit brighter and then we are going to use this repeat do it two times so what happened is i'm gonna make it go down first a little bit before i start the loop actually make it touch and disappear because if i don't do that uh if i have something called touch edge it will just get stuck here and then disappear immediately so what we do is repeat two times i'll make it go down a little bit so to go make it go down say change y okay don't make don't use the set y okay make sure you change y change y by minus five and then we say change x by the wind speed okay this is the wind speed of the snow make sure it's for the sprite only and then here move over here uh what we do is we're going to use a repeat until loop so making sure when it touch the uh the santa claus or the the ground or the the enemy it should disappear so what we want is we're gonna touch the virtual ground not the ground okay because the ground with the tree in the back you don't want it to touch the tree and immediately disappear we want it to kind of go through all the way you know to the bottom sorry clicked on it all the way to the bottom of the ground then disappear um so what you can do is get this repeat two uh we're gonna use a couple all operator uh one it depends on which one you want so let's say we wanted this guy to you know touch this it should disappear this guy i don't really think you need this guy because this guy and this guy will probably the same right because this is on top of this so you might need like animated character virtual ground right background you don't need you need the spike you need this and you need maybe the snow or snow pod you don't need you like let that fall through and then the igloo right so whatever you want okay so what i'm going to do is um so i'm going to create more of this duplicate and then duplicate hopefully you have enough if not we can create one more okay so first we'll put the anime character okay next we'll put the virtual ground okay next we put the enemy okay which is the uh the tiger okay uh next we'll put the uh we can put the spike in the igloo and then we buy the edge so we're gonna do one more actually so next i'm gonna go with the spike and then we'll say igloo and then last one water edge okay all right so let's zoom back out so we have these main character virtual ground enemy spike igloo and edge okay so what i want to do is when they keep i will make them keep going down until it touch until you touch this so what you need to do is kind of same thing over here um going down until i touch it okay and then we're gonna grab another repeat loop here and we can say make it go lighter okay say change the ghost effect okay change the close effect by 10 after that we say we can delete it okay so delete this clone okay let's test it out see how it looks save it so you can see the snow kind of fall when it touched the the ground it kind of disappeared or touch the santa claus you can see when it touched the santa claus it kind of faded and then goes away so that's how this is used this to look okay so you can see if you touch the spike it also goes away if you touch the tiger let's see so you can see the tiger so the snow will touch the tiger right and it goes away say same thing so whatever you want it to go away you have to make sure that you know you you have that so you see it touch the edge using that and touch the edge over here and it also went away okay so that's about for the snow okay all right um what we can do is we can do the thumbnail next okay so the thumbnail i already have something in my backpack but uh you know you guys can come do it yourself as well let me just say painting this right and then i'll drag this costume here okay so what i did was pretty simple right just take the background so uh let's say if you're gonna do the thumbnail all by yourself just say control a copy oop sorry why while i click that so i just go to here go to my costume right this is my own one so what you can do is just go to the new one you copy from that group it together so that this is your thumbnail right because i i put a couple of them of them together so that's why you have this line so what you can do is you can convert the bitmap and then convert back to vector so now it's one big file so you see one big file so now if you want to make a thumbnail right you can look at these right so you can just copy it from like the ground right whatever it is so let's say you take this whole thing ctrl a will select all control c copy and then you go to your thumbnail go back over here you can just put it here so something like this then you can stick your santa claus guy you know find the one that you like maybe the running one ctrl a because ctrl c go back over here kind of adjust him a little bit you know and then if you want the tiger ctrl a copy ctrl c control v so now the tigers here you want to make them bigger if you have them bigger you want to flip them around click on this flip horizontal then you know you can add some something else at the rock or whatever you like right just like how i did here so i added a rock uh added some gym added a rock i had a ice block out of the snowman and then out of the text so that's how you would do it for the uh you know a thumbnail so let's just trash this for now okay so what we're going to do is we want to make the thumbnail glide down i think we have shown that many times on our channel how to do that um so what you want to do is so since this uh this one use a timer itself so we cannot really use that timer uh like uh using when timer greater than the timer plus one so what we have to do we're gonna have to create a new variable for this okay so you can make it for another variable or you can say stop timer right you can create any way you want but i just use all cap so this is not really used for me just for the s making it you know uh for the for calculating the thumbnail to go down so what you can do is go r1 green flappers click okay so say look we'll hide it and uh you can go so what i'm going to do is going to set it to the top say 0 let's say 300 and then i will say go to front layer okay then i will have um set the stop timer to 0.1 and then grab a forever loop here and then we're going to duplicate this actually okay and then here we will use operator add we're gonna get the timer oops sorry my bad and then say plus zero that one okay okay so all right so after that you're gonna go create another block here there's a block say loudness right select timer here drag it over here and then drag this variable timer okay so when you stop the screen you want this thing to drop down okay so what we want to do is when this thing drop down you want to highlight level score live whatever right so you can do that so what you can do is say hi oh no i need to save it what happened oh something's from scratch oh good i'm able to save it so high the level so hi the life hide the score hide the time to have the time oh i didn't even have time okay so we want to see how fast you you go right so we're gonna start the time okay so what we can do is we can add or create another vehicle called time uh this is for orders right so we're gonna add the time somewhere on top here as well um so let's continue with this thumbnail we're gonna get the time later so let's do the time and then if you want the fastest time create another one let me get the cloud variable fastest time okay got it so crowley will only support letters and number i know that number but not better that's why sometimes you cannot create like a table easily with like like who's the first winner you know the name of the person so but i can show you next time how to do that actually there's a way to do that okay so let's say set so we'll hide this so i'm not set sorry let's hide it okay where's my cloud variable on top okay okay so we hide all this for a timer when uh you know when the game stops and then what we can do is make this go to the top 0 300 and then we'll say show and then we'll use this glide 0.5 to 0 0 so i do 0 0 because my actually my costume actually cover the whole screen right so zero zero will be good enough for me okay so i also need that when i start the game i need to show it again right so when i start the game start game uh we want to show all these variables or i can just copy that so show our level life score time and fastest time okay all right so we have all of them let's just check it out so we probably have some more bulk i'll show you how to fix it so let's say we stop this you see how the santa claus is still in the front so we need to hide this guy right okay so what you do is you go to the center go here um drag this thing can zoom in a little bit okay and then select the variable and then you say hi okay okay so when you have high make sure you have show so yes i have show should be good so let's try it again i start the game so i was playing let's say i'm playing him and then i say stop so you see this drops in and hides it okay all right so actually when i converted this thing it did not cover everything you see there's some background there so probably not a good idea when i converted the bitmap earlier so what you can do is go back in here actually make this a little bit bigger okay drag this guy a little bit bigger out a little bit okay make sure you cover everything okay i think maybe i accidentally moved it so let's try it again stop so cover everything for the thumbnail okay start so you can start so you can see score here maybe you can put a time i don't know this seems like there's a lot of stuff on here maybe the fastest time you can pin the bottom here okay so what we want to do is you know we're going to have to start the timer right the timer has not started yet so let's do that so uh what you can do is you can do it on any of the sprite uh you can do it in the thumbnail or anything that matter background um in my old game i actually did it on another sprite um but we can probably do in the thumbnail of the background doesn't matter let's just do in the thumbnail here okay so uh get another green flap is clicked okay we're going to set this variable so make sure we reset the variable so set timer to zero time okay what i'm going to do is um gonna make this a little bit of weight before it's count the game because uh we're gonna set it up right so we'll go away for a half a second and we can use a forever loop and what we do is we're going to set time to this timer variable so this timer variable will keep on going we'll set the time and then what you need is you can use another operator if okay and then you can use operator say um equal so i what i did was i did it at the level three so basically when the user got to level three that was the end of my game and then i will check if the fastest time is uh you know um it's uh it's good it's greater you know the time actually is less than the fastest time then we'll set it so what we do is we are going to set the to the if's condition here okay but whether set the fastest time to something first in order for this work because we're doing fastest time not more score right so because we have the fastest time set at zero then 0 is always less than the time so it won't work right so what you can do is this you can say take this one less so take this variable time fastest time so if your time is less than the fastest time then we want to set the fastest time to that time okay and then we also want to stop the script so whenever you don't need the script to run anymore make sure you stop it that way it will help your game you know not too laggy okay all right so this is how to have so what i'm going to do is gonna set the fastest time to something so that way you know something high in the beginning maybe let's set it to you know um 50 right but for me actually for this game i only had two level but on my original m3 level so i'll set it to like let's say 60 seconds i should be able to complete within 60. right so let's say i'll say save right so now if i say run so you see fastest 160 so you see my timing running so i just have to complete the first stage oh okay before 60 seconds i guess oh man okay got it oh almost died there okay so i got it so you see the timer stop because this is level two right we say if it's equal to level two and the time is less than that we'll set the fastest time to that so now the fastest time is 33 seconds 0.101.101 see so that's the fastest time so so for me actually if my okay i'm actually level three so level two you can play and then level three just one small stage and that's it okay so we can throw this away this code so now the game works perfectly uh should be so you run you see all the snow is fall falling down correctly right so there you go so this is the end of the uh the tutorial uh for this game i really hope you guys uh like it and enjoy the video and actually learn something from this video so if you don't like the center guy right you can always replace it with someone something you like like mega man on mario or whatever so you can make your own sprite as well right doesn't matter so i just teach you guys the concept here how to do the scrolling uh for this game so that's about it so um please give us a thumbs up on the video that will really help us and uh yeah if you have any questions just look at the uh the game uh uh the video description i have the link to the actual game and you can check out the code there okay all right so uh let's rename this project i think we cannot send a run teaching okay all right so this was my teaching project so i had to make it again after i made a real one all right guys see you guys next time have a have a good day bye
