hello guys it's kids coding playground here today we'll be doing a video on how to make an apple dash game so in our previous video we made about a week ago we demonstrated the game so if you want to check out how the game works you can go into that video and watch it and i demonstrate how the game works so yes today's i'm going to work on the tutorial because you guys gave us 50 likes so thank you guys for 50 likes so we're going to work on tutorials so first rename our project let's name it apple dash so apple dash is the name of the game and then we're going to trash the scratch cat okay let's upload the ghost sprite ghost so we're gonna get the ghost this one um that's gonna be our apple catcher the fruit catcher for the ghost we're going to be using the third costume but you can actually get some legs so like you can duplicate these legs onto the go see so then again looks like he has legs okay so this is optional but it'll make your game a little bit better i think okay let's duplicate one more what there you go can we make it go backwards backwards okay so there we go we got the two legs make them go to the back layer um so another ghost is there goes let's uh group this group okay let's we can trash the other costumes we do not need them needing this let's rename this costume to fruit catcher so this is going to be a fruit catcher so inside the fruit catcher we're going to have to when green fly clicked um let's zoom in i think i'm going to move the fruit catcher like about here okay and i think i set the fruit catcher to i think 90 percent uh yeah 90 i think that's what i did so i'm gonna make it go about right here okay so i'm gonna make it go to let's put x zero y negative one negative one fifteen let's make an even number so we're gonna go to that position gonna make a couple variables let's make let's delete this variable and name make another variable called money so with money you can buy other upgrades for your apple catcher so we're going to set the money to zero in the beginning and we're going to make a new variable called characters so you can buy a skin in this game which is the pig skin so in the beginning we're going to set the character to the ghost so care director oops character you know that's nice yes character okay so for all sprites we're going to set the character to ghost in the beginning ghost and then we're going to make another variable called run so this is to control the speed of the player so we need a variable to make it move left and right because um there's an upgrade that makes the ghost quicker so that's why we're gonna need a variable so run we're gonna set run to eight which is gonna be eight speed basically so run to eight and then we're gonna switch the costume to the fruit catcher fruit casher i'm gonna name a fruit catcher one because we're gonna have to pig and all that stuff so we're gonna have this all right now we can get a backdrop so let's look here so i got the jungle i think not the jungle it was something else i mean you guys oh yeah force you guys can pick any backdrop you would like i'm just going to pick this one okay um and for the backdrop i got some trees just delete this one i got some trees from here so i'm gonna not choose a backdrop i want to upload some sprites into here so i got some trees so let's get a tree so tree you can remember you can always just copy paste in here so just select your tree group it copy ctrl c go into the backdrop let's go to vector control v boom you got your tree right here so it's pretty cool i'm gonna make it a little bit smaller okay select this one more time ctrl c ctrl v i'll put two trees i guess oh like that right okay and then because we're not gonna eat that and then we're gonna get the apple and put some apples on the tree i guess so let's go inside we're going to make the apples a bit smaller so we're going to group that which we'll see ctrl v and then we're going to make it a little bit smaller like about that big maybe a little bit smaller okay and let's copy paste this ctrl v put one like right here we'll copy about two more let's put one right here and let's put one right here let's put one right here okay so now we have like two apple trees okay now we're gonna make a fruit sprite and we'll have a bunch of costumes inside so we're gonna need the apple okay so inside the apple with the costumes we are going to get the orange banana and all those stuff so orange orange we're going to be using this orange we also have the banana bananas put those inside and we're also going to get the watermelon watermelon watermelon and we're also gonna get the strawberry i believe they have a strawberry as you can see they do so we're gonna be using the strawberry watermelon let's just take that out watermelon okay so for we're gonna rename the sprite to fruits fruit one because we want more fruits so we're gonna have multiple sprites for fruits i'm gonna set the size of 75 right here yeah so the fruit's a bit smaller as you can see okay so for the fruits we're going to add some code in it later so first let's go back to our ghost or let's rename this player so let's rename this sprite to player okay now we're gonna make the movement of the player so so we're going to create a begin button sprite so before the ghost will show up we're gonna have to have a begin button sprite so we're gonna get the uh green button this thing so in the beginning we're going to get some text let's make it white so i'm gonna write begin okay put that like right here okay that thing i should do and then we're gonna copy paste it flip it over and hold down shift if you want it to be perfect all right now we have the begin button okay let's group all this okay for the begin button let's name it beacon okay so this is the begin button so for the begin button so before we get into the code in the begin button we actually have to broadcast a message from the backdrop so from the backdrop we're going to get a one green flag clicked we're going to set uh we're going to hide the variable uh let's make a new variable i forgot to make score score and we're also going to make a variable called high score and it's going to be a cloud variable um so what's high school so we're going to be using high score and score so in the beginning we're going to hide high score and hide the score variable and after that we're going to broadcast a message called start screen so this is going to be broadcast to the begin button start screen start screen so let's go to the begin button now so in the begin button we're going to want to receive start screen um let's hide this oh yeah actually in the uh goose we're gonna hide it in the beginning when i clicked hi and now we can go back to the begin button when we start screen let's put the begin button about right here i think that should be fine get this okay let's make it zero so it's more perfect and then we're going to set the brightness to zero in the beginning set brightness to zero and then after that we're gonna show and broadcast a message called spin button so we're gonna make the button spin like we do in other tutorials and then for the spin button when i receive spin button inside the button we are going to get a forever loop forever turn two degrees to the right um and if it's touching we're gonna need to and so if the mouse is on the begin button and it's clicking on it then it'll run something so if touching mouse pointer and mouse down so i want to make sure that you're clicking one thing we're going to set the brightness negative 10 to add a little bit more effect to it and set brightness to negative 10. and then we're going to wait until not mouse down wait until not done okay and then once it's clicked on we're going to play the sound pop and we're going to hide the button once it's clicked okay and then we're going to broadcast the message and wait called start game which will broadcast to the ghost and apple start the game and we're going to stop the script once this is done running so we're going to stop this skirt now let's go to our apple i mean our fruits okay so inside our fruit we are going to get a one green flag clicked so when the green flag is clicked we are going to hide the fruits in the beginning and when i receive start game when i receive start game we are going to set the fruit speed which is a new variable so we're going to name it fruit speed so this is the speed of the fruit so sometimes we'll have armageddons where the fruits will fall faster so that's why we're gonna use the fruit speed so we're gonna set the fruit speed to negative six and in the beginning we're going to show let's go to looks and show and we're going to go to a position so we're going to make it go to a pick random position to make it pick random negative 210 to 210 for the x 210 and for the y i think i'm gonna do 180 which is the top and we're gonna set the y to 180 actually i don't think this is necessary because we're already going to this actually i'll add it just in case so we're going to set y to 180 and then forever forever we're going to make it turn degree so we're just going to make a turn turn left 5 degrees and we're gonna change the y by the fruit speed which is negative six so it'll fall down by negative six and then we're going to do we're gonna make a new sprite so this is going to be a hit box so if it touches it then it will make it go back to the top so we're going to be painting it so let's get the line tool let's make it about five thickness okay and hold down shift then you get a perfect line across okay i can use the select tool and center it and then you can move the sprite this hit box right like down here maybe about right here yeah okay so for the hitbox sprite we're going to get the code later actually we can do it right now let's name it box hit box and then one green flag click go to this position go to and we're going to be using it to set we're going to set the ghost effect to 100 because if you hide it then it will not detect anything so if you send it to ghost effect which means it's disappears it will still detect stuff so for the fruit we're going to when after this we're going to get an ifthen statement so i'm going to import my basket sprite basket so we're going to be using a basket from the cashmere fruit so for the basket i basically did a circle as you can see we might put this into the google drive so you guys can get it from there or you can draw your own or there's a um bowl sprite so basically we just drew a circle with outline right here so as you can see it's just a circle's outline and then right here we just drew a rectangle with outline and then we just used the reshape tool to make it look more like a bowl i mean a basket and then we used the lines we just drew a couple lines to make it look like a basket and then right here we just made it bigger so we have this one upgrade where it makes the basket bigger so we just made a bigger version we just stretched out so yeah so this is the basket so we're gonna go to the code so player i mean not player fruit okay if touching if it's touching the basket then we are going to start the sound pop or chomp whatever doesn't matter what sound and then we're gonna actually i think pop sounds a bit better than chong because it might be quite annoying one pop is the most simple sound ever i'm gonna start the sound pop and then in the variables we have the change score by one okay and then after this we're going to go to a random position once it touches it we're going to go make it go back up so we're going to make it go to pick random 210 negative 210 to 210 same right there and 180. okay and we're going to set the y back to 180 um and we're going to switch the costume to pick random one to five so what this does is so random fruits will be falling down so we have five costumes so we're gonna make it swish costume to pick random one to five i'm gonna use the random put it right here five depends how many costumes you have and then we're gonna get another ifthen statement so if it's touching the hitbox which is the thing in the bottom if touching hit box then we're going to go to um i can just duplicate this this whole chunk and put it in here okay so this is the fruit that's gonna be the fruit falling again as you can see the fruit falls and of course the player is not done yet so we're going to work on the player and when it touches the basket it will gain one score so let's go back to the player the fruit catcher so when i receive start game in here when i receive start game we're going to um make a new variable let's name it hit bomb so later in the game we're gonna add bomb so if you hit the bomb then you'll lose one life so we're gonna name it hit bomb so in the beginning we're gonna set it to no because you have not touched the bomb so let's go okay and we're gonna show it when the game starts the player and forever if left arrow is being pressed key left arrow key left is being pressed and we're going to point direction of negative 90. 90 and we are going to move the amount of run steps which is eight so like that just duplicate this put it under if the right arrow is pressed i'm going to point direction of 90 obviously facing the right side okay and for the basket let's go to the basket so for the basket when fly clicked you want to switch costume to basket one which is the smaller basket and we're going to hide in the beginning and once i receive start game on the basket then we're going to show go to the front layer go to front layer and forever control forever go to the fruit catcher from the player go to the player so and we want to show the player at this point and we want to adjust it to where the basket is on top so when you click play it the basket will just go right there so the basket does not have to be centered now because you want it to be on top of him so we're going to do that kind of like that okay for the big basket tube we're going to have to do that as well so you wanna just go into the costume and find where you want to put the basket all right let's go back to the basket and okay i made one little mistake in the project so right here inside the player i set this to fruit speed to no instead so that's why you saw it was only rotating in one place so i should have set this to hit bomb so i actually didn't set that and one more thing you want to set the player you know this thing right here click that so that it will not flip upside down so as you can see if you don't then you'll flip upside down every time so you don't want that so we're going to obviously do that okay so save it i'm gonna demonstrate the game now so let's begin so when you hit every single uh fruit you get points and let me show the variable score uh where's this one here okay right there as you can see we're getting score and as you can see when the fruit hit the bottom they just disappear okay and i think i hid the variable score right here so when i receive start game we're probably gonna have to show it again so receive start game or you just set yeah we can just show it right here actually show variable score okay so when you begin the score will show automatically and we have to set the score to zero as well so let's set the score zero okay score and let's hide these variables here and only keep the money score and the swiping on this one okay let's go full screen all right so in the beginning begin button you catch the fruit you get one score the basket follows the main character yes we have the basic mechanics done you can now you can catch the fruits but we have some more mechanics we'll get into a shop in the future all right i think that should be it for the first episode of this series so thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share and subscribe and to our channel and i'll see you guys in the next tutorial you
