so hello guys it's kids coding playground here today we'll be doing a like a more advanced version of the turtle race so if you've not done the turtle race python project i suggest you to look at that video first before moving on to this one on this video it's a little bit more advanced we'll be adding like a winner so as you can see in this image right here red and purple are really close to each other you can't really tell which one's the winner so we're going to be adding a winning function where it compares the xaxis so we can see which one's actually the winner so let's start so first we're gonna make a new variable called winner turtle to tell which turtle wins turtle and then it's gonna be equal to turtle turtle and then oops let me put the shift key turtle and this parenthesis okay and then after that we want to win our turtle dot high turtle so we're going to hide the turtle so winner dot hide turtle so we're gonna hide the turtle first okay and then after that we're going to make the winter turtle pen up first so it's not drawing anything pen up and next we want to get a thing where we set the winner turtle to zero zero for now we'll change its axises later so we're just going to set it to zero zero for now winner turtle dot set x we're gonna set its x and y we really don't have to set the x oh i mean the y we're just comparing the x but we're gonna set it anyways okay turtle dot set y zero okay so we're gonna set to zero zero first and after that we're gonna get a map so we're gonna define the map as brackets first so we're going to put some more enters real quick okay so now you can see it better okay so we're going to go down here so um i just put some enter so we get some more lines so you guys can see it better so we are going to make a a map so we're going to do race turtle per curler dot map map no not that map and then we do equal sign equal to these curly braces and then after that we're so we're going to find the raised turtle map as the braces so okay we're going to have to get a key value pair so the key value pair is like the letter one the like the spelling one ome and the number one so we're like comparing those two so we're comparing red the red turtle red as the race toward one so we're going to write race turtle map and then we're going to do brackets and then put parentheses and then red like that i'm sorry accidentally did double quotes you have to do single quotes like this and this okay so the race journal map red is equal to the race turtle one so red is equal to the raised total one one actually no we don't have race turtle one we have my turtle one so race turtle one was um something else i had before so we're gonna do my turtle one one my turtle one so right here we have the my turtle one is equal to the turtle so we're gonna have to use my turtle one and not race turtle so we're gonna use my mind one and after that we're gonna do race turtle map and the brackets and parentheses and we're gonna do yellow yellow and then it's equal to race turtle i mean not race turtle my turtle two okay i'm used to saying race turtle um and then the third race turtle map we're gonna compare cyan with the race turtle three so the my turtle three so we're gonna do race students and this and then we're going to put cyan and now here we're going to do equal to my turtle 3 okay and finally we have one more which is purple race turtle map and then we're gonna do this and this and put this inside i will do purple is equal to my turtle four four okay and then next we're gonna do keys is equal to the my turtle uh race turtle map dot keys so we're going to keys is equal to race turtle map dot keys so this is defining the variable that okay and then next we can add something called print the keys so like after the thing will uh end it'll print all the keys it's just red yellow cyan and purple down here um um it's used for debugging usually but we can still use it i'll comment it out for now and i'll show you guys at the end print and then okay and then next we're going to do the winner color turtle color so this is like setting a variable to a blank link thing in scratch like you know in scratch how sometimes we have to set the variable to a blank thing so this is what we're doing right here so the winner turtle so because there's no winner yet that's why we're going to set it to blank so winner turtle color color when our turtle color is equal to these quotes just blank okay and then next we're going to get a repeat loop so for i and range so you can do any letter you'd like range we're going to repeat the length of the keys so the key is uh four which is red yellow cyan and purple so we're gonna do len and then put another parentheses and keys so this is a loop so you want to put a colon and tab and each key is equal to the keys of the index so first we're going to get the first one which is red is zero and then next it'll go for the next one which is yellow which is one as an example and then next we're going to go to two which is cyan and three which is purple so usually in coding except for scratch you start on zero so we're gonna get the keys of the index like that and then next line we're going to write each total is equal to the race terminal map of each keys okay so each the each key is um the my race turtle map each key we're getting this thing the first line my turtle one so so first we'll be getting the red one so the first key we're going for is the red so we're going to get it each turtle turtle is equal to the race turtle map race turtle map and we're going to do each okay okay and let me capitalize this real quick and let's capitalize it and then next we are going to find compare the x and x coordinates of the turtles to see which one is the winner so first we're going to get if each turtle dot the x coordinate is greater than the winner turtle then we're going to change it so we're going to get an ifthen statement if each turtle dot xcore and then put another parenthesis and then we're going to put a oops and then take that out i'm gonna do this so the greater than symbol so if uh yeah so i was supposed to do that i have to put another parenthesis like that sorry about that and then we're gonna do winner turtle dot x core and then do this and then we're gonna have to add a column because this is uh if then statement so if the each turtle of the x coordinate like we're here the the comparing we're comparing the keys right now so so let's say the red turtle is this one and the winner turtle remember we set the x to zero and set the y to zero so let's say the red turtle is like at 160 on the x so that's greater than the winner turtle so so if this is greater than it so then we're going to do this we're going to make the winner turtle turtle equal to the each turtle okay and then the winner turtle color is equal to each key so the winner color is equal to each key and each key right here is defined as the keys of the index like the red yellow cyan and purple okay and then next let me take out the tabs so now no more tabs anymore so next we are going to i'm going to comment this out for now but we'll look at it later so it's like we're going to print the winner turtle color okay so first before we go on to that we're going to uncomment this so i can show you this so let's do that and also one more thing uh when i said commented the print winner turtle color we can actually show it right now so then you guys can see which one's the winner so we're going to do print winner turtle color and then that so we're gonna run it now so let me save let's run okay so there's the turtles so let's see which one wins okay so as you can see it shows all the keys right here and the winner is the red one as you can see the winner is red and these are all the keys okay so now that's what it's for and then now we're gonna have to display which one's the winner onto the board right here so we're gonna do that pretty really quick right now so let's okay winner turtle message so this is another variable when internal message is equal to the word winner so we're just joining two things to make it like the winner whatever the winner caller is and then the turtle so the winner is i'm just going to put it in all caps because why not and then and then we're going to plus so we're going to add the winner turtle color and then we're going to also add the word turtle and then i'm going to add the word turtle oops let me click on here turtle okay let's add a space right here okay so next we're going to set the color of the font i mean the color of the text to white so it's easier to see setup turtle dot color i'm not set up qatar oh yeah we are using something else right here so i keep on forgetting so we're using uh turtle right remember we're using turbo is equal to this so we cannot use setup turtle so because in my old project i had setup turtle in it so that's why i keep on saying that but we have to use turtle okay all right so for turtle dot color we're gonna set the color to let's say white like i said earlier white and then make that lower case and then after that we're going to add a semicolon right here actually and then we're going to go down and next line we're going to set set up turtle's speed to zero so we're going to do the turtle dot speed zero and then next we're going to make the setup turtle or the turtle to pen up dot pen up and after that we're going to make it go to like negative 125 20 to negative 100 so that's somewhere like right here negative 120 and one negative 100 like somewhere right here so then you can see it so then we're going to do turtle dot go to go to and then we're going to put negative 120 and then we're going to do negative 100 so we're going to set it to that place and then we're going to write it we're going to set we're going to use the turtle we're going to set up the writing so turtle dot right winner turtle message so up here we define the variable winner eternal message as the winner plus the winner turtle color plus the turtle and then we're gonna set the font to arial font equals to error real 20 we're going to set the size to 20 and we're going to make it bold so there you go let's try it out so this is the code we had okay i'm just going to show it really quickly save and let's run so at the end it'll show the keys and all that so once the thing is finished so as you can see the cyan turtle actually won that if we didn't have this we would not be able to tell which one won actually look the purple and cyan are pretty close actually i wouldn't be able to tell so right here it also shows the cyan and shows the keys so i'm going to play it one more time for you guys okay and then um if you do not want this print and all that stuff you can comment it out and as you can see the purple turtle one so now it's much more accurate and it makes your little game much more cooler so i think that should be it for this tutorial thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share and subscribe and i'll see you guys in the next video
