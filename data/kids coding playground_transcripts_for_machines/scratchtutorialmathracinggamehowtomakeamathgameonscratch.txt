so welcome back guys to another tutorial on kids coding playground today we're going to be evaluating to the math game so we're going to turn it into a math racing game um we convert it from the math game so if you have not done the math game you guys should do the math game first before working on this one and the players will have to answer a math question and every question that answers correctly i'll move forward if it doesn't answer any questions correctly it'll just stay put and the dog is controlled by the ai it'll just move amount uh like six steps or something like every second and if the dog touches the finish line before the cat then you lose but if the cat touches the finish line before the dog then the dog loses so you want to beat the objective of the games just to beat the dog and today we'll be learning these following concepts in scratch uh actually we will not be using variables and custom blocks this is from the last episode so that's why it has these but we will be using the broadcast message loops i don't think we'll be using operator blocks but we'll be using some of these concepts from here so let's go back to our project so i'm gonna change this music right here because um we don't want to get flat our video flag for copyright so that's not a good thing so our video might get taken down if we do copyrighted music so i'm going to show you the game now so i added some modifiers to this game like credits and all that stuff but and i also added an intro you guys can add that if you want as well let's turn up the volume a little bit so i added an intro it was pretty simple to make so these we will not need to get into because i did music um so let's go with multiplication because it's this easiest so if you get a question wrong you'll just stay put if you get it right then you move forward if you get it right then you can keep moving forward so i'm going to try to repeat this real quick so as you can see um i'm pretty fast right now and the score still goes up right here so let's finish this real quick and i made it a little bit more funny so like when you lose you'll say that you failed or something um uh we're almost there oops go i think we got there i win and then i'll just say great job you beat the dog press the flag to play again and now you can enjoy the music so that's what i did at the end so that's what i have so let's go to our project we were working on okay so now we are inside our project will work we were working on earlier so this is the one i've been teaching you guys with so we're gonna go to the cat and i in the beginning i set the uh i made it go to um i think negative 204 negative 204 negative 58. and i also set the size of the cat to 60. um set the size of the cat to 60 and i'm actually going to upload some uh um backdrops into this one so let's go to backdrops backdrops so i have the um this is the winning meeting screen these are the intros um and this is the track the race track actually i move this like right here this is the race track so this is the racetrack for it and this doesn't look very good it's not very proportionate so i just moved it to the left a little bit so now it's covering the whole screen so now let's go to the cat put down the backpack again so i set it to negative 204 and why click negative 58 and i set the size of 60 so it'll be between the tracks and then for right here for like every single right answer we're gonna have to do this so when um after this when the answer is correct we need to broadcast a message let's call it correct answer correct answer so this will go to the um cat when it receives correct answer so it'll move forward so we're going to do that or here as well you're gonna have to do it for every single one here and finally in here so that's it we're here and then now we're going to have to receive the message so when i receive correct answer then we want to repeat 10 times move three steps so basically moving 30 steps move three steps and then i did next costume wait 0.1 seconds so look like it's running wait one seconds and then if it's touching the finish line and i have to get the finish line which i don't have so i'm gonna get that quickly okay so i just got the finish line from my other project so what i did for the finish line is basically a uh rectangle just a long rectangle so if you show it i put it right there and move it like right there actually i might have to like elongate it a little bit there you go center it a little bit smaller and look at that yeah that looks fine so that's going to be my um finish line it's just a rectangle so i'm going to go back into my cat let's go to the code and then um if i get an ifthen statement if it is touching the finish line touching finish line then i will make it say i win uh i win for two seconds i guess i win and then i'm gonna switch the backdrop to uh this backdrop um this one this backdrop so tell them that they won so i'm gonna go into cat and then make it switch to backdrop five which is the waiting backdrop and then i'm gonna stop the script after you win or you can just put stop ball i'm just gonna put stop all um and then now let's go to the dog so from the i just got the dog from the sprite library so let's go dog this dog i just got this one so i made it go uh when i receive start game which is a broadcast i made i believe start game right here then i want to show in the beginning uh go to front layer and repeat repeat until it's touching the finish line just like the cat um touching finish line so we're gonna make it move six steps that's what i did move six steps and then i'm gonna next costume wait one second so his two costumes are like sticking out his tongue so i'm gonna make a wait one second instead and then if he is touching the finish line then i'll make him say i beat you for two seconds i beat you for two seconds and then i played the sound dog so i just play the sound that's what i did and then i'm gonna broadcast a message called you lose and then i'm going to hide and stop all so that's what i'm going to do and then i'm gonna get a one flag clicked show and i made the uh uh dog go to negative 183 negative two for the x and y position and i made him hide and actually actually don't even need this show i don't even know why i put it there but um when the backdrop switches to backdrop five which is the winning screen i want it to hide so one backdrop switches to backdrop five then hide gotta do the same thing with the cat so i dropped your sister then finally for the backdrop remember for i made like a little intro of the end flashing in the back i know it's not a good intro but you guys can do anything else so when i receive start game in the beginning i want to switch back up to backdrop one which is the first backdrop this one so after that i'm gonna run flat clicked uh actually no we switched to backdrop too sorry about that so when you start the game you switch to backdrop too and then we're gonna get one flag clicked repeat five times switch backdrop to backdrop seven actually up to backdrop seven which is the um the flashing stuff i'm gonna wait 0.35 seconds that's what i did three five i just experimented until i found the right number and then i'm gonna switch the backdrop back to backdrop eight and then after that let's switch back to backdrop two actually no we're switching it right here i forgot about that so we're gonna do backdrop one right here for now and then i'm gonna get a forever loop set the volume to 40 because you actually don't you don't have to do that but i actually had a medieval song because but back then i had another song that was really loud so i set it to 40 so i actually did the medieval medieval one sound you guys can pick whatever sound you want and i'm just gonna play this on medieval one and so on so for the finish line i'm gonna get a one flag clicked go to this position and hide 228 y negative 22. that's where it is right now um and then when backdrop switches to backdrop two then we can show which is backdrop two is the oops backdrop two is the racing backdrop so i'm gonna show and then after that when backdrop switches to backdrop five then we're also gonna hide so yeah so yeah that's the code for the finish line so i'll show on the racing backdrop and i'll hide on the backdrop five the winning backdrop so i think that's pretty much it see what else we can add oh yeah anna losing losing screen yeah losing so i'm going paint a new sprite i'm gonna make it like a red color um put marker because it's easy to read remember you lose okay so remember we broadcast and fail on the um so you can hold down alt if you want so keep the sprite centered when you make it bigger so when the dog right here touches the finish line it was broadcast you lose so we're gonna get a one flat click right here i wanna hide this in the beginning and i'm gonna make it go to zero zero which is the origin zero zero and then when i receive um you lose then i want to show and go to the front layer go to front layer and show so that's pretty much it let's try it out now everyone i found out a bug while i was testing so in the beginning you want to actually hide i actually got the backdrops incorrect i'm sorry about that guys so up here where it's supposed to have a one flag clicked you have to replace it with the switch when this backdrop switches to backdrop one then you will execute all this code under here so that's one mistake i did and the other is inside the um backdrop i think yeah and these two are backwards i actually did it wrong i actually did it as backdrop one earlier which is wrong so you have to switch these two so that was um wrong so and the dog one last thing i wanted to make this dog at size 65 i think yeah i said at 65 so let's try it out now it should work so as you can see the intro place and i'll say let's play a math game answer the following questions press the quit button to stop all answers uh choose one of the operations are random so let's see so that's correct you move forward so it's working as you can see so i'm gonna try to beat this dog and after i beat the dog i'm going to let you guys see what happens if the dog wins i'm going to like set the dog up going like 20 steps every time so 50 or something like that so i can show you guys what happens almost there i think one more should do there we go so now great job you beat the dog oh yeah and i can also make this hide if you want to do that quit you can just say when backdrop switches when backdrop switches to backdrop five which is the winning backdrop then you can hide so yeah as you can see it is working right now so i will show you what happens when you lose so let's do that make it like 50 steps and yes i need to show this in the beginning one flag click hide and when backdrop switches to backdrop two i think is the racing one yeah so switch to backdrop two so we can quit when backdrop switches back drop two then we wanna actually show this so let's try it out this time i will let the dog win i put it at 50 steps or something like that let it finish talking random beat me already so looks like the dog is going pretty fast so you'll say i beat you and then you'll say you lose as you can see so that's it for this tutorial on how to make a math racing game uh thank you
