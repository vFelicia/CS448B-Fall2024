welcome back guys it's kids coding playground here and today we're back for the ball game so this is actually the second part so we can just name this the um the bali game so just like that seem a happy diwali that's all that correct yeah i think i did all right happy default and then um so we have some code from the last part so from part one so um here it is pause whenever you need to when the green flag is clicked just um you can just copy all this code this is the rocket currently and we're going to work on the sparkles in the backdrop in this um part so and the diwali candle so if you don't have anything uh any uh um if you don't have this code you can pause whenever you need it and rocket two basically the same as rocket one just a little bit and pause whenever you need to again and rocket three uh this is all the code for rocket three so pause whatever you need so before i start please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below for what else content you want so anyways let's get started so we're gonna work on the backdrop first so when the green flag is clicked it will switch backdrop to the night city because it's the night city and this is the night city backdrop this is the flash backdrop so you have like a little fun effect uh after when you're done i think in the july 4th fireworks we also did that one so you can it's just a fun effect so we also have a sound it was dance around and remember you can find whatever sounds you want from the loop section up here so dance around at this code please i'll play dance around until done and now when i receive bang bang and switch costume switch backdrop to flash it'll wait point one second and switch costume switch backdrop to night city again so we're gonna work on the sparkles and the happy diwali as we as you guys saw in the demo so um in the in the um thing you saw in the demo you guys saw the code for the i mean not code the cool effect and the diwali happy diwali after when you blast the fireworks so you guys saw that so let's work on that code right now so when the green flag is clicked it will hide and repeat 300 times and create a clone of himself so myself not himself so that's how you basically do it and then when i receive bang it will repeat 100 times and change color effect by two we also need some other code so when i receive bang then it will set color effect to pick random negative 100 to positive 100 so doing this will make it more colorful and more joyful and this will make 300 sparkles of it uh themselves so make 300 sparkles of the thing so when i receive bang again then it will set speed to so we need a new variable called speed for this sprite only so it will not have any uh for any other ones like including sparkles 2 or sparkles 3 but we will get to that so a variable name speed already exists oh ok so there already is a speed i think this is already for the sprite itself so i put in the backpack so it's already there so so it will set speed to pick random point three two three zero point one the third now set ghost goes to zero which means it will be visible it goes to 100 will be invisible goes to zero it goes effect to zero is visible you know change color effect by 25 and i'll set pen so we have the pen if you didn't do that in the last part we have it over here so there's not a pen all these dudes makey makey all this stuff so we use pen and none of these other dudes so and it was pen it'll set pen color to green so we already have a green and let's put it as a out of green so it's getting more colorful and pen up even though my favorite color is blue it's green and because in the demo we use green so i'm going to use green and then i'll go to it it will pen down and it will point in direction where's that block point in direction pick random direction let's pick random negative 180 to positive 180 and it will show what it will also do is reset timer so we're using a timer to control the fireworks speed and stuff like that so i'll reset the timer and then it'll repeat 50 times oh move speed by steps so move speed steps and it will change the ghost i mean oh yeah i forgot to do something before that so let's set speed to speed divided by yeah so speed divided by um oh sorry about that guys so we were supposed to do the one before that so move speed steps we don't need the set speed yet so it will change y by zero minus so zero minus timer then we use this thing afterwards but it's going to be in a while so it's a timer and then we can just duplicate this because we need another repeat 50. add that on and you still have to move speed steps and then you need to set speed to speed divided by right here speed divided by 0.9 and we'll move three steps we already did that because we duplicated that so if you do not have that put that right there and it will change ghost effect where's the change change ghost effect by pick random one two three no hide and erase all so this last block is to make it more colorful and it will make it hide in the end so we can also add uh so if you do not have this code you can do it you can um look at it right now so yeah so as you can see it will work and we'll do the rest of it so click on the candle bam bam bam these will explode into nothing because you don't have their kids yet so we can that's basically it and then um we need the rocket sparkles we can duplicate this and make sparkles too and then instead in sparkles two so instead of receiving bang you'll receive bang two and instead of receiving bang you'll receive bang two for everything basically and up here and then we decided to set the pen color to a different color i used purple and um pen up go to rocket 2 and set a regular rocket so you just may make some changes rocket two in the point direction but we got that correct and yeah that's basically all we need so as you can see it will work click on the candle bam bam lighted bam bam and the last one just goes into nothing because yet so let's code that right now and we just need to duplicate this and change some things instead it's bang three and this is bang three and this is bang three this is go to rocket three i think for the sparkles three we used um we used the yellow color so yellow and then it'll pen up go to rocket 3 and that's basically all we have here so i think it will work so i'm just going to take out some variables so uh let's take out all these as you can see it will work frequently light them up yeah so it's working and then we can also um get our things so h is for happy diwali so right up here letters so h h h right here and i don't even know why h is not the first one in the when i search for h so a isn't even the first one anymore so let's go letters oh because it's blocking it's called block a and then p block p duplicate that p and then so and y so i w a looks like a jumbo right now l plus sprites i so it's all jumbled up so let's just break them and spell it out so uh there's this code is all the same for all of them so you can just keep on dragging it into them so i think i have two p's right there p p y and then duh d i w a l i perfect and for the h you just need all the same code for all of them so when the green flag is clicked clear graphic effects it'll hide when i receive happy diwali then i'll set color effect to pick random 1 to 300 no show so all of them is the same code so you can just keep on dragging these so you shouldn't we'll we'll check them afterwards so we have them right here so so we have it for p2 so let's keep on dragging so we have the p so we got two over here y d i oh i don't have one i w a oh hi i think that might be it so i'm gonna demo it to you i'm gonna show it as full screen and before i end this recording please like
