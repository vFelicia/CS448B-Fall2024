so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding playground so today we'll be doing um the uh we're going to be doing the collectibles and the portal and we'll add some more levels so as the last time in the last episode so we got the wall jumping you can jump around you can die if you fall off and you can also die when you touch spikes so yeah that's what we had from last time but the problem is we need more levels and there isn't a portal at the end and we also need collectibles so today we'll be adding that stuff so for my collectibles i downloaded some fruits or online uh you guys can actually just draw a coin or something just like draw a simple circle and then also drag this in the portal portal is actually quite simple to do i just draw i just drew two portals so you need a closed portal a closed portal is when there's still um when you haven't collected all the collectibles you can probably do like a black circle and then you need an open portal to let the player know that they have collected all the collectibles and they can go and advance to the next level and you can also use uh so i did the fading as you can see there um i did i clicked this one you can swap the colors and click whatever color you want i just did like a blue and white fade color i did and i also did a border outline for it and then i drew it all inside of one big blue circle and then i grouped it and then for the close portal it's similar just duplicate the open portal and then just uh you can just make it another color or something like that so now let's go on to the collectibles so collectibles has similar code to the danger so you can drag the position in it drag the clone drag the reset and drag the green flag you can drag actually drag everything and we will add code to some of the parts let me separate it now okay so now it's separated so for the cologne clone at x and y um we have to add another part so put this out for a second uh we want to change the collected max by one at the end of here so the collected max is the maximum amount of coins or collectibles you can collect and then if you have if you have a costume i'm gonna throw this away if if you have like costumes like my fruits i have different type of fruits then you wanna get a switch costume switch costume pick random one to eight because i have eight costumes if you don't have any costumes you will not need this code so i have eight costumes and then i will add this create a clone myself at the end so now let's get on to here tick when i receive tick you want to get it if touching player if touching the player then we want to change the collected by one which is the amount of collectibles there are so if the collected is equal to the collected max so let's say the number of collectibles you collected is equal to the maximum amount of collectibles you can collect then we can broadcast the new message called open portal so this the portal will receive this open portal let's open portal and then we want to delete the club at the end right here delete this clone and then so yeah that's the code for the uh collectibles and also this is just we've changed this out so remember we did the mouse thing in our backdrop when you press m it'll go to the position the x and y position coordinates up here of your mouse so wherever you want to put a collectible like say right here or something then you press m and then you just go into your uh collectibles sprite and then you enter the x and y position of where the m is so that's how you um make your x y position but i have different coordinates so i did negative 170 uh 100 uh and then 10 right here and then 100 and why 40. so oh yeah and don't forget the code the m code is inside the backdrop and i will demonstrate one time how you do it so i have so i will go like you have to run the game and let's say you want to put a collectible right here you press m so 887 negative 14. so i will go to the collectibles and i will set a clone set a clone at 887 negative fourteen and negative fourteen right here so the collectible will appear somewhere around here so i'm gonna play it and show you guys so it wasn't working earlier probably because i did change right here and you have to set the collectible place so instead of change you want to put set and you want to put the set the um x and y to the corresponding up here x and y so now let's see if it works and one last thing before testing it we have to actually add set the collectibles to collect it to zero and set the collected max back to zero in the setup so i just put some positions right here let's see so i have this the fruits so we have the fruits so you saw that i couldn't collect the last collectible it's because um i did not set in griff patch's video he explained that uh you have to move the original of of the clones so you want to set the x back to negative 99999 so then it'll go out of the screen and it won't show so that's why it couldn't be collected the two clones were on top of each other that's why i couldn't collect it so be sure to add the set x to negative nine nine nine nine nine um just do something really big and then um i will add some extra clones for the collectibles so you guys can add it as well so i have one so i'm just gonna add some clones let's duplicate this put this right here remember you have to use the mouse thing you press m that's how you know where you put your clones 7 30 50. these are the positions for me it might not be the same for you okay so now i will show you guys so as you can see when you press m it's not going to be completely accurate but it's about the same position as the first collectible there it is so let me just collect it it can disappear and if i press m on this strawberry it's also about the same x and y position 139 and 140 it's about the same thing and oops accidentally died there same with the apple over here let's press m the x and y position almost match up so 3 11 and 60 about the same thing and then i position these like this and then i have them press m so it got 6 11 21 6 6 10 6 11 about about the same thing more or less but remember to use the m and this last collectible is at 1025 or about the same thing so you remember to use the m button to um know where you want to put your collectibles so now we will work on the portal so let's go to the portal so i have already have the portal i already have the portal in my backpack but i already told you guys you can draw it if you want to i just draw like a circle so i'm gonna duplicate this code into here and duplicate this as well duplicate this and this so for the portal for the uh this thing we will only need this top part just delete those two and i'll zoom in okay so you want to put this actually you don't even need the clone because we only have one portal on each level so you do not have to clone any so this is all the same thing and now we will get this thing so so you can go like so if you want to put portal somewhere you can go to the end just go to the end you don't have to collect all the collectibles actually just go to the end and press m where you want to put your portal maybe like right here press m and then you set the clone right there but i already have the coordinates for my portal so i uh you just have to set the collected to zero in the beginning take out the collected max set the x and y to zero we can make it hide let's put that up here i just realized we already set the collectibles right here so take that out we don't need to reset it so if the level is equal to one we have to in the beginning we always want to set change the costume to the closed portal so i have two c portals the close portal and the open portal close portal open to portal and then um we can take out the um set x thing we will not need that because we don't we're not dealing with any clones and i only need one of these so i have the coordinate where i put it from last time i put it at 1110 and y is negative five so you can just place anywhere by just pressing m and now we want to get um when i receive open portal open portal then we want to switch the costume to open portal so remember we broadcasted the open portal right here if collected is equal to the collected max then we open portal broadcast open portal and then when i receive tick when i receive tick i think we have it in here drag and drop this into the portal oops so tick we will need the we'll need this this part um we will not need the this inside so you can just throw this away if you can use costume number and costume or costume name either one so if you were to do a costume number so if costume number is equal to 2 or you can use costume name so you can either use costume number name so i'm going to use name so if costume name is equal to open portal so remember if you're going to do costume name you have to write it to the same costume name as the portal or else it will not work so if if uh it's costume name if the costume name is equal to open portal and it's touching the player then we want to set the exit to win set the exit to win so remember the exit was from the player exit right here so for here we will need some other code so remember to put this into the tick area drag that in so now i will play it we will add the if else condition right here to signal if is dead or not so we have to put it in a player get an if else statement if the exit is equal to win then we want a player if we want a player die down here so if the x is equal to win then we want to do a player win so for player win we have the code in the player so we have to make a new cost custom block name it player win player win repeat 50 times and this is just to make it like spin into the portal this is what griff patch taught so it will make your game a little better will definitely make your game look cooler so you want to make it point towards the player i mean the portal exit and you have to remember to make it don't rotate or else it'll start flipping upside down when it's turning turn 65 degrees 65 degrees move move the exit divided by two steps this just to make it kind of spin into the portal so you have to go to the distance of the portal so the distance of the portal is like the center how long it is from the distance like the center of the portal so the exit the distance direction so distance sorry guys i got the wrong one it's supposed to be distance this one distance to the um exit divide by two and you want to change the size by one so shrink it'll get smaller as it goes into the portal change the ghost effect change ghost effect ghost effect by two to make it like uh fade away i guess hide right here and then you want to change the level by one we don't have more than one level yet but when we get onto more levels we will actually have to use this and then wait one second and then next up here we have to go back up here to the exit win so if x is equal to when then we want to run the player win else it'll be player die and in the beginning we have all set up let's save our project and actually let's add one more level so let's duplicate this if it's equal to level two we want to switch the costume to level two one i believe level two one right here and then uh i created a clone at 150 200 y200 so you remember you can always use the m mouse to find out where you want it to go we have not done vertical scrolling yet so this is not gonna um scroll up yet so i will just save the game make it bigger let's run it so when i did this earlier there were some bugs with it so when you went in the portal it will um keep on going into the portal to fix that you add this to the code you just put this into the front so if the level is less than two and if the level is equal to one then we want to switch the cost from the closed portal create the clone at that position and set the x back at negative nine nine nine nine nine or whatever to make it go off the screen again because we're dealing with clones and for the platforms we need to add this at the end we have not done the y scrolling so when i jump up i will not scroll on the y position and you have to add remember to add the set x to the negative 99999 i think i believe i told you guys to do this but if i haven't then add this so let me close all the variables now and i'll show you and take that out so number one you can collect the collectibles now you can collect all these collectibles and when you get all the collectibles the portal opens and you go in and you go on to the next level so yeah that's what we did for today there's no y scrolling yet so you cannot scroll why yet but we will do that in another video so guys thank you guys for
