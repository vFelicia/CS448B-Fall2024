welcome back guys it's kids coding playing around here and today we're back for another video of spaceship adventure game part two two so i'm gonna show you all the code that i've already done and what yeah what i basically done so here it is um so yeah just copy it off feel free to pause anytime so this is laser oh we didn't do the laser yet didn't do alien either background this is background so feel free to pause arrow that this arrow is for the left side this arrows for the right side doesn't really matter what side you put it on but you just have to code it correctly the start button and the thumbnail i will get to that so first we're going to start with the laser so the laser is just a green cloud clip because that's what everything starts out with when you click this magical button um the set size is 20 so it doesn't look that big because the laser is humongous right now and then put yeah so um point in direction zero but remember guys i've got a lot of comments of how do you get the laser how do you get the laser so this is how you get the laser it's a button you go here i like what i mentioned in the first part this button right here i'm not going to use this but look you just put it look simple and then you just rename this to laser there you got laser so that's basically what the button is for and then i'll go to i'll go to x position of the tricky block the two tricky you need two tricky blocks so um remember always change the last one first so spaceship go to the x and y so then it will go to the spaceship y position and then now you need to go hide and then go forever the forever glitch isn't here anymore and then if then statement but then the key space is pressed the laser will fire up which is normal for most of our games that we make you can make it any other key but i decided to make space key because space key is honestly the best for shooting out bullets i mean that's how it is and then you need to go to you to go to the x position of the spaceship the y position of the spaceship it'll move 20 steps so it will go to the front of the spaceship when you shoot it out because they'll have some delay if it's in the middle because once you go to it'll be right here in the middle smack dab in the middle so it'll have some delay while you shoot it so we'll go up so you do not want that delay so you want to move 20 steps up so that no glitch so yeah um you also need to show and then you gotta repeat until touching edge and then you also have to do move 20 steps if you wanted to go slower then move it less and now you need to hide and then you need a go to x position a go to x position y position spaceship so we could just duplicate this and put it right up there and then now there we are done with the laser so let's try it out oh yeah yeah we have done it so remember the review from last time skin changing phenomenon stuff like that and start button great so now we're gonna work on the alien so we're really close to be done but the alien has a whole hunk of code so i have five different types of aliens downloaded in google drive if you do not know how to download it from google drive please go to our channel and watch our video how to download sprites from google drive so we have everything in the google drive for you so please do not use your uh school account but use your um normal account like if your name was tom smith or something then you would do tom smith and not your school account or whatever so we have ladybug 2a which is just the normal ladybug we always had alien alien 2 costume one costume dude basically this this one's from um what's not called again space invaders space invaders or something uh this one's also from space invaders i only played six invaders a few times but this thing i don't know where this is from online too so i'll give them credit so um yeah so when the green flag is clicked hide and then when i receive start then it will repeat 10 times you know create clone of myself which is basically create types of clones and then when i start as a clone it will switch costume pick random one to five this is because when it switches the costume since i have five costumes it will switch to five costumes so it can pick a random of the costume one to five so it's a 20 chance to get the ladybug a 20 chance to get the green monster 20 chance to get the dark green monster 20 chance to get the purple pixel monster and the 20 chance to get the light blue eye alien so um yeah so switch costume no set size is 65 because i don't want the aliens that big and not that easy to hit it's already 65 but i'm just adding this and then you guys can change the 65. and it'll show i'll go to x go to x pick random negative 220 the positive 220 a hundred pick around 100 to 175 this is because you don't want aliens spawning down here or like here or like here or here i mean no like these are fine but like here or here or here or on the spaceship itself you do not want aliens to swan there so it's only going to be around here and then now you need a forever loop so forever change y by minus two so go down slowly maturely so change y by minus two so you need if then else if then else the so you need if then else so both the laser and the spaceship will go in and it'll the alien will die so whenever it gets hit by them so i'll code that in just a second so later i will have to use this block so i'm just going to duplicate this put it out to the side for a little bit and i'll take it back once it's chilling and then chilling i'll take it back so so the one if if then else you need if then also if then else the negative 175 is greater than y position then it will go to x position so this this so basically so go back to the top if it's down here or go back to the top and then that's why i put that to the side and then you you need to if then in the if then else and the if then in the if then else has to be an or statement has to be the touching laser or touching spaceship and then um it'll change score by a hundred no i mean you need if then else and then if then that's in the if then else so you need to if then else in the if then in the if then else so you need if then else in the if then so you need to so you need the if then else and if then this and that then else in the forever so if then else you got to put the if you got to put touching laser so right here we can duplicate this touching laser it will change score by a hundred and then it will change shield by minus five which means the shield will go down if it touches the if it's touching the laser it'll go up the score will go up but if it's touching the spaceship itself it will change yo y minus now broadcast spaceship got hit please i put him there broadcast spaceship got hit oh spaceship ship got hit after we got the spaceship got hit you need to hide but you need to hide under the spaceship got hit script and then you got to put a wait one second a goto which we need this same thing so we need to put this go to right in here and then after that get to show and then we are almost done with the code we are actually done with the code so our aliens are done so if you guys are confused you guys can copy this down which is just the forever you put the change y by minus two you need if then else and then you gotta put a go to this same as this one and then you gotta i'm just wrapping up the code and then you need to if then so basically that's what you need for this script uh i can zoom in one out so you can see the whole entire thing so yeah now i'm going to show you my game so start once you can choose your skin so i'm going to choose this skin because it looks cool you know i like this one pink rocket let's go you click start look the aliens are coming closer look the aliens are touching the edge so so i'm about to code the end of the spaceship when it dies but for now i'm gonna kill myself no no i didn't kill myself yet but like you know the shield is going down look you can get score whenever you hit an alien and the shield is going down every single time i hit um a alien so so i haven't not coded this stuff yet so i will code the the if the you lost sprite so i'm going to code the spaceship first for the spaceship got hit so what i received spaceship got hit which we just made for after off of the bug it will repeat 10 times so change color effect by minus i mean change color effect by 25 so no clear graphic effects in the end so yeah so clear graphic effects where's that right there so there we go we have this coded out so now we have this clear graphic effects so clear graphic effects in the beginning and when you get hit you'll turn back into normal so okay guys we have to code the you lost sprite after that with the code the thumbnail and then the backdrops and we're all good so first we have to get the painting spray go to text um red i'm go handwriting because in my original game i i actually did you lost in purple and in marker so this one's gonna be handwriting and red because you know whenever you lose in a game or something it's always red i don't know why so you lost i'm going to see if i have to calculate that i don't think i have to you lost and then locally have it so i'm going to make this gigantic so i think that's the right size because whenever you lose it's really big it's like defeat or something so when the green flag is clicked i'll go to zero zero go hide go to front layer it will wait two seconds so this is where the big part comes in so when you lose originally um the if you lose originally one time that means you uh if you do not have this whatever you lose you will you will not be able to play again because the shield is messed up you will see uh you lose when you play it again so basically i'm just gonna code it without without the wait two seconds and i'll show you what happens because i've seen a lot of featured games with without the wait two seconds so they're like refresh the screen if it's not working or something i don't know so it's like i'm going to show you so you know or so if the shield equals or the shield equals zero or the shield is less than zero then show and then stop all so i'll show you i'm gonna die real quick so i already died already so look here the shield 100 lucky play i'm gonna so it says you lost see when you click it again it still says you lost like what is this you click it again it works but no one likes that little delay right so you should always put the wait two seconds so then you can play again on your own game without the new loss coming in bug so can we kill myself real quick so it keeps flashing yeah just uh it's like you lost look no you lost it's working yes see um i've seen a lot of featured projects say that it's just glitching whenever um you didn't do that you've lost so remember this is very important and now we have to do the backdrop we have to add edit some music so so i i normally just set it um set the volume to 20 just because i want you to hear my voice so set volume to twenty percent or twenty five and then go forever let's play space ambience i don't wanna pronounce that word yeah this is space ambience so you just put it in there and look we have our games but first we have to edit a thumbnail i'm just gonna tell you it works lasers working whenever you get hit it's working flash red flashing binary of colors actually function is working so now i'm going to code the thumbnail so the thumbnail you'll hear the costumes i already have this already so i just wrote space adventure game drew the little space invader ship put some little space invader dudes around it so yeah oh so you can copy it from here like do ctrl a or just drag the whole thing so ctrl c ctrl v to the thumbnail and then you got an alien and you can add it on to your thumbnail so this is just to make it look cooler and in the end it does look pretty cool in my opinion so okay so we're going to work on the thumbnail and so when the green flag is clicked this is optional but i highly recommend it to enhance your game even one little thing can make a difference so it will go to zero zero um go to front layer we actually have a video on this so you guys can watch that um in our channel so yeah there's a lot of videos for you guys to watch we post weekly uh like twice a week maybe three times so yeah so go forever and reset timer today i'm posting on a monday because there's spring break and that means i can record more often so that's great and then when timer so you need to use this so when loudness timer is greater than 0.1 they'll hide variable score so then you can see the little uh the little thing drop down so you also gotta hide the shield and i'll go to x 0 y 300 and it'll go to the front layer and then next you have to make it show and then glide 0.5 seconds so to zero zero so it is not done it is not quite done so we on this we have to simply i hid the thing i have to show it again or else you you cannot see the both of the variables so show score and then you gotta show variable shield and then there we go we have it i'm gonna save this real quick i already have the shared project up so you guys can look at that if you guys do not know how to do it so we have some spaceships here like all the different skins so when you click to stop space adventure will come down so look great my nails working and yeah about to end it around here i'm watching my little skin so if anybody can beat my high score well um i'll give you nothing i'll give you air but if you can win my high score right now i will be i'll give you something okay so see you guys in a second i got three thousand of course i died on purpose just to finish this video up but anyways um this has been great so uh in the end i will be replying to some comments because i have not been inviting people to my studio i had done that in a while but i did start doing that so i'm gonna reply to one comment so thank you all guys for your support like i i got taiwo the scratch user right here thank you for his support or her support so he is or her is giving me support by saying my video is nice so thank you so yeah i think i'll end this video right now maybe yeah so please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below um anything you want to comment though if something wrong
