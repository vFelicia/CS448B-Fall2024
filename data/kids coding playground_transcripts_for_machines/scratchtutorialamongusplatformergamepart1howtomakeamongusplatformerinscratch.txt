hello guys welcome back to kidscoolingplayground so today we will be working on among us platformer many of our viewers have suggested us to make another platformer game and some have suggested us to make among us platformer so we thought of creating one so it took us some time to get this working because uh all the sprite we have to draw the background and all that this sprite actually download from another website i'll show you guys later but other than that the background and other stuff we actually drew them so it took us quite some time to get it done okay all right let's move on to the next page here we'll be learning some of the uh concepts in scratch like key controlling the sprite broadcast messages custom block uh variable uh platformer logic so uh i and then this is where we got the sprite sheet so you can go to this link to get the sprite for the among us right so this person created for us so we can download and use it um if you like or you can go to our google drive we'll create the sprites uh and we'll upload there as well um okay so you can find all that in the video description okay and uh before i was working on the first platform was a ninja platformer and that has like a little bit of bug i think a lot of people asked if we could share that project so we didn't share that project because it has a little buggy so it gets stuck on the platform and all that so it's messed up so this is actually really good now uh for this among us platformer it has no uh no known bug that i know of so it's worked really well so you can use this logic to do your ninja platform when we like so it works good okay so here's some of the shower we had so these are some of the people some of the viewers that want us to work on our mangas platform kind of game so i think we had a manga's animation that we worked on earlier so this is a kind of a tutorial for the platform and then we have a community post this week regarding the uh counting the uh the cornucopia the turkey and then uh something else i think uh and then that right answer was 23. so these are the some of the viewer who answered it correctly really early so uh we're getting a shout out all right so let's jump into it okay so we have the game here so we're gonna go full screen mode it's gonna start again so this is just the first stage just showing how the game works so if you touch the laser then you get kill and you start back in the in the beginning of that same stage so we're in level two right now so it has a depth also counter here this is level two so we'll try to pass here oh come on let's jump over this little guy here oh let's jump over him oh okay okay so there's a little jump pad here so so you want to jump over that and then there's this smasher thingy with with some spikes coming down so you know you won't get hit by that and then this is a level five so you can make many many different levels and you can try to do that yourself as well so we'll show you the basic and then you can do much more okay so you can jump over here so this one you don't want to fall down so i fall down here yep i die right start back again and then you don't want to touch the spike also so so this is oh that's the last stage so this is just the uh the last stage so please subscribe and thank you for learning with us so if you guys have not subscribed uh please do so this is actually a demo of the of the platformer okay so we will get on to the actual uh coding of the game okay so i forgot to show you guys this so this is what we bought download the sprite from so you can go to this website here so uh this is the sprite resource website you can download this one so if you link below in download video as well all right guys so we are here at the new uh project um so we're gonna delete the scratch cat we don't need um i have something in my backpack for the backdrop for now so i'm gonna drag that in but i'll show you guys what i did with the backdrop okay so i'll just oops let me paint a new one so what i did was just draw you know draw shapes like this and then you can use the reshape tool to draw them so it took me a while to draw this but as you can see just drawing shapes so like let's say let me copy one of these guys here so let me just show you i'm not gonna draw it obviously it takes too much time so this is like one box so you have this color you can choose any color you want right and then i did 10 10 size for the pen here and then on that and then the other one i draw a lighter box here and then i use this reshape tool to uh so let's say you have a squash box here like this you know and then you you kind of reshape it like this guy so you see how they reshape too right so you kind of like maybe click on this like this then move this like that oops it took a lot of time so as you can see right you kind of go like this and then you can hold the shift and then oops and then like that so something like this so you can just draw your own little boxes and then draw another small box uh from here you can just like uh copy this make it a you know different color right obviously you can let's say use this color here then you can just fill this inside and then make this one's sorry and then make this one smaller and then and then you can say front so something like that right so like this one this one's like this so something like this you can draw your own and then this is just the yellow yellow with the pen filling so you can just match them all up so after all that oops i actually moved it my whole thing that's bad let me take this again i'll group it together pull it back to the center here so i accidentally put a little block over here uh let me delete that so you can just kind of move it like this try and make sure that it can show up on the in the screen something like this will be okay okay i think that's good enough okay so this is our background okay let me trash this one and uh yeah we can rename our project like among us okay platform okay all right so what we're going to do is uh we can i'm going to drag in this one so we're going to paint this one i'll show you what i mean so we're going to call this main character so the main character we are going to use a a a costume like this i'll put on the first custom so i'll show you what i mean okay so this is a little black box right so also we're gonna paint another costume so this is the animated character so this can be anything so uh what we're going to do we're going to upload the uh the sprite that we have downloaded so uh as you can see this idle will update idle first then we'll upload more and we'll walk so they have different ones so we'll just take all this all right and we'll trash this so idle is the first one it doesn't matter first one the last one i think in my original one i had it as the last one but uh doesn't matter so we have this idol so what you want to do is this so we're going to make this main character you control the movement for the main character and then you want the uh anime character following the main character so that is actually a little bit better so that the the code when you are doing it you know you can have more control and doesn't like glitch to the uh platform so what you can do is uh this you take one of this guy copy this ctrl a ctrl c okay go here so what you want to do is you want to fit this black square you see how this black square is kind of like the same size as this guy so it doesn't matter what color the square is so you want to try to fit the black square around the same size this this guy so that way you know um they when you touch the uh with the main character which is the black square touch like any of the object like spikes or whatever when it died right so you want to make it pretty much the same size okay and and then you can adjust it later how you want to adjust the the sprite maybe make it a little bit lower or higher like that whatever it is i'll show you what i'm in later uh so uh for right now you can't put uh put the black box in the center kind of thing right and then you put the main character and also in the center right so the main character is also in the center so you can convert the vector right so you see he's the center right so we want to put this around the center and this is black box is also around the center okay all right so we don't need this costume too so do a custom one so you just draw the black box you know how to draw a black box right just select this guy just draw a black box you can do no outline okay okay all right so we are done with the main character so we're gonna make him follow that okay so we're gonna create some level uh variable let's rename the first one uh level uh for all the sprite and this one let's trash this okay and then we'll create some more variable uh later on uh for now let's just keep it like this simple first and then we have to go to uh when start we're holding on the main character again by the way uh what we're going to do is set the level to one so we're gonna start with level one uh what we're going to do is we're gonna create a block called uh reset so for the reset block so for the reset block we're gonna use it to reset the uh some of the position and stuff like that so uh what we're gonna do is move this guy to uh go to 200 and zero or negative hundred sorry i wanna going to go to the left side so when you start it was somewhere in the left okay so we're gonna change the size to 50 here for both of these guys they're too big so so both the black box and the animated character who want to be 50 size or you can change it through with the code here as well it's fine okay or you can do the size set the size to 50 as well okay all right and we are going to reset and go to this level so we can use this to reset like when the player die and then uh the velocity and jumping and gravity and all that so for now we just have this okay so we created the reset so what we're going to do is we're going to call reset under here and then we are going to broadcast a message okay start game okay start game and we have a start game when i receive start game i'm going to change the ghost effect so we want to make the black character the like kind of ghost go away so and then we're going to make this guy in front of the black character okay so we'll make it ghost effect okay so here set the close effect to 100 and we're to make sure we have a show for right now um we are going to define another variable actually we'll make another variable uh we're going to call g for global variable so we know it's player dead okay for all sprite what we want to do is in this reset i want to set this okay so let's say false okay so play is not that then we're going to use a repeat until here and then we have to use the operator okay and we are going to say repeat until player dead which is true you can use one or zero or true or false doesn't matter and what i'm going to do is i'm going to do another broadcast here say start or control so this will uh tell it to start all the control okay we're going to make another variable here global variable also speed x for the sprite we're going to make another block movement control okay we're going to run it with our screen refresh okay so this is very important make sure you check that so that you know the uh the sprite will run much more smoother you wouldn't want to see the refresh every time with it kind of move up and down or whatever okay so what we're going to do is let's say everything else and then if later if key key yeah okay right arrow key right arrow uh what we're going to do is set uh global speed x to 5 okay and then duplicate this and we are going to use another if condition here oops inside here and then we're going to check the left arrow here sorry so we'll put another if and else okay here we go and then this is the left arrow key and we are going to do a negative five and then here we are going to set it at zero just in case there's something else button we don't want it to move okay all right so this is the movement control we had okay okay so we have the broadcast start all control so we have to say um receive start all control what we're going to do is we're going to call the movement so my block okay what i'm going to do is take out the ghost effect for right now so that we can see okay so we're going to make a new block we're gonna move the hitbox uh we are going to have a uh an input we'll call speed x uh make it run without refresh as well and we're gonna put it on this side uh what we're going to do is uh change x make sure you get the change x okay is it x okay so what we're going to do is i'm going to create another broadcast so later we can use it uh we're going to check the platform it's called um so that we could use it for later on uh well we can put this here i'll call another call check platform detection okay i hope i spelled that right uh so next let's say check platform detection here we'll call this uh my block move hitbox and we are going to move with this variable okay all right let's just try it out so as you can see we can move this uh box right left and right kind of thing okay so we'll stop like around here for now uh so next time we'll work on the uh making this guy you know uh kind of move and stuff uh i guess we could just make him go to this one for now we'll be a little pretty quick uh let's just start here we're almost done um so and then we'll set the set the rotation style left to right or you can just click on this and click this okay it's the same so make sure that it doesn't flip over upside down okay and then you will say look go to front layer and then we'll say show uh draw in this forever and we say go to the main character which is the black box okay so for now we have this code let's just kind of see how girls run it so as you can see the black box is moving and this guy is following him right so later we can make him jump down here doesn't matter so uh so right now you see it's kind of following him okay and then you can hide this so put this back over here all right let's start again so you can see he's kind of moving left and right and you don't see the black box there's the black box actually doing the movement and we can animate this character later okay so we'll stop right here so please uh share like uh subscribe to our channel and i will continue this next time i will go with the part two uh with like some more code for the animated sprite to jump and stuff like that and then maybe doing some of the platform okay all right so this is all the code here so make sure you guys do subscribe to our channel okay and give us a thumbs up on the video would be greatly appreciated and this is the code for the main character okay byebye thank you have a good day
