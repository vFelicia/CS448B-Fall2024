welcome back guys it's kids coding playground we're back with another python tutorial it's been a while so we're gonna make a turtle racing game today not really a game so like um the turtle can like move around and when it gets to the finish line you can guess which one wins and stuff like that so yeah so we're gonna start a new trinket python we're gonna rename this trinket first let's name it um turtle race so turtle race and then we'll go i'm gonna zoom into the code a little bit more so you guys can see it better so first we're going to import the turtle library so we're going to do it by import oops click in here import turtle so import turtle and then we're also going to import the time library which is like the wait pluck and scratch import time so we're going to do that as well and let's go down two lines and then we're going to import the actual object turtle so we're going to import the turtle object from the turtle iber library so we're going to do this from tur turtle um import turtle with a capital t okay from turtle library we're going to import the object so and then we're gonna also import random we're gonna from random we're gonna import the random int okay so from random uh library we're gonna import and after that we're going to get the screen so we're going to backdrop screen is equal to turtle turtle dot screen and click parentheses and then we're going to do turtle is equal so this um library turtle is equal to the object turtle like that okay so after this we're going to set up the grass for the background so we're gonna have some grass as the background so right here we have all the colors for the turtle so you can pause the video and use whatever color you want when we get there so we have um we're going to set the backdrop to force green like the color the grass so we're going to do screen dot bg color screen dot bg color and we're going to set it before a screen and some of these colors might not work but because this is for css colors but some of them do work so like you can pick some right here as you can see you can pause the video if you'd like okay after that we're going to set the turtle color to white so this turtle we're using to draw is the turtle library not the actual turtle we're going to be using to race so we'll show you the end product that we'll show you the product at the end the result of this game so then after this we're going to set the turtle color to white because we want to write turtle rays up here we're going to write turtle dot color and then we're going to do parentheses um uh quotation marks once so like that you can add a semicolon if you would like and then after that we're going to do turtle dot speed is equal to zero and zero like that and after that we're going to make the turtle pen up so then it won't draw so we're going to make it draw once we do pen down so we're going to do turtle dot pen up and up so like if you don't do pan up it'll already start drawing and then we're going to make the turtle go to this position negative 250 150 somewhere right here so then we're going to write turtle race somewhere right here okay so we're gonna write turtle goat oops dot go to dot go to and then we're gonna do negative 120 and the other position is 150. so you guys can pick whatever coordinate you think is best for you then we're going to do turtle dot right and we're going to write turtle race quotation marks turtle let's make it all caps turtle race and then we're going to put a comma and we're going to set the font to ariel you guys can set whatever font i don't know what the fonts are but i just need arial font is equal to put another parenthesis quotation mark ariel ariel and we want it to be 20 size so that one's 20 size and we want it to be bold so you can do this you guys can do anything you want you don't have to make it bold i just made it bold so it looks better except for this we're going to make it pen up so after it's done writing it we're going to make it pin up turtle dot pen up oops i still put this pen up and then do this and add something right here okay and after this we're gonna set up the dirt so we're gonna have some dirt over here like we're gonna add like some brown dirt so we're gonna make the turtle go to negative 200 negative 150 first so somewhere about like right here so start drawing from here so what we want to do is make it draw from here all the way to here and then come down and then draw with this then all this area will be brown so we're going to do turtle dot go to negative 200 negative 200 and we're gonna do negative 150 for the y um and then after that we're going to do actually uh yeah so negative 200 negative 150 you guys can do whatever coordinate you would like and then we're going to set the color to chocolate remember we still have a python color so we're going to make like a brown color i'm going to pick chocolate you guys can pick whatever color you would like and she did chocolate and then we're going to do turtle dot color is chocolate so we're gonna do this chocolate and then after this we want to get let the turtle begin to fill this area with brown so we're going to do turtle dot begin underscore fill and then we can put this in semifinal okay and then after this we're going to get uh the pen down so we're going to make a pen down so it'll start drawing so turtle dot pen down and then we're going to put this so it's going to begin drawing the brown so we're going to make a move 400 forward so from here we made it go to negative 200 negative 150 so move 400 it'll move all the way to the other side so 400 is like about right here and then we're gonna make it uh so let's enter so let's write so we're gonna make it move forward by um 400 so we're going to dot forward forward and then we're gonna put the parentheses and after that we're going to make it turn right so as you can see when i run it right now it says turtle race and has the green so as you can see the turtle moved all the way right here so we wanted to make it turn right it's kind of hard to see but if you can see over here right here um so we want to make it turn right so then it will move down here and then go back all the way back so we're going to make it turn right 90 degrees 90 degrees because um the 90 degrees turn right here so if you were in this position you would be turning right okay so after this we're going to enter so i kind of need to scroll down right here i don't think it's letting me scroll down so you guys have to look down here and then we're going to have to make it turn right by 90 degrees so turtle dot right by 90 degrees and after that we're going to get uh turtle forward by 60 so 60 is like about from here to here so we're going to make him move 60 degrees and then move back so we're going to turtle turtle dot forward by 60. so we can move 60 steps and then we're gonna make it turn right again so if you're down here you're facing down so turn right you move this way again so we're gonna do turtle dot right 90 degrees oops so we have the turtle turning 90 degrees okay so after that we want to make it move back 400 and then we're gonna end the fill so we're going to turn forward 400.4 for word 400 and we'll do that and then we're going to turtle.end the field so we're going to finish the fill end underscore fill okay so now let's play it as you can see it says turtle race the background is green and the dirt right here has been filled okay so now we're gonna work on the turtles we're gonna work on the turtle and the finish line next but uh before we continue i'm pretty sure in some previous python tutorials we mentioned that um you can comment out stuff so that's what i'm going to do right now so i will show you guys how to do it i'll i'll comment it so it's easier guys for you to understand so right here this is importing the turtle object i'm just trying to make it easier for you guys to understand from the turtle library the library and we're importing the rand int from the random library okay so now this is what we have right here importing the turtle so i just commented it out so you guys can see what it's about and then right here we are drawing the background we're setting up set up the grass green background and then right here in this area we're going to set up the dirt or set set up the dirt which is the brown stuff right here okay so that's what we have right now we will i will add more comments as we continue so i don't know why it's not letting me scroll down but i guess i can make a couple more answers and then you can see right here okay so next we are going to be working on the finish line so i'm gonna make a comment real quick set up finish line so we're gonna set up the finish line and then we want to make the square size 15 we don't want to make it any more or less because 15 is just the right size if it's 20 it might be spaced out a little bit more and might go off the screen so we do not want that to happen so we're going to set a variable square size underscore size and then we're going to make it uh 15 equals to 15. okay so next we're gonna define another variable okay so actually the square is the square size um it's the default square size for the turtle so it's 15 by 15 but you can change it but if you do 20s it'll get spaced out so it'll not fit on the screen so it doesn't look great so we're going to do 15 as the one we want so next we want to get a finish line so we're going to make the finish line underscore line another variable finish line at 170 so that's going to be like somewhere right here on the x position and then we're going to make the color of the squares black so we're going to do turtle dot color turtle.color and then we're gonna do black so you guys can do whatever color you want i just picked the black color um and then next we can get a turtle.shape we want it to be a square the finish line you can make it any shape you want pretty much shape and then square so square and add a second column here and then down here we're going to add a couple more enters so you guys can see and after this we are going to work on the repeat loops but before i show that oh yeah and we need the pen up i forgot about that we have to do turtle dot pen up and then we're going to work on some repeat loops to make this process of stamping black squares much quicker than it is so i'm not going to use it right now i'm going to show you guys how how much code you need to do it without the stamping it takes a lot so i'm going to show a section okay so start here so we're going to do turtle dot go to you will see that it's not very efficient go to and then we're going to do 170 140 140 oops and then next we're going to do and then we're going okay so next you wanna let's go to another position so we're gonna keep on stamping down we're gonna add a little section in the middle that's not shaded so first we're gonna stamp this one turtle.stamp and then we're going to do turtle dot go to and then we're going to do 170 110 so we're going to make a little gap for like a like some space and then we're going to stamp again okay so when you run it as you can see there's a little space we want to make two layers of them as you can see it's not very efficient you have to do it for the whole line and we're gonna have to do another line of those so i'll show you an another part of it another little section of it so this is like the second line of this so we're gonna do turtle dot go to oh yeah and i can comment this out before i show and then um i'm gonna comment this out real quick so you can do control slash to come and add the whole line let's highlight it in control slash so i'm going to be um showing you the other line so turtle dot go to and then we're going to go to 185 125 and these are just some coordinates you can get whatever you want you know you actually should not you don't have to code this part we'll be working on a loop to make it more efficient and then after that we're going to do program dot stamp and then we're going to do this and after that we're going to get turtle dot go to as you can see it's not very efficient you have to keep on typing or copy pasting it and there's a much quicker way to do it and we will show you later and then we have turtle dot stamp again that so as you can see i commented this out so now you see there's two lanes so let's uncomment this real quick so you can do control slash again so as you can see we want like a lane right here and a lane right here it's going to take a long time to do so this code is not very necessary so we can take this out and i'll show you guys how to do a loop on how to make it way more efficient so let's start on the loop so on the loop we're going to make two repeat loops so for i in range you can basically pick any letter you'd like i'm just going to do i so for index in range for i in range and then we're going to do 10 that means repeat it 10 times um has to be colon not a semicolon this one has to be a colon because it's a loop and then you tap enter and then we're going to do turtle dot go to so this part requires a little bit math and then we have to finish line so right now we defend define finish line as 170 so that's the value of finish line you can think of this as a variable like x or y so infinite x is equal to 170 let's say that and then we're going to put a comma and then we're going to make another one of these another uh parentheses and then we're gonna add space actually i'm gonna do 140 minus and then we can put another one in here so um put one in here sorry so you put one in here and then i we're going to do i multiply multiply by square size so square size we have defined it as 15 up here as you can see square size and then we're going to multiply it by two okay okay so right here we have the turtle.go2 finish line is 170. so this is finding the coordinates 170. so let's say all right i always starts out as zero in python so we can substitute the i as zero so zero multiplied by fifteen is zero fifteen multiple zero multiplied by two is zero so one forty minus zero is zero so i mean for 140 sorry 140 minus zero is 140. so this becomes 170 and 140 that's the coordinate so let's say i was one so the next index would be one it would just keep on going up so then it'll be 170 finish line is 170 so 140 minus 1 times 15 is 15 15 times 2 is 30 so 140 minus 30 is 110 so the next coordinate would be 170 and 110 and then so on so you see the pattern it goes down by 30 every time so let's what if this is 2 so if i is 2 2 multiplied by the square size is 15 so 30 30 multiplied by 2 is 60 and then 170 is the finish line so 140 minus 60 is 80. so the coordinate will be 170 and 80. so i hope you guys understand what that is so and this is the subtract so 140 is subtracting of whatever this value is i'm actually going to put a space between here so it's more easier to see like that okay so next we're going to write turtle.stamp so it can actually stamp and then we're going to make another loop for the second row as you can see it already created one row we're going to make a second row we're repeating 10 times for the first line but for the second line we can repeat nine times and then for the second one you can call it anything you want again you can even do i could do j you can do z so i'm just going to do j for the sake so you guys can understand it better for j in range what you're going to do nine times instead so in the back we're only gonna do nine oh yeah and not a semicolon sorry keep on putting a semicolon or hit the shift key so you have to hold down the shift to get the colon so this because this is a repeat loop and then this is going to be different than the first one so we're going to turtle dot go to and then of course there's a finish line defined as 170 and then we want to add the square size which is 15 to the finish line and then we're going to i'm sorry not 15 square size not because we already have the variable defined you guys can just use the variable i'm going to put another parentheses so uh 140 we're gonna put two actually 140 minus minus the square size and then we're going to add a subtraction sign in the middle actually take out one of these so we have this we have the 140 minus square size we'll add the other parentheses later sorry about that so we have the 140 square size and then we're going to subtract it by j which is the right here j in range j multiply whatever the j value is like zero because it starts at zero square size times two okay so right here i think we need to add some more parentheses let me add a couple more parentheses i think you have to add i accidentally deleted them sorry about that i wanted to let you guys see it better so we have to add the parentheses back now that and one more okay so we have three on this side and two on this side okay so what this is is basically kind of similar so finish line is 170 square size is 15 like i said so 170 plus 15 is 185 and then we have the 140 minus the square size so this is going to be a little bit different this is the back lane so 140 minus square size is going to be 125 so and then j is 0 first so 0 times 15 0 15 times i mean 0 times 2 is also 0. so 1 125 minus a 0 is 125 so that's the first coordinate is going to be 185 125. okay let's say j was one we're going to substitute j with one then the x position would be 185 because you have the finish line and plus the square size and then right here we have 95 because 140 minus the square size and then you minus whatever this value is and then finally it just goes on for nine different times and let's just say j was two finish line 170 plus square size would be the same would be 185 140 minus 15 would be 125 and then 125 minus 2 times square size is 30 30 times 2 is 60 and you minus then it'll be 65 125 minus that is going to be 65 as you can see so that there's a bit math there's some math into this coding and then we're going to do turtle dot stamp and then we're gonna do this so let's run as you can see there's two lanes and turtle race and that so this is all the code we have so far so i'm going to i guess i can make a comment right here so let's make a comment let's say set up the finish line let's start up here actually i already have the setup finish line this is just stamping the finish line let's name it stamp the line like that okay so for you guys to understand it more easier and you should save your project as always when you have a lot of stuff you should always save your project okay let's make it back bigger okay okay next we want to do turtle.hi turtle so after it's done stamping all this we want to hide the turtle library so we're going to turtle dot hide turtle i'm gonna do that okay and let me add a semicolon right here it's optional remember that and then um right here we're gonna set up the turtles to the color so we're going to do setup i'm going to give you like a little comment set up somewhere here and then we're going to my turtle one one equals turtle turtle which is the turtle object okay and next this is defining the variable and then we're going to do my turtle dot speed uh one sorry my turtle one so we're dividing these as one two three and four we're gonna put four turtles and then um dot speed to figure out the speed equals two zero speed and then we're gonna do zero with that and then we're going to add my turtle color red so we're going to make the first turtle right so by turtle one and then dot color it's going to be red and then i'm going to add more spaces so you guys can see and then my turtle dot one oops one dot next we can do the shape so we want the shape to be the shape of a turtle obviously like that and then we're gonna do um pen up my turtle dot pen one dot pen up okay so that is going to draw the turtle and then we're going to make it go to this position one dot go to i'll make it go to negative 170 100 and space and then you can pen down after this i can do my total one dot pen down okay so now i can just uh copy paste all of this um to make the different uh ones so as you can see it draws the first turtle the red one so i can just copy paste this to make all the different turtles i'm gonna put four turtles if you guys can put as much as you would like i'm just gonna do four for the sake of time and then we're gonna copy paste this and we're gonna have to change the number of the total so we're gonna a couple lines and then right here we're gonna do my turtle two is equal to turtle object two and this should be two as well to to just change all this to two and then we're going to change the coordinates and the color to and remember you guys can change it to whatever color you want i'm just going to change it to what colors i had and then right here we're gonna i'm gonna put the second one as a yellow turtle and then we're also going to change the x and y position so right here i'm doing 50 as the i'm going down by 50 for each turtle as you can see so this is my second turtle let's copy paste this we're gonna make the third turtle okay we're almost done and then my turtle three so we can change all this to three three three three oh yeah let's do that three three there's three and three so we got all the turtles and then we're gonna change the x uh y position so we're gonna make it zero we're going down by fifty and we're gonna change the color to cyan any color you'd like i didn't want to pick green color because the background is already green so just pick a cyan color and then my turtle for ctrl c ctrl v okay so we have the my turtle 4. now we can just use the down key if you want to go faster okay so it changes all to four and then we're gonna um change the color to purple so this is the fourth this is gonna be the fourth turtle and then we're going to make it negative 50. okay and then it's okay so we have all the turtles let's play as you can see they're not racing yet because we did not make the move yet so we will now so right now we're gonna do time we're gonna add this at least waiting one second before the game starts so time dot sleep and then we're gonna put parentheses one second so it's gonna wait one second before starting up the race and then i'm gonna put another comment right here let's go move turtles let's move to turtles for i in range so we're going to make another loop for i in range so we're going to make this repeat 110 times do this 110 times and colon because it's a loop so my turtle one my turtle one dot forward and then we're gonna make it a random one to five steps pick random so rand ins one to five put this one to five and you just copy paste this a couple times let's tap to tab and tap okay so now we have them we're going to have to change the numbers two three and four so now we have all the different ones so my turtle one two three and four okay it looks like we're finished now let's play as you can see the turtles are moving so you can bet with your friends which turtle you want to win and stuff like that so as you can see the yellow turtle won right now so before we end the video we would like to tell you that we have a second channel now it's a gaming channel so my brother started it and he has like one video on
