hello and welcome back to kids calling playground Channel so we'll continue our ninja platformer game today going different background the the platform and then we can try to make the ninja move around and setting up the different things ok before we begin I would really appreciate if you could please subscribe to our Channel and give us a thumbs up on the video you like and comment down below okay alright so we'll begin where we have left off last time we have the Ninja made a ninja with different outfit we have some of the outfit here we're standing right wealthy and then we have different outfit that you know he is getting hurt right time then we have some of the outfit he's running and we have something that is jumping right so we'll be working with these different costume that he has okay and also we were looking into the costume for this sprite the platform that we were working on so I think I show last time how we could do that you can upload the platform tile into your sprite and then you can just copy and paste connect to a vector and move around for now to make things a little bit faster what I'm going to do is import the previous platform are a mate and we can also walk walk with one together as Elsa as put together as well okay all right let me upload this okay I export it for my previous game so as you can see I have a platform I made wonderful too but I think we can make one more level for level one maybe something easier so make these like three and four so when you can do is make sure you name your give you a custom like one two three so later you can switch costume so as you can see I have three here so I can use three so let's change this to 33 right now so this will be 33 so what we going to do we're gonna make platform number one which is a little easy so we already get this last time right so what we can do is we can copy this right and then we'll go back to our costume here we'll make this one or delete him or something and we'll put it here we'll rename this as one or maybe for easier for people let's rename this first two to three and this to I will make this as one so this is going to be our first level will make it really easy so that people can just move sorry I keep getting wrong so this is this is the bead and oh I can have three somewhere I guess somewhere down here maybe it's not allowed me to put three let me just delete all the other one just to not get into trouble with this naming thing okay so I have won the now till till here this won't be how the change is to something else first three three because you can have the same name this is three and we'll change this back to okay so I have one two three so number one is like this what we can do is we can delete this right here later and we don't need so for now again I am so we're working with platform one so platform one we're gonna make it really simple only the big kind of whole thing across or copy and paste again and hope I do something like this so we can move this around later so I was just maybe try to online with all your platform in one location so when you when you're doing the screen there will be all a similar fashion so what I'm going to do is gonna make duplicate this I think will be better actually because this will cause us some trouble with online it correctly so let's duplicate this actually okay so this is one sorry for confusion there guys we are going to make some changes to this so we have this here we're going to just copy this over what we can copy this as well doesn't matter copy put it here we are going to make it around the same area so in youth so gonna like this what to move this tree out of the way actually or like right here something we keep something simple for for player right now so that they can get used to jumping maybe we're gonna make this higher a bit like this so we get the user some idea how the game works so as you can see if you're making games for the platform it takes a lot of time this up there's same thing so these are tree and and the grass here the shrub I just took it from the from the other backgrounds of what you can do is you can always do this right you can go to the the tile and then you see PNG objects you you can just take some Bush in like let's say this one we want to use this so what you can do is just click on this about this one we can get a header to our our background we can make him smaller or something like that like maybe here covering this this ground here right so as you can see this is a little high right so what you can do is you can just kind of copy one more set and kind of cover it up so as you can see we have come at three level right the player can move maybe we'll move this one a little bit shorter lower can use the arrow key as well you want to adjust it so you can see well three level I just get the player familiar with it okay so we have the platform with the tree in the back you know it should be a little bit out more there's over here so anything you want SoDo usually the platform you want to get you or your objects comes right in here and then you can do something else later with the other one okay so this is dumb let's see if I I have any more fear anymore those specials right who could use some web rocks right yeah see we can even use mushroom so even first time I did the game I didn't even use this house trying to just get it working but now since we doing it again I can maybe add something else in here let's do that okay so I got some mushroom and then the trees down okay so we have a bunch of little things that we could add to our stuff so let's get the mushroom copy go back to our forest age or put some will come us make this small mushroom here doesn't matter where you put it so everything looks nice hmm the stone converts a vector on this personal so you can adjust it a little bit I mean right now we don't have any collision with the different objects here so you can kind of walk over and they're like in the background at the moment okay we have some stones here we can put another still so we need it's not where maybe no next to the mushroom so since I another move this mushroom somewhere here so the stone is covering the mushroom because I think I put the mushroom relate earlier and there's still one I did a pay so they have some order consistency but you can push him back and forth with this so let's say you want to go back just push it back so now the mushroom was in the front right okay so one more tree stump let's get one more this okay alright so well and then we'll get one more two more one more mushroom right last mushroom let's use it oops did on this wrong one not go back to one so we can do it later on the other one yeah put them here okay all right so this is our first stage will give the players a chance to kind of move around and yeah I didn't get the meal with the with the game okay okay we have first stage done okay we can delete this sprite you would only need that anymore so we have the first stage okay what we need we can add some sprite to the sign right here we want to get the sign up with the sign here and we can put the sign like maybe here this in here if you want telling the player you know they can get the move that way you can change the sign till maybe ninety ninety five dozen there 75 maybe okay so the ninja will kind of come and start from here oh and then what we can do is we can create a crate also for the crate we can create that like a having a gym means after you break the crate you know the portal open up so we can do something like that so what you can do is you can create your uploaded crane okay and in this crate go to the costume what I did I also added some mom some grass around the crate so let's say you want this okay what you can do click on this change it to copy that and put it on the crate itself so if you like so kind of hiding the crater little bit okay so I know the crate the crate is little big right now but we can always change it a little okay so we have our crate there so either we can change it here like this select the whole thing right and then just just change it to smaller or you can change it with the size here as well so we don't wind doesn't matter so we're changing it like this for now okay with our little box maybe a little bit smaller I think that's good enough okay so we have the crate and we're gonna put a place somewhere here for now okay okay so the player breaks this crate I will create a portal somewhere for the player to get in I didn't have too many background things you let me remove this rocks I'll put a portal here later okay let me go back to my platform let's remove this rocks okay it was too clever I think there's too many things here okay just back up front so as you can see if you try to make the background look real nice it takes a lot of time okay all right okay let's go back to the plate so we got the crate going so we can delete this costume but only tell anyone I think earlier I forgot to convert this to vector so what happened now you cannot move this individual thing it gets stuck right so that's my problem with that I forgot that earlier so what you can do you say you see I cannot move this grass anymore I want to move it down a little bit it would walk because I forgot to connect to vector let's trash this my bad so let's do it again so make sure you always convert to vector ok I'll go back region go here and push again so convert this to vector first convert this to vector then oh yeah click on this so when you have bitmap once you move the thing just get stuck there that's it you can't change anything else after that so I try to cover this okay all right this is good now that's making smaller in the center so okay sorry about that this is done so this is put a crate here okay done it's done okay now do the water so for the oh I have come I already uploaded I already downloaded my previous sprite water so what I can do is just add it here so what you can do is you can push the water in the back on the front since there's all land we shouldn't see any water right if you have any gap then you can put the water so what we can do is we can push this water back so when you go to the next stage you'll see the water and you will see the water in the first stage so what is 5th wheel is similar right you can just you can see yeah you cannot blow those things and you and just kind of move them around cook them and then just form your water I'm not gonna show you how to do that it's pretty easy it will take a lot of time for the video if you give the see here I in here PNG this object known object background tile you'll see water I just use these two image that's kind of laid them up like John Nash the water line and then you get your water okay so let's go back so what we can do for the water well let's just do some coal for now I know we haven't done anything yet I think we were just and mostly set up so let's do our first coat for the water we are going to make them go here this position for now wherever the position is and we are going to push into the back layer so that the next stage when we move will see the water so first stage when we run we don't see any water so just kind of lame right okay that's done for the water part okay what we're going to do is we're gonna create some variable so we created that one variable called level so that will determine like what is the level what you know the different platform we have and you know we have to create a variable later on as well like gravity and speed fall speed and jump speed but I think that never was the one that was looking for is already here so what I'm going to do is gonna show you how we you know well we touch the portal and we can go to the next level but I think how to make the ninja move first right okay so where to walk on the ninja moving first ok let's create our variable so the first one will do one run speed this is like how fast we can make the ninja run we can the jump speed well then we can't force so as you can see this is called camelcase and programming lowercase F capital S comes different to see different world so this is kind of standard programming when you're making variable you use the first lowercase and then if you have any more dots next to it you kind of put a capital first capital letter and no spaces in between when you're making variable okay so we have for speed jump speed run speed we don't have to show this we're gonna show level every one and now we have gonna make something called gravity and we acquainted something with us to the next will keep track of the running costume costume this is just a keeping track D customer we're doing a loop through since we're multiple objects in the multiple custom for the jump and run and we'll make another variable maybe no and then in just dying so we do not want to have any action when the india is dying you should not be moving or jumping so we'll made that bear probe check as well okay so for now we have all the necessary variable for now what we're going to do is we are going back to the ninja we are going to make a block we're gonna call this start again so this is our function as a custom block what we want to do is we put in different num different Col here so that will run every time this function is call so let's see here we can do showed so when I start I can gonna do show we're gonna switch to costume ah so what we want to do without switch to this custom I five right no it doesn't matter you can use one five so this is a custom that we start the ninjas that we can put them enjoy any position let's say you put on me here that matter so we're gonna make it McCallum drop down a little bit little test our gravity make sure that works so we'll put them right down right here okay so you can just drag that in and then we are going to make in point in direction ninety basically to the right and we are going to make him go to the front layer like in front of everything so that you don't get this sign or anything blocking him and then we are going to set some variable initialize a variable okay we're gonna set the end run speed so we have to run speed ten we're gonna okay this we are going to put jump speed so jump speed auto twelve and then we are going to set our fall speed for speed is how fast is falling or we'll use that later zero for now and we're going to use gravity we're gonna make it negative one so every time you know if this up in there one y value to make the ninja fall down and we are going to say set the running custom index is zero and we're going to set the jumping custom index is zero as well we are going to have one more our dying way just the player dying so I'll put it nope and okay so this is the turn of the initializing the variable someone we what we make the call so what we can do is we can say even when it's clicked we're gonna say we're gonna call this block so right now nothing much to go to it won't just initialize a variable nothing's fun is happening didn't is just standing there he's not even falling down so right now we just cannot get there meow setup we've got the platform setup we got the water we've got the crane that we made we have the sine and then we have a platform we have three different stages so these we can delete we don't need them anymore okay so we have three stages stage 1 stage 2 stage 3 ok so if you see if items change it you see this first stage you see this change to something else there's another one so what we can do later we're gonna make sure that the box is generated somewhere that within this stage that we want so the the box that many I said break this box and give a gym when the ninja touch to gym they open the portal right so what we need to do is we are going to depending on different stage we might move The Box to this location of this location right and we're on stage 3 then we're to make sure that you know the box doesn't fall off the water it shouldn't be really hear it the box should be like I say right here up here or anything like that right so with a go in to make sure the box is generated correctly to the right position later okay so for now we'll stop here and we'll continue again on the next video thank you please like share and subscribe channel and I'll see you guys next time bye
