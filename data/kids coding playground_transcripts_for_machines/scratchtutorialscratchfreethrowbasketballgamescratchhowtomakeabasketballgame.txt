welcome back guys it's kids coding playground here and today we're back for another video on scratch and today we'll be making another face sensing game called free throw basketball and i'll be wearing the same demon mask so if you do not enjoy demon masks please do not watch the video while i do it i don't know why but okay so anyways i'm gonna show you the demo so i'm not going to start it yet because my face i get give me the mask i got the face mask on not the face mask the demon mask oh my demon mask in a basketball hoop and you try to get the basketball to touch the uh so you can use your hands and everything so swing the basketball and make it move i can also use my head you can do okay okay so we're back like this and um i just took off my dwind mask and we are going to start coding so so i were back and um i'm going to turn on the face sensing so yeah uh the face sensing i'm trying to put on my mask but don't don't don't turn it on yet so uh if you click on it it'll just show your face and then i put on my mask right now and it's all disproportioned and everything so i'm just gonna turn it on now click it's gonna turn on i don't want that to happen let's see you see my face no you don't but now we have to get turn video on instead turn it off you don't have to do this because i don't want a face reveal so i'm just going to turn it off so you can't you don't have to see my face and i don't have to uh suffocate in this mask so um the first thing we're going to do is the um is drawing the basketball we don't need this at all oh yeah we have nothing on our um backpack this is today so we have a basketball if you do not know how to draw a basketball hoop uh we draw on our own and if you don't know how to draw you can just go down our project and export it and we also need uh we're gonna draw a basketball paint first you start the rectangle the outline is four and it's black and the inside is a dark grayish blackish color with a 4 or 5 if you want to and we're going to start out with a nice rectangle a light nice long pool because every basketball has a pole and you have to have the rectangle on the bottom and we're gonna proportion that so now it's all even and then now you gotta make this the board you know all basketball hoops have a board so the thickness has to be 15 at this point i'm pretty sure and it has to be a light gray color because all boards are light gray or sometimes white uh and now it's 10 it's 10 yeah and uh we have this and we're gonna make the whole entire rectangle so yeah and we're gonna put that on top and we're gonna do the smaller rectangle inside which is just another rectangle but just slightly smaller because they always have that i don't know why they waste paint just to do a smaller uh rectangle it doesn't matter but uh and then we have a red rectangle it's to help you balance the ball so we just make a red rectangle with no fill so no fill so the fill is going to be the same color as the scoreboard now i mean the board and then the outline is red and that would be 15. so yeah so yeah uh we're gonna make that 15 and there we go we got a scoreboard and we just did not scoreboard but the thing that helps you balance the goal over there and now we got to make the uh goal itself the hoop so we first start out with a dark brown color almost a maroon uh darkish color not black a little bit lighter ish so a brownish color and we got more of a burgundy color and there we go burgundy same thing so we got 15 thickness and uh we put a straight line hold shift remember and drag it across and there you got the top of the hoop and now you got to make the net itself which is a brown color a brown color you should just have to drag it down there and we have to make the net so hold shift no hold shift because you have to make a line like that because the hoop is not just um like just put like not straight it's more of uh sideways so you want to do ctrl c ctrl v we and then we can flip horizontal so that will be on the other side and we can just move it up and we're gonna put a third line in the middle of course because that's how the hoop is so shift this time because it's straight and we're gonna put two lines on the sides so remember hold shift are these two and hold shift for the other this might be worse than my last goal because of the bottom and all we have to do is just group these together drag them on the uh wooden thing not the wooden thing but the thing that holds the net and we can make that thing go in front and we group that again and we place it on the thing so there we go a basketball hoop so if you do not know how to draw this still just export it and we can just make this a little thinner little just thinner but you know uh we still have it in our backpack so we just have to drag i think it's this one so i don't think we have in our backpack so i'm just gonna so i'm gonna put this like that a little skinnier but not too fat like the last one a little down and maybe so there we go all we have to do is just do control c and make the scoreboards right which is paint control v and there we go the scoreboard sprite and we got to make it on top of the net but not really on top of the net so it's actually on the bottom of the net behind the net but actually in front of the hoop so i mean the uh the thing where you shoot the thing in the goal and uh we gotta put that on top and then we have to make it go to back later gotta make it go to back layer so i'm gonna just change the backdrop so all we need oh yeah i'm gonna click this real quick wait a second so they'll go to the backlight and then we have to make the um blue backdrop which is um just a blue color regular look at this color and then we make a gigan it doesn't matter about the red thing you won't be able to see it anyways but like still yeah and we got it and we're gonna so now we're gonna move we're gonna code the basketball we don't have much code so that's the good part because we can make a fun face sensing game without much code and then now we need to when the green flag is clicked it will go show go switch costume switch backdrop oh it's already that same backdrop it'll go to a position and i'm gonna move it up here around here and it will point in direction 180 so it'll be pointing down and we're gonna have set score to zero new variable set score to zero and turn video on but we're not going to turn it on until the end where i wear the demon mask and everything you know set video transparency to 20 so it'll be not that faint because 50 is very faint and yeah so we need to see and then wait two seconds i i hope i don't click on the green flag on this thing and also turn on everything and wait two seconds and it'll go forever move 10 seconds and if on the edge it will bounce 10 steps this is a very dangerous code block and dangerous and now we're going to work on another piece of code we have so when the green flag is collect it will go forever it will you need to make a score called high score i'll do it in a second so i'm going to make that a second right here variables you know we have high score cloud variable so we have that and um and we have if then if then the score is greater than the high score then it will set high score to score that means if you get a higher score than the world score or whoever plays this game score that means it will set the score to that score and then now if then if then not inside the if then but inside the forever if that is touching sprite 2 which is now target square now target square then it will start sound drum bass too yeah and then we need to change the score by one and hide and it will wait 0.5 seconds and it will show and then after that it will go to a position which is just the same thing as this position and point and direction 180 so where's that block and then we're going to have when the video motion is greater than 10 it'll start to sound boiling and it will send it flying okay so i'm going to use the boiling and boing this one so blink starts on boink and then point and direction point where is that block point and direction there you are uh video direction video motion on sprite on sprite and when the s key is pressed it will stop everything because if if you just click the stop key uh if you just click the regular stop like the stop sign it will just keep on going this the the basketball the video will keep on going in the basketball and everything but we just need to do this so then turn the video off and it will stop all and now i'm going to get my demon face mask so wait a second so i got my face mask back and now i'm going to save now i'm going to move the high score to that side and now we're going to play it okay so i'm going to full screen this and let's start so i got my mask back so my camera's on oh so so yeah um have you uh please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below uh and like basically anything you want to come like like any new projects that you could ask for and we can make it so anyways see you guys next oh i forgot to rename the project let me do this i just saw that oh what is this supposed to be called free throw basketball right yeah i think it's called free throw basketball and yeah we have it so anyways see you guys next you
