welcome back to kids cooking playground today we'll be making a tutorial on how to make the rain effect in scratch so let's show you guys how it works so you can see that the rain is just coming down and then it just splashes onto the ground and disappears so we're gonna make something like this today in scratch so let's start a new project new projects and let's paint a Sprite so what we want to do is keep a one outline White box so it's easier to see so what we're going to do is get the box one outline I'm gonna draw the box like this and then what we want to do what we want to do is draw a one outline for the ring about this long that'll work all right and then after that we can delete the box I mean duplicate this we want to duplicate this and then we can delete the Box all right so once you've duplicated it you want to get the line again don't connect it but draw a little bit above because if you connect it will be in the same line and you don't want that so we're going to draw a little bit above and what we can do is we can trash the line and then we duplicate the costume and then delete the Box and then the next costume we just repeat this process uh we go a little bit above above this circle Dot and then we go draw a line we can delete the line above it duplicate the costume and we can delete the Box oops wrong wrong password delete it from this one and this one what we're going to do is select the line and again we just repeat this like six seven times until we get to the bottom so we delete this duplicate yeah so we just repeat this process so again draw a line delete this duplicate delete the Box foreign so once you've reached the bottom um to your desired location we can draw three uh three small marks to in to like show that the rain has touched the ground so that's what we're gonna do right here we're gonna draw one two three and then we're going to delete this duplicate it and then this time we're just going to do the same thing but we're just going to make the lines a little bit bigger to show the splashes got bigger actually we can delete that it is bigger okay so now we have all our costumes as you can see we have one two three all the way up to eight so these two are like to show that it's touched the ground and splashes and these are from falling up and down so next let's go into our code so our code we're gonna do it's in the Sprite we can rename it to rain we're gonna get l135 glitch the code is really simple and your thoughts clicked we are going to switch costume to costume one switch cost me plus one then we can set the Y to zero and then uh we're gonna get a forever Loop so forever and then we're gonna go to we're gonna set the x set X to pick random negative two forty two forty so it falls from a random position up there take random negative 240. 40 to 240. and then next we're going to repeat seven times because we have seven costumes for the rain we'll give eights but um seven of them are like falling so we got repeat seven it's gonna use next costume next costume and then after that we're gonna switch the costume back to the First costume so it's gonna loop back to the beginning special custom bags cost one right here and next all we need is a dark backdrop I think there's like a one that's like stars or something it's pretty dark as you can see you can see the rain so let's run the project as you can see the rain effect is working what we can do if you want to make it lower is you can change the set why so like negative 50. and this way if you're making like a platform or something and the platform's like down here you can just adjust this to however you want to make it look like it's hitting the platform and then it's splashing save the rain see now it's lower so yeah that's pretty much it for today's tutorial on the rain effect if you enjoyed this tutorial please like share and subscribe and ring the notification Bell and then I'll see you guys in the next video
