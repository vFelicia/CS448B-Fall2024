welcome back guys it's kid scrolling playground here and today we're back for another video in scratch and today we'll be making a holy game and um a lot of people a lot of celebrate this holiday so we decided to make a holy game because a lot of people just played do this holiday um this might this video might be a little bit late when it gets released but it's still a pretty cool game so when we start it under some music so we start it and then there's some music in the background uh ben is holding a bag and you use the arrow keys to move up and down you can't go left and right and you throw bags at others so then they'll change color and when you get to 100 color each person does 10 color they will um hit you if they hit you 10 times that means um your colors will go up by 10 and if you get to 100 that means you got colored and now you have to go home because you're very uh colorful so yeah we have to do we did that and if you throw colors at the people that are trying to color you you can um slow them down and then they will have to go home too because they are colored as well so you can see i'm throwing bags of color on these characters sometimes you throw two bags sometimes one bag sometimes three um each character has um a different amount of speed and uh health which is how long we survived from the back so you can throw multiple bags at once and they split two and it's a random position so it can go like from here let's get started so now let's get started so of course we delete the scratch cat and now we get our bed ben uh up here and if you don't want any of these costumes you want him throwing a bag you do not want him doing that or that or that so the first one is the regular idol position you duplicate that click on the arm flip it vertical it might look a little bit wonky right now but all you have to do is make it go a little bit more up and then you got a throwing position and you just keep on duplicating that and slowly rotating it until it looks like it's moving properly so as i'm doing right now but right now um i have some yeah and then you just move the arm off so right now i have my character inside my backpack so let's put it in our band because it's all the throwing ones this shows one there should be seven costumes in the end the idol position the throw one throw two throw three throw four throw five and throw six where he throws it and there's no more back so we have to import our bag too and actually um i drew this bag so we need two costumes a bigger one and a smaller one because this is the one that he should be holding and this is the one that he throws out so this one the lines are a bit thicker these are seven lines and these are three so so you just have to make the line smaller and uh make the overall sprite smaller so all you have to do is do that ctrl c go to your bend and if supposing you don't have this bag yet you put your bag maybe you want to make it a little bit smaller and you put it on his arm that's what you do for every single costume like this one like this one like you can control v right here put it up there so you want to copy the costume from before so you don't have to resize your still time see you have this bag you copy the same bag because if you get from the color bag again that means it will be um bigger and you want it to be the same size as before so you just copy and paste it to the next costume as so ctrl c and then uh ctrl v so it's the same size and you put it up there so that's good and now uh we have our color back in we also need our character which you can just get from here there's a bunch that you can pick from there's actually character one and character two so there's a bunch of characters but we're gonna use character one for now and we need you got colored so we have these three as well so you can go to our how to make amazing text video from our um channel and that was one of our newer videos so just go there and then as you can see this is how you do it so it's actually two layers of text so the first layer is just regular and the second layer is more bolded and it's darker so if you want to learn how to do that um just go to our how to make amazing text and you just drag it out and put it back in so that's for our text and we just changed a different color so you see you can do that change to whatever color you want and yeah you put it back in and have a forgot and you so now we yeah so we go oh yeah let's rename this real quick holy and now we go our ben when the green flag is clicked that means it will clear our graphic effects because in the when we get hit by the characters that means you'll change color because you got color and clear graphic effects in the beginning as always um switch costume to ben a let me change this real quick back to the big bag right here because that's what he throws um cleographic effects switch costume to ben a because that's his idol position the one with his hand down and then you'll go to x yeah i already have the position because i uploaded it from the thing so it goes somewhere around here it'll set colors to zero which are basically his lives so set colors to zero and go it will go forever and then if then so yeah we have our street let's get our street in real quick yeah so um if i'm not mistaken it's called neural yep and we delete this so for reference this is where our you want your ben to be so i'm probably over here because you don't want him flying up here because there's no way he could fly you're probably running from the sidewalk and down to the bottom of the road so so uh we have our and so if the up arrow key is pressed and the y position is less than 50 the y position is less than 50 so it cannot pass a certain position and after that we need to change y by 10. and then we duplicate that it's almost the same concept now it's down arrow and y position is greater than negative 100 so let's do greater than negative 100 so we have our y position negative 100 so it's over here somewhere so you don't want to go too low you don't want him to go under the ground because there's no way he would go under the road without like a drill or something no way you could just drill with his own hands so and after that instead of changing y by 10 it changed y by minus 10 negative 10 and then if then the space key is pressed then it will broadcast throw back and wait and after that we have one more script of code we actually have two more but we'll get to the other one later because it's from the bag so when i receive throw bag it'll switch costume to ben a which is his idol position oh repeat six times because he has six moving costumes as you can see right here one two three four five six and uh repeat six times next costume since this is um a lot of costumes you don't have to put a small weight and then wait 0.1 seconds right under here and switch costume back to then a so okay so i'm gonna zoom out feel free to pause so uh you can get all the code down just in case if you haven't got it so as you can see yep he is throwing the bag and yeah we can move him and he can't move that high there and he can't move that low into the air on the ground so yeah working so let's set the size to 100 i have no idea how this got to 125 but yeah 100 so yeah so his feet aren't in the ground because they were on the ground because he was 125 so we just decided to change it so yeah now it's time to work on the back when the green flag is clicked it will hide it will hide and then when i receive throwback it'll wait until not not okay and key spaces press because you do not want to let hold the thing hold the space again it throws bags and there's no way you can lose so we need to add this simple script of code and then it'll create clone of myself so actually i have to make the back of 20 i have no idea how i got to 35 i actually have no idea and we do that and when i start as a clone it will set the color effect to pick random one to three hundred it'll go to x x position so this is you use the tricky part block we have to move the second one first so it will go to the x position of bend and it will go to the y position of bend and now it will show it'll point in direction so this is just random aim so he goes blah blah blah and go here to here so you have you can't it's not 100 chance you'll hit the person you're trying to target so so uh let's see as you can see the bag is actually gonna be on him so as you can see it's it's behind him yeah so the bag is actually on him you do not want that to happen so if you click space you want it to be up here because that's where his hand is so so you do not want that to be in the middle right so um you want to add the x position you want to add 25 so it's somewhere over here maybe over here gonna be over here so then the hand is up there in the y position you also want to add 75 and then it'll show like we already did that so it'll point in direction um you know pick random like what i described earlier pick random 60 to 120 so the aim is different and the direction you have to click all around i already did that so you see this is 60 to 120 yeah right here so this is the range you can hit people from and uh yeah so 60 to 120 so it will repeat until touch it or repeat until touching character one because it will go into the character which will make it change color or it's touching the edge it'll move 15 steps to get to that goal and i'll delete this clone in the end so yeah we are done with the bag so yeah let's let's let you see all the code i think we can zoom in feel free to pause right now so you can get all the code so yeah so let's see see the bag is going but right now the character is in the middle so the bag is stopping there yeah so yeah the bag is going so now we have to work on the character character still has some decent code so um so the character you actually have to make it rotate left right the direction so it doesn't flip over when it's going on the other side so we need when a green flag is clicked so we also have to change the direction negative 90. so it's facing that way and then the green flag is clicked it will hide it'll set character hp sub room okay this is very important please do not skip this part so character hp did i spell character correctly yeah i think it smells correct correctly and then you click for this sprite only do not skip the step most of the mistakes come right here so please do not skip this step the character hp you know set character hp to pick random three to five so it can the character will can disappear in three hits from the bag or five hits from the back or four hits because three to five you know set size to 75 percent well i mean it's 100 right now so i'm gonna set the size of 75. and then i'll go forever no create a clone of myself and i'll wait a pic random second until a new one spawns so wait pick random one to 1.5 seconds for another person to spawn and uh since we have the clone we're gonna do some clone work here so when i start as a clone you'll switch costume to care to pick random or so uh there are 13 costumes for the character i'll show you in a minute so 1 to 13 so it can be number one character all the way to 13 because there's 13 characters that are here so switch costume to pick random 1 to 13. and i'll show and i'll set speed so this is also uh for this right only so please do not skip this part and it'll set speed so each character will have a different amount of speed to pick random negative three so it's actually pretty slow to negative seven which is very quick so it'll go to x 200 so it's back here so the character will spawn over here because you do not want it spawning right here next to ben and uh we need to pick random for the y negative 60 so it can be from probably here a little lower negative 80 my bad and to positive 80 so it can be so it won't be flying like ben if so he doesn't fly either so and then it will repeat until you need an or statement repeat until the x position or so we need that is less than negative 220. so x position up here is less than negative 220 or touching ben because um if you do edge if it's touching the edge that means the characters spawn right here that means they'll be touching the edge and they'll be constantly disappearing and they can't move so there's no point of this game so add this descriptive code or touching ben it will change x by speed and that's how quick they're going right so over here so change x by speed and then it'll delete this clone in the end of all that and then there's another one i start as a clone so when i start as a clone you'll go forever so if then it's touching the color bag then it will change color effect by 25 because they've been hit by a color a color back so they'll change color and then change character hp by 1 so because they'll start losing their hp slowly and then you need an if then else statement right not right inside of it and if and then if the speed is less than negative one which means that they won't be able to move anymore so negative one is the slowest possible speed of a character so if the speed is gr less than negative one which is like negative seven which is quick that means it will change speed by 0.5 so it'll actually make the character slower and else you'll set speed to uh negative set speed to negative one because that's the slowest it can go and you want them to move right so yeah so when i start as a clone you'll go forever and if then if then you need a or semen if the character hp is equal to zero so when it loses all its hp or it's less than zero if it's been hit by multiple bags then it will delete this clone because they had uh gotten colored okay um and now i'm going to show all the code so feel free to pause here let's drag that down a little bit so we're going that yeah and yeah feel free to pause right here so you can see all the code so let's see if this works let's actually hide this first so then i can you guys can see something so um and the variables too so let's go to characters no colors you know okay and now let's go so you see they're moving okay we're changing their color and they will disappear they have different amounts of hp as you can see this woman right here has five hp this one has three and the colors aren't changing yet because we're not finished with the code but yeah it's function it's functioning so now since the characters are moving we go back to ben and when the green flag is clicked forever if then it's touching character one because if they get hit by the character let me go change colors by 10 which means you got colored a little bit so yeah and then it'll set the color so it'll have a slight change we'll set the color effect to pick random ones 300 so there's a bunch of colors you can become for just 0.1 seconds so 0.1 seconds right here it'll clear the graphic effects again and now under that we put an if then statement right under that if then the colors you need a or is equal to the colors is equal to 100 which means you now have to go home because you have been fully colored uh or colors is greater than 100 then it will set the color effect to pick random one to 300 in our broadcast you got colored so you you got color and it'll stop other scripts in this sprite so you can't move ben anymore once you get color so stop other scripts in the sprite and after you stop all the scripts on the sprite you also have to stop this script because if you don't stop this script i mean that means uh you'll be still changing color you'll be still broadcasting this thing so you want to stop this script as well so now we are done with fully done with ben so i hope you guys can see this i'm gonna zoom out a little bit so yeah feel free to pause right here get all the code done and now we are on you which is a sprite u so when the green flag is clicked you can i just drag the position somewhere and then uh you'll go to this position it will hide and then when i receive you got colored then it will show and that's basically it for all the other ones but you just have to change the position so they're not in all on one position so let's move that in there why is that zooming out zoom in and then it'll go to here instead of going there it'll go to here so yeah just get some positions done you know drag it around see where you can put the positions so now let's go to whatever go to this yeah and now we have you got colored and and on the last one colored you have to add extra code to stop everything so it will wait two seconds and then it will stop everything so we have one more scripting character so let's go back to character so right now we have four scripts but we are supposed to have five so we're gonna move over a little bit so when i receive you got colored then it will stop other scripts in this sprite where's that and then it will delete this clone because there'll be no more spawning once you get color yeah so feel free to pause right here and now we're gonna add the music for our final touch and if i'm not mistaken the music is dance energetic so let's see energetic you have this one and when the green flag is clicked zoom in when the green flag is it will set volume to 50 so you can kind of hear me and then oh it's optional and then it'll go forever and i'll play sound energy dancer until done so let's listen and see what this is all about so as you can see there are people coming my colors are changing i'm changing color too and bags are working correctly they're slowing them down to see like this man getting slow and yeah they're slowing down yeah and some have different health than others oh no i'm about to lose i got color so yeah that's it oh is it so please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below uh what you did for holy and if oh if you celebrate holy what you did for holy and yeah i've heard that there's also really good good food at holy and stuff i've never went there but yeah um so yeah uh see you guys next time
