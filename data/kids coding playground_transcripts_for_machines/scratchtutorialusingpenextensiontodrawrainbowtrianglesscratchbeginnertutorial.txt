welcome back guys it's keith's coming playground here and today we're back for another video in scratch and today we'll be making a simple tutorial for beginners and um so first thing you do is delete the sprite because we do not need this for um this specific tutorial and we start by making a sprite you make it red and then outline no outline and then we make a circle and it's a little bit too big right now i'm gonna make it a little bit smaller let's go like that so okay so now we're finished with our dot number one so then we got our code here and when the green flag is clicked we will point in direction uh pick random it'll be a pick random from negative 180 so to positive 180 so it can be all over the place and then we go forever it will move 10 steps and if it's on the edge it will bounce so if it gets on that edge it will just go bounce and plus we need a pen sprite i mean uh let's just duplicate these dots first so we duplicate this dot turn this into dot two and dot three so now we have three dots and these are all the dots um and we're finished with the code for dot one the two and dot three because all three of them are the exact same code and now we're gonna make our fourth yacht so let's name that drawing dot and um when the green flag is clicked not the same code uh you need put to click this little extra block section and then you see all these um little extra blocks things so you click on the pen because that's the one that we need so erase all in the beginning because you don't want any when you click on the green flag already and you'll want to set pen size to eight after when you do that you want to go forever and pen up go to dot one so you'll draw so it's pen up right now so it's not drawing you go to dot one so you do go to dot number one so go to the first dot and then this is when it starts drawing so and then it'll go pen down so this is when it starts drawing and then it'll go all throughout it'll go to it'll go to dot 2 and then dot three and then back to dot one so you go pen up go to dot one and then pen down and we'll go to the fir second dot the third dot and then back to the first dot so it will be drawing a triangle and then you want to make it multicolored so you want to change the pen color by 10 so it will be changing color and then we need a green flag so when the green flag is clicked it will go forever it will wait 10 seconds and then it'll erase all so every 10 seconds uh the cycle restarts it'll erase and then you it restarts so feel free to pause and i'll be giving you a few seconds to check down this code to make sure it is correct so feel free to pause always and uh the other code we're not finished yet this so feel free to pause at this point and our backdrop we need a new backdrop which is called stars and well you could use any other backdrop but this one looks kind of galaxy like so i just used it and we have our um music so when the green flag is clicked set the volume to 25 so you can hear over me and then it will go forever you know play sound you remember you can use any music you want and there's a lot to explore a lot of you can listen to so the one i use is play dance snare beat and we have that and i'll play that until done so let's try this game as you can see it is making the triangle and it is making it and every 10 seconds will reset you can hear the music and uh you see the background and it will restart so let's rename this project to rainbow triangle so yeah so please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below whatever you want to comment and join our studio and our discord server so it should be in our about go to our click on our channel go to about and then you should see everything you need in our scratch profiles gumball 098 and the rest of our scratch profiles so yeah see you guys next time you
