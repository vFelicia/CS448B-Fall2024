so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding Clara today I will be doing a video to clarify ting game so one of our subscribers recommended us to do this he gave us this idea to do this so we'll give him a shout out here and this game took 20 hours to make so it was pretty difficult so this is how it looks like pete players will be able to select their characters so the origin which is player 1 will be able to select them these two and the green team which is the player 2 will be able to select from these two characters and they are allowed to select the desert map or the graveyard map and so today we'll be learning these following concepts and scratch so we're going to learn broadcasting messages the custom sprites like the drawing drawing sprites and will get custom blocks looking we're gonna do loops like forever loose stuff like that we can do to change color effects so when they get damaged then we'll change the color effects and for variables we will do them for all sprites and for this spray only we'll have well used both of them and this is important you must complete first complete our tutorial on the simple platformer game in order to work on this game and these are the two websites you can go to to get the sprites for this game so let's go here show you guys how the game works so let's play so my brother is here to play with me hi everyone I will pick the genie from the other thing I'll pick the ninja and also if you don't pick they both don't good one orbit close we saw four characters so you a ninja yes and we see when you check one other one does not check so you can also double jump so for the player one different roles is FN key you can change it of course for the team and WASD maggini is arrow keys and zero and nine zero it throws a fireball or I guess and one it will shoot all the magic when you get the gem of the appeal and you can slide the planer one can slide and you press the down button to the genie and the dragons and I enjoyed the story jumping on the road if it's double jump when they have a shield then will not be affected by any incoming damage huh okay so so when you win they will die in a tombstone sure so there's also what try another time and my brother so damaged I'm gonna go get them we shoot fire on Petraglia dragon we'll shoot fire out in this round is the lowest range attack is and to Allah so yeah that's pretty much the game we haven't added the player 1 and Claire to win yet like you can make like a windscreen we can do that later in the tutorial so as I said you have to be done with the simple platformer game the one where you can go around and wrap the gems this one so I know I think you've all done this one so let me make a copy of this save as copy so I'm gonna be loading up all the getting this into the twoplayer fighting game so twoplayer fighting game and I just uploaded all the sprites from the backpack so I'll play the platform's sway a little so now I'll teach you guys how to how the platform is done so we were just like you can just take out one of them because it'll cuz we still have the double jump it'll give it more room so you can double jump easy easier and we don't need any of these you can just delete them all so all we need is this one since we have another platform that with all the decoration and stuff we can just delete the other one but if you have not and then we will also work on this graveyard platform later and then newer videos in the next videos so we don't need this platform so we can just delete it so we have platform 2 we can just name it platforms rename it yes so we have the sign we don't need it because it's already in the backdrop we don't need the bush either cuz it's already in the backdrop and finally we don't need the tree I think because I think yeah it's loading the backdrop also so now we will have to rename all the costumes for it like the ninja girl we put mg in the front so later we can like join it with the variable so we can so when it clicks on it it will choose that character like all of these have ng and the Dragon has DRG in the front see it says DRG in the front so since we have 10 costumes for run for the ninja girl will also need 10 for the dragon but the dragon has initially only 4 I think for the running so you have to do some of the costumes to make it ten see it only has four moving walk you know there's five yeah sorry there's five walk dragging costumes so you have to duplicate five more you all set match the name for the Dragons let the run jump attack we can just put numbers underscore number behind them so that we can use a loop to go through so as you can see we just wrote DRG run and then put underscore the number behind it and then we have the jump the jump costume is basically the attack costume we use the same one just duplicate it I will show you guys now how to make the costumes for the sprites I put I know you guys can see it but we put tape on our screen so you can like proportion the sprites correctly we want the sprites to be the same size so when you play the game the costumes will be the same size so I put tape right here on the top two pieces of tape on the side and then one tape for the bottom one piece of tape for the bottom so that's how you're gonna position it so now we're gonna show you guys how to do it so we're gonna up the little costume just gotta get it so we can just use them a do so for now the Medusa costume as you can see this Medusa is very small compared to the dragon so we have to proportion it correctly the same size so we first we convict from vert to vector so you can select the whole thing so we select it and we just drag on the sides never drag on the bottom or the sides or it can mess up the proportion so you want to drag on the sides corner the corner sides so you wanna so remember we have tape on our screen that you cannot see we want to put the top of it touching the piece of tape the bottom of the sprite touching the bottom of the tape and the sides touching the side of the tape so you know it's perfectly proportioned so if you show it the Medusa is that big and if we show the dragon it's about the same size and the ninja girl is also about the same size so this is this is pretty good for the Medusa so you have to so I did one example you have to do this for all the all the costumes so it may be a little tedious but you're still gonna have to do it for the costumes you did it for all these costumes so we have one Idol costume ten runs ten run costumes and then we have one we have jump costumes we have ten of them I believe yeah we have ten jump costumes then we have some attack costumes this is the sword attack costume and we have also ten of those and then we have ten throwing costumes this is the throw the knife and then we have the slide costumes 1010 slide costumes as well and then we have the dead costume so when the ninja dies it will lay down we also have ten I think yeah then we have the tombstone so when the character dies the tombstone will switch the costume to the tombstone remember you also have to adjust the tombstone size as well with the other costumes the dragon since we have less movement costumes we had to duplicate some like the jump ones we have to duplicate some attack and jump are the same costumes even though they are the same we still have to rename it to attack and jump so we can use it in a loop in the future and then we have the throw which is the shooting fireball mmm this is the dragon dead which also has 10 costumes to match the ninja girl you always have to have same amount of costumes and then we will delete this one so so for now I'm gonna duplicate all the code from the treasure hunter into the player one so so I'm gonna drag all this code into the player one from the treasure hunter so remember if you want to duplicate your code just drag it and finally so we're done with all the code and just separate it hmm so that's a lot of code zoom out I'm dragging all this code over here because it's I've already done it so if you guys have not done it you guys have to work on the costumes first oops so separate hold it okay so this is all the code when I play it it will not actually work yet cuz we you don't have the code yet because these numbers are different and we will work on that in the next video maybe so we will start stop here so thank you guys for watching please like share and subscribe and I'll see you guys in the next video
