welcome back guys the kids coding playground here today we'll be doing a scrolling sonic game in scratch so the point of the game is the longer you survive the more points you'll get and then you use the up arrow keys to jump over obstacles and try to dodge obstacles and then you can use the down arrow key to duck under obstacles so before we start our project i would like to give a few shout outs to people that requested for a sonic game so here on our channel you can see a lot of people um well some people have suggested us to make a sonic game so this person suggested us to get the sprites i'm pretty sure we used this website to get the sonic sprites we'll also put the google drive in our comments or the description below so you guys can download your sprites or you can export it straight from our video so yeah as you can see we have quite a few comments um of sonic hedgehog games so without further ado let's start on our project so let's first demonstrate the game so i'm going to go full screen so basically you're running you can jump over the obstacles you see that gear right there you have to jump over it when you roll when you press the down arrow key you roll and jump over that and bullet bill you can use the duck under as you can see i hit the gear so it died so i can restart you duck under the bullet bill and if you hit the rings you get 500 points like in sonic you know how he collects rings you get points for that yeah so it's pretty much it pretty simple um so it's kind of a simple runner game alright so now let's start on your project by clicking the new button okay so next we are going to get onto our game so let's delete our scratch cat let's go into our backpack i backpacked a few sprites so we have the sonics right we have the scrolling backgrounds one and two and we use the scratch tutorial from the scratch team channel to make the scrolling backdrop so huge thanks to them for showing us how to do it it's really simple i can show you guys here as well we have the traps we have three costumes for the traps the saw spikehead and the spikes we drew the spikes but these are from we got these from some website and then right here we have bullet bill for mario we just decided to put him in anyways so yeah there he is and then we have the rings and inside the rings we also have hearts because the heart is also from scratch we just put a heart because it's almost valentine's day so we just decided to put it in there as well if you collect it it also gives you 500 points okay so now we have all our sprites so let's get on to our backdrop so we'll just draw a really simple backdrop so like we're gonna get a light blue color i guess like that color no outline and just draw a rectangle or maybe this needs to be a little bit like like this maybe yeah maybe a little darker actually there you go what's that no it's too maybe like this yeah that's a pretty good color maybe actually a little lighter because that now it looks kind of dark there you go that's better uh and we drew a sun in the top right corner so let's get a circle tool remember just hold shift if you want a perfect circle so we're going to get the yellows color that yellow hold down shift and boom you got a perfect circle put that in the top right corner and there we have it we have our backdrop really simple to make and then here we enter sonic sprite we have a ton of costumes here are all the ducking costumes like the rolling we won't be using this one but we'll be using these four and the running animation so that's our sonic sprite okay so inside our scrolling backdrop i'll show you guys how to draw it and stuff so basically what we did right here is we drew a rectangle green and then we used the reshape tool to reshape it to look like mountains and then these trees is from the sprite library and here we have just a green strip as the grass i guess and then rocks are really easy to make i'll demonstrate how to make one so basically just get the circle tool draw a kind of oval shaped kind of like an egg shape use the reshape tool and then move this up a little bit and boom you got yourself a simple rock really easy to make so that's how you make a rock and then right here we have more so we just made two costumes for the first sprite and two for the second sprite so what we're gonna do is make the next costume so that alternate so there's more variety to the background so we have two right here and then right here we have another two and then right here we have a little pond all we did just get some green patch and just drew our oval so yeah here's our second costume and you always want to make these guys like kind of like touching the edge because you want it to be smooth so as you can see make them kind of like similar in the same position so then it'll be kind of smooth when you're doing the scrolling background so there's like no empty spaces in here so it's all filled up okay so now let's hop into our sonic sprite and first we didn't make him go to the front layer because like you see he's in the back so we're going to get a one green flag flicked zoom in a little go to front layer and go to the front and then we're going to broadcast a message named reset we'll need this later so first let's broadcast message oops broadcast message name it reset and then next we're going to see let's make it here to the front okay and then when i receive reset when you receive the message reset we are going to make a new variable we're going to name it score so score for all sprites that's fine so we're going to set the score to zero in the beginning and then we're going to go to this position so the position right here i have is negative 150 negative 85 so it's kind of near the bottom left of the screen so it's a pretty good position i guess so you can do that and then next we're going to define a block so this is simulating the gravity so then sonic will jump up and you'll come down we'll come back right back down so we're going to make a new block so we're going to name it simulate gravity simulate gravity and then we're going to run screen without refresh um this is optional but since like we don't have the animations inside or simulate gravity block this is not necessary but what it does is just make sonic run smoother so then the game will act a little smoother so you can do this run on screen.refresh so we have our simulate gravity block we are going to get an if else statement so if else so if the up arrow key is pressed if key up is pressed you can also do w or whatever key you want and then we're going to switch the costume to jump so the first costume to jump is this one let me find it right here sorry my bad uh it's all the way at the bottom jump so it's kind of like a jumping animation and then we have another ifelse statement so we're going to put it inside the first ifthen area so this part is to simulate the gravity so basically you know how his y position is negative 85. so we're gonna make sure if it's equal so if the y position is equal to negative 85 y position equals to negative 85 we are going to set the fall speed which is a new variable so basically if it's at 85 we will negative 85 we will allow sonic to jump up but if it's not like let's say it's in in the air then we'll make it fall right back down by making it minus one so we're gonna make a new fall speed a new variable we're gonna get false speed full speed for all sprites so here with our full speed we're going to set it we're going to set full speed to fall speed plus 16 so if it's right here if it's on negative 85 y position we will allow the player to jump so we're going to get the plus so we're going to hit the full speed plus 16 full speed plus 16 and then next if it's in the air else then we're going to set the fall speed to fall speed minus one so it's going to come back down full speed minus one so down here we're also gonna do a set fall speed minus one because if you were to jump sonic would get stuck if you don't have an extra one down here so you always want to make sure sonic is coming right back down okay and then this is just defining the variables this is not actually going to make it fall back down and allowed to jump so we're going to have to do change y so we're going to change the y by full speed down here full speed and and then we're going to get if then statement if uh y position is less than negative 85 so sometimes you know um like when you're doing a platform or something they can like fall through the platform and stuff like that so we don't want that to happen so we're going to make it we're going to push him right back up if he somehow falls under negative 85 so we're going to do a if y position is less than y position is less than negative 85 so there's less than that then we're going to set his uh y position back to negative 85 so he'll get pushed back up and we're gonna set the fall speed to zero so we won't fall anymore when he's on the platform so then next we're gonna get an if then statement one more if it's touching the trap or bullet bill so this is for later but like let's say it's touching the trap or bullet bill touching trap or bullet bill which are the enemies then it will broadcast reset right so here we have our simulink gravity so of course it won't work unless if we define the um if we call the function so we're gonna have to call it so up here inside the reset block you're going to get a forever loop and we're going to simulate gravity okay so now you can save the project and i'll show you guys so now you jump you see it it jumps yeah so well there's no animation yet so when you click the up arrow it jumps and it won't fall under as you can see so the jumping mechanic is working it's jumping up and right back down so i'll show you guys if you take out this part what will happen so let's take it out jump see it'll just get stuck to the top so it is mandatory to put this part in so there you go so now we have the jumping mechanic done we can work on the walk animation and the docking animation so let's zoom in again let's uh broadcast right receive the message reset again so when i receive the message reset this is we're gonna do the walking animation now so forever if okay so we're gonna get an if then statement so if not up arrow or down arrow key so basically if neither arrow key is being pressed then we are going to allow sonic to be able to walk so we're going to do knots so if it's not up or down so not up arrow key key up arrow or down arrow then we're going to next costume and then we're going to if then statement if if it's greater than um the costume number is greater than eight so here you see we have eight costumes for the running so you see we have the ducking animation right here so basically um we have eight which is running and then a few that are ducking and then one for jumping so basically if it's greater than eight which is the walking animation then we're gonna set the uh walk animation back to the first one so then it won't go to the next ducking animation so we're gonna go if costume number is greater than eight greater than eight then we're going to set the block animation back to the first one switch costume back to run one and then we're gonna wait point 0.05 seconds right here just so it looks a little better so it won't look like it's lagging so it looks a little bit better when you do that so let's play our project as you can see sonic is able to walk see the walk animation you jump see that yeah so we've got a simple walk animation and next let's do the docking animations over here we have the walk and down here go to the dock so when i receive the reset uh message then we're going to get a forever loop and then if we're in if then statement so if the uh down arrow key is pressed key down is pressed down here then we're going to start a sound so let's get the sound i think i have it yeah toys r here see that so we're going to get the toys start the sound toys and then we're going to switch the costume to duck one so when you press down you'll switch the costume right here so it starts right here for the first ducking costume okay so next we're going to repeat three times repeat three times and then we're gonna wait 0.05 seconds so it looks a little bit better and then we're going to next costume costume so basically we're just gonna make it switch costume to this we're not repeating four times even those four costumes because we're starting on this one so it's going to repeat three times and then go back to here repeat three times go back to here so it just keeps on going until the player lets go of the down arrow key so here we have all of our code for our sonic so let me just move it all down so it looks a little bit better okay so there we have it so if you have anything with it if you have anything that you want to add to it that you didn't add before that you you should add it now okay and then next uh we can make the score thing so we can make it like game score as you keep on going so we're gonna forever change score by one change the score by one this is one of those games where like the longer you survive the more score you get so the background isn't scrolling yet so it doesn't really look like anything yet uh so you jump you duck see that yeah so you can roll yeah so there we have all the walking jumping and ducking animation for sonic so that's it for our first part of the series so this is the first part for the sonic scrolling game so in the next part we're going to be working on the scrolling background traps and the rings so that's it for this tutorial thank you guys for watching stay tuned uh for the next video we'll probably release this shortly after this one gets released so don't forget to like share and subscribe and i'll see you guys in the next video you
