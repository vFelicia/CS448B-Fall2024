hello guys and welcome back to kiss coding playground so today we are going to work on the next platformer part five of the among us platformer game uh so if you guys miss anything you can like pause the video and get the code here okay so here is all the custom block on this side and the main function is this uh broadcast a start game with start to broadcast to other uh message here which will start the game so here's all the code on this side so and then we have some code in the bottom here okay so let me move down a little bit more so here's all the code uh this is like when the player actually drop off uh drop off the to the bottom uh and then this is when they move from one stage to the next to change level and this is the player when it uh you know it got killed and then it reset the game okay so let's see on top here this is the movement control jump control here okay and then this is the checked if it hit the ground this is the move the um the hitbox which is this one then this animated character follows that so this is this is the the part of the the end of the main character so now let's move to the anime character so animated character you have some code on the right here where it starts and then the when green flag is clicked this is like moving uh the right or left and then changing the costume okay okay all right and then you have the ground this is just changing the level and you have the jump pad and this is all the code for the jump pad okay let me move them all together look okay so that's about it so next we'll be working on the other part of the uh the other other spikes and stuff like that other traps okay we'll work on the uh so we'll walk on the sprite uh for the spike so we're gonna paint a new block here uh just make it seven here uh you can use the line just draw up like this and then down and then up down up again you know however you want to draw okay and then from here maybe a little bit longer so this one so here just kind of draw this across so as you can see it's not really good but but you can kind of connect it okay all right so once you get this you can move them to the center or whatever right uh as you can see mine's not really straight i'm just doing it real quick but uh you can you can get it perfectly you like and then you can just feel the color and then fill this okay like this let some spike so for now let me put this spike here like let's say you want a spike here or something like that then you can you can make it smaller a little bit so that you know you can maybe use it for something else okay as you can see there's a little thing here you cannot really erase it if you use an erase tool like this it doesn't erase so you have to actually erase it you see how the line won't erase correctly so if you actually want to erase it you just have to convert the bitmap but it looks a little bit bad i'll just try to play around draw it a little bit better maybe the line a little bit down you know so that you don't have this problem but if you want to change the bitmap you can and then you can just erase that little piece but it won't look good right this is a little blocky but you know but uh i do have my own i drew earlier it looks better i'll just use that um but as you can see just draw any way you like okay so once you draw the the the spike then you can put the coin okay all right so the spike is done okay let's do the code for the spike so similarly for the trampoline really close the coast should be looking like similar to what we have in the trampoline so what i'm going to do is going to take the coal from here okay and move it to the spike okay i'll take everything here two three i'm gonna change up the code a little bit later four and five okay so mine has it like this i'm gonna move it up a little bit spread them out okay okay all right we'll make some change to it okay so since the custom only have one costume right we don't really need a chain custom we can just throw this away put it here like that and then the setup should be the same this x and y should be just for this sprite only okay make sure you when you create the variable that x and y you can see right sprite one only right so make sure you create it for this sprite only right here okay select this select this when you create a variable okay so you can rename this to like spikes or something like that okay okay all right so let's say at the location one let's say this is your first level you want to put it at this location then you know just use the uh use the uh m key kind of thing and it will tell you where it is so let's say 80 80 87 85 whatever 85 97 so you can try that fills for level one you can say like negative 85 negative 97 so we're gonna put one on this we'll put this under here we don't need level three yet we don't know where that three will go right so i have to go there and well to see so the other part is the reset delete the clone we still need that and then this forever loop will be different so when it touch the main character is not going to bounce right we actually want to say broadcast die right just like how we did on the other uh sprite when they fall off the edge so so now let's just test it out so as you can see this is not a little bit off right so you want to move it back up then change it up you know like maybe negative 90 right let's see okay so it looks good negative 9 looks good so if i hit that i get killed right just like this it'll start again so i had to jump over that i guess this is a yeah this is too big actually this um this little thing yeah i guess i did make it over but you know you can change the size of the spike a little bit smaller and uh you know you don't have to do 100 you can do like you know maybe size like 50 or something like that when you start as a clone you can do that right let's do that maybe or you can just change it inside here as well change the sky size highlight the whole thing and then make it smaller or you can do it with the code so let's say um maybe i say the size is uh maybe 75 okay let's start tm again so you see if the 75 is smaller then you have to move your your thing differently i would say just leave it at 100 and then just kind of you know change the uh change the uh the picture inside itself so that you don't have to send different size you know when you're going to different level so let's just kind of resize this a little bit maybe so that this guy can jump over right easier okay all right so and then i think my original get my size a little bit bigger so let's see 100 this time we'll move it back down so let's see negative 97 98 95 i don't know 97 let's try again so yeah it looks good so still a little bit tough to jump over that yeah okay i did make it over so so there you go so that is for the spine so for level two we have the laser we can work on that right now uh what we can do is just paint call it a laser okay and then here in this paint we can just make a one one one dot in the middle somewhere in the middle yes whatever that is okay so one dot in the middle okay one dot in the middle that's good enough so that will be our red laser now let's copy the code from here to here uh the code for the laser a little bit different so we'll we'll try to change it up a little bit so let's copy this copy that this copy this and copy this okay now we have the laser uh let's spread the code out a little bit set up and then the clone and my high is missing so let me get that again okay all right so we have everything that we just copied from the spike but we are going to change it up a little bit okay so for the laser we actually need to do something a little bit different um we need the pen right so let's add the pen block okay so here for the reset with this say erase all and then um we need to have another one say stop all script and sprite and then delete this clone okay the start is the same any change over here uh setup we're gonna do uh something a little bit different here uh so the setup we're gonna have to make it run the laser multiple times so i'm gonna break this apart i'm gonna create my block okay okay it's called start laser again okay okay so we don't need to check this checkbox for this one we can let that run like that i'm gonna put in the bottom here and now what i'm going to do is gonna get this so i'm not gonna go to level one level one doesn't have a laser so level two has a laser so we want it somewhere on top here control m like let's say this is c like 0 124 something like that right 0 0 position should be okay so let's just do 0 120 okay so this is level two sorry i don't know why i have two m sorry i think i push the mouse button so level two okay and we have the same one just like this um what we're going to do is we're going to call this from here um so that we can reuse this code so that's why i made a cell block okay so for the laser come back to the variable whether make another variable called timer so this one select for this sprite only okay so this is like we're gonna put some time on the laser so like after a certain time you know the laser will go away so here we're gonna say set set the timer to zero well we're gonna take out this one so we'll show okay we need the forever loop we can't take this one outside for now we'll change it later uh we can set the color for the pen uh for right now you can set it like some red color or whatever color right oops sorry so you see red something like this whatever okay this is you can use a darker red if you want and maybe this if you like okay all right so and then you have to set the pen size oh not change set set the pen side by one and we're gonna say we erase all and we're gonna do like pen down okay so we're gonna use a loop here repeat loop here repeat 10 and we are going to use the position y change y uh do it like 250 and then do change y minus 250 so it makes it go up and down like this you see these are forming that stop this again okay and then um what we can do is um we can change the pen size here oops change pen size make it three it's a little bit fatter and we can do a wait so i'll wait 0.1 a second and then we're going to change the timer here change timer by one and then we're going to put our if statement under this thing go to our control up to this and go to operator get this one variable go get the timer put it here so we will just say greater than 15 some random thing and then we're gonna broadcast a message say stop laser okay and then we'll say delete this clone after that okay so and then we are going to say when i receive a stop laser i'll move this down for now uh what we have to do we're going to have to stop other script in the sprite in the control here stop all the script in the sprite and whether go depends that you raise all make sure you do that if not it won't work correctly and then we can do a wait like maybe a one and a half second before it starts again depending on how you like it and then we say broadcast start laser again okay stop laser again what we had is uh earlier right we have this uh stop laser again right so what they call this so same like what we did for this right we can do this here say start laser again we'll call this one this block all right let's put more down here okay so we're going to add this sound to this laser go to sound i'll upload this sound later for you guys this is like the zap sound i got so sounds like this it's like laser sound so you can add it to your laser so what we need is uh we are going to we actually don't need this and we'll delete this part let's touch it we're going to use color touch so we have the laser here we need another one start as a clone here when i start as a clone okay so let's scroll down here uh we're gonna set the volume if you want you can set the volume like not to allow or something like that it depends on how much you have on yours how high you have on your volume as you play on your screen okay and you can you can do that it's optional um you can use the forever loop here and now you can do a weight so it's gonna wait some half a second and then we'll play this down until done okay and then we'll do another wait so it's kind of like have a little bit of a delay in between of the laser so let's just try it out okay i'm gonna make the spike a little smaller okay for now let's just oh okay let's just try this let me show you i can jump over this thing okay i'll jump over okay so you can see the laser is kind of going like this you see it goes away as a sound but we still see this little dot here right so let's see if we can fix it so let's put our laser sprite here first okay okay so what we can do is this uh we can say take this one put this here and put it in the back layer so you can see the little dot went away okay all right so you have your laser going you know you don't like the color you can get a little bit brighter i guess so maybe like this yeah i think this looks better right brighter okay all right so we are good with that so now we just want to make sure that when the sprite jump here will die right we have to hit the laser so let's go back to the uh our character here okay so in the character let's change it to like a stage two for now so change it to level two so we can test this so every time it runs always test this uh what we're going to do is we're gonna find the code where we are seeing like if the okay die yet we can change this to kill here so what we're going to do is this we're going to say touching color okay let's see touching color we're going to use the all condition here first okay touching color or this position okay so make sure you don't use the same color so if you use the same color it might it will not work correctly right so uh what you can do is just click on this do the little thing oops let's just wait until that thing comes up there we go okay so we got the color all right so now let's try it out so let's see we got kill right we jump over right we cannot do the color with then we can jump okay so this is working fine so we can put a spike here also for number three so let's say this is level three when we want to put a spike here push the m key some way around at 130 and 84 something like that so let's go back to the spike take this out duplicate this so do that for level three and you can say like 130 right 84 i don't know just try it negative 84. if it doesn't work you know you can just always adjust it okay so let's run this again jump over this so this is so high right so 84 is high so we want to do something i don't know but we have 97 let's just try that so let's try that again so you see okay all right so jump over that cool so same thing for level four you want the laser to be around here or something like that push the m key you see 2 and 127 right so we'll hold our laser go back over here we'll go level 2 now it's level 4. duplicate this now we can put like two with 120 or something that's fine so now let's run it for level four let's go here and test it out level four here so we're gonna start four nope it's not working yet let's see what's going on okay so let's see what's going on that did not work right when we did this there's no coming okay let's see i made a mistake duplicate the code forgot to change it now let's try it so the laser is coming so level four is working fine okay level five let's say you want a laser here push the m key 3 and 120 or something okay whatever take that duplicate this look for level five we'll do uh three or three twenty see whatever let's try that again so this is level four okay the level four is done you see level five it has the laser you can adjust it right whatever you like so no fights the end can't go any further okay all right so we'll stop here for now so uh next time we can work on the uh i think the among us uh what is it the imposter and maybe the smasher i think that's it that should be the end of the uh the tutorial and then you guys can do your own you know we can get better do more level put more stuff and then you can share your project with us all right thank you have a good day bye
