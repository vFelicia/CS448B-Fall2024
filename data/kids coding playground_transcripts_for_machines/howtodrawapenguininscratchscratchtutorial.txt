welcome back guys it's kids and playground here today we're back for another video in scratch and today we're starting a new series called how to draw so if you're wondering how we draw our sprites uh we'll be going thoroughly to teach you and my dad drew this penguin so i'll be trying to attempt to draw it today and uh yeah we're starting this new series called how to draw so hope you catch along and you start um drawing along with us and uh and be better at us at drawing and yeah so you can i made a bunch of different costumes he drew the original one i made a bunch of different costumes red penguin ice penguin evil penguin reverted penguin futuristic penguin a drastic penguin and mini penguin i made a bunch of these things and uh i'll be trying to attempt to draw the normal penguin and let's start a new costume paint a sprite so now and then now let's start drawing first thing you want to do is get the two ovals it's pure black and you want to make oval like ellipse i think it's called ellipse something like that you center it and then you make another one and you put it over the other oval so it kind of looks like a lollipop maybe a little bit lower and that looks around the same it might be a little bit smaller than the other one but we'll increase the size and then now we're going to make the stomach which is also our lips but it's um gray a light gray so that's good yeah uh there we got the stomach now we're gonna make the eyes the eyes is first a white circle and you hold shift down while you're doing this to make a perfect circle see look it's very perfect it won't end up like an oval or ellipse or anything so and you just duplicate it ctrl c ctrl v and then make the black circle inside pure black for the pupil or the eye itself so just a smaller black circle inside of the white circle so ctrl c ctrl v and put it to the next one little cute little mini penguin and now we're gonna make the beak and the feet so the way you draw the feet is you use a light color a light yellow and that's the mustard yellow actually for the inside and of a kind of orange color for the outside well it looks like american cheese or some sort of cheese so yeah you have to make that so it's a darker inside lighter outside so dark mustard yellow and a pastel orange yellowish color and the thickness should be four and then you put you make this little mustard little feet you put it over here and then it's you have to put a backwards after i'll do that in a minute back so it'll be behind the penguin and you ctrl c ctrl v make a new one and put on the other side of the penguin and just go make it go to the back then we have the feet now the only missing part is the beak so this is the tricky part you make um a circle i have a square square and then you cut part of it off you cut the half so you click this you click one of the corners and you backup space with the reshape tools delete or delete yeah and um now you have a triangle because you know two triangles make a square you rotate it and you kind of reshape it a little bit to make it look more longer and more like a beak because you know a square one half of a square is a triangle and that's 180 degrees and a square is 360. so that's why you click use the reshape tool against that to make a beak so right here we have made ourselves a dwarf penguin that looks pretty cool honestly and then i'll teach you how to make like some coloring schemes because you can be very creative with this if you have some free time like what if you want to make a uh i don't know superman superman super penguin see look you can be very creative with this and make some good designs and you can send me the projects on my account dumbbell and show me them uh and show me them and i'll try to comment on some of them and see how good your artwork is because i bet your artwork is very good and yeah so you can just be very creative with whatever you're drawing and so let's just um yeah like this one like what i did red penguin iced penguin evil penguin reverse penguin so there's a lot of possibilities you can make future penguin actually spend a while on this one like a little lever three little buttons and like the buttons yeah actually a little drone and a little control panel so ammo propeller on top yeah so you can be very creative and like this one jurassic penguin a little boat on top of his head he's holding a bone so yeah there's a lot of dwarf penguin there's a lot that you can make a lot of possibilities a lot of colors so um please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below uh what else do you want us to draw we'll try to attempt to draw it so anyway guys see you guys next time
