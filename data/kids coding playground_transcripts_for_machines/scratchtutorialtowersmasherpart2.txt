welcome back guys it's kids code and click right here and today we're back for another video well this is actually part two of the video of tower Smasher so I'm just gonna go rename the title first if you haven't watched part one please watch that right now and in part one we did all this code so this calls this and this cause this and this makes all the clones so so I'm going to move on to the ball we haven't even worked on the bull yet we have to make a new block move ball to stop and another block move so move ball to start is to move the ball over here and move balls to actually move it so let's do a go to let's you go to met to go to around here I think this would work maybe a little bit lower a little bit higher this is much higher I'm just gonna go delete this I think this is close enough maybe a little bit over here actually maybe ok so we have this you can set the ball to 50% so it's not that big it's not that cheap you know won't like it everything at once well if you want to be cheap you can do it but and we also have to set a speed horizontal speed to zero and we can duplicate that oopsies and choose just a V speed vertical speed and then we can also broadcast new message get ready so when I define move ball or change the X you also need changed x and y change X by each speed because it's horizontal speed and change Y by V speed that's vertical speed I'll change the the speed to give me a multiply sign to 0.99 H speed so I'll also set H speed I'm sorry that's actually right here on B speed XP so I'm on the sternest at each speed give this back it's a check at H speed speed speed right there and then a V speed is on top we can put that on top if you want to be speed is negative zero point if then touching the color see if that's not to be the red color just take the brown color this is a simple just a little bit different I'll set the V speed to multiply sine negative 0.8 these be so this H speed and V speed so I did something wrong right here it's actually back it's just actually set it just means actually changed that if you change V speed and this one's actually set a new speed let's just take this house when we could save it set B speed it's actually net negative zero point to what I did earlier so this is supposed to make like when you watch it's gonna be really quick and then it's gonna fall down gradually and get slower so it's supposed to be each speed okay let's move on so we're still working on the ball we can minimize one do not minimize make it smaller so why not when the green flag is clicked just set this score to zero it's simple enough they'll set lunches to 20 so you only get 20 lunches before you lose 20 lunches it'll move balls start like it runs this code and then when I receive complete game they'll say you have to take this one not say for two seconds because it might be a really big number so it'll say you showing because you'll join the two together you score comfort space you score a you score the amount that you scored so you gotta put a score so this will make it so it won't go away like if you put two two seconds that means they'll go away in two seconds so it's move on to if you lose so when the green flag is clicked well go forever then if then loop the launch is equals you'll need greater than or less than because it takes like a time for it to launch again so zero lunches it'll stop all you need forever remember that so it'll keep on going rows in the beginning you'll just stop not really stop but oh just do it once so then we also have to work on the arrow so you can see all this code if if you miss some code you can be sure to pause the video and let's work on the arrow it's the arrow when the green flag is clicked either the pen it's inside this a block thing that you can pick I already have pen already set up and then I'll set the pen color to any color you want I'm gonna use yellow and then you'll set pen size to 15 that's pretty thick and they'll show go forever well risk if we erase everything and it'll go to X this thing so you have to use the backdrop up stage actually two of them and then you always have to change the back first so you can put ball don't go exposition of the ball and all you also need this ball but you need the Y position is this in the Y section oh good and that's pointer will point towards ball what is that point words bowl it'll turn the 480 degrees and then when this sprite is clicked it will broadcast fire you broadcast message though show up hide pen up and then when I receive get ready show and pen down so let's try it up do you see look there's like a little thing doesn't want yet not don't the code yet but we can move on to it's another for the ball bull has another chunk of code so when I receive fire because that's what got them the arrow or reset the timer but so reset timer you have change launches by minus negative also set I'll tell you what the reset timer is for later but now let's focus on this set h gap you need to actually but actually one for the other one so that one it's Mouse X Y also here Mouse Y for the next one now so X and no x position x position and I can just duplicate this I guess yes that could work V gap instead and then noce y instead oh yeah I need this and then go to this and take Y position instead of exposition the gap is to define the where the your mouse is in the ball is so also let's just keep on moving on a set H speed to divide each gap is to figure how much each gap and three so if you just duplicate this it's really easy but instead changes to these speed I change this to VCAT by 30 so this is 4 but like a decent paste but if you want to make this like 20 and this 20 that means this will go like 20 I'll go quicker and if you make it like a larger number I'll ghost um I'll go slower so let's keep on continuing repeat until you need a greater then go sign you up or put this inside 5 seconds and put timer so the timers for it'll go until 5 seconds so keep on moving until 5 seconds or it's touching the edge you'll automatically go it's touching to the edge you'll automatically go oh move the ball so the timer is 4 so we have to put the move ball to start afterwards so if it's if the timer is greater than 5 don't go back to the start it or if it's touching the edge you'll go back to the stock oh so just keep on moving just first remove all the variables Bam Bam Bam Bam except to score you can keep that one you see her scored we can move it more off so as you can see the timer actually works like 1 2 3 4 5 or might count longer and they'll go back there or if it's touching the edge it'll go and you can also hit these things you always also get you score I I've wasted 2 lunches earlier so I can also show you what happens when you lose so we can set these lunches to to save up to so that's gonna be one and last lunch it runs out so you ran a high ran our lunches let's change back to 20 so this is the end of our project so I'm gonna demo it one more time before I go let me add the music first and go at the music forever well that's really big so I already have a sound you can take any sound from the sound library I'm gonna upload a sound this song you can totally play this and I'm gonna go take us down place out and glitching or ride until done that's the song I've been using so anyways I'm gonna go try to gather stick you like doing it into I like getting in school you can skip this part let's just I'm just gonna play five seconds so please like share and subscribe to our Channel and please call us in the comment section below to see what videos will come next and be sure to smash that like please show to your friends and everyone you know cuz to support our channel and if you did thank you
