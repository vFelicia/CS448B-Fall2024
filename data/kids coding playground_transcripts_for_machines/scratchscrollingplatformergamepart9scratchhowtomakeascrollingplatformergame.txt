so welcome back guys to the final part for the scrolling platformer so today instead of wasting time on um scrolling around and showing you guys the code if you feel like you missed anything you may check out my scratch account and uh you can look at the code i will share that i already i will share this project when i'm done i i already have a shared project for the scrolling platformer so you can just check that out so before uh we get onto anything new we have to fix some bugs so i noticed that um before you click the play button um the timer is already running so as you can see i play it i'll just wait like five seconds i click play it's already running see as you can see the timer is already at like eight seconds even though i just clicked the play button so to fix that um in the beginning at start game we want to set the timer to zero and then reset the timer set timer to zero and reset timer so where's reset oh there it is okay and instead of just um doing a bunch of random variable setting right here we'll hide all the variables inside the you win sprite let's uh hide the variable timer here i wanted to hide the variable timer in beginning and as you can see when you play it now you want to wait for five seconds timer just started running as you can see so now we fix that bug we can move on to something new so we were thinking of making bounce pads so we have a bounce pad where if you like touch it you'll jump really high so let me just drag the bounce pad from my uh backpack so i already have like all this code in it so um remember you have to use the m the m thing to find out where you want to put the um trampoline so you can just play a level uh find where you want to put stream clean maybe like right here so um we this this is all the same code from like the saw so as you can see i have all the same code from the saw except just the different positions we'll just need to add some extra code to this so for the tick let's get an if then statement if it's touching the player then we can broadcast a message player where's the player broadcast a message called bounce bounce make a cap bounce and then for bounce when i receive bounce on the trampoline then we can repeat 16 times i'm doing repeat 16 times um since i have eight costumes i just want to do a 16 so it repeats the whole loop twice of the trampoline costumes so um it may be different for you so when i receive bounce repeat 16 times next costume wait 0.1 seconds and right under that we want to add a switch costume back to the costume one because sometimes um instead it's when you're on the bounce pad it might it might end in another costume so we wanted to always switch back to the first costume by default so now we have the bounce pad i'm gonna play the game oh actually no we can't play the game yet we still have to add uh some bounce pad code for the player which is fairly simple when i receive bounce then you want to set the sy to 30 sy to 30 so it's higher than the regular jump height the regular jump height is only 16 is 30 and then we want to change player y by the sy which is 30 by the sy so now i will play it i already have i already have the bounce press position but if you want to do it then press m remember so now we can work on the rock head so i have the rock head right here so same with the saw all this code is similar to the saw except for this part um in this part so we have all that same stuff and i just did the m thing use the m and place where i want the clones i only put the rock head on level three and level five but you can put it anywhere you want so what the rock head is supposed to do is it's supposed to um crush supposed to like move down and crush the player that if it gets too close to it so first you want to go to the player so let's go to the um play game when i receive play game we need to make a new variable you can name it oh yeah all caps activate rock trap activate rock trap set it for all sprites remember all the capital laboratories are for all sprites only and then we'll need to add another one also all caps because it's for all uh all sprites called deck deaths so this is supposed to count how many deaths you've taken in the game so in the beginning and top we want to set the rock strap activate rock truck to no so what it's supposed to do is um when it's when it's getting near the rock drop the rock trap will come down else it will not come down so only activates when you're near it and then down here in here so in the else area you want to add set rock trap to no if it's a win then player win else you want to set the rock trap activate rock shot to n and then we can change the deaths by one when you die as you can see deaths by one and then down here in the tick custom block the tick script i'm going to add an if then statement if the rock trap is equal to n activate rock trap is equal to n activate raw trap then we wanna if the level so what i did right here is if it gets near it then it will activate elsa will not so if the level is equal to three i only put them on two levels remember so if the level is equal to three and the player x position is greater than the 590. so i used the m thing to find out where the rock trap was then i moved it back a little bit so to tell when it activates so just use the m thing to um find where you want to put the rock head just move it to the left a little bit so i just so the rock trap initially was 660 at the x position so instead i put at 590 it will activate the rock trap and if this is true then we will set the activate rock trap to y which means yes and i'm just gonna duplicate this for level five instead of 590 i did 170 so i again i did the mouse thing press the n button and um i got that um so i just position it like that and then set activate rock shot to y if the x is greater than 170. so now let's uh finally we have to add one last part of code for the player win we need to uh set the rock trap activate rock trap to end right here if the player won and now let's play it i can set the level so um instead of setting a level up here i want to set it in the background so i'm going to set it in the background real quick so instead i'm going to take this out and so set it up here set level so i'm gonna set it to three for now so i can show you the rock trap just play it again get these fruits oh yeah and never mind we already did the clone because i forgot that um um i already had the code so as you can see when you get near it oh yeah and i forgot one last bit of code so for the rockhead i forgot to make it uh come down so when i start as a clone so you want to get it when i start as a clone when i start as a clone forever you want a next costume so for this rockhead i actually had costumes for it if you couldn't tell oops sorry it like i guess blinks looks like it's blinking like that um so next costume we want to wait one second and if the activate rock trap is equal to yes or y if activate rock zoom in rock trap is equal to y activate rock strap then we want to change the y change the y by negative 90. so go down by 90 and then we can wait like a pick random two to five seconds for it to come down or go up again wait two to five seconds you can do and pick random but i did two to five so it's a bit easier so it's not too hard then we can change the y by 90 again so it'll go back up so now if we try it it should work so i started at level three see so before you get to the rock trap as you can see it's not activating only activates when you get near it so let's get here as you can see when you get near it it starts activating but when you're not near it then it will not activate and one last thing i want to set that fruit right there to the better place because it's hard to get the fruit because it's up here and the rock trap is coming down in the rock trap one last thing it only activates once when you get near it and then after that it'll start activating so we did that only activates once per level so for the fruit and the um and one of the uh and one of the places we want to change it as you can see when i play it um this fruit is hard to get as you can see right here so i'm just gonna move it down here press n let's see what is that six i'll just round it 675 and the y position is 10. so let's go to the fruits the fourth one i think 675 and then we can set it to 10. so now let's play it see if it's easier to get the fruit and yes it is much easier to get it now when you get near it but now you can get it easier so i actually added some more levels in my new one and my new new game so let's work on the finally let's go to the thumbnail let's add some code for that when i receive start game we'll show our variables here receive start game start game then we want to show our variables show variable level show level level show variable timer and show variable sets timer and show variable depths okay okay and then for here we also since we have an extra variable we also want to hide the variable deaths up here and next we want to go back to the u.n and hide the variable deaths as well right here i hide the variable death so deaths right here so yeah that's pretty much the game set it to one i'm going to play the whole thing one time just to show you guys i'm going to select the green skin oh yeah and we have to set the deaths in the beginning to zero when flat flight do you want to set the deaths to zero let's make it bigger so now i'll show you the whole game oops so so i'm only actually going to play a little bit of it because we're low on time i'm just going to play and show you the trampoline and rockhead area so the trampoline pretty cool three with the frog head so we have another chair playing right here as you can see the rocket comes down waits took random and yeah so that's it oh yeah and it's not dying yet because we have not added the code so the death part is the same as the saw so i can actually just copy it that part this part duplicate that to the rock head put that down here thing as a saw so i will set the level to level three to show you guys it can die now level three play so i'm gonna go to the rocket seeing that when you touch the rocket you'll die so that's it for today's video the last episode for the scrolling platformer i hope you guys like learning how to make this game and don't forget to like share and subscribe and i'll see you guys in the next video
