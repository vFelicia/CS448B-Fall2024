hello guys welcome back to kids calling playground once again we will be walking on an easier platform game today I think the ninja one that I started earlier it's a little bit too tough I think maybe if kids doesn't have a good understanding of scratch maybe too difficult so this is a little easier and also I have fixed it the some of the issue with the ninja game I encounter before the ninja getting away kind of stuck in the in the middle of the tiles here on the floor those are above platform so I fixed that a little bit so if you watch this video later you work on the ninja game you can make that changes there okay so today we'll make this a simple scratch platform again so as you can see we have a one treasure hunter guy here we have about three small platform on the top and the bottom platform on the bottom so the point of this game is the discharge of hunter how it jumps around and collect the gym so I don't have any level is only one level so this is just demonstrating of the simple scratch platform again okay alright let's go on to the second page okay so this video this tutorial you can learn about the custom block how to edit the sprite custom sprite a platform editing editing that platform and also you can control the sprite within the central platform learning how to do the control I will need there's a gravity pouring porta the sprite down right and then you cannot kind of hold a sprite back up you know if it touch certain color or the platform also you want to know where to download these sprites and tileset you can go to this URL below I will also have that in my description as well on the on the video alright okay let's get started okay alright let me demo the game once to you guys and then we'll get started okay so let me go to Mac screen okay so you see the this is the treasure hunter guy he can run and laugh and right jump this if you want to slice haha so you can run and slide how about than that it's really simple you just gonna jump around so I just can see if he's tried jungle pushing back down will show you so this is a little bit more smoother than the ninja ones so don't get stuck over there and also as you can see the smallest changes yeah alright so let's get on to the coding scheme gonna start this alright okay so before I begin please like share and subscribe to our channel and if you know anybody who's interested learning scratch you can pass our channel to them greatly appreciate it and if you have any comment or question just know down on the video below the comment below the video okay let's get started so we'll go file new okay so what do we need to do first so first will actually lower sprite into the game we can delete this cat we don't need we can say paint so this is painting the sprite so after you click on this paint sprite you go into here you can upload all your costume so I this is my tile set let me download my character first so this is the cake I'm using so the objector how many about we don't really need all the different sprite for the idol because I find that if we make idle switching costume it it's not that good actually the game doesn't run away well so we'll take the first or take all the jump okay let's do jump here from jump zero to jump nine and then run zero to run nine and sly okay so we take all this was hold the shift key and select and then hold ctrl P just selected the first Idol okay so we click open so as you can see all these are getting loaded so you have Idol you have jump and then you have run and you have slide right so where all the costume okay so the first custom would we did we can delete that okay so we have our guy over here okay so next we can get the platform so uh to make the video shorter I already have my platform but I'll show you guys how you would actually do it so let me go to demo I already created my platform okay Salo okay so how do you do the platform so in the platform the same way so what you do is you can just kind of upload all your platform in here and then you just kind of click on the platform say convert to vector so this is my let's say this B this is a bit nap Rice's connective a convert to vector and then you can use this arrow key selected say ctrl C copy and then you can go to your platform and then you can paste it there and you can just like kind of lined up like this you know however you want to line up your platform right so that's how we did the platform so same thing you will just upload right so you upload the custom and you have to go to the desert tile set go to the PNG go to the tile and just upload all your tile just say click on the first one hold the shift 3 click the last one say upload open so it will upload everything to here and after that you can just say convert to vector and then you can build a platform or you can just make like simple platform like this as well view like right so it doesn't matter so let me just delete that so I'm just so so what do you do is you can just make your platform and then you can resize them right you can say resize bigger and solar so when I say let me do an example for this one let's say for this will let's say we'll take one here right let's say we do one yeah I'm just doing over here let's say I put it here right this isn't one and then let's say I put this guy I copy this I go here control C control V and then this is the second block and this is the third block click here go back here and I can put it here so as you can see I kind of form one platform right you can come look into it a little bit make sure they're all aligned and you can like select them and move this guy out of the way and you can move this down and then what you can do is make sure you have this arrow here select them and you can kind of resize them right so how big you want how small you want so this is how you go the platform okay so you guys kind of get the idea how you would do the platform right okay so let me just trash this just delete this okay so we have the little man here with the platform I'll go back to my first platform this is the one I'm using so you can I move it around make sure you cover all the bigger than outside so that he actually doesn't fall off here so make sure that the platform's a little bit out bigger than the box around here okay all right so we've got the platform out of the way what we can do is we can you can decorate this a little bit later also and also we need to a background ISO habl√≥ to go back to the desert tile and there's something called background here background select that say open so this will fill the background in the back so you have the kind of the desert look and feel for the girl thought I came and then so now we have the background and you can add music later on and all that we can do that later but for now let's get the get create some variable and get going okay so what we need to do is we can change this one to rename it to score okay and we'll have to mix them all variable we have our fall speed this is basically detecting how fast the sprite going to fall down and then we are using run costume index this is kind of how I show how the running animation for the photo sprites since they have multiple costume we are going to use the index so if you can see here go back to this sprite you can see here you see jump zero zero three zero zero four so we've kind of run through that either run or jump or whatever right so that's why that's four and then we'll make another variable called Chun costume index this is like the the loop for the index for loop then we can use something like and we can specify it like a speed the jump speed for it as a variable so we can change it later of you when you're moving the game you don't have to like change the code at all for that and you can say run the speed so we're gonna make something so very very simple here so we have a couple of variable the fall speed basically keep track of the sprite falling down with gravity you have the running costume with the jumping costume right okay all right so that's all we have for right now and then we can decorate this costume thing later so let's kind of take out this I mean I can put it here for now maybe you guys yeah we can see this custom house change right okay so we we have and we can add the gym and other stuff so you know want to add the sign you can call the object you can get the sign out right and you can put the sign somewhere here and if you like all right wherever you want to put it and you can change the size maybe 75 right here this is the sign okay all right we have the sign and let's upload the magic Kim so I uploaded form I have a lot of game before and then we can upload some cactus let's take this one okay and let's get another one let's take a tree and we'll take one more at the bush we want the one too much stuff on here but just a couple and then we take one the magic gym that we had I created already from the other game okay so we have kind of order called things that we need it and you can adjust it any way you want make the tree I say smaller all right you can put in 75% you can make the tree smaller the cactus you can put it anywhere you want let's say you want to put the cactus up here or here or whatever you can do that let's put the cactus down here maybe maybe you're like great I don't know right here that looks like he's not blocking right let's put him up here okay so you can make this cactus 75 or 50 or whatever you like and and then this little tree you can put them on top if you like okay so the tree will quote me 50 oh okay maybe 75 will put the tree 75 in 50 a little small okay okay all right try to get it aligned perfectly but I think it's a little bit tough but I think it's good enough okay so we have that we have the gym so what we're going to do is we're gonna make this a little smaller maybe 25% so he is about 25% we're gonna start him somewhere let's say like right here doesn't matter and then we can code it so that's why when he dropped down we kind of stopped him over here okay wait without though it's a South Bush there's our cactus this is our tree and this our scientist our magic Jim and this is our sprite so we have everything okay all right we have all the variable we have the platform now let's work on the treasure hunter so we'll call this guy treasure hunter okay so we have the nice filtration wrong okay so with a treasure hunter so what we want to do is we can define some custom block here so that every time is start in a way we we can call this block I just call it start again but like if you're making a more than one level right you can call this function start again and then we set everything so what we want to do the first thing we want to do it in case the characters hop we want to show so zoom in a little bit say show and then we will switch to the first costume which is the idle right I don't custom by standing and we can say okay go to this position here so ever position we just move this guy here so go with this position here and make sure that we also have to make sure that you have selected list so that he doesn't rotate upside down and you can say at the beginning we want to make him point to ninety basically pointing to the right and also we want to make this guy go to the front layer so that he will not get blocked by either the tree or the cactus or something like that right okay and we will try to initialize some variable in the beginning so let's initialize some variable I will say the run speed so run speed will be 10 T for 10 and then will can't replicate this we can say jum speed let's say 15 like you can put any speed you want and we can we are going to put the for speed this is like when he's dropping down or football speed zero in the beginning okay and then we can set the custom index to zero also in the beginning so that we set it so that run custom index is zero duplicate that we can put in the jump custom index also zero okay all right that's how much we have for now okay so this is our custom block for these start and now let's walk on this next one is these simulating gravity so this is kind of making the the sprite fall keep falling down and making it either when it's falling down I kind of keep him up in the in the in the platform so we will meet that and what we can do is we are going to change first thing we do is that we're gonna change Y basically changing this position of this uh this uh yeah check your hunter by the fall speed so we will actually go into a yeah change the fall speed later but the another loop but uh basically every time this run or change the force bit making it go down okay and then we will say I will put an if condition here so we'll say if okay if the touching the platform so we need an end condition so we want to use a in the way that it can check both the its touching a platform and color because we don't want the other color array or any other thing else that could be on the platform so we'll say if touching oops I think I should do that over here let's jump first if touching the platform and or say touching color so what I'm going to do is I can click on this little dropper here kind of go in here so we're gonna drop this this one this color here okay so it was touching the platform and it's this color okay we are going to do okay so we'll check the fall speed so we'll say we'll use what the uses if an else statement here so this is a little bit different than the ninja platformer I initially did I think this works a little bit better so if you're working on the ninja platform later on after you watch this video you can try to change that to match this okay so we can say put this check here we'll say fall speed you have the fall speed it's greater than zero okay and what we did is we need another loop put a repeat until in here I'll explain what it all means something let me just call this first okay this and say here change Y by minus one so what is this doing is if the fall speed so basically the jump up right we're gonna set the fall speed to there to the jump it to the fall speed so it was a positive number of the fall speed and he's not touching this color we want to make sure that he's going down so and we'll jump up we wanna make sure bring him back down okay that's what this shows mean and we need another one here and this one we are going to put a positive so what happened is if the fall speed is negative basically he's falling down right now he's falling down point up on down become it was not touching this will put a plus one so make sure that he stand back up on here so make sure that when he's uh when he's jumping he either on the top of the platform or below the platform okay that's what this what is called us okay and then at the end we want to set the ball speed back to zero no sigh here okay okay so every time let me add some code and we can actually test this out so okay so we have already defined this to custom block what we're going to do is we're gonna use this custom block when the stop green flag is clicked so what we can do is go back over here in this event we say when the green flag is clicked we are going to call this start again basically that resets everything and we need to have a forever loop here to make this sprite going down and we have to go back to the variable we say change fall speed by minus one basically making this sprite keep on going down okay and then we need another control us the spring trackers click here and we need to have another forever loop here so this will keep on checking the gravity make sure the user the player stay on top or the bottom of the year of that platform okay so if I run this you can see how they player react so you can see the player can't drop down all right let me move him a little bit higher let's say let's say I move this player let me stop this let me move him like maybe here let's see like this right you can kind of see let me just throw this in here throw it here just for testing purposes we have not made the ninja run and jump yet so as you can see you kind of fall down and it stops it stops right so it stops right there because of this KO here this one is touching the platform either going up or down we want to make sure that he is staying on top of the platform so that's what how and then after that after it written through this and when we're touching the platform and then we'll set the false bit to zero then they will not fall anymore right so that's how it is so you can see this fall speed here so let me run this again just pay attention to this number here on top you see it says you know apart from the power from that fall speed right keep on going negative in here and it gets here it's changing back to zero so you know they didn't just not only fall down anymore further so let's stop here for now we'll continue the blacks next lesson to make the ninja kind of running and jumping and sliding and then maybe one more lesson with the collecting the gym and all that ok we'll stop here for now thanks for watching please subscribe like share our video thank you very much bye bye
