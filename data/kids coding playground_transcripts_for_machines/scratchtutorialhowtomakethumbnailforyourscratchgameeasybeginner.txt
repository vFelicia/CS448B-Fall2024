so welcome back to another video on the channel kids coding playground today i'll be teaching you guys how to make a thumbnail so let me demo this game first to show you how it's like so as you can see i just use the apple game apple catcher game but i just added the thumbnail so let me just get 25 points really quick so just say you win wait three seconds then i'll show the thumbnail okay so for the thumbnail we want to get a one clicked in the beginning i'll just explain the code so in my case i want to hide these two variables in the beginning because i don't want it to show so it won't look that great if it shows so i wanted to go to the front layer because it's the thumbnail go to zero zero set ghost effect to zero so you can see it wait two seconds so as you can see i'll wait two seconds before switching to the play button screen and it'll repeat 10 seconds and change the ghost effect by 10 so it'll fade away see looks cool so it broadcasts a message called thumbnail so it'll receive a message called thumbnail and forever it will go to the zero zero and go to the front layer so when you so when you and it'll set the ghost effect to 100 so as you can see when you stop it it shows like that because i had to go to front layer when i received the thumbnail so if you want to do this you first you gotta make about another backdrop i just need to play and you just wrote click on the play button to start the play button so when it receives the thumbnail it will show which is the the green background with the click this one when it switches to this one next you want to um switch backdrop to play go to zero zero when it's when the flags clicked when the sprite is clicked it'll switch to the blue sky background hide and broadcast start so this one broadcasts the start one so as you can see when you press play we'll switch to blue sky the apple will receive start and run the code down here and the same goes for the bowl start the start message starts the apple code and the bowl code so from a thumbnail i just like copy pasted the backdrop for this one painted a new sprite pasted it here just wrote apple catcher on top put a couple apples and a bowl so that's pretty much sums up the video guys thank you guys for watching i'll see you guys next time and don't don't forget to like share and subscribe to our channel and like this video thank you guys for watching
