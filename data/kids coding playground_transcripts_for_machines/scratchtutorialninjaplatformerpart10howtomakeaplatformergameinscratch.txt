hello guys welcome back to the channel I thought before I was gonna be able to finish the Medusa on one video seems like that is too long so I did break it in half so this is the private final video now for this series for this ninja platform okay so before we start please like share subscribe to our channel and if you know anybody who would like to work with kids Cody please pass our channel to them I will introduce more different kind of coding later on but for right now we're using a mostly scratch later we'll probably look into other language such as Python and other may begin because studio to another kind of language to do the programming okay so let's begin okay what to hurry up and finish it I think taking a long time in the video let's try to get it done quickly so the unit is I can get hit right so what to have dad okay so um what they put more coal for that so what we're going to say is this because I got hit right so how to make this knife disappear also but I just finished in the do the first let's say Oh back over here event here we'll say looks at ball one cut it okay if the Medusa got hit I will change the metal sir HP buy one Medusa HP by one by negative one sorry negative one and then with a check and where the check if the Medusa HP is equal to zero so that means you know there's a dead wanna put in a Cell me such for like a squeaking screaming sound so this is pretty good we'll use that so if it gets to the end you know whoa my curse just come on scream I'm not sure you can see this I mean zoom back in a little bit okay and the wall switch to costume so we'll switch to custom to deaf number four number one or whatever that matter and then wait Oh a fourpoint do it one fivesecond and that was footage to death number two mm so let's check out custom depth or one and two how they look so def number one number two okay that's how they look let's go back and there none will have to one so if it's dead then what it said say that else oh I forgot anything else fe if an else actually let's change this out okay I also set the Devere on this variable back I will set the custom back to one and then we'll say ok this is actually wrong sorry sorry so we want the one her not zero so this is when it's actually greater than zero meaning this she's not exactly dead yet you know she she just got hit so we try to make her like like ouch kind of sound but uh that's not when she's when she's when she's greater than zero so if it if she's she's not that good we'll do this but when she's dead we'll actually do something else actually so we'll look at the costume so we have deaf he writes or custom moving one right one two three so we will use the death one two three so we reset that to one and we can switch the costume Peter sixth time I think with six eight one two three four five six right okay so we'll repeat sixth time J captain to Pier what's a six and then we'll change the customer before that we had to actually make the Coase effect so we when we kill the Medusa we don't do that also we don't want a year actually the ninja getting hit by the Mateus actually even though she's dead but she's not totally dead yet and you can still get hit so what we can do is I'll show you how what I mean later okay let me put in the KO first okay go to look whoa do a change ghost attacked by ten so kind like time slowly the Medusa fade away so we want to do that then we will put in here saying the switch in the costume will use the join operator again so we have something called a friend definitely I have spelled correctly let's just check yeah yeah okay and then we will use the index of the custom here okay and then with a increase their customer count here okay all right and then we'll played when actually when she's totally dead we might have there not a sound that's just this magic think that sounds good so right so when she's dead we'll play that self like you can't get a porn or something okay so we'll say start okay well say yeah play the cell start magic sound and then we'll we'll hide this Medusa here and then we'll what casts a message what we're going to do is we're gonna what cast this Sun message to let the Medusa start again so we'll say again okay so this is our message so when I receive this thought again what you can do is you can like come wait have a way condition here you can use a random like maybe three to five seconds another ten doesn't have like kind of wait for some time and then you can call this block again so now we're almost done right so with the actor Cole for the fourth is right and was that the co for the ninja as well so okay um so when the ninja I'm into the matter so get hit you get this broadcast here what we can it was go back here whoaah some Cole year saying if I receive cap here basically cut and hit the Medusa I will just hide is this knife so that doesn't keep on traveling to the end right and also in the ninja here bombing on the water is so on what we also need is that for the Medusa if it hit it got hit with who saw something so let's move this up a little bit Oh daddy no not if condition then I'm gonna have to track this he'll they've got him it'll get messy okay so here we will say so we actually have to check him and do the help I'll show you what I mean later as I'll show you this first I think so I just say touching my here I said sages advice a touching deucey that I can say what cast death right like this way but it will not be good I'll show you how why I mean that okay let's let's start this let's just try okay I was having some issue earlier my ninja gets stuck when I put the Medusa in I think I found out what the issue was um the issue is that the ninja here sometime if you have more than one of these custom block inside of the year when start with the foil loop it has some problem I have seen that in the past so I broke this up this one used to be like forever loop with the two similar gravity and run control inside how to break this up into write two different one that actually fixed at the issue and then one you have to in a forever loop going in there's things getting messed up and it's not triggering the custom block so I have to break this up into a separate one being black is quick now it's working fine let me just take us out that variable now so when you actually have any problem with your Korra you always want to open up the variable and just kind of go through what they are so that way you can actually see you know what things are not walking or walking whatever it is okay so let's take a look again so we have the Medusa on left and right basically he's trying to like find out when the moves I see if I know how far you can walk to the left oh how far you want the right before it turns around so it that's why this toe is there this um 70 and plus seventy okay alright so the meter says 3 HP so what we're going to do is I mean Joe and India when the Medusa touched a ninja right here so we'll put it inside here so I show you something so we need to change this condition actually so let me just save this let's run this so as you can see there's a squawking light on HP right so we can jump up hope that we get her good so one more thing like if we use that pipe we hit her you see how she's laying down on a ground of course effect but we still capture by her so what we can do is we can fix this condition here so instead of talking Medusa we are going to say touching Medusa and HP is greater than zero okay so we have to condition here and I'm gonna do sir HP is greater than zero move this over a little bit so basically for each piece he wrote and you know we we cannot we cannot get attacked by her okay we're gonna try it again let's stop so you say I would not be a problem because I that coal right so only if their HP is greater than zero then I can't get attacked by her some of them we see that after three to five seconds she can appear again that we can change it here depending on how wait I can change the condition so he said okay that's something there's still some error there the Medusa did not hold the effect is fading but it's not going down right so okay so we have the issue with the Medusa the getting hit is still kind of moving so what we need to do is we're gonna use this block here saying stop otoscope in the sprite so we have to put it before this so we'll stop this guy because this guy said conjoined emitters are moving so we wanna stop this and then we'll make the death animation and then we'll start again so this will help and also we can reduce the Medusa speed maybe two three then she's moving way too fast let's give it a try now so she's a little smaller yes let me put the sound back I think I just might so let's go back oh oh my coop got hit by her so he see it she's she's no longer and she'd fade out she should not be moving again so she says she never move again and we have a passer problem okay so I think that fixed that issue got the gym oh by the way Simon you can do like 10 region 3 to 10 seconds so something like that off I just and maybe a little bit better so that she don't come back so quickly so say this is bad stage our final stage so we landed here so this final stages here so let me high just label tips of a costume and ok let's test the game from the beginning you can keep the right gal with a ninja when when the ninja die you can actually like you know we make different things like after portal when you can say stop the do cell phone tell me how again you can't do a lot of different things if you like and also you can put up a little way of the ninja diary it wouldn't respond and wait as well so we can count them or one you win so that's kind of about it with this ninja platform game I mean if I have time later maybe I can try to fix some of the issued with the this a green platform here later because you know sometime we can get stuck in between of this to platform and if we hit put the hitbox then sometime you cannot get on to it and it's gonna fall off so it's a little buggy on this sorry about that so that's about it for the ninja platformer game just hope you guys understand now just this is just a simple one showing how you do like platformer from one stage to the next station having some the ninja different custom attack throwing the knife out and stuff like that okay alright thank you
