welcome back guys to kids coding playground so today we'll be working on the fifth part i believe for the apple dash game we've been working on so in this video we will be working on the pig skin like we have you can switch skins and if we have time um we might work on the force field as well okay so without further ado let's start it let's get started so before we start we're going just to look through the code so you can get anything you missed to make sure that you guys have everything right so here we have the um player and then we have the bomb this is the bomb movement of the bomb the bomb explodes this will happen if it hits the player the health this is if you hit a bomb you'll lose health the basket to catch the fruit um and then we have the fruit fruit one this is all the fruit there that and then the begin button this just to click it so you can start the game the coin this is the currency of the game uses to buy upgrades okay okay hopefully you got all this down in the hit box for the bottom when the fruits touch it the shop this is if you hover your mouse over it'll get bigger and smaller when you click it this will broadcast a message called shop and here we have the shop background so the shop the background and the shop are different normal background and the shop background under two different backdrops you have the exit button so if you want to exit or something it's just um this is the same thing as the shop when you hover it'll get bigger when you click it it'll go back okay got the wings upgrade to make you go quicker okay let's go inside let's check the purchase of the wings and we have one more scooper here let's go to the basket i'll zoom in so you have a better look at it basket code the larger basket this is gonna make your basket bigger and okay today we'll be working on the pig to add to uh let the player have the option of switching the skin so first we're just gonna drag and drop this code into the pig it's really simple just drag and drop the shop thing we're gonna just duplicate all this uh so we have it right here okay so we have to change some stuff right here so on my previous one i had 60 85 as the coordinates and right here this should all be the same this um should be the same as well just keep this all but with broadcast another message we're going to call it check checked check skin purchase check skin purchase that's what we're going to do this all all this code will be the same all we have to do is receive the message when i receive the um check skin purchase we are going to get an if else statement so we're going to have to make a new variable first so we're going to name it um skin purchase status this is to check if it's bought status okay so we're gonna hide the variables so we're going to get an if else right now so if um so we're gonna go to equals so if the pig character status pig uh skin purchase status is equal to unlocked so let's say you've already unlocked the skin and bought it then we will broadcast a message called switch skin switch to pig skin skin i'll name it like that and then we're going to stop the script so this this is if it has already been bought and down here we're going to check if the player has enough money to purchase it or not so we're going to get a fl statement if then else so we're going to go if money is equal to or greater than 100 so we're gonna i'm gonna price it as a hundred um you can price it at any cost you want just make it a bit reasonable so if it's uh greater than or equal to 100 so 100. so if the money is greater than or equal to 100. so we have the variable money let's put that into the first slot and the money right here and then we're going to change the money by negative 100 so you lose the money after you buy it money by minus 100 and then we're going to set the uh skin status to unlocked uh skin purchase status we're gonna set it to unlocked once you have bought it and then after that we're gonna switch the costume in the costume two which is the grayed out one the purchased one that means you've already purchased it so we're going to switch the costume to costume 2 and after this we're going to broadcast the message the switch to pigskin message okay and then in the else right here if they do not have enough money and do not buy it then we're going to set the pig character status the skin purchase status to locked so it's not you're not going to be able to buy it and we're going to switch the costume to one the first costume the one that has not been purchased yet okay so now we have the script okay so i could have actually just drag and drop this code in here and change some of the variables but i just wanted to show you step by step you guys can do that if you want okay so in the purchase in the pick we're gonna get what i receive start game we're starting right here start game then we're going to hide okay so also in here let's see if we did yeah we already did this okay i was just trying to check if we did that in here so we have to also put start theme for these and then um we're also going to get a one receive start screen receive start screen then we're going to hide we're going to hide and we're going to set it to locked so you cannot buy it yet and switch it to costume one set skin purchase that's still locked and we're gonna switch the costume to costume one like that okay and then one more script in here and then we can move on to maybe the option where you can switch back to the go skin and then we're gonna get a when i receive starts uh when i receive check the skin purchase check skin purchase we're going to get an if then statement so we're gonna get if the skin is unlocked so we're going to equal if the skin purchase status is equal to unlocked so if it's already bought unlocked then we're going to forever go to control can we hide that group forever we're going to switch costume to costume 2 so it'll be grayed out it would always be the second costume all right so this is the pig's code so this is just like the cosmetic stuff and then right here we have the script to see if it's locked and you can buy it and stuff like that and then right here we have the starting and resetting stuff like that okay now let's go into your last sprite so this is to with the option let's say maybe you want to uh switch the costume um back to the ghost let's say you don't like the pig and you bought it and you switch it back to the ghost so this is what we're going to do so we can drag and drop this script this shop script into the ghost so do that real quick all right so the place i set it to is negative 175 negative 25 those are the coordinates i put and i'm going to keep all this same thing and we're going to broadcast another message we're going to broadcast a message called switch to ghost sprite switch to go sprite and in here we're also going to get the same thing we can just drag and drop this script here the start game and the start screen and oops okay i got the two scripts and we will not need this right here to take that out okay so now we have to switch the ghostbrite we're probably we're going to go into the player so inside the fruitcatcher player we're going to receive a message so when i receive switch to ghost switch to ghost sprite oh we are going to uh switch costume uh switch costume to the fruit catcher one which is the this guy and we're actually gonna have to upload a pig costume into this so then we can have a second sprite for the second skin so right now we're going to go back here we're going to switch costume to the fruit catcher or the ghost and then we're going to set we're going to make a new variable we're going to name a character to keep track of what has i think we already made it or it already came with it because i just um dragged the sprite in so we're gonna use the character sprite if you have not made it make it and then we're gonna set the character to ghost character to ghosts ghost and then um in here okay so now we're going to get the pig sprite okay so finally got my um pig costumes from the from another game i had so we have the pig one and we're getting another picks of one is the angry pig and the other one is the smiling pig um so the angry pig is if you get hit by a bomb it will switch that costume so inside the script right here we are going to when i receive um switch to the pig costume we're going to again i want to receive switch to pigskin we are going to switch the costume to costume 2 which is the pig one switch costume to costume 2 and we are going to set the character the variable set character to maybe pick all right okay so now that we've got all our code for the player let's start the game so you click again so when you hit s in the shop you go to the shop as you can see the pig sprite is right there and the ghost spray is always available um because it's free and i'm just going to give myself like 100 100 money for now so i can buy the pigskin it'll take a while okay let's buy it as you can see the costume has switched to the pig i might have to recenter the um basket a little bit but now as you can see the costume has become a pig so inside the basket maybe since it um maybe like move it down a little bit like right here i don't know how the ghost would look like on it i'm gonna see that doesn't look that great so i'm just gonna keep what i had before so maybe you can center and go up so it was like about right here so i think that should be okay okay all right i set the money to 100 i'm gonna see as you can see it looks fine i i recentered it to look a little better let's go to the shop and spy this so once we have the pig let's go back to the shop and switch back to the ghost as you can see it just switched back to the ghost now the costume is back to a ghost all right so now i can switch skins and all that so today we worked on the pigs icon to purchase the pig the um swishing back the skin and the pig skin so yeah i think that should be it for today's tutorial thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share and subscribe to kids going to playground and we'll see you
