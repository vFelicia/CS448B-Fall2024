hello and welcome back guys to kids coding playground today i'll be making a video on how to make your titles look attractive and make them look good overall so instead of making those simple just like text we're going to be making them more advanced so here we have a text from one of our thumbnails so right here says game right but it looks like it's like kind of 3d like block letters so i'll be showing you guys how to do that today so without further ado let's start a new project so we're going to create a new project okay so we're going to delete the scratch hat um and then so basically what you do is you paint a new sprites and as you notice when you try to type text you cannot use the outline but what you do it's kind of weird how scratch works this way okay so you can just draw us like a circle right just draw a circle go to your text i'll zoom in so go to your text and type something so we're going to name this we're just going to say hello or something so you write that and then you click here first and then you click here and then you get outline for some reason this works um i don't think it's supposed to work like that but i guess you can actually do that you can actually make it have outlined so what we're going to do is make this all black so we're going to make our back our hello black this is the back layer and then we're gonna make the outline to eight so it's kind of hard to see like you're gonna make it something like that and then we can delete our circle sprite and then we can enlarge our spriter here so we hold down alt so then it will stay you make it a little bit bigger okay so there we have our hello so what we're going to do ctrl c ctrl v and then we have our second one and then we're just going to remove the outline and now we're just going to make it red so here we have our hello and then try to center it a little bit and there you go so now you have your block letters and as you can see we had some brown shadow so if you can also add shadow if you want to make it even more better it's for extra bonus points you can control c ctrl v you get another one uh you can probably you make it brown let's make the color like kind of brownish like dark brown like that and then so you basically just want to make this go back one layer not to the back sorry back one layer and then this red one you just try to get make it look like it's a shadow so you can like move this one a little bit that and then this one kind of like this so as you can see you kind of got like a shadow behind your letters so that's pretty much it for this tutorial on how to make your text look way more attractive and more awesome and also a quick update from youtube they um didn't let us reupload our python video on how to download uh youtube videos into mp4 files because like it uh it was against the terms of service so that will not be on be able to upload again so that's pretty much it for this tutorial thank you guys for watching i hope you enjoyed watching this simple tutorial and i will see you guys in the next video you
