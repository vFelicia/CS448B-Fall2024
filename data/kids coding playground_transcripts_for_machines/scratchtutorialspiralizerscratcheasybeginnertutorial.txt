so welcome back guys to another video scratch tutorial today we'll be making a game called spiralizer it's not really a game more like a project so um this is from a book you can check out the book in our description below ok so how you so the default angle and speed is 74 just makes a cool effect of a spinning spiral you can play with it you can make the speed or you can change the angle yeah you can play with it I guess so without further ado let's hop on so thank you let's make a new project first of all let's rename this just by robots or face a spiralizer or spelt that wrong I think ok no ok spiralizer ok so first we can make some variables one called angle and the other one called speed so you have angle and speed you can double click on this to make it the drag and couple click on this to make it drunk because you need to you need to be able to track I'm sure I position it ok there you go it's an angle and speed so after that we can complete this fresh cat let's make a backdrop just get a black square that's what I did just get a black square square tool and just drag sensor okay so it's entered that's the backdrop so now let's go get a sprite we want the ball sprite ball and so so this is the one that spiral eise's around make changing the color effect so we want to include you want to set the ankle and speed to their default default angle and speed so the vfold angle I would put out seven and the default speed I would put at four okay so you want to set the size of thirty percent so it's smaller set the size to 30 percent and you want it to go to the center of zero zero three two zero zero okay so you want to erase all the pen effects in the beginning we need the pen so if you don't have a pen just at the extension that's gonna be right here I already have it here so you want to erase all in the beginning set the pen size to one and pen down so this would be like a the color that comes out so you need it forever leave forever create a clone of myself so just keep on making duplicates of itself and turn turn to turn to the right angle degrees so how much how whatever a number your angle is that's how much it'll turn so let's say your angle seven it'll it'll turn seven your angle is ninety will turn 90 degrees see the ball spinning accordingly to the angle it's kind of hard to see but you can see it a little bit so yeah so now we work and then now finally we put changed pen size pen color sorry change and color by one so we'll make different colors so right now we have this the spinning the angle so next we'll be making the speed so we need control go to control get when I start as a clone get it when I start as a clone um get a forever loop drag the forever loop under here then move speed step so I'll move how much speed it is so if it's four then I'll move four steps if it's a TS a teaspoon gonna move eighty steps so move speed steps so go get the move ten steps move speed steps and then and then you need it then statement if then touching the edge then don't delete the clone touching the edge then delete the clone delete this clone and then finally this is optional but I would recommend adding it when key space press erase all so you can erase everything if you press the spacebar and delete this clone so delete all the clones in the background so that's it it's pretty simple so let's play it see spinning it's pretty cool change the speed goes faster change the angle it'll spin faster yeah it's pretty cool effect you know and if you put at zero speed zero angle it would not do anything okay guys thank you guys for watching please like share subscribe to your channel ring the notification bell to receive all the latest updates and thank you for watching
