so welcome back guys to another video in kids coding playground today we'll be finishing the rock blaster 2.0 so before i start i'm just going to scroll through the code and do before i uh before i start uh please like share and subscribe and ring the notification bell so now let's so you can just pause the video if you want any um if you missed any code you could just pause the video and put it down so i'm just going to spend like two seconds you can pause it and then this is the rock blaster player the player so there's a player i'm just gonna put this on so it's easier to see then you have the laser the laser code um the game over sprite i can actually rename this and and then next we'll get the shop so for the shop this is the code um and then for the exit exit button exit button shop background this is just the background to switch when the shop opens you have the pause button this is the blue spaceship skin and the force field we will be working on today uh we'll be working on these three today and then we have the change back to default skin and finally last but not least we have the cool station okay so first let's start out by making the scatter shot button so we're gonna uh direct and drop all this code into the scatter shot sprite we just have to change up some variables and broadcasts so just drag this on here and i'm just going to separate this a little bit move this right here so be a little bit more organized and so for here instead we have to put a new x and y position so for the scatter shot i put it at negative 50 for the x and negative 30 for the y and then i set the size 100 show all the same thing up until here instead of broadcasting check cool spaceship purchase we have to make a new message called check triple triple shot purchase um and then um so we got the check triple shot purchase and then right here instead we have to uh check this check triple shot purchase and then we have to um get a new variable let's make a new variable it's called a triple shot triple triple shot purchase status so get that variable so instead of here we're going to change it to triple shot purchase status unlocked all the same and then we have to do switch to triple shot new uh uh broadcast let's name it switch switch to triple shot and stop the script all the same instead of 2 500 i'm making triple shot 5 000 coins so it'll take a quite some time to get that and instead of negative 2 2 500 we're going to be minus 5 000 of course because it's 5 000 money and then right here instead we're going to set the triple shot purchase status to unlocked and then instead of right here we're gonna broadcast switch to triple shot and then right here we're gonna have to do the triple shot purchase status the variable and then let's move to the right we have to check here right here we're going to do the swish to triple shot right here switch triple shot right here and then next we're going to get the um start game and then when flag clicked locked and then we have to change this so now we have all of that let's go to the player so and then also right here forgot about that so let's go to triple shot status so then let's go to the player now i'm uh starting with the player the laser so the laser we will be broadcasting the message so when i receive when i receive um triple shot switches triple shot we are going to switch the costume to triple shot which is the second costume with the three lasers so we're gonna switch to that so now let's try it out so i'm i already gave myself some money so let's try it out so i'm going to play it open the shop i already started out five thousand dollars um let's click on this door buy it and now you can't buy it anymore as you can see let's go exit and now you get triple shot as you can see now you can kill enemies much faster rather than using the single shot and we did not do the transition where you could uh go to the um back to the regular um single shot but um right now we just had the triple shot you cannot go back to the single shot so it's just a onetime purchase but you can add that if you guys want but next let's work on the force field so for the force field i made it that you have to click f to uh activate the force field so when key f is pressed then with um oh yeah and let's make this first because you have to click on that to make the force feel so for here same as pretty much all of these let's just um accept that except it's a little bit different just because um you can buy multiple force fields so so if i drag and drop this we're gonna um change it up a little bit so right here we're gonna change the x and y position so i made the x and y position negative 175 and negative 30. and for here it's all the same but then wait until right here instead we're gonna have to make a new variable and um we're just gonna put a wait until right here wait until um not not instead we're gonna have to do this wait until not uh mouse down so wait until it's not messed down and then we switch costume costume two and then we may make a new variable called start buying so then buy multiple of them start buying so we're going to set the start buying to yes right here since it's getting clicked on so start buying to yes so yes and then we're going to have to um make a a new broadcast message so i'm going to name it check check uh force field purchase check force field purchase and then let's get a one flight clicked let's get a one flag clicked and this is a setup so switch back to the first costume in the beginning and then we want to hide in the beginning and when i receive start game we also want to hide and switch costume to costume one like that and then we're gonna get a one i receive when i receive check force field purchase force field purchase and if uh start buying is equal to yes that means they have they're trying to buy it so if start buying is a yes um then you want to set it to no set it back to no and then you have to and then you can click it again to buy it again so start buying back to no and then if the money is equal to or less than a greater than 500 so we're gonna make it 500 coins but you guys can make it any value one so if it's uh equal to or greater than greater than 500 if the money is greater than or equal to 500 the money then we will change the money by negative 500 so they'll lose 500 money and switch costs from costume 2 switch cost more costume too so it'll become the by bot the bot um uh costume and then um we have to change we have to change the force fields we made this variable earlier i think so we're gonna have to change the force field by one um letting the player know they bought one force field uh or sportsmail up here okay change force field two by one and then we're gonna make a little weight in 0.5 seconds so they can't just keep on spamming the uh button to keep on buying it um you can keep on buying more as long as you have the money but we're just going to keep a little delay right here and then um we're going to switch costume back to costume one so we're actually going to add a little bit more code to this so this was just like oh so we're gonna in the beginning right here we're gonna set the start bind to no so it will always be no no matter what so let's say sometimes it might start as yes so we we just want to reset it back to no it will probably improve your code and then right here we want to um set the force fields to zero in the beginning so they have no force field and then finally let's work on the force field so for the force field i did the f key because f for force field and then um yeah yeah and then we'll do a if then statement and then let's get an and and then let's get in uh and um so we got greater than symbol so if and so great the force field is greater than zero so if they have more than one zero more than zero force fields which means any positive number and not force fetal equals on so force field status equals to on so we need to make a new variable force field status force field status so what this variable is for is once you have a force field activated you can't click it again so let's get an equal sign so equal force field is equal to on so force field status is equal to on then we will set the force field timer for five seconds so uh i'm gonna make a new variable called force field timer force field timer so we're gonna set the force field timer force field timer to five so this is just a countdown for five seconds i've made the force field last for five seconds but you guys can make it last pretty much any however much time you want and then we're going to broadcast a new variable called start game um start timer sorry about that start timer so that so the uh timer will start running for the force field and then after that we want to show and then go to front layer so go to the uh front and then next in a forever loop okay so let's get a forever loop um let's put it right here under here forever let's get an if else statement if the force field timer is greater than zero that means the force field timer has not run out yet force field timer is greater than zero go to player and turn 10 degrees so it'll go to the player and it will um turn so in the other video in the two player space dual game we made the force field uh spin so we're gonna make it spin here as well so i made it turn 10 degrees um else we're going to set the force field status off because the timer has run out off i'm going to set set the force field status sorry about that not not the timer status and then i'm gonna hide and stop the script because the timer has run out stop the script and then next we want to get a winner when we receive start game beyond hide in the beginning and receive start game hide and then we're going to get one fly clicked in the beginning we want to set the force field status to off so you will not get any force fields at the beginning and force will not be running so force field status should be off at the beginning all the time and then we want to hide in the beginning and then let's get a when i receive start timer that's from the when you press the f key whether it's you start timer start timer i'm gonna get set the force field status to on because you're using the force field right now set the force field status to on set it to on and then we're going to change the force fields by one because you're using a force field so you're going to minus one for the force fields so we subtract one and then we're going to repeat the force field timer times so the force wheel timer times um is five so i'll repeat five seconds repeat five times sorry repeat five times not five seconds so it'll repeat five times the force field timer and then we'll wait one second so it will and then we're gonna change the force wheel timer by negative one so it'll go down the timer will go down change the force field so basically this is uh repeating five times waiting one second and then change the force field timer by one negative one so it'll be five seconds okay so now we have all of that uh let's try it out and i forgot one last thing i almost forgot this so in the enemies we have to get an ifthen statement so when it's touching the force field it'll actually deflect the enemies from uh hitting him so let's get an ifthen statement if touching force field for the force field when they're touching the force field i'm not going to make them gain points when they kill the aliens with the force field i'm just gonna um i'll make the aliens die so let's go get a goto i'm just gonna copy paste this actually just duplicate it put it in here so yeah so now when it touches it it will actually die and then um so yeah that's pretty much it so let's try it out so i'm gonna turn on the force field i'm gonna take out this so then you can see clearly and then turn on the force field so i have zero force fields right now so click the p button open the shop so you can continually you can continuously buy force fields it'll keep on going up and up so as you can see so now you can like shield yourself for five seconds and when you restart the force fields will go back to normal i'm just going to buy some more real quick and show you guys one more time so as you can see the force field is pretty good for defending and you can shoot enemies at the same time so yeah uh it's pretty cool the force field so yeah it's pretty cool so thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share subscribe and i'll see you guys in the next video
