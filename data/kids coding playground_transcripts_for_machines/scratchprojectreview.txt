welcome back guys it's kids from playing around here and today we're back for another video in scratch and today we'll be um reviewing projects from our channel studio so we have a bunch of people in our studio and they all post content for us to review sometime so today i will be reviewing some stuff so let's get started so i was just looking at this um project and i it seemed pretty cool by pragal pro and i really like uh the snow effect there's also um some music but i'm just turn it down and i like the snow effect it's just pretty simple and you can click space to throw a snowball so it's just like some sort of like snowball fight so yay so looks pretty cool i'd rate it pretty good that deserves a favorite okay so i found another game called block dodge so here we are with another game for a project review it's called block dodge um so basically it looks like it's just a game where you just dodge blocks i guess so let's go full screen so let's hit start so i'm assuming you use the arrow keys okay so you use the arrow keys to dodge the blocks as you can see uh it's a pretty simple game but it's pretty cool um i would like like if it had more decoration or something it would be probably a bit better but like it's still pretty good still pretty good just a fun basic project so that deserves a favor so um i found this cool um project i'm um you should set up some sprites and made a project click space to start and it plays a cool tune so this is cool so i found this really really cool project by espio 200 and i this deserves a favorite i have already reviewed i saw it so uh you start and you can change your costume by using the up arrow so there's the apple the ball and the butterfly so if you click the butterfly will go there and you paint with the butterfly i really like the costumes and the color and how you can change of what you want to paint so you can paint something pretty cool here so we got the ball too kind of looks like a caterpillar and there's also a button called clear so i like everything in this project uh it's nice but if it had a backdrop it'd be cooler because a backdrop would be pretty cool but great job uh yeah so i found this also cool project in our studio also by um the same person is po200 and it is a simple platformer game and it plays cool music wall jump and this is cool i mean like just like right it's just a generic platform yeah like who doesn't want to play generic platform yeah it's just a regular platform we've got the spikes lava everything this is a really good design i like the whole entire thing i like the multicolored um avatar and just how the game functions it works like a really good platformer so the jump physics are pretty good too yeah all right let's say given some credit for that it was probably from some like tutorial but that doesn't matter yeah and and it's also um i'm pretty sure is i forgot what i was going to say but it is has a lot of levels so yeah like you put some effort this person put some effort into making levels so that deserves a favorite so yeah so i just saw this project and it's called defense uh version 1.1 so um so i guess you're just supposed to use the arrow keys and you use your um uh arrows to try to defend against the and if something like goes past the line i think then you lose i'm not sure which parts the line yeah yeah the edge the edge yeah but pretty much what one thing you would want to do is like make it so there's a delay between shooting it because it's kind of opie it's doing that but it's still pretty hot yeah yeah that's pretty much it our last one is a fidget spinner game taking this back to 2016 when this is actually a thing so fidget spinner i'm pretty in the description it says it's from this guy named guy so i guess it's from some tutorial or something check it out but still we're gonna check it out anyways so fidget spinner yeah basically it's just a clicker you just click it click the fidget spinner to get it yes yeah cookie cutter spins whatever you call it yeah basically a clicker but if you could add like some small tabs here like you can buy upgrades yeah like it'd be cooler yeah if you buy like 2016 person and then they would get like one spin tree for like every five seconds uh that'd be pretty cool and you can like fidget spinner industry whatever so yeah pretty good project from uh this person uh yeah so yeah i'm not even gonna bother pronouncing that but it's pretty good yeah please like share subscribe and comment in the comment sections below what else uh projects you want in um our channel but today was a special day we just reviewed some projects on scratch so anyway see you guys next time
