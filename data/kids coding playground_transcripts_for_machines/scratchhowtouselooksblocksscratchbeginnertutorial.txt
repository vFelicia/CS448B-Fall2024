welcome back guys to kid screenplay right here today we'll be doing another tutorial on blocks so in our last video for motion blocks someone told us to make a looks block video so here we are making a looks block video so i'm going to explain a little bit about each block and tell you guys how to use them so without further ado let's continue on to the project so first we have the say hello or anything you can put here for two seconds so this one's really selfexplanatory it's just basically when you put it you click it right it just says hello for two seconds you can change the values for the hello the saying what to say and for how long and this is just saying hello this is no time limit it's just going to say hello yeah it's not going to disappear same with this one think this is the same thing as hello except is thinking for two seconds and this is the thinking without time so it's just going to say think but you can change the values as well for those two here we have the costume so you can switch the costume to two so here inside the scratch cat as you can see there are two costumes looks like it's running so we can click this as you can see it changes the costume so you can also change it back to the first one and change costume back to the first one so basically if you want to make your games better um by making costumes you can use this block to make your game look like uh more alive so like you know you can make a character switch costume to make it look like it's walking like the scratch cat okay and then next we have the next costume block so this is like if um let's say you don't have to switch a specific costume like a running animation or something you don't have to like keep switch to the second one because there's only two costumes you can just use next costume so so for the scratch cat um if since it wouldn't be as complicated if you use this block as to the other switch costume block because all you have to do is just one cream fly clicked you can just put it forever right so now when you click as you can see it just switches it but like for this one since there is only two costumes and it's only for running you do not need to do that so next costume is just for like uh running animation stuff like that it's perfect for that stuff and then switch backdrop so let's import a backdrop so let's import this one it doesn't really matter so you switch to backdrop one right so right here if you switch the backdrop so here we have arctic right so you'll switch to the arctic backdrop this one's also selfexplanatory so i like to when you move off the screen in some game maybe you want to switch the backdrop or if you're doing an animation you want to switch the backdrop because the characters are moving to a different place this is the block for that and then next we have next backdrop this is the same thing as next costume if you don't want to like switch this specific backdrop you can use the next backdrop button so you can click as you can see it just switches to the next backdrop you don't need to use the switch one and then next we have the change size so this one is like selfexplanatory two so all you do is just click it it'll change the size of the cat as you can see and you can put negative 10 if you want to make it smaller so you can change the size so here's just to change the size so let's say you want to make something pop up make it look like it's going towards you then you can use the change size or maybe you want to shrink something you can use the change size effect as well and let's say um you want to go back costume so you know how the next costume just switches costumes but what if you want to go back one costume instead of uh instead of like making a specific costume you just want to go back one because you know that's the costume you want to be on so let's say you're on this costume right so to make it go back a costume you just go switch costume use a subtraction so you can do that and then you get the costume number uh subtract by one so it'll go like this as you can see it's going back to its original form and basically this is just the next costume one except you want to go backwards you use this one and then next we have the color effect um and the chain set size i forgot about this one this is just to set the size of the cat to a certain thing in the beginning so maybe it's at 500 size then it'll be that big and or if you set it 50 then it'll be smaller so this is just to set the size of the cat however you want or your sprite and here we have the change effect so we have the color right and change the color of the cat and then right here we have the fish eye this is just like turn it like like big in the middle like a fish eye and then right here we have the world this is just like whirl yeah as you can see so this just may add some effect into your games and projects pixelate here just pixelates it yeah like that mosaic this is just to make duplicates of it like a lot of them and then brightness this is just to change the brightness of it so it becomes more bright when you click it and then we have a ghost it just makes it ghost away and hide so uh you can just select the different ones and you can also change the effect by different values so if you want to change by negative it'll come back to normal if you're in the ghost and then maybe you want to ghost it to 100 to make it hide completely you can change the value as well you can do the same thing with everything else uh we usually don't use any of these that much the ones i use the most is the color and ghost effect um and then here we have clear graphic effects and set the color so set color what this does is you can set the thing to affect any of these effects to a certain thing so you're going to set the color effect to 100 then click it well first we have to clear the graphic effects set thing to 100 as you can see it can just set a color effect or any of these effects to a certain value so you don't have to like keep on changing it so you can set it to wherever you want here we have the clear graphic effects so you see it's blue right so you just click the clear graphic effects to make it back to normal and then we have to show and hide these are arguably the most used looks blocks so for show so hide is just to hide the character and show is to show it so in many games in almost every project i do i think i need to use the hide and show button like blocks because let's say you start the game right uh you want to hide a certain like maybe the start button you want to hide that right so you'll hide it but in the beginning you want to show it so you'll need to use the hide and show to make your game look much better so you don't want the play button showing up while you're in playing the game next you have to go to the front layer you can make it go to the back as well so go to front layer is going to be the front layer so it just goes to the front and overlaps anything else behind it and then go to back layer it's just going to the back so we'll need some layers to show how that works so let's just duplicate our scratch cap so inside our sprite one we'll just put it on top here so go to back layer as you can see it will go behind the other scratch cat and then go to front layer it will go in front of the other scratch cap and then next we have the go forward or backwards a certain amount of layers i shouldn't have deleted that uh i think i can restore it yeah so you can just restore the sprite so here is the same thing pretty much unless you want to set it to a certain amount of layers so go forward one layer it's basically just go forward one layer and then for go backwards one layer let's go backwards one layer and you can if you have even more layers you can change the value of the amount of layers so then it'll go to the certain place you want it to be the certain layer and then here we have the costume number so this is just the number for the costume as you can see costume number one is costume one costume number two is costume two so earlier when i show you guys how to go back a costume we use the costume number to check uh so you use the cost number minus one so two minus one would be one so you'll go back one costume and then here we have the backdrop number this is the same thing except for the backdrop you see we have one and two so backdrop one is right here backdrop two is here so it'd be the same thing if you want to go back a backdrop you'd switch the backdrop by the subtraction switch the backdrop to subtract backdrop number 1 so you would go back one backdrop so there you go and finally we have one last block and that's the size so the size this is the size of the cat so like basically um in some like like in like if you're gonna make a bun pop up or something you're gonna need to use the size um to make it like pop up so the size is just like the size of the cat so maybe you can do uh you can do the size plus maybe 100 so that'd be 200 size so it will increase so you see those uh size plus 200 i'll set the size to 200 right there so what you can do is just do set size put that in here click that as you can see the cat is now 200 size all right so that's all the uh looks block so that's it for the video thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share
