hello guys and welcome back to the kids cooling playground channel so today we'll be working continue working on the mangas animated story this is part two so we'll go inside here all right so uh where we left off last time was uh we created the uh the among us the cyan character you can move them around and we have some code for the red um among us costume here so he will be on the first level and then we have the backdrop there's some call in the background we play the music uh for now i am going to remove this for now so that you know we're not having too many uh sound when we're testing the code so uh and then we also have this is our main um story where we started the episode one so this uh start the broadcast of episode one then it goes the background background will change the backdrop to one then it'll start the code for the cyan sprite and also the red sprite here all right so we'll continue working on this so what we want to do i think in the first when the video when i was showing we have actually have something that shows a weapon right how they do the weapon uh what kind of move uh like one two three four five six seven or something like that that is the last one here the power ability so what we want to do is this um so this should be pretty easy since we have all the sprites already done so if you guys do not have it please load all the sprite in and for the backdrop you can just uh load them up one by one so backdrop one two three four five six and so on and until you get to the last two backdrop okay so just load them in this order okay um all right so once you load them up um so now we'll go back over here okay when the green flap is clicked uh what we're going to do is we're going to hide it so that it doesn't show up in the beginning and we're going to make it go to some position it doesn't matter i guess whatever position we have here is fine if it doesn't work then you can actually show so it kind of look like this i think this is fine if not if you want to put on here you can but i'm putting in my in here okay all right and then what i'm going to do is just like how we did the other sprite right we have one backdrop one is uh change or show this and we'll duplicate this we'll change this to backdrop four so we'll show that for the first two three stage and then we'll hide it i think after that people know how to play so we can hide the sprite so when we start this game again so we'll have the among us in the middle story here after that it shows this move here all right so what we're going to do next is we'll work on this move so we'll start with the club okay so select your club uh what we're going to do is always start with a screenflex click so what we're going to do we'll hide in the beginning okay so hide that and then what we're going to do is we're going to use this forever loop here and then here we say go to so always go to cyan and then we want to point in the direction of cyan so that way you know if the sign is pointing to the left the club will come here if the sign pointed to the right the club will come on the right side okay so you go to sensing block here take that select the back one first then select the um direction okay all right so now the club will always follow the cyan character um what we need to do next is um we're gonna assign it to uh number one since this is number one right for the club and then we are going to have a condition here so what we want to do is we don't want the the user to be able to hit the club or use any of the ability when you know something is talking or at certain stage you know we don't want to do that so what we're going to do is we're going to use this event else here what i'm going to do is i'll put this over here i'll put this over here well hopefully you guys can see both uh and then you take this you take something called not put that here then you take the equal here you say variable dialog in progress say yes so basically you're saying oh you can say no so basically saying if it's the dialogue it's not yes so any other thing other than yes if it's not yes then you can do this so you can say okay here you say go to front layer so it will come in front of the sprite ears always somewhere like this over here okay and then say show and then we'll broadcast the event and then new message say club so we'll use the club and then we'll say wait one second and then we will high okay so what we want to do is we're going to test this out so let me look at the cyan so we have to set to know right in the beginning okay let's just try it for now so when we push one you can see the club comes out so if it is on the left side will come out and left if it's on the right come on the right okay so the club is still not hitting him we'll fix that okay let me change this to like faster in that four seconds one because we want to test this right so we want to go fast okay all right so we'll go to our among us the red sprite here so what we want to do is we'll probably do the all the backdrop change and position we'll do on top or on the bottom we'll do the uh you know the the animation you know like if we get hit what happened so what we can do is this drag this over here so so whenever we see club okay so we have to have a wait until and then you say touching so we'll select club here should be alphabet order oh it's not because i have capital okay capital no case is different so yeah anyway okay so you say touching club now what we're going to do is we're going to do a repeat loop here uh you can do how many time you want we're just going to do a swirl effect of 25 25 times and then there's some effect here let's see what's the swirl so here effect by 25 and then play the recording sound so this sound my kid made you know like like that so just uh sound then we kind of change it to a robot always you can make your own okay or you can use that doesn't matter and we call this sound so after that i wanna broadcast a message so what you want to do is you can broadcast a message so when you finish the stage there it will open the door and go on the next stage and all so simple as a message new message and you're gonna say you know mission complete so basically they took one of the crew member out they get this message mission complete okay so what we need to do is we're going to go to the door so i think the first stage we have a door so let's go to the door so we're going to come back to this mission complete um later so we're going to put that in the portal so actually okay let me just go to the portal let's finish that part first so maybe it will be better okay so we'll go to the portal first so this is basically the portal like the door you can go in um so you go to here grab the start so when green flag is clicked you're gonna set some variable here so what we want to do is um one allow open doors you know so when the green pack is start they don't want to allow the open door so you want to go through the whole scenario when it's finished before we allow them to open door or portal or whatever right so we'll set that and then what we can do is um say go to back layer for now and then high and then we are going to call this forever loop here and we are going to say next costume so basically what happened here is this portal has like different costume so we kind of like so you see it's kind of turn and turn it keep on turning so i have this let's say i i want to show the portal as if i click on this right so you see it's high but if i show it you can see it's turning right the portal is turning turning turning so that's what it's doing here okay all right okay next so the mission complete so what we want to do is this i'm going to say when i receive kind of zoom out a little bit because there's a little more code here mission complete that's when you take out the crew what you're going to do is you are going to let's just grab it here you're going to allow them to open the door say yes and uh for the first stage with it we didn't have the portal so we don't want to show the port on the first stage but so we have the door we don't want to show the portal we have the portal we don't want to show the door so what you can do is this i'll get this if condition here okay i'm gonna get some oil joint so how old join works is if you are let's say some condition here in some condition here if either of the conditions true then this will run okay that's what it means okay so either this is okay or this is okay so what we're going to do and grab another oil joint here so there's three okay three blocks so what we're going to do we want to check the backdrop number here using this and we're going to have to use some operator here say equal so backdrop number equal to one so which is the first one first costume of our portal here this backdrop number one so we don't want to show the portal at this stage we want to show the door right so what we're going to do is this go back to our portal backdrop number one backdrop number seven so this is depending on which one you want to show so for me i'm doing one seven and eight so we will not have the portal at one seven and eight so we're gonna put it in here and put this over here oops okay i'm gonna zoom out a little bit more so what we want to say is not so it is not one seven and eight then we are going to show this uh portal otherwise we want to show it when the mission is complete okay so what we're going to do is we're going to create a door for this one so go back to the door sprite when green flag is clicked we'll say hi and same thing here when we switch to backdrop one what we want to do is i'm gonna switch the costume to close so basically you can't switch it to this closed door costume here on backdrop one then we say go to the back layer so that would uncut or behind the sprite and then we'll do show okay so now let's save it let's run it again so you can see the doors appear in the back okay okay so we have to destroy the crew going to the door right so what we're going to do next okay so now let's go back to a cyan here so on the cyan what we're going to do is we're going to call the up key over here so an up arrow is pressed let's move it over here a little bit you can see it better so what we want to do is check if the uh if they if it's allowed to open the door okay so we say if and we're going to use the end condition here so any condition meaning you have to have both condition to be true in order to perform this action okay so let's say 1 is equal to 1 and 2 is equal to 2 and over equal to true then you do something i mean that might not be a good example but anyway if let's say one variable is equal to something and another variable is equal to something and if both true then you do something in here in the middle okay all right so we're going to check the first variable so you say oops okay you go here you say allow open door to open door it goes to yes so let's allow the open doors equal to yes and it is touching doors so basically only if you allow the open door and this the sprite is actually touching the door and the up key is pressed then we're allowed to open the door right okay so what you can do is this so use the broadcast and wait broadcast a message open door okay and then you will wait for one second and then we are going to hide it and we are going to say broadcast away again and say closed door okay so basically we are going to open the door wait for one second we're going to hide the cyan sprite and then we'll broadcast the closed door okay so what we're going to do is we're going to go back to the door here okay and then we're going to say when i receive open door so wait for one second and then we want to switch to costume to open so same thing for the closed door so this is opposite so we wait for one second and then we'll close it okay and you can put another one seven here wave you like okay okay now let's go back to the cyan here we'll finish up this up arrow for the portal as well okay all right so depending on different stage we you know we broadcast like okay the episode in and it goes to the next stage so for me i'm doing number eight uh backtrack number eight is when the episode two end so it depends for you different different sprite i mean different story you might have differently so for us we're doing that so you can just follow along so here we're gonna take this if condition put here and we are going to take this operator and same thing we're going to check the vector so the background number is equal to eight now broadcast event new message so this is episode 2 end and then we want to also broadcast a new message actually again here after this this is called next stage so this is how we can move from one stage to the next stage okay and use next stage and wait so that they'll do something and change the scene they'll come back okay okay so we need another if condition here here we will work on the portal so here we say if touching portal hmm what's my portal right here okay if touching portal will say wait for one second and then we'll hide the sprite as well okay and then we'll broadcast the message and wait same thing here select next stage okay and then here we want to set the variable again saying allow the open door say no so basically after you open the door you go the next stage we don't want them to allow the open door again okay maybe a certain stage we can set this variable again so the user can open the door right now let's go back to the door here i know that we're going back and forth just pay attention because it's kind of a little bit difficult if you don't pay attention so it's kind of back and forth with the code here so here we want to say if i receive a next stage i want to hide it because when you move from one stage to the next stage you want to hide the door also we're going to duplicate this here we'll select backdrop seven so i'm on backdrop seven i'm using door again so i'll show so i have the door and then close and then back layer sam is here and then backdrop a i also have a door so for my costume so same thing here okay and then we'll add one more when the star i mean it might be needed might not be needed um on this one no i'll show you this so just take this in um just in case because sometime when you switch from one one of them to another so you might show the door so they want to show the door at these stalls when they actually kick the um the the other grey uh sprite out of the airship you know when it's spinning around that's the store background we want to hide the door as well okay so this is the door code looks like so far so you miss anything please kind of get that down okay so we have the um here right we have the um next stage where we're gonna call this up here we'll worry about this one later so the door you guys got it right the door is over here regarding open door and closed door and uh we'll work on this one the next stage so next day you're gonna go back to the backdrop here when we say receive next stage so what we want to do is so we're gonna have an if statement here so in the first four stage we actually don't have any dialogue so what i'm just going to do is gonna check the backdrop you know if it's got greater than four will put the dialog in progress so that you cannot attack okay all right so what we're going to do go back to the backdrop here and we are going to use operator greater than so if the backdrop number is greater than four meaning you know you have five six seven that's greater than four so this is one two three four so after this stage the computer um you know you get the next stage so it's greater than four what we're gonna do is we're gonna default to set the variable dialog in progress to yes just in case so that we don't want the user who controlling the cyan to create um do any ability so we want to stop that then what we want to do also we want to say next backdrop so what happens is in the beginning we'll run the first backdrop then after you complete this you go into stage or run the second black drop so let's just test out the club so we did this mission is complete we push the up key so you can go in and then close the door and what happened is change to the next spectra but we have to make sure we clear the sprite here and then change a different color and all that right so let's go on and work on that okay so we have to go back to the red among us here so what we're going to do here is um the event that we have right next stage so take that say next stage here what we want to do is one clear the graphics effect and then we want to switch to the next costume okay so what we're going to do is we'll call the next costume and then we're going to set the custom variable for this among a sprite so that we can switch you know between the dead and not that if they actually get smashed by the whole can later so what we're going to do is take this go back to here get the custom name okay so let's select the name okay and then we say hi for now okay so this is for the next stage and then we're gonna call for backdrop number two so you can put them in a different position for me i just added like negative fifty so basically you know move one station next you can put the spring this side this side however you want in this one i have 90. okay clear graphic effect and show and let's just try it out okay so you can see the uh among us we're trying to go into the door you see it doesn't allow you okay so we'll destroy this guy first then we will go into the door so as you can see after we go to the door you see there's a different sprite this is the next costume of the red one so we start with the red now we have the pink and then also our variable right let's see current among us is pink so you can see this is pink so we smash them with the hand you can switch it to pink dead or something so that's why we need to keep track of what colors the among us spray is okay so as you can see we have coated the club where we destroy the among us costume i mean the sprite and then it goes to the next stage and you can see that the backdrop it came to the next stage right so this is what it is so far so let me just go over um show you guys the code again so if you miss anything just kind of pause it and then kind of copy down the code so let's just take a look at this okay so this is the code for the cyan sprite and this is the code for the among us red sprite we start with red and this is the code for the door this is the code for the backdrop so far you know we're gonna have more code here and then we have a code here for this one where we're switching the backdrop is showing this this box here the ability and we have some code here for the starting the animation episode one okay so this is what we have so far so for this you can actually go from the first stage to the second stage so if you guys like you can try to do some yourself by going moving from the second stage to third stage if not we'll continue working on this you can follow us along so uh right now we're gonna stop here for now and we'll create the next video and teach the other part all right thanks guys please like share subscribe to our channel and ring the notification bell and we'll be up really appreciative you can give us a thumbs up on the video thanks bye you
