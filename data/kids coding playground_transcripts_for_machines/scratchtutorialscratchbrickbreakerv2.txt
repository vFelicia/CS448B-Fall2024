hello and welcome back to kids coming playground today we'll be doing another project in scratch so this is going to be our brick breaker version 2 on scratch so about two years ago we made a brick breaker version one so this is our version two it's much more advanced the game looks much better there's a lot more effects going on so without further ado let's run the project brick breaker version two so start it so as you can see when you hit the ball there's like a trail behind the ball and when you lose there's also a cool losing effect that says game over and then next you have uh when you play it i'm trying to win this time so you can see when you when you start the game all the bricks it looks really cool when they come in and as you can see every time you hit the ball the paddle also changes color effect and when you take out the bricks it also looks better so i'll show you guys what happens when you win so here we're about to repeat the level so let's finish this up okay we got three right there let's get this last one as you can see when it says you win has a cool winning effect so this is our brick breaker version two without further ado let's get started onto the coding all right so let's start a new project so here we have our new project let's rename the project we're gonna name it brick breaker v2 so for version two this is gonna be our second version of our brick breaker so right here we have the scratch cap we're gonna delete we don't need the scratch cam and then we're going to get our paddle so this is going to be our paddle for the game so here we have our paddle this is the one where you used to hit the ball and then next we have the tennis ball there is the tennis ball inside the scratch library i think everything is from the scratch library here and then here with the tennis ball and then next we have the game over you win brick and then we have the trail which is another tennis ball so we just got to get another tennis ball or he just it let's duplicate the tennis ball rename it to trail trail so here we have tennis ball two bringing the trail and then we're gonna get the button so this is the button this is basically the bricks and then finally we have the u n and you lose so i already have the you win right here but basically here we have our blocked letters it makes the game look much better so here we're going to center our you in so we're just going to duplicate this and then we're going to delete you game over we're going to say game over and then we're going to move this we're going to have to rename that this one and then next we're gonna make our game over one so since this is already in bitmap we have to get our other text one so we're gonna have to rename this one so we're gonna say game over game over and then we're gonna move this over zoom out i'm gonna rename this to game over and then we're gonna move this towards the center so about like right here i'm gonna move this to the center as well all right so here we have our game over we're going to group it so here we have our game over and then our you win we can show that as well so maybe we can increase the size of our game over by just a little bit yeah this should be a good size okay so here we have our you in game over we have all our sprites right here so now start coding in the paddle so we can hide this and this for now let's go into paddle so let's start coding so first in the paddle we're going to get our wind green fly clicked when we flag's clicked we're going to set the rotation style to don't rotate so we won't let the paddle rotate so like i said it don't rotate and then we're going to set it to x negative 130 and then y i mean x 130 sorry x 130 and then y negative 140. so we set it here should be somewhere down there because the ball is gonna we're gonna make the ball bounce towards this way um then next we're gonna get forever forever set the x to the mouse x so we're gonna make it follow the mouse set x to mouse x and then next there we have our paddle code so as you can see you can move the mouse uh it will move with your mouse on the x so here we have the paddle now let's go into our tennis ball so inside our tennis ball we're going to get a wink fly clicked when group likes clicked we're going to go to zero zero it's gonna make it go to the center and then we're gonna point direction of 135 so we're gonna point in direction of 135 so we're going to make it point towards the bottom right so that's why we move the paddle right here so it's going to bounce here first and then we're going to wait one second before we start to give the player a little the time to get ready and then we're gonna get a forever loop after this so forever uh we're gonna move ten steps this is the bouncing for the ball so we're gonna move ten steps and then we're gonna if on edge we're going to bounce and then we're going to get if that's even so if if it's touching the paddle so if the ball is touching the paddle if touching the paddle then we're going to start the sound pop and we're gonna broadcast a message we're gonna name the message bounce so we're gonna start a new message bounce all right so now we have bounce we're gonna receive the message bouncer here so when i receive bounce inside the tennis ball we're going to point in direction so basically it's going to make it bounce in the opposite direction after touching the paddle so we're going to point directions so it basically randomizes the bounce so it makes the game a little bit more interesting we're going to point direction point in direction and then we're going to do 180 minus so we're going to take the minus 180 minus the direction of the ball so put that in here and then we're going to repeat until we've got to repeat until we're going to repeat until not touching paddle so basically if it's not touching paddle we'll make it move 10 steps so repeat until not touching paddle move 10 steps motion all right and then next we're going to get a one three fly clicks for the ball here if i clicked go to front layer so to keep it at the front and then forever we're going to wait 0.1 seconds and then we're going to create clone of the trip so basically we're going to make the trail for the ball so we're going to need this later so we're going to create a clone of trail and then next this is going to be the game over so basically when the game is about to be over you'll do this the game is over whenever if i clicked we're going to do forever um if if the y position is less than negative 160 so i'm assuming negative 160 is somewhere around here basically the ball goes below the paddle so y position it's less than negative 160 then we're going to broadcast game over so we're going to need this later as well so broadcast so it came over now let's go back to our paddle so i'm going to zoom out to show you guys all the code all right now let's go into the paddle now in the paddle we're going to work on how to make the paddle change color when it's touching the ball so we're going to do is when i receive bounce we're going to get an ifthen statement if so we're going to find the we're going to use the distance block so if it's less than 60 so basically we're going to find the distance between the ball and the paddle so here we're going to get the distance to tennis ball so basically the distance is square root of x2 minus x1 plus this uh square root of y2 minus y1 so basically this is just the distance between the ball and the pedal so this is the formula on how to do it you can also replace it with another big chunk of code but we're just going to do this because it's much more simpler so next we're going to do a repeat 10 times and we're going to change color effect by 25 so now let's play it so as you can see the panel changes color now but every time the ball touches it all right so that's exactly what we want now let's go into our bricks so inside our bricks we're just going to rename the button to brick bricks so what we're going to do is inside the bricks we're going to when we fly clicked zoom in we're going to click we're going to make it variable we're going to name it score for all sprites and then we're going to set score to zero in the beginning and then we're going to set the size to 50 so it's half the size 50 and then we're going to go to negative 200 uh and then for y maybe 200 and for why we're doing 140 and then next so we basically make 28 clones of this we're gonna make 28 bricks repeat four times repeat four times and then repeat seven times so there's gonna be 28 colons repeat and then we're going to create a clone of myself create a clone of myself and then we're going to change the x by 65. so basically we're going to evenly space the bricks uh a little bit so we're going to move them by 65 each change x by 65. so we're gonna have four by seven of these bricks and then next right here we're going to do the repeat four times just give me the four rows so we're going to do go to set the x to negative 200 and then we're going to change the y by negative 30 so it's evenly spaced out as well and then next we're going to hide so we're going to hide the brick because we have all the clones out so we're going to hide the brick and then when i start as a clone we're going to get a when i start as a clone we're going to change y by negative 10. so basically in the beginning as you can see in the beginning when i showed you guys a project had a little like drift effect in the beginning this is what we're going to do we're going to change the y by negative 10 in the beginning and your 10 and then we're going to set the ghost effect to 100 set ghost effect to 100 and then we're going to show and then next we're going to repeat 10 times repeat 10 times we're going to change the y by 1 so it's going to go up a little bit so it's like a little drift effect and change the y back by one so it's going to move back to its original spot and then we're going to change the ghost effect by negative 10 so it'll slowly fade in change ghost effect by negative 10 and then next we're going to wait 0.01 seconds and just keep a little bit weight so next and we're going to get it forever forever if touching if touching the tennis ball so if the bricks are touching the tennis ball then we're going to get a start sound blazer too i have a sound right here it's in the sprite library so laser laser 2 sounds like that so we're going to use laser 2. so with laser 2 we're going to start sound laser 2. so after we start the sun laser 2 we're going to broadcast bounce and then next we're going to change the score by one so every time you destroy a brick you get one score and then we're going to repeat 10 times repeat 10 times inside here we're going to get a change color effect by 25 so basically once you hit the brick this is what's going to happen so we're going to change the color effect by 25 we're going to change the ghost effect by five boost by five and then next we're going to change the size by negative four so basically just makes it look cooler when you hit the brick change the size by negative four negative four and then we're gonna change the y by four and then we're gonna make it spin change the y by 4 and then we'll make it spin by turning 15 degrees and then we're going to delete the clone after you've destroyed the brick so here we have all the code i'm going to zoom out so here we have the top part and the bottom part so this should be all the code for the bricks so let's play so as you can see it generates the bricks it makes it look much better when you generate the bricks like that let's show you one more time as you can see when you hit the bricks with the ball it makes that cool effect so yeah this is exactly how we want it so far now let's go into our trail so remember when in the beginning we brought like tried to make close in the trim right here so right now we're going to work on the trail so whenever we fly clicked we are going to hide with the trail and groove so i clicked hide and then we're gonna when i start as a clone when i start as a clone we're going to show and then we're going to go to tennis ball to tennis ball and then repeat 15 times so this is how you make the trail repeat 15 times change the size by negative four so we're going to make it a little bit smaller than what the tennis ball actually is change the size by negative four and then we're gonna set change the ghost effect by five so it's a little bit transparent so repeat 15 times change the ghost effect by and then delete this clone so that's it for the trail show you guys how it looks like as you can see it looks pretty cool makes your game look much better and fades away okay so this is exactly how we want it now we can work on the you win and you lose so back let's go into our you win so inside are you in we're going to make like a cool effect when you win so when you're if i clicked we're going to zoom in move your flag is clicked we're going to go to zero zero gonna make the wind go to zero zero and then next we're gonna hide and then next we're going to set the ghost effect to 100 set ghost effect 200 and then set size to 100 and then we're going to set the score to zero in the beginning and then we're going to wait until we used to wait until it's right away until the score is equal to 28 because there's 28 blocks wait until score is equal to 28 and then once the score is equal to 28 we're gonna get a sound of those sounds in here but let's see uh percussion see i think i had gong before so this one i guess we'll use this one sounds pretty good so we're gonna use starts on gong and then we're going to broadcast uh stop game new message stop game actually we'll name it you win win that sounds better so you win and then we're gonna show and then we're going to repeat 10 times so this is the effect to make the uin look a lot better repeat 10 times we're going to change the ghost effect by negative 10. so it's going to fade in slowly change ghost effect by ghost effect by negative 10 and then we're gonna change the size by three so it's going to get bigger and then we're gonna get change y by four so it's going to go up to the top and then we're gonna wait 0.01 seconds so basically 0.1 seconds because it repeats 10 times and then next we're going to wait a 0.2 seconds before continuing to the next part of it so wait 0.2 seconds and then this one it makes it flash a little bit so we're going to repeat two times repeat twice now we're going to get a set brightness effect to 50 set brightness 250 and then wait 0.1 seconds and then we can duplicate this put that in here uh we'll repeat like twice so four times right here and we're gonna wait four seconds before stopping the game stop all so this should be it for our you win so i'm gonna zoom out show you guys the top and then to the bottom so this is our you in okay so let's go back to the paddle so right here when i receive you win when i receive you in we're going to stop other scripts in the sprite there you go okay and then one last thing let's go to you lose or game over my reading in this right to game over game over we're going to when i receive game over actually no let's do this part first we need to do the setup first if i clicked we're going to go to zero zero go to zero zero hide and then we're gonna set the ghost effect to 100 ghost to 100 ghost effect 100 and then we're going to set the size to 100 percent and then we're going to point direction of negative 60. so we're basically going to make it spin so that's why we're going to make it to negative 60 in the beginning so pointing to the top left uh and then next we're going to do when i receive game over then we're going to start the sound gong again i guess let's get the gong gong start sound gong and then next i'm going to broadcast stop game for broadcast game over you lose so you lose and then next we're going to show show and then we're going to do the little spin effect so we're going to repeat 10 times then turn 15 degrees and then we're going to change the ghost effect by negative 10 change ghost effect ghost by negative 10 so slowly fade in as well and then we're going to change the size by 12. so we're going to get bigger change size not the size sorry i'm going to change the size by 12 and then next we're going to do a weight 0.01 seconds and then finally we're gonna wait four seconds at the end and then stop all right then finally let's go to your paddle when i receive you lose stop other scripts in the sprite we can also drag and drop this into our blocks one last thing let's add a backdrop so i had the galaxy backdrop last time so we're gonna do that galaxy delete this one all right so let's also drag and drop these into the tennis ball so we're going to drag drop tennis ball and then i think that should be it we have the backdrop we have everything let's run our project show you guys what happens when you win so as you can see that is our ending you win all right that's that's how it looks like when you win and for you lose i think we should decrease the size of this a little bit just a little bit maybe like that much was it in largest i just i remembered that it makes it bigger and you win so we'll see how it looks like when you lose as you can see game over it's still a little too big so we can change the code a little bit maybe instead of changing five we'll see yeah that's better so here we have our game over and our winning so that's it for today's project so here is our brick breaker version two on scratch if you enjoyed watching this tutorial don't forget to like share and subscribe and i'll see you guys in the next video thank you guys all for watching
