hello guys welcome back to kidscoolingplayground so today i was looking at the kidscooling playground studio and i saw this game as a clicker game uh done by this person here and i was thinking about making a script uh to do the auto click for me and uh i thought of doing that so i thought that was pretty cool i'll see if i can do that so i was looking at that earlier and i found that using python is actually really easy to do this so i can show you guys how to do that you probably can do it with javascript as well but since our channel we have some python tutorial done making it the uh you know the python tutorial for it so if you look over here let me go inside the game i'll show you how it looks like so the game looks like this uh so when you run it and then every time you click you get one point right and then after you click after some time you can buy something here to make it more click so one click you get like double the click and ten times the click 100 click so every time you click you get more points right so uh you don't want to click on this all day right so how can we do a script or something like that that will help us click this and you can get more points so i thought of um trying that so in order to do that you can uh you can go to uh python.org here dot download from here you can go to download and then download the latest version of python okay for your window or your mac or whatever okay after you download this you can install it okay so when you launch the launcher right for installation it'll come up like this make sure you add this one select this one say add python to the path basically if you once you've done that it will add it and then you can run python anywhere okay so i'm not going to install it because i already have it installed so i can cancel this okay and then you can go to like a window open up your uh command uh you know command prompt so just say run cmd you type cmd will come up with something like this just click on that you get this black screen and then you can go to your directory so you can like change directory right so cd path the directory so now you're on this directory i'm already on here but i'm just showing you so you can type change directory to go here and then what you can do is uh you can type it if you make sure your python works you can type python dash dash version so as you can see i have an older version of python 3.7.3 okay so once you've done that what you have to do next is you have to type in this command pip three install okay let me move my mouse so you guys can see and you can say py auto gui so this will actually help you to uh help help you to control the uh the gui basically the graphics user interface using python so you type this command and you type install it will take like maybe like a minute or two to install the package for python so i'm not going to do that because i already have it so if you have not if you do it for the first time you do it okay so after that you go to your folder wherever you want and then you can just create a new file a text file and you can say let's say auto clicker and then you can change the extension to dot p y okay so you say yes so you see my icons a little bit different because i have a pycharm installed don't worry about that you know might look like some file right doesn't matter so we're not gonna use pycharm anyway so right click you can say open with let's say i'm gonna open with notepad so as you can see i open it with notepad i think for for mac you use text editor or something but window you can just use notepad or you can use any of your favorite editor likes sublime or whatever doesn't there okay so once you have this open uh you can say import okay pi auto gui okay so this will import the uh this package that we just installed and then you can say print okay and then you say py auto query that size so if you have multiple window it will actually um you know show the size of the main window so um if you have multiple window you have to just imagine that there's a whole thing so the um it will actually see the whole thing as one one window so you might have to move it further okay it depends on the size so let's say we go back to our game okay and then now we have this this file here right so let's say this is the size and we want to move the mouse so you would say right py auto grid dot move and then capital t o and then let's say you want to move to um 1 300 okay comma let's say 300 y so this is x and y okay comma and then say duration equal to one so it will be basically one second so for me i have two screens so i have to do 1 300 so if you're a smaller screen you know you have one screen maybe 450 or something doesn't matter just try it okay you save it so to run it you go back here right to where we have the file same location you can just type python and then say auto clicker dot py so you if i run this you can see the mouse move right you see my mouse just move out the window so that's how the mouse moves right so um because 1 300 is still on the other side of the screen let's say i say 1 800. so you can see i'll save it again so if i run this again you'll see that the mouse move see so you can see how the mouse moves right so we're trying to move it to the heart right so um for this one i already actually have the coordinate down because i already did it earlier to test the location so i can just move it i'll show you so for here i'm going to move it to um 2100 and then 425 so for you may be different okay for you if you have a single screen maybe 450 or 400 just try it so now i have this on right so i'll save it ctrl s i'm gonna run that again you can see it moved to the heart shape so this is the exact position that i want to right go so now i found the position that i want so what you have to do is there's a couple way to do the click you can say uh py auto grid dot click and you can look up the uh you know the information on online okay that's different way but um for the code you have to actually look into the code of this project so this project you use something called mouse down so it's not a mouse click so that's different event so if you look at event here right that's like this sprite is clicked if you use this sprite it's clicked then that is actually a a click so you will say uh p y auto grid dot click that's the in python but since this is a mouse down so you cannot use mouse down i mean you cannot use click you have to use mouse down and then they also have something like wait until not mouse down so that means you have to make sure that you have to push the mouse back up so what we have to do is let's go back to this project again so let's go back to our code so here what we have to do is let's let's just go for 10 okay 10 times so 4 x in range and then we'll do 10. so make sure you put a colon i'll just take up the space so make sure you put a colon at the end and then tap okay say print x so uh in python it will go from zero and then one two three right so it will be zero to nine so you can add semicolon or no semicolon doesn't matter okay uh you can say auto good dot mouse down okay like this and then what to say pie auto put that mouse up okay this is basically moving the mouse down then moving the mouse up back up so now i'm going to save it ctrl s to save it so now what i'm going to do is i'm going to run this game again okay so you can see zero so i'm gonna have here uh what i'm going to do is going to run it just click on the up key in your arrow key up here will automatically run the last command so when i run this again you can see it goes over there and then start clicking it you see that it click 10 times you see that so you can see also that this thing is also showing because i print the uh the x right x value which is the loop because in here i say print right print x right so you don't want to see this you can take this out and it won't show so now let's say if i want to run it for 100 times right just change this to 100 and then i'm going to run it again here right maybe i'll move this over here i guess you can see because i'm in full screen so anyway but you can see the clicker so so you can see it's called clicking so as you can see it keeps on clicking 100 times so just don't move your mouse if you move your mouse and they will try to click somewhere else so you see that they keep on clicking to 100 so it will be 110 because we clicked the first time 110 right so uh you see i don't have to do any work so the program is running for me so it will click until 110 or stuff so you see it's stopped so we go back over here in this uh application you can see everything until 99 right so you see from zero to 99 so now once you have 110 you can go into the shop you can buy this value i guess so now every time you click you get two points so you can go back and let's say we change it back to 10 right so now every time we rerun it we'll get more points so let's run it again so we'll go over here and then i'll click so you see two points each time now okay so from 10 to 30 because we'll get two points so as you can get more money you can buy the power up which gives you 10 per click 100 per click something like that it's really cool uh thanks to uh this person who made the uh the game for the clicker so uh i was just experimenting with python today with this clicker so i hope you guys like the video and um yeah give us a thumbs up if you enjoy the video thank you very much and see you guys next time be sure to subscribe and share
