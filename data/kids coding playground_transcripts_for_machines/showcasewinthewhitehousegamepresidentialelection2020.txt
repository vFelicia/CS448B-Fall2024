so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding playground so this will not be a coding video so this is actually a video of me playing win the white house so recently um in america um there was a voting like a couple days ago there's election day so in america what they have is like election day where you vote for a president so um the the two candidates were trump and biden and um by recently this afternoon biden just won so this reminds me of this game called win the white house i used to play so as you can see this is um the results right now so biden has already won so like the game you need 270 to win so yeah this is the election right now now let's hop into the game um so the links in the description if you actually want to play it so let's start the game so i'm gonna click new game so um i'm just gonna finish this okay so i have to make my character right now i used to play this game a long time ago we'll see what character should i get maybe pick this one okay i'm gonna name myself joe biden because joe biden won uh so i'm gonna choose let's see new york i guess that's the home state i don't know uh issues i'm just gonna pick democratic because uh joe biden was democratic so let's see retirement security i'm just going to pick some random ones education prevent gun violence address climate change let's do a adjustable climate change we need to win the party's primary elections these are hot issues for the democratic so i'm going to present this one i stand for stronger politics explain yourself pollution uh the government should know yeah this one okay and how um i think this one that makes no sense at all i haven't played this game in a long time so i'm not as good as i used to be retirement security i'm here so um this one i'll pick this one okay so now let's pick another issue so this is um so basically the point of the game is just to like answer questions present ideas and stuff like that um so i'm actually gonna like um skip this area i'm gonna finish this and move on and you'll and i'm gonna move on to the winning the white house part so i'm done answering all the questions and i picked all my issues so i'm just gonna i just picked a random one okay a random slogan or whatever so let's just finish this so i just finished the profile and now uh yes i know how to do this so you're just gonna launch the campaign so this is the convention so um now i'm just gonna pick uh i'm just gonna select this one whatever my bike um and after this we're gonna have to go to the white house the voting area my butt so this is the republican party and i picked the democratic party so this is the other convention okay so this is week one so what you're supposed to do is first get funding you're first supposed to get funding fundraiser so then for fundraiser you're supposed to pick the one with like high value or something like texas or something so you when you use fundraising you get these points right here and then you use the points to do these different things so the more points you have the more actions you can do so now i have three points that means i can do all of these so now the opponent will be trying to get funding as well so let's try doing media okay let's just pick a state like pennsylvania okay so now you have to answer questions so supported issues i'm gonna pick this one run the campaign and then you're supposed to answer questions um so i'm gonna pick this one because i think that's the right one as you can see you get it right so you're supposed to pick the right um answer and then it's a sad day for the rep so now i have control over here so now as you can see everything you use breaking news so now um let's try to appearance i guess so select uh new york um so you're supposed to select another one let's like usually supposed to select uh supporting issues so i'm gonna select this one because i also have this one so i'm gonna do this so federal funding for education so you want to do more educational stuff so let's find that so i'm pretty sure it's this one so let's give the speech as you can see i got it correct so the democrats are doing really well as you can see so the more you do it the more um like you can you're just trying to like control different states and stuff like that today's efforts on the campaign trail um what else so now we're polling so just to select a state that you have not pulled yet as you can see most of them in georgia are popular to democratic so that's the opponent's turn okay so we are losing right now as you can see they have more points than us okay so now we're winning because if your popularity is so the to win the white house you have to get 270 electoral votes like in real life so you always have to use fundraising first to get these points is fundraising california you need to be in the league um i have to fundraise here i guess you have to have like a state that's supporting you i guess in order to get the points you have to have a state that's supporting you to get more points so let's do a media on here so then we can take california back so there's a supporting issues or these um i have none of these so i'm just gonna do oh yeah i have one of them yeah let's do global cooperation so america is stronger than this one cooperate cooperation gets more back so as you can see televising the ad the democrats are doing really well at their latest the republic so now you guys have an idea of how the game works i'm gonna skip to the end and then um i'll show you at the end who will win so see you guys later so there's still four more weeks left and it looks like i already won but you still have to wait until the weeks are over so i already have more than 270 electoral votes so see you guys at the end when i i'm about to win or lose so as you can see now it's one week left so this is gonna be the last week so i'm gonna try to win now um i'll be recording the rest of this so let's go to new york so let's get the three coins and we can do more actions um let's see let's make a poll so uh so these numbers right here actually mean the number of electoral votes you'll win so i'm gonna go for the highest one which is arizona so yeah it's a blue state that means i get more points so is the opponent's right now it looks like they're jumping arizona so i'm gonna make an appearance and let's see let's make an appearance in massachusetts um retirement security this one so you have to answer correctly in order to actually get some value it's a sad day for the republic um today's efforts only so we have one more point let's just use media let's use it on let's see let's use that new jersey supported issues actually no i don't think i should use it on this one i don't have any good ones for um let's go for let's see washington voting um so for voting rights right yep is this one the democrats are serious opponents okay and this is the last day election day finally so as you can see i have at 303 points 163. wow wow i have so much points okay i think i'm definitely gonna win i can tell so oh wow new york's completely democratic right now and then uh congratulations you beat your
