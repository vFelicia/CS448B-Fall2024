so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding playground so today we'll be doing a scrolling platformer after a while of hard work we finally pulled off the scrolling platformer ready for you guys to learn we got some of these ideas from griff patch you guys probably know him from scratch he made some very famous games and he's also a scratch youtuber please subscribe to his channel if you haven't already in the link in the description and today we'll be learning these following concepts we'll be learning custom blocks the scrolling physics for the scrolling platformer clones friction like when you move forward it'll have like friction on the player and collision with platforms and traps some of these we will not be doing today because we today will just be setting up variables and sprites next we would like to give some shout outs to some people so sergey hakkoben uh gave us some sprites from this uh this uh website right here we used the sprites to for this project we used the game maker studio 2 to uh cut out the sprites and we used some of the sprites for our platformer right here and then 11 plus preparations suggested us to do a scrolling platformer so here we are making the scrolling platformer so now i will demo the game for you guys so we have some music so there's y scrolling and x scrolling you collect the fruits you avoid all the spikes and if you hit the spikes it'll blink and you go back to the beginning and all those fruits are there again and in order to go to the next level you must use you must collect all the fruits and once you hit the portal you go inside the portal and there's a timer right here and you can just wall jump you can also walk up you can you can walk up this tells you what level you're on i'll try to complete this as fast as i can so i can show you what happens this part's the hardest part so when you win it'll stop the timer and it'll say you win i'll still let you walk around give you like some freedom to walk around but that's it we have that's all we have so now let's start a new project we will start on the game we only have three levels for our game but that's not all you guys can make your own levels after learning how to make it from us we only did three levels because uh we don't want to make the videos way too long so next let's get on to the code so first we have to make some variables you can delete the my variable before i can continue i would like to tell you guys to like share and subscribe and now let's make some variables so in grif patch's video he capitalized all the work all the variables that um were global not like just for the sprite only so for all sprites he would like capitalize the name of the variable so i'm gonna do that to cause less confusion so we're going to make some variables we'll need collected so put this in all caps collected for all sprites this is like the amount of collected um collectibles or the fruits then when you collected max so this is just to say the maximum amount of fruits you can collect now let's get another one called exit and remember all the variables that are capital are for all sprites now we can make another one called inair this is for this sprite only so we we can just delete this sprite and we will draw our sprite so we have we have the sprite in our backpack already but we will show you guys how to draw it so we're going to code here create a new costume and we'll draw it for you guys so first we need to get the uh so you see there's a two rectangles and four circles so that's how we draw like the curved edges there's a circle so let's draw the squares so you want to draw them not too fat you need them kind of thin squares and next you want to get no outline and you can just copy paste the square rectangle you did from before and hold down shift and rotate and center your sprite center both of the rectangles and next you want to get the circle tool hold down shift and you want to scale the circle perfectly like that it's not completely perfect you can select it move it back a little or use the arrow key it's not perfect enough a little bit more to the i think that should be a little bit more to the right uh that's perfect that looks pretty rounded out so you can just copy paste it and try to proportion it correctly for all the other sides as well i'll move it to the left a little bit as you can see that looks pretty much all round and you can just hold down shift to select both of the circles and you can move it down i'll use the arrow keys and boom you got your it's a little bit off but i can move it up a little yeah so that's pretty much a rounded square that looks pretty nice actually so now we can draw in the eyes so we use a line with a thickness of 25 so we have a a black line with a thickness of 25 and we just hold down the shift key so then we get a straight line and then we draw another line i think i kind of messed up right there let's try that let's try 15. let's rescale to 20 because i actually kind of messed up there our square is a little smaller compared to the other square we have so i'm trying to rescale it like as you can see it's a little smaller so i'm doing 20 size now you gotta move it a little bit so yeah and then you draw two white circles for the pupils let's get circle tool get the white just saturation zero and brightness to 100 hold oh yeah and we forgot to fill it we were supposed to fill it and now let's try again delete i'll delete the circle okay just draw hold down shift and draw a small circle no outline sorry about that so we just draw a kind of small circle delete that circle again just draw a small circle hold down shift so we get a perfect circle we can copy paste that and there you go you got your square so try to draw it like that you guys can pause the video to copy it down if you want i'm going to delete this one now because we don't need it anymore so let's go continue on making our variables so we already have some variables from the last thing i had these variables because i dragged it from my backpack so i already have some pre loaded variables so that's kind of nice so i'll give you some time to copy that down so you guys can um just copy these down we'll need these later but we won't need them now and remember all this lowercase ones are for this sprite only so you have to set all the lowercase ones for this sprite only and the uppercase all capped ones are for uh all sprites global so next we will make some more variables so let's make the level level level variable for all sprites because it's all uppercase mouse so the mouse variable is to tell where the um mouse is so when you press so uh grip patch did a video on this on a scrolling platformer when you press m it will find the x and y position of your mouse so this is good for putting where you want your collectibles and where you want your um platforms to be so next we want to make another variable called player dying this is for all sprites and player dying we'll need that later when we have traps and spikes we won't need that now let's make another variable called scroll x scroll x so this is the scrolling for the x position and this will need scroll y of course so this is a y scrolling position and then we'll need one more variable called timer this is just the time how long you can speed run or play the level so timer so those are all the variables we will need and we will also need a blank sprite so in group patches one in this tutorial he taught that um making a blank sprite will actually help you run the game faster because it actually takes time for scratch to draw yellow border around the code when you play the game so this will actually make the game a little more smoother and next we can set up our sprites we need the code for our sprites so let's go to the player we will be um putting in the platforms in the next video right now we're running low on time so let's just get on to the code for the player just like the setting up code so we're going to make a block called game on in the beginning this is just to start the game so game on we want to reset all our variables so we want to set our x to zero set that y to zero y to zero and you wanna set the s y which is the speed y to zero set the in air in air to zero in air is if the character's in the air the player to zero and then we want to duplicate this then we can set the speed x to zero as well and then next we can set the exit to blank so exit is if the player has touched the um uh portal we'll need that later and exits to tell if the player is dead we'll need to set scroll x to zero and same with scroll y and i'm going to move the s x up here so i can put the x s x and x y together so in the beginning we want to set the size to 50 so my character is already up 50 but if you haven't just set it to 50 set the ghost effect to zero because when you touch the portal it kind of ghost effects away so we want to set it back to zero we want to show in the beginning so um at one point when you die it'll start blinking and hide in show we don't want it to like get messed up so we always wanted to show in the beginning you want to get it when fly clicked in the beginning we want to set the levels as one we'll talk about the levels later we will not need that right now just set it to one in the beginning because we always want to start in level one we want to show the variable level because at the end when you win i hid the variable level so in the beginning you always want to show it set the timer to zero in the beginning timer to zero and you want to broadcast and wait a message called green flag or start game start game and then we can broadcast another one called play game play game and then when this sprite receives green flag green flag we want it to play game when it receives a start game sorry then we wanted to hide and go to the front layer i'm actually gonna change this start game to set game because it's kind of confusing so i'm gonna just broadcast a new message called set game because it's a bit too confusing because play game and start game you you can get mixed up so instead of start game we're gonna receive set game so that's it for now for this video thank you guys for watching please don't forget to like share and subscribe and i'll see you guys in part two for the scrolling platformer you
