so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding playground today we'll be making a chat bot so like you can engage a conversation with it i guess well not really because i didn't put too much work in it you guys can add some more if you guys want to um i it can also tell you the day of the week the current date and the time you can also chat with it i guess and we'll be learning these following concepts in scratch list the type text thing we learned that in the indie cat game so if you don't know how to do this you should check out our indie cat game i also show you how to do it in this video and we'll be also learning custom blocks loops sensing blocks related to data and time and i got this idea from my friend and his name is uh his username and scratch is called rayleigh1123 you can check out his scratch account right here there's a link to him and follow him he can also he also made the chain reaction game tutorial on our channel so if you haven't checked that out be sure to check it out okay so now let's continue on to the game so let's go here i'll show you how it works so let me i just got some chat bot png from online can you search it up or get anything you want in the beginning i'll say hello there your username how are you and you can respond with i'm doing fine and it will reply i'm glad to hear that um i know the popping sounds a bit annoying i just added that because why not and you can ask it to play music you'll play a random i originally had a different music wait let me turn on the volume a bit more so you guys can hear it so music play music i originally had other songs but um i took it out because it was copyrighted so if i used it in the youtube video it would be considered copyrighted so i didn't use it i just used some from the scratch library so i'll play a random song i have three songs the current date is 22 20 20. what is the day of the week it is wednesday yeah today is wednesday so that's right and we also have what is the time the current time is 2 21 25 that's basically 9 25 in our time so without further ado let's make a new project file new i'm going to rename this chat bot uh delete this sprite the sprite one backpack i already have the chat bot as you can see the background's a little off i'll make the background a different color so in one of our videos we taught you guys how to remove the background so you can also watch that but for now i'm just going to change the background color so just convert to vector it's our vector just select this color go to backdrop and just draw a square take out this just draw a square i know it's kind of hard to see because it's all white okay there you go so now the backdrop is completely blended into the chatbot background so next let's make some variables of lists only two only one variable we don't need this actually so we need one variable two lists so our one variable we will need is letter which is for the type text we'll also need two lists one is called days of the week days of the week and make another list called words okay so we have two lists and one variable letter days of the weeks and words so for the bot we're going to start out by making a block called type say type say and then we can add an input call it text so that's it for the block so let me zoom in this code let's start with the type text so in the beginning i'm going to set the letter to one because there's one letter in the beginning set the letter to one delete all of the words in the word list and then repeat repeat the length of text so it will repeat how however long the text you write as length of text text and it will change the letter by one so keep on going by one letter so change the letter by one it'll say the words say the list words the words in the word list and i'm just gonna get the pop sound because why not it's a bit annoying you can take it out if you want to i'm just going to add it and wait wait 0.15 0.15 seconds this is just to make it type out slower a bit wait one seconds and then say blank so we can set it back to blank so that's all we have for now that's the type text and one more part i forgot about this part we have to add the letter letter add the letter letter letter of text so add the letter the text so to to the word list so this is what we have for now remember to add this so next we're gonna have to um set the days of the week so get a one flag clicked hide the orderless days of the week i know it's already hidden but i'm just gonna put this if it's not if yours is not hidden then put this in the beginning we want to delete all of the days of the week in the beginning clear it all we're going to add all the days of the week so sunday monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday so i'm just going to duplicate a couple of these until i get seven so i get seven so add sunday monday monday tuesday tuesday wednesday thursday friday and saturday so all the days of the week are here and next we're gonna get it one flat clicked this is for the chatting the actual chatting for the bot so get it when flag clicked i think i should zoom in a bit more when flag's like you want to go to zero zero set the x and y position to the origin um and then we can type say type say join we'll need a couple joins join join so we can type say hello there hello there and then we do the username so i'll say hello there username how are you so that's what i'm gonna do hello there username how how sorry accidentally i dragged uh uh pick random you're supposed to drag a join so i should say hello there username how are you how how are and before before after here you should always add a space so it'll be spaced out and you should add a space before here so it'll also be spaced out so when you play it it'll say hello there my username wrestle12345 how are you so that's just a greet the user so get a forever loop let's get a forever loop um this will only say a couple things so we will not be using a list so if you want to do more like to say answer many questions then you have to do a list that's a bit complicated so we're just going to do it this way for now so we're going to ask blank in the beginning just let them ask anything we want get an if then statement if the answer answer contains a date so if the answer that they answered contains date which means the date of the week the date with current date and we type say type say join we'll need a lot of joins again join we'll need five joins okay so three four five five joins the current date is the current date is join the current month the current month join the current uh you have to put a slash just to like separate it that's what they do the current the current uh date and the current and then you put a slasher here and then the current year so when you play this and put it together i'll show you what happens so this is what we have so when you play yeah just say that i think i should uh take this out for now because it's going to waste a lot of time so i'll just show you uh let's say what is the date the current date is 7 22 20 20. so that's right right now it is july 22nd 2020 so that is correct so we can just duplicate this we'll need to do now we're gonna do the current um time so if the answer contains time then we can do the current time the current time is we have to join the current hour per hour and get another join this time we'll put a colon to separate it that's what they do and then we join the current minute so right now i'm for now i'm just going to take this out because it's going to waste too much time so when i plant what is the time the current time is 21.35 so that's basically 9 35 in our eastern time so 21 35 that's the correct time so now we have this let's work on the um the current day of the week so duplicate this we'll need an or get an or or statement so if the answer contains day or no actually no not or and sorry so this is to check double check if they actually meant the day of the week so if the answer contains day and week just put that in here then we can type say it is and then we get the item the item days of the week item the current day of the week current day of the week of days of the week so as you can see up here we set the days of the week so i'll open it up so this is the index one two three four five six seven so the current day right now is four which is um wednesday so if you were to take this out click on it it would say four which is wednesday so that means i'll select the fourth index of the list so right here it'll say it is wednesday which is today uh of the week so if you put this in just drag that in here under here so next we're gonna add the um this is like a little conversation i guess so if let's get an or okay we'll need and two ores two ores so just duplicate this so if the answer contains doing great so in the beginning notice that how it says hello their username how are you so the user might reply with i'm doing great uh doing good or doing fine there of course there are many other ways to do this with lists but right now we're doing like this doing oh oops week i was looking at something else fine and then instead of this we can just make it type say i'm glad to hear that i am glad to hear that i'm glad to hear that so you put that right there i'm going to duplicate this so this time we can check if they're doing bad let's say if they're doing a bad if they're having a bad day or something if they're doing bad or something doing bad or doing horrible if the answer is doing horror or ripple i think that's how you spell it then you can say i am i am sorry to hear that put that in here so this is just for a little conversation and finally we can do something else so let's get some sounds so this is the music playing music let me hide this list first sounds i'm just gonna take two like three random sounds put that up there um go to just gonna take the first three sounds whatever uh loops chill just take the first three sounds so for the code we're gonna do if the answer contains the answer contains answer contains play music so if they're asking us to play music then we can uh start sound pick random one to three so it will pick a random the first three uh sounds so the first three sounds right here are the bossa nova cave and chill the three sounds i have so now let's try it out the whole thing save it real quick so hello rosslyn12345 how are you i would reply with doing great then it will say i am glad to hear that you can ask it what's the date the date the current date is 7 22 20 20. yeah and you can ask it time what is the time the current time is 21.41 so now it's 9 41 in our time you can add and then you can say what is the day of the week and you can say it is wednesday so next you can say play music then i'll play a random sound and after it's done you play music again it'll pick random one to three so it could be any song really so yes i'll scroll through it one last time take a look through it so that's it for the chat bot don't forget to check out um rayleigh1123 who gave me the idea of this game uh his scratch account will be in the
