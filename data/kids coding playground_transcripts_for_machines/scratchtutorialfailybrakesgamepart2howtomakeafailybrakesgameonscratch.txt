welcome back guys it's kids coding playground here today we're back for another video and we're still working on the daily breaks game so yeah um so today we will be working on the laser and the power up so i was showing you the code um if you don't have this code right here feel free to pause and yeah yeah copy down all this code so and also the trees i'm pretty sure we did this one too so first let's rename this i forgot to rename that in part one family three okay okay you don't have to have the teaching but i'm gonna do this so yeah um i'm gonna work on the laser second secondly so the third thing because we already worked on trees and the other thing the player so when the green flag is clicked we'll set size to 20 percent then laser will be smaller because i'm pretty sure it's kind of big it's already at 20 but uh you probably don't have it's probably not 20 for you because you got the button so when i receive start game then oh sorry sorry sorry um sorry i forgot to show you where the start game is so as you can see it says broadcast start game when you click the space bar so when i receive start game it'll go forever and unit if then statement if then the key and um the key space is pressed and and the laser is more than zero so basically if you have more than one laser you can shoot okay so laser zero then change laser by minus one because you lost a laser that's a create clone of myself the laser is the button so yeah you can actually get it from here search up buttons right here i think around here but you can also use this button if you want any button you want you can even use a bat if you want but it's your game so wait until you wait until so wait until not key press so that will not spam so you cannot just hold the space key you know and go like a machine gun so yeah so you might if you want to spam you can you don't you don't have to use this technically but if you want if you don't want you the player to spam then you can you add that so when when i start as a clone so as you can see it says create clone of myself so it brings to the when i start as a clone and when i start as a clone it'll go to the player and and the player is basically a convertible the car and go to the player point in direction um so i will show you a thing so point in direction direction of player so you always have to change the last one this is tricky player and you have to change this direction and i'll set y to wide position so we can just duplicate this and we need a plus so a plus negative 20 so a direction of a player so i will explain this later and i will show you what this basically means so instead you need a y position of player and then it'll move 50 steps so yeah i'll show you what this means later and so because if you don't have this it's just the y position of player it'll be like up here and that's not directly in the middle so i will actually show you later so yeah so move 50 steps so go in the front of the car it will show and repeat until you need to repeat until loop repeat until repeat until touching that sorry about that so it will repeat until touching the edge and it will move ten steps you also need an if then statement so you can get the if then statement inside here if that is touching the obstacle then it will hide until you shot the obstacles and it will change obstacle hp by one so i don't think we have that variable yet but you can make that and i'll get further into that later so obstacle hp so i will change obstacle hp by so then the rock like some so so some things have like two times to kill like the wall picks three times rox takes two times so you gotta change it by one because the laser does one damage and you also need a if then statement we need if then statement so if then we need an or if then the obstacle hp and you need another one the less than symbol so the obstacle hp equals zero variables so it was actually a glitch i just found out so when i when i saw there was no obstacle hp here i did it for all sprites so now it's working so i just clicked on one of these and obstacle hp was on there so it was actually and i clicked back on this one and it worked so it's actually a glitch so sorry about that so the obstacle or hp0 or well or the obstacle hp is less than zero i don't know how that's supposed to happen but it's just in case because you can't spam but i don't i don't know how that can happen but just in case so yeah you know broadcast obstacle destroy so if i make a new uh broadcast some weight obstacles i always get confused alphabets so broadcast and destroy obstacle destroy and also delete this clone so you gotta put the delete this clone on the right place so it is not in here so it is right under this one and not under this one only under this one and also you need to delete this clone under this so yeah we're done with the lasers i will show you what this means in a while and i also showed you what you have it or not so basically delete the laser means that the um laser will go so i'll show you what how it is if you do the this one like with this because it's plus negative 20. i told you i'd do that so let's just start as you can see um the laser is directly where the car is in the middle of the car but we're going to try another one so we're just going to take out this put this inside and as you can see it might be a little bit different for you i'm not sure because sometimes as you can see it's unlike on top of the car so yeah so this could help so we're gonna move on to the power up next so this one has uh a hunk of code two so i'm gonna start easy and simple with one green flag clicked go to x so i have the coordinates so go to x 94 31 and no show so somewhere over here and when i receive start gain then i'll go forever i'll go to x 200 and y pick random pick random from negative 115 to positive 50. so it'll be like around here and repeat until you need it or wait until or that it's touching the player or touching that edge and i'll change x by pick random negative three to negative something sometimes it's lower sometimes it's higher basically faster sorry so depending how big your costume is or how big your size is the thing could be like flashing around here because it's touching the edge so i'll show you that right now as you can see it's 250 and i'm just gonna wait for this as you can see it's like flashing around here and that is just wrong so it depends how big your costume is and and your position also your size if you're caught if your thing is small or big so i'm also going to show you the this way how i did it with 200 eggs as you can see it's not on the edge and it's not like right here going like this and that and this and that so yeah that's basically what it means and then you have to make when i receive got power up we're still coding so it's over here yep i'm touching power got power up hide i'll start sound magic spell already have that sound sorry sorry excuse me and magic spell you can get it from the scratch library so magic so yeah you use any sound you want like pop pop whatever you want so yeah and you need a if then statement so um the co so we're actually going to use costume number so um so it's you need it equal so if it the costume number is equal to one so the constant number is equal to one i'll describe all of this afterwards when i'm done coding so costume number equals one custom number is the heart so yeah so if the costume number equals one you need an ifthenelse statement if then else i'll just code everything right now if the hp plus 20. each heart is 20 so you can make it like infinite if you want but the next block of code i'm doing it will stop that so and now it's over 100 then set hp to 100 so so i'll describe everything afterwards so set hp to 100 and it'll change else it'll change hp by 20. so basically you cannot your hearts cannot go over 800 so if you want to go over 100 you can remove the script of code and make it differently and but i'm using this else i'll change hp by 20. so it will work and the set hp to 100 means that won't go over a hundred so if you're like 70 hp you'll go to 90 hp but if you're at like a 90 hp it won't go to 110. it'll still it'll it'll stay at 100. we'll just add 10. if you're at 100 and you collect a heart it's still 100. so yeah that's basically what it means and also the second costume is star so this doesn't really have a use but it's just a flex it's basically like a score it's like a flex score so yeah if you want like a big um score you can always use the star so so yes so you need equals if the costume number equals two uh then it will change score by five you can make it like infinite score if you want like 10 million if you want i don't judge you but if you want to you can't and you just have to duplicate this it's just a little bit different sorry that you just make it aft out outside and you can make it three you know change score instead of change score let's change laser by ten so i'll show you what the next one is so you can make it five but i'm using ten so the laser so it'll have ten shots when you collect it so show your costume laser this costume three i don't know why it says costume two because this is and um wait three seconds it'll come again wait three seconds set x to 200 so it will go around here again and it won't flash around here so just go around here and next costume show so you get the powers yep and i think we might have a part three i'm not sure but let's see costume one costume two as you can see you can pause anytime you want feel free so we will actually have a part three i'll actually show you the game so it's not completely finished the obstacles are not here so we can move these down so if you do not know you can actually double click on this to make it like laser 10 and also do this and you can also double click to get this so um i'm gonna double click on i already i'm gonna double click on this drag the variable down here double click on this drag the variable down here double click on this drag the variable down here and let's start actually so as you can see please select the car using right and left arrow keys please press space when you're done so i'm gonna select yellow this time so as you can see the powerups are going around and it's the on laser so yeah yeah i have 20 lasers now it's hard this time so stay at 100 as you can still stay at 105 like five points and it's not that challenging right now but we will have part three for this and yeah so as you can see the hp i'm just gonna play this again so i'm gonna show you something with the car and as you can see it says um hp to let me set the hp to 50 so then i can show you the heart so yeah let's just this i'm going to pick red so as you can see the hp is coming as you can see it went to 70. so yes it does work and i'm just gonna wait for another heart so it's just a power up this time so as you see it's changing spray oh i got a heart as you can see it's 90 i hope there's another heart if i'm lucky enough this is another star and this dude and as you can see the heart it doesn't go hunting 110 i'll show you that again right here wait for heart to come wow why is it going in the same order i don't know why so as you can see 110 it doesn't go to it just goes there stays at 100. so i it looks like we have um next costume so it's always predictable so i will maybe change this to a random costume to make the game more challenging so let's say switch costume to pick random costume one two three because there's three costumes so i'll run it again and show you guys this time it's not that predictable and harder to guess i mean it's impossible to predict it uh so yeah as you see it's a star design instead of a heart i think the first one was supposed to be a heart and this time it's a heart i wonder what the next one's going to be it's a star see look it's not a towel anymore so yeah so you you can do next costume if you want but this is more fun in my opinion because you can't you don't know what it is so next part will be part three and yeah and we'll be working on the obstacles it might be really short but yes so please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below for what else caught what anyways see you guys you
