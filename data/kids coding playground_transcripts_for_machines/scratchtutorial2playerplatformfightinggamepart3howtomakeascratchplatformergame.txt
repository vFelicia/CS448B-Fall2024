so this is the third episode of the twoplayer fighting game so if you haven't watched the first and second one i suggest you to watch that those two first it's kids coding playground and this is the third video so we're going to be working on the background the begin button and the selection screen today so first let's go to the backdrop open code in here we have the sound here you can take any sound you want but i downloaded this sound so let me zoom in so when fly clicked you want to switch the backdrop to this one the first backdrop which is the desert just you can rename it back back drop one bg one broadcast this message called start screen so start screen is to start the game start it'll start this a start screen for the selection so we'll put the forever down here put the sound in here and let's move on to the begin button so i have it in the backpack already so i can just drag it in here but since you guys don't have it i will show you guys so um i'll just make a new sprite paint i'm not paint i'm sorry um so we'll just get the button sprite button get this button so you can just type um make it maybe white white color so you can write begin or something shrink it and you can write another begin begin and then you can flip it over like that so that's how you make the begin thing oops there you go like that see this let's make it something like that so you can just i'm just going to delete this just copy this down make something like that so we want to get one flight another one fly click sorry so when it receives start screen we want to reset all the variables so we need to make two new variables one is called player1hp and we can make the other variable later actually because we don't have two players yet so just name it player one hp so player 1 hp you can just hide this so we want to set hp player 1 hp to 100 in the beginning we can make the other player 2 hp later because um we don't have two players yet so we can set the player one character to clear in the beginning so that means it hasn't selected anything yet so we can go to this position x zero y negative eighty this position i have already and set the brightness to zero because we will be changing the brightness when the button is clicked uh and then we can show in the beginning because after that when it's clicked we need to hide it so we're gonna broadcast another message called spin button so this broadcast just make a button spin it's just to make it spin to make it look better so just name it spin button spin button so when it receives spin button then we can do a forever loop turn two degrees to the left or the right whichever one you'd like and if it's touching if it's touching um the mouse pointer and mouse down so if it's getting clicked on basically touching the mouse pointer and mouse down then we can set the brightness effect to negative 10. so we'll make it darker change the brightness effect by negative 10 brightness by negative 10 so make it darker so let's play it so when you play it um it'll play the music and when you click it it'll get darker we haven't done the code to us make it hide and stuff yet so we will do that later so the back let's make a little recap so the backdrop broadcast is start screen to the begin and again we'll will receive it and broadcast it to other sprites later on in the video so we still have some more code for the begin button so when the sprite is clicked when the sprite is clicked if when if else statement if the player being an equal sign if the player one character is equal to blank that means nothing has been selected yet then we can say uh for two seconds maybe uh players please select please select your uh characters and else if it is selected then we can start some pop like make a little sound effect then we can hide hide broadcast start game and wait start oops i need a new message called start game start game new uh message and we can stop other scripts in the sprite because we don't need the begin button at all after the game has started so this is the code for the begin button so let's play it click on it players play select characters and we have not we haven't done this uh selecting buttons so that's why it's uh saying that so that's why it's saying that because we haven't got done the selection so we'll do that later so for the player one have to change all the when flag clicks into the start game so it won't show up in the beginning we want it to show up once the button is clicked so start game just changes that for a start game just do it for all the wonderful clicks start game do we have any more let's drag to this side i think that's it for now we might have to do more later and finally we do not need this code anymore this is just testing so you can just delete it so next we will work on the artwork for the ninja girl buttons i already have the stuff in my backpack but i will drag it out and teach you guys how to play make it so you go to costumes so first let me delete this i'll show you how to do it from the beginning to end so you want to get the ninja girl idle costume and then convert to a vector select the whole thing ctrl c copy and paste it make a new costume and paste it over here so as you can see and now you erase everything under the head convert to bitmap with the eraser tool and erase everything under it until the head you have to be you have to zoom in a bit at the end because you have some uh hard parts to clean up so you got to go slow see like you can mess up sometimes like you can click it that's a good way to do it and you can set the things a smaller size like a 10 size to clean up this edges um we're almost done i mean it doesn't have to be too perfect but just clean it up try to do it the best you can like i'm doing oops there's a little cut on the hair maybe five size a bit smaller now to make it clean up better clean up this area um this is pretty good right now let's clean off the edges that's bad and erase this so that should be good so now you can just convert back to vector so you can select it so we can make a new sprite paint a new one make it right here get like a circle put like some orange color like i did up there put an outline like a brown color and you want the um and you want the thickness i'm just doing a random color just to show you and demonstrate you can um make six as the outline draw the circle and you hold down the shift key so you get a perfect circle like right now so you go to the head select it remember to convert back to vector ctrl c ctrl v now you can shrink it shrink it to the size and always drag from the corners so i have the ninja head you can make it a bit bigger actually so this is my ninja head and then you can just duplicate it um make a different color for the background like maybe blue blue blue and then the edge can still be black i guess and then you can just write with white or something player one and put it right there so when it will start out as this and when it's clicked it will change to this like that and that okay so i'm just going to delete these so if you ever need to um learn how to do it you can just go back a bit and watch me do it so i have the costumes same thing for the dragon do the same thing as the dragon when you're making the dragon button so let me drag this in let me take it so next let's work out the code for the ninja girl button so in the flat clicked we can set the x and y position so the reason why it's set right there is because i have in my backpack so it will set it to that so if you because it probably won't be the same place as mine so you could just set it as negative 170 or y60 you can do it anywhere you want actually but i'm staying with this we wanted to go to the front layer so everything will go to the back like the platforms and stuff switch the costume to costume one in the beginning like the regular costume nonselected one and we have to show in the beginning uh and when the sprite is clicked you want to set the player1 character to ng because this is the ninja girl button so when you click on it we change it to ninja girl so now we broadcast a message called player 1 select we can name it player 1 select and when this receives player one selects then we get a fl statement if the player one character is equal to the ninja ninja girl then we can get change it to ng so if the player one character is ninja girl then we can switch the costume to costume two which is the selected one as you can see and switch costume else we can switch the costume to costume one the ng is matching with the sprite costume that's why we have to put ng as you can see costume is ng run ng jump ng attack that's why i have to put ng in the front and when i receive start game then we have to hide because when the game starts we want the buttons to hide player 2 dragon is pretty much the same thing you can just drag and drop all the code into here but we just have to change a couple extra things um drag this in and drag this in so now we have all the code here so instead of ng since this is dragon we have to set this to drk because uh the corresponding um costumes as you can see right here is drg see drg run drg attack drg jump so we set it to drt and we set the variable to here also to drg and one last thing i think we forgot to add it from here we have to change the x and y position to negative 65 y 60 which is that position right there and broadcast and when the sprites click we have to switch to the costume 2 so yeah that's all the code so let me play it and you only select one so right now you only have one player so if you don't select anything they'll say players please select your characters players please select your characters we'll change the break which i'll fix the brightness thing later when you select one of them you cannot select everything still works smoothly and fine so since every single time you click the button it gets darker and darker like that like that you can't even see it put the clear graphic effects right here so now as you can see when you click it it'll clear back after it's done saying it so thank you guys for watching please like share and subscribe and i'll see you guys in the fourth episode of the two player fighting game you
