so welcome back guys to kids quoting playground and today we'll be doing a project called cat in the basketball we will be learning these following concepts in scratch broadcast messages touching sprites of sensing use pick random motion slash movement and key press and sprite on click so cat and basketball today we will work on this project this is how the layout looks like so this is our new project first of all we need to rename the project to cat and a basketball then we can rename the cat from sprite one to cat and then we'll need to get a bunch of sprites start from the basketball sprite then we need to get the cat letters we need the letter c letter a and the letter t t okay and we also need a backdrop we might choose a basketball backdrop okay so now we need to put the cat up here cat so first we'll start out with the code for c okay so you need to do a one on click when this flag is clicked then we'll need we'll need to go to this position negative 119 130 then we will go when sprite clicked we need the one sprite click so that means if the c button is pressed then we will glide somewhere down here so as you can see this changed so we will apply probably three seconds three seconds to this position we can wait one second so it stays down there for one second then we'll move back up to this position right here maybe another three seconds we need a distance negative 119 and 130. then finally we might want to make the letter c change color so we can go to events and then click on the when space key press then you can change the color effect by 25 change color effect by 25 so now we have the c button done now let's head on to the a button so for the a button when clicked we want to go to this position 7 126 and then we need to when the sprite clicked we want to glide two seconds to maybe somewhere down here so when this break is clicked then we'll might glide somewhere down here how about that so we collide maybe two seconds instead to this position wait one second then we can glide back to the home position we this is all for the a the a sprite now we will head on to the t sprite okay so when the space bar is clicked we want to turn right 90 degrees so it'll just turn right 90 degrees if you click on spacebar and change color by 25 and we always want to set the position to where i replaced it so in this case the position is 111 127 okay so now if you run it and click on c it glides down here and it will glide back up now if you press space bar this one turn they both turn change color and the t rotates by 90 degrees if you press the a it glides down and glides back up so this is how we do the animation for the cat letters and next i'll be moving on to the basketball and the cat please like share and subscribe and ring the notification bell to receive the latest updates from this channel so now we will be working on the cat and the basketball so first we'll start out with the cat so first of all we need a one click we want the cat to be somewhere right here maybe so we want to go to right here and then we want to repeat until touching the basketball so then when it touches it it will make the basketball bounce all around basketball yes and it will move 10 steps that means i'll move 10 steps every time next costume it'll make it look like it's running and wait 0.1 seconds so it looks more realistic and it won't keep on going very fast it'll have like a short pause we'll broadcast a message called kick and we'll and the basketball will receive the message kick so then next we will be going onto the basketball so the basketball will receive the message kick and we also need to set its position so first we need a one flag clicked then we might want to move the basketball somewhere maybe right here and then we find this and then now we can work on the kick function the broadcast message so we want it to turn pick random negative 180 to 180 degrees so it'll pick a random degree in between that range to 180 and we want a forever loop and forever loop means everything inside will repeat forever until the stop button is pressed next we want to put a move 10 steps so it'll make like the bouncing effect and if on edge bounce that means if it's on the edge it'll keep on bouncing and we can add change color effect by 25 it'll make the basketball change colors so finally now we can play it all together see now the basketball is bouncing around you press the c it moves down there comes back you press the spacebar they change color and this one rotates by 90 degrees press a the a goes down here and goes back up so thank you for watching guys and see you guys next time you
