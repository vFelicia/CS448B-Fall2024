so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding playground today we'll be doing the next episode of the scrolling platformer and i'm just going to scroll through the code for a little bit so i can show you guys just if you have missed anything then you can i'll copy it down right now i'll scroll a little bit slower this time so you guys can actually look at it better so so the tick custom block and all this and then we have the platforms the platforms danger so we have this and let me just delete that i don't know why that was there um so that's the danger collectibles and the exit the portal okay so today we'll be working on the vertical scrolling so let's go to our player let's go to the tick custom block so you want to get an if then statement if scroll y is less than zero so this is if it's the scroll wise less than zero it will not scroll so if the scroll y is less than zero then set the scroll y to zero like the scroll x we also did that if it passed zero then it'll not scroll anymore next we want to add the vertical scrolling so add this right here so you want to change the scroll y by the round so this is just uh this is just to uh make it smooth scrolling so for here we just set the scroll x to x but if you want to make it uh smooth then you can do change scroll y by round of the just put a division symbol and then a subtraction so y minus the scroll y then you divide it by 10. and then next you always want to position it again so it will go to the correct position and if the y position is less than 180 negative 180 if the y then we want to set exit to dead set the exit to dead now you want to go to the platform script we will add some more levels to the platform so remember you have to you can use the m to find out where you want to put the platforms we are adding more platforms so then we can see more levels when we're scrolling so i already have some coordinates i i'm using so i would just use those coordinates it may not be the same for yours because your platformer may be different from mine so let me just quickly enter this duplicate this uh let's go to level three one set this up three sixty three sixty 0 0 360. and finally level 4. duplicate this and don't forget to change the level i almost forgot to do that level three level four set this to level four one delete this okay so now i have all the coordinates to place all the clones for the platforms now we gonna work at the collectibles so i already have some hornets for the collectibles as well so i'm gonna take this out for now so because i have to add a lot of script so i'm going to duplicate this put the code so level 2 negative 79 negative 76. one six six two three two two six two three two so remember you can place collectibles wherever you want i just did it at these exact places you still have the mouse thing to find out where you want to place your collectibles and finally for a one so i am done with the level two let me duplicate all of this so then i can just put this down here and instead of level one we'll do level three we remember to rename your levels negative 75 zero 56 negative 65 50 10 50. and we have three more to go 910 oh yeah and not five it's fifty fifty nine ten negative sixty um 988 60 and finally last but not least 1020 and 168. so we have to change this to level three right here uh it's already level three this is level four sorry about that so i just created one fruit at the end of level at the end just for fun so i just put it at 170 negative 175 and 5. okay so now we have all of our collectibles positioned and don't forget to add this set x negative 99999 so we can move the actual collectible off the screen again so now let's work on the saw so i just got this saw from online um so the saw actually has like a costume where you can um uh you can like make it rotate look like it's rotating like a rotating blade so let's get uh the code from the collectibles you can just drag and drop this into the saw we will not need some of the code however so um in the beginning in setup you just take out this it's already set so you want to set the x to zero y to zero i'm gonna hide right here set the player dying to no player dying to end so remember all the uh all the variables with the capital letters are for global so if you have not made this variable make it it's called player dying make this variable so you want to set the player dying to no and i only put a saws in two of the levels so if it's equal to level two i remember you can use the mouse thing i just made it at 65 130 that's where i put my saw and i'm going to duplicate this if it's level three in the beginning you want to switch the costume to back to the first saw so it won't be on the rotating saw already so negative 63 and negative 85 that's where i put those and then i will duplicate this i guess and then i did 1 1 2 8 and 85 and then don't forget to set the x back to negative 99 since we're dealing with clones again and then we can just delete the rest of the code all right now you want to also get the the clone thing right here and the positioner to position it the green flag and also the reset and of course the tick all right so let me just spread this out a little bit okay so for here we will not need the switch costume to pick random one to eight we will not need the collected max for here we just want to switch the costume back to the stall one so so in the beginning it'll always win a clone it'll always be the first costume for the saw and then for the um tip uh when i receive tick we can keep this if it's touching the player and and player dying is equal to n so let's set this to n so if touching player and the player is dying is equal to n player dying is equal to n then we will not need this right here we don't need this right here so once this is happening we want to set the player dying to yes because we when the player is already dead we don't want to keep installing it so let's go player dying to y if touching player and so we want to set it to y when it's touching it so it's dead once it's touching it and then we can broadcast a new message called player die the player will receive this and it will die then after that after it's done sawing we set it back to no so it won't keep on sawing it and it won't keep on dying set it back to n and one last bit of code for here when i start as a clone you wanna forever next costume this is just for like this rotating saw animation and i put a weight 0.05 seconds so a very very little pause a very little pause and then next finally not not finally but we need to add one last bit of code for the player when when i receive player die then we want to set the exit to dead to let the player know it's dead exit to dead so up here we have the thing where if where is it again oh yeah if set the exit to uh if touching danger and set the exit to dead so if the player is when it receives the player die when the chainsaw touches the player they'll set the exit dead and finally let's work on the portal positioning so now we have four levels we can't do this level is less than two so we have to change this four same with the danger this has to be all right not the danger uh what was it again oh yeah we have to set that for the sauce i mean not the sauce the collectibles so for the uh portal we want to set the level if it's less than four so if the level is equal to one we will i put this position it may not be the same for yours so i will duplicate a new cost i mean not a new costume a uh new if then statement so this thing duplicate this if it's equal to level two if levels equals level two switch costing close portal so i put it at 709 541 and i will duplicate that again oops wrong one duplicate that again and if it's equal to level three then i set it at one two three five and one fifty so i just found these positions by using the mouse thing so now let's test out the game so guys i forgot to add the danger for level two and level three so we will add that right now really quick so i just set it for these positions 150 200. 360 and 100 and then um next i should duplicate this so let's change it to level three so i have these costumes right here so instead of level one three two one we have to do three one and instead of level two we do level three like i said and 360 100 i'm not doing a 360 0 0 360. so it'll just keep on going across no y position has changed duplicate this and finally the last bit of it so four delete these two and we just need to do level four one that's it so let's try it out so i have no music yet i can add that later remember you can still wall jump collect all the fruits and go to the portal and the y scrolling is working fine because as you can see you can scroll up and the saw is spinning around and you can get killed by it as you can so your platformer should be looking like this and we have the whole line of spikes here and finally level three the last level we have another saw right there oops i just uh it's a little bit laggy right now it's a little bit laggy okay it's back to normal okay let me collect all these fruits and boom we're done and on level four tomorrow in the next video we'll do the winning screen but anyways thank you guys for watching don't forget to share this with your friends like this video smash the like
