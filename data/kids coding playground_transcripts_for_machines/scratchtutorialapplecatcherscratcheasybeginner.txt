welcome back guys to kids coding playground and today we'll be doing another video this time we'll be doing a video on Apple cash routine we'll be making an apple catcher came today and the objective of the game is to get 50 points by catching apples so an Apple catcher game we will be learning these following concepts and scratch broadcasting messages using pick random variables operators and condition checks so without further ado let's head on to the tutorial okay so now first we can you rename this to apple hunter so you need to leet the cat sprite because we don't need it first we need upload some sprites and a backdrop we need the apples right we'll need the bull sprite and we need to paint a sprite the win the winning to let the player know that they won so you might want to pick like a red color I guess I'm gonna pick the marker fun because it's big and easy to see so you win so you want to Center it like that we might want to get a backdrop to I would pick the blue sky that looks great with the occasion game okay so let's start with the code for the Apple so you want to always start with one flat plate we want it to go to room in position set Y to 180 so it would be somewhere up here next you want to drag in a forever loop everything inside will go on forever then you wanted to change Y by negative seven so that means I'll make the Apple drop by negative seven every time change Y by negative 7 and then we need dragged in ifthen statement if then it the position the Y position track this is equal to negative 178 which is somewhere around the bottom of the screen you want to go to a random position and reset back to one a set Y back to 180 next you want to get dragged in another if then statement this part is a check if the bowl is touching the Apple so we need to go to sensing dragon if touching block we need a selectable then we might want to play the sound chomp to give it a little effect we can and then we need to make a variable so our variable would be score to track how many points you get so you want to keep this check to show up right here so we want it to change score change score by pick random one to ten so you've got a random score every time every time you catch an apple so you want to select back to go to a random position so I'll reset again and set Y back to 180 oneeighty will be around somewhere right here and next you want to do a 100 and clicked if if the score is equal to 50 or greater than 50 so dragon if cliff like like to forever loop and you need to if then statement so Union also need some operators so you need your after the or if the score is greater than 50 or equal to 50 so that means if the score is greater than 50 or equals than 50 equal to 50 because we need this part because we have a random right here if it picks random then it's not a guarantee it will be under 50 or equal to 50 when you broadcast a message after call it win and we need to broadcast this Apple has to receive the message win and whatever sees it it'll hide so it won't show on the backdrop anymore and then stop other scripts in the sprite so you weren't drinking to stop all click this other scripts in this straight so as you can see now if you do this this will stop the code for this part and this part so as you can see if we're done with the Apple now let's move on to the bull code so for the bowl first with the dragon if like legs we want the bowl to be somewhere down here and also be in the center so we might want to go zero negative 136 so it'll be even like straight through the center or we want to set the score 20 so you you won't start out with the score bigger than zero so you get an advantage so next we'll drag into forever loop we need to ifthen statements so if then left we need go to sensing if then left arrow is pressed down that means it'll go left if the left arrow is pressed down we need to make it go left so pointing direction of negative 90 which is the left side right here and then next you want to change X by negative 10 that means it'll move to the left by negative 10 so and then we want to get another key pressed we want the right arrow this time and instead of changing X by negative negative 10 we need positive 10 and instead of pointing direction of negative 90 we want to point in the direction of 90 so we'll change X by 10 and then when it receives the message wind stopped other scripts in the sprite which means I'll stop this chunk of code right here and don't forget this step you will always want to set the bowl to this or else your bowl will flip upside down when you're playing and it won't look good and finally we want to go to the wind code so for the wind code we'll need to get a 1 clicked you'll go to 0 0 and no hide we wanted to hide in the beginning because you don't want it to say win in the beginning even though they haven't even got one Apple yet so we need a dragon up the when I received when we wanted to show when it receives the message win and stop all everything stop all okay so now we have the whole game ready oh yeah and we also might want to set the Apple a bit small it's like size 75 so now when we play it Bob mom you catch an apple it place the chunks up and get a random score Bob and the score goes up Bop as you can see the score goes up right here every time the humming Apple Bob and when I reach over 52 or equal to 52 it'll say if you win so thank you for watching and see you guys next time and please like share subscribe and rate the notifications well to watch our latest uploads
