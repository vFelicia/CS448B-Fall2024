hello guys welcome back to kids calling playground we i haven't done a video in a while been pretty busy but i thought of finishing this uh ninja platformer game what we had last time so we have done number three up to part three where we can make the ninja fly and attack the enemy but now we're going to work on the ninja getting attacked by the medusa and can die and also moving to the next stage okay all right so let's start so go to your main character so last time we had this message called check player position so we're going to start coding that so we're going to say when i receive check player position so what we're going to do is we're going to throw in the forever loop in here let me zoom in all right so this part we're going to get some operation here so we're going to use the if condition and then we're going to use some operation okay and then let's add one more inside this if and then we'll get else if inside okay all right so let's start so we're going to call the operation we're going to get in or join so what we're going to do is we're going to get two all join and then we'll get one end joint put that in the front okay all right and then we'll put this inside here uh we're gonna check if it's touching medusa okay so you touch medusa you can die but we don't want to touch medusa and die but if you look at the medusa we want to only if it touched medusa in any of this costume like seven eight nine ten you know these costumes not the dying costumes so if the ninja hit the medusa medusa is dying it should not be getting killed only if the medusa is walking we're getting if the ninja hits it then you can die right so that's why so let's go back to here so here what we're going to do is uh we're going to use the sensing block here and then we're going to use the all operator greater than so you're touching medusa and the costume number of the medusa is greater than six okay dump that in here and then for the or here what we're going to do is um if it's touching the spike then ninja can also die or you can get the y position so basically if the ninja falls off the the land like the land block it fall off and fall into the water you can die so we're going to say the y position so y position is less than negative 150 okay all right so let's go back let's zoom back out a little bit i guess so you can see okay here what we're going to do is we're going to broadcast a message so uh broadcast message uh click on new message and then say die okay and then here we're gonna check the portal so the ninja touched the portal we're going to move to the next stage so portal is this okay so and we want to only move the next stage if the portal is less than 10 so because i have 10 costume here so you see i have 10 costume so at the very end at the last costume sorry accidentally created one one more here at the very end of the last costume i say you win right so we don't need to move anymore so only up to the uh 9 costume on the ground the level then we're going to increase so we're going to use operator here and then we're going to say less than 10 so we're going to use the level so the level is less than 10 we're going to increase it so change level by one okay and then here we're gonna broadcast a new message okay saying uh start new i think we might have this already i don't know i think we might have it already and cancel let me see if i have start new level no i don't have it yes i do yeah start new level right yeah just select that sorry about that and then the other one we want to we'll get to the end we're going to say you know u1 okay all right okay so start new level so we're going to get this i'm going to say start new level so for start new level we're gonna reset it and then we are going to uh broadcast a message it's called start game okay and then we're gonna do the uh uh die so when we broadcast die we're gonna do something as well i'm gonna say die we're gonna set the the player is dead to true so that you know will not do anything not allowed to play the jump anymore and then we're going to say stop um other script in the sprite okay stop by the script in the sprite okay now let's move on to the ninja and then we'll come back to the main character so in the ninja we're gonna code the dying animation so we're gonna say when i receive uh die okay so here we're going to stop other script i don't want other thing to move so stop other script in the sprite and then we're going to play the sound uh place down until done so basically this is the library sound that we had with the alien alien making quick sound that's in the uh scratch library okay so you can use that so now we're going to say change the depth by one and then we're gonna set the custom index to one and then we're gonna switch to the custom index to switch the custom to that zero so that's zero so you can see i have that zero one you can see it's falling down down so let that zero to that number nine right so from zero to nine that is actually ten times right so but since we already used the first one we only need to loop nine times so let's go here put repeat nine time and then we're gonna switch the costume say switch costume and then we're going to use the join operation and we are going to put the d and then we're going to put the variable the custom index here so we're gonna call d1234 until d9 okay and then we're gonna change the custom index by one not set oops change custom index like one so we'll move to the next one okay and then after that we're gonna broadcast a new message uh we're gonna say um that animation done okay so we're going to come back to the main character so we're going to reset everything when the dead animation is done i'm going to say when i receive that animation done i'm going to do a little bit of weight 0.1 second and then we're gonna reset and then call the start game okay so let's try it out okay all right so you can see if i touch the ninja i mean ninja touch the uh the meduza you can die right okay but if i let's say if i kill the medusa i walk by see i don't die right because the ninja only dies when we get hit by when the medusa is actually moving not when it's done okay all right so let's go back let's put the ground back to one so we're gonna start moving the net level okay all right okay so when the ground level so when we say green flag is clicked we're gonna start creating this we're gonna set it to zero zero and then we're gonna use the forever loop and we're gonna say level i'm going to use if condition here sorry so if condition so the level is less than 11 because my level only up to 10 right so if level is less than 11 then we're gonna switch the level so whatever level was uh change we're gonna switch it to that level okay so switch costume to the level okay all right so that is done for the level so similar thing we'll do it for the virtual ground so we're going to just copy kind of move it drag it here so now we have it here so on the virtual ground same thing but we are going to make it like a ghost effect and then we're going to kind of hide so we're going to say um set the ghost effect not high but set it like clear color kind of thing so set goes effect to 100 so that you can see it and then we have to do is show so that we can get detection and then we'll put this in okay all right so we have that done so now we're gonna move on to the crate so what we're going to do is we're going to make the gym after the ninja breaks the crate you can open the open the gym box kind of thing right okay so in the crate we're going to start with when i receive start new level okay so when i receive start a new level i am going to go to front layer and then switch costume i think my create a different costume so it can be this this or this okay so we're gonna switch your costume a random costume so switch costume pick random one two three because i have three costumes sorry three okay so you can put anywhere you want i think uh earlier we created one code for detecting the position in the main character i think see this m key right so let's say i want to put this flower thing here i can say m so it gives you the position 0 92 so you can put it at that and then you can just kind of adjust it as you want okay so let's say so for the first one let's say i want to put the crate over here around this this area right negative 36 83 it might be good it might not be good let's just see okay so now what we can do is hey if it's level one so i can say if and then we're going to use the operator here say equal right and then we're going to use the level if we go to level one let's say i put it this 30 negative 36 and negative 83 right so let's see if that works well if it doesn't work well we can adjust it always okay so we're going to say go to um negative 36 and negative 83 so now let's see if we start the game let's see level one this box should show you see the box is kind of too high right so we're gonna make it move down a little bit right so we don't want it to be too high so what we can do is hey let's change it to negative 10 negative 93 so let's see how it looks so let's start again so you can see uh 92 is pretty good it's kind of on the ground so that's good so we can see we can attack the the crate but the crate is not breaking right now right we want to break the crate once the ninja attacks it so we can get the gym and we can open a portal right all right so whatever you want you can go like level two so you can just switch the map to let's say level two you can say hey where i want to put level two item i can put them let's say right here or something right you can do that so you put them right here you can see oh the crate is um at this position right next uh 133 and then three you can see that right so you can copy that and put it there right something like that so if you want to do that then then say level two you move your crate here you can see uh 133 right and then we'll change this to level two and then and then here the y will be like negative three right right okay so just that's what i'm saying you can put it anywhere you want right so that's kind of like that and you can do it all the way until you know level 10. okay and then after that we want to say show so i'm gonna only code two and you're gonna say show okay after that after you say show uh what you're going to do is you're going to check uh wait until the ninja attacks the crate and then we're going to break it so we're going to say um there's a thing called wait until so you can say wait until and then we can use a or condition here and then we're going to put one end condition in the front so what we're going to do is we're going to allow the canine to break it if that can i touch it okay so touching goodnight where's that little knife yeah right here oop okay goodnight which is this little knife okay if we touch this knife then we can break it or you know if it's uh touching the ninja but this time we have to check the costume of the ninja so if you see the custom of the ninja look at us i put all the attack costume at the very end so basically any of this attack costume so greater than 52 then is attack costume so any of this costume hits the crate you're gonna attack that okay so we can say go back to the box okay and we're gonna say custom number so we're gonna use a greater than right i think it was 52 something like that let's check again that thing is 52 right the costume okay so 52 is this standing okay so 53 so greater than 52 yeah so so we can say greater than 52 so it's greater than 52 the costume index so we're going to say uh select this select the costume the ninja and then custom number okay so costume number greater than 52 we are going to play the sound okay play the sound crunch i think the the sound basically this down okay so basically it's like a sound that the crate got broken okay and then we're gonna say hi and then we're gonna uh broadcast a message say new message say create broken okay so when the crate broken then we're gonna show the gym so let's go to the gym so let's work on that so in the gym when i say when green flag is clicked we're gonna hide it so we're not gonna show the gem in the beginning okay and then we're gonna clear the graphics effect so we're gonna make the gym kind of flashing and then um so when we say uh forever i'm gonna use the forever control here we're gonna say uh change color effect by 25 and then we're gonna have the if condition i'm gonna go sensing so if it's touching the ninja i'm gonna play the sound okay start the sound fairy dust so far it does is like a bling sound like that okay so and then we're gonna say um use the think and then we can put it here say gym obtain okay and we're gonna do it for one second and then after that we're going to hide the gym and and then we're gonna broadcast a message okay uh new message say gemma thing okay and then we can create a portal after that okay so and then we're gonna put this saying um if the crate is broken where's the crate broken yeah crate is broken i'm gonna go to uh go to the front layer okay and then we're gonna show and then when we start a new level a new level uh we are going to hide it so we're not going to show it and we're going to wait one second then we're going to go to crate so we're going to make sure the crate got set up first and then i'm going to go to create so the gym will go to wherever the crate set up so we don't need to worry about setting the gym okay so we only have to worry about setting the crate so whatever the position the crate goes to that is where the gym is gonna go okay all right so let's work on the portal so the portal is pretty simple too so portal right here so we have um when green black is clicked so for the portal we are going to hide it hi and then go to the front layer okay okay so after that when we say when i start as a new level uh we're going to hide this as well don't want to show it and then we say when we get the gym uh up gym obtain okay and then we're gonna put anywhere so let's say level one let's say our custom let's go back to level one let's say after the uh you break the crate we want to put the portal here we can make the portal show up and then let's say we moved it here and you can see the position 198 76 right something like that so you can add that so just same thing like we did for the crate kind of thing so you're going to say um if right we're going to use the operator i'll say equal and then go to level let's say level so level equal to one let's say we want to put it here and this position 189 76 then you can put that say go to 189.76 right so and then let's say we go to level two so let's say we go to level two and we want to put a different location so let's go to level two we'll switch the costume to level two so let's say level two i wanna put the portal right here so you can see is 194.85 right so in level 2 we're going to put negative 194 and then negative 85 right okay so now let's just check it out so let's start the game so you can see the crate is where we want it right so if i break this crate so you can see the gym so once i get the gym you see the portal is going to show up portal didn't show up correctly oh i think i made a mistake let me check okay i think i messed up i forgot to finish the code we only put the port away we haven't show it so we're gonna have to do that so show put that in and then with the portal we have different costumes so you can see that different costumes so we can make it turn so what we can do is we're gonna say um forever here and then inside of forever i'm going to use another repeat uh 24 times and then we're going to go next costume so because i did 24 time because this guy has 24 costume see okay all right so let's save it again let's try it out okay let's start so let's let me destroy the uh the reducer so you can see the portal goes where we want so once we go to the portals it goes to the next level so now the crate is on the top so let's say i want to destroy the the crate on the top so let me move up let's uh so i can also use the sword to destroy that so you can see the portal went down right so if i move here it goes to the third level but the third level i didn't set anything right that's why this flower's here right so also this one if i jump off right you can see it died right so there's a a little lag right you can see a little lag like he's kind of stuck here so because we use the use the uh sound right when when it die we play until done right so you don't want to do that you can say just say uh start sound right so that way it will have not no lag we don't have to wait for this sound to be done so this will be a little bit faster right so let's let's try again so so let me get back to the third level right okay so second level okay okay okay come on so now let's see see it died immediately right because we did not have to wait for the uh sound to be done you see that looks a little bit better so you can do that so this is pretty much right in so the spike i think is a very similar to the uh to the crate and all that you can do it yourself probably so at the very end you can make it win or maybe i can do the spike i think that one is clone so maybe i can show you guys for that so for the spike if you're just using only one spike at one level then it doesn't really matter you can do it like the crate but if you want to use a spike with like clone then like you can put multiple spiked and you have to do something with clone so if you want to do that then let me kind of show you real quick we'll make a block we're going to call it a place clone at okay so this one will place the clone wherever we want we're going to put a two variable okay we're going to call it x and y and then check this one run without refresh okay and this one what we're going to do is we're going to say go to i'll grab the x grab the y and then call the creator clone myself okay and then what we can do is when green flag is clicked we can hide it okay and then when we start a new level uh new level we're gonna delete the clone it's okay and then when i start as a clone and then i will show so when i start as a clone and then i will show okay okay all right and then uh when i start a new level so let's do that again so here we're going to go to front layer okay go to front layer and then we can say whatever level let's say uh level one let's go back to level one let's say we put some spike on the ground we can do that so we're gonna say let's say um i think in my original game i have like level seven or something like that so let's say we want to go let's say we want to put in level two or something so let's check allow level two what look little two looks like so let's say level two wanna put a spike over here right so what we can do is open the spike costume and move it around here right right so i think that's a little hard let's put the spike here let's say let's say for example we don't put a spike here but not necessary so let's say we put a spike here you can see the position of 42 or 53 right so you can say uh just like how we did earlier right so we're gonna say equal and use the level right level equal to 2 and then we're going to say um you can even make it flip upside down as well so you can say point in 90 point direction 90. okay if you want to go upside down let's say you have some some land on top you want to put upside down you can put this at negative 90. so flip around okay so i'm going to call the place clone at right and then we're going to put the sound right right position 42 and 50 negative 53 right so say 42 negative 53. let's say we want to put one more here like this right i mean this is gonna be probably impossible to jump over now either like fly a top but i'm just giving example then you can just say hey negative 55 negative 53 right so we're going to copy this put it over here so negative 55. so i'm using negative 53 just the same so that was same uh level right so you can do that right if you do that then let's say we start the game let's start it again so let's go to step two okay so once we go to step two you can see see there's two two clones here right so so in order to go through that we might have to fly over right right so and then we can fly it back so see there you go so you can you can do that so if you let's try if we get hit by the spike we should die as well so so let's go here so let's see we die right we jump on the spike we die so the depth is increasing so pretty simple so um i think this is pretty much it for the video so at the end right uh just at the very end you can just make sure that hey at the very end we can display the u1 right sprite so that way you know you don't have to um you don't have to continue the game so maybe i can just show you that code real quick for my original game just one second let me move the code over so as you can see um so if you want to put multiple a spike you can have it like like this right for my other game my original game at level seven has bike level a level nine okay and then over here you know the the the crate same thing right we just put it like this you know we have a level one uh level two right just wherever you wanna put the crate same thing and then the gym pretty much is the same the portal is like the crate so you can just set it at any any position you want right and then you just you know show it up so let's just go back to the original game so you see the original game i do not have matusa in the first level so that people will let them get used to it after they've done this so now so medusa is dying so got that and then jump into the portal you can see right let's go to the next stage next stage and go on so you can see you can also add some music right so add some music to your game and see this one look up that kill there so here i don't think i have any spike here in this one but you know so once you did that you can fly up here see you see the spike so this is level seven i think so you see level seven i have negative 90 so that flip the spike upside down and then you can slide over i don't think that i did i called the slide part from the original game but uh pretty just like slide let me see if i have it if i knock out i'll code it just one sec okay so let me go to the original game okay so let me go see this yeah i think i do have it so the slide does yeah it does have it see slide is there so i think it's fine okay so i hope you guys understand this game okay so at the very end uh where we win right you can just show the costume so when you say u1 right where we have the u1 costume i mean you want broadcast message from the main character so when we say you won you can just at the very end say hey you want show this that's it stop the game so i hope you guys enjoy the video thanks see you guys next time bye you
