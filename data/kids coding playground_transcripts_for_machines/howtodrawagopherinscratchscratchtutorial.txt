welcome back guys it's kids from playground here and today we're back for another video in scratch and today we're back with the how to draw series and um as you know we started a new series called how to draw and today i'll be teaching you how to draw this very uh this gopher here um if you don't know what a gopher is it's like a type of i think it's like some it's like a groundhog i think it's like it's like a rat i think it's a mammal it's a mammal definitely and it's like they live in prairies and they have like gopher holes to like come out and they like hide from snakes and stuff so anyways um this is a gopher and i'll be trying to teach you how to draw a gopher and let's start drawing so first we have to make the fill a dark brown color which is um maybe like so i got my color up here 0 57 51 and um we'll be using this to try to uh or attempt to draw the um the plump side of the body and you want to turn the thickness to five draw a circle do not hold shift guys i know mainly i told you guys hold shift but no do not hold shift because you want it to be like an oval shape to maybe look like a peanut or so something like that so i just hid my gopher so you could see it better and so there we have it put it over there and you need the reshape tool remember now oval guys and we're just going to flatten it out so reshape tool and we're going to make it look like it got rolled by a dough pin and make it uh extended out so there we have that and we make it go a little bit up and a little bit out like kind of like that like it's not it's like a serp it's like a oval it's like a lips a lip so it's just looks more like a lips so uh and then you put the sides in and there we have a peanut shell which is the body of the gopher and we're going to make the eyes next which is just a white pupil i mean just white just white just bright white so like that and then the outline is five or three i forgot and then you hold shift for this one and then you do that and then you around put it over there and then you have to uh put the black pupil pure blob no nevermind i have to make a new click uh pure black and then make a smaller point no fill i mean no line and then you put it on hold shift and you make this part of the eye and then you put a uh a white pupil inside the iris so yep there we got it and then we go shift and make i go shift and then do that it's almost impossible to see but once you put in the black it should be fine and you want to be a little bit smaller and there we have the pupil of the gopher and then you put the mouse hold down shift you get the mouse hold down shift so then you can group the whole thing shift and then you click on all three of those and then group and then ctrl c ctrl v and then you make the second i and then now you have to make the nose and the mouth so the nose is just an oval shape uh black we're gonna do the um actually the peach the peach color first so a hundred saturation 25 and then now we have that outline we don't need outline actually we do need outline we need a shade of and then you need three for that and then you go make yourself a oval do not hold down shift so it looks like rudolph and then you reshape the thing to a kind of like looks like a pea pod yeah yeah there we go see like that kind of shape a little bit down and then now you have to make the nose the button knows just a black just pure black and then you use the outline no outline and then you just make a nice nose right now the gopher looks like as a mustache but after when it finishes it won't look like it will so you make the two little teeth or just two rectangles that are white pure white and then you can make the outline you need to put on outline you make it black and you make the thing is three so if you want to be creative with your items you can actually make the teeth a yellow color but i'm not going to do that here like it has stained teeth or something so and then you have that you reshape it and then you pull it out and then you ctrl c ctrl v actually yes ctrl c ctrl v and then you put it right over there make the teeth touch and then you make it go back you can reshape the teeth to make it look crooked and like it can you can be creative with your ideas and uh like a little bit like that so because you know all teeth are not the same so you can make that and they will touch and then we touch them and make them go back so we have this mouse pointer hold down shift and then you group these two together and make them go all the way in the back and then click forward and then they will be right behind the mouth so now it's time to draw the ears so it's just a circle but we'll be using only half of the circle so and the outline is five and then you draw a circle like that and you put it in and then you um make and you make it go to the back and there we have it we have our ears and now you have to draw the inside but first yes we have to draw the inside appear black and then make it a small no outline make it a small semicircle so um we have that put it over here and there we have that and then we make it go back and then click on clicking forward until it goes over there and now we can group these two and then make a second ear so hold down shift and then ctrl c and then ctrl v you group it and then it's in the front right now so make it go you flip horizontal make it go back send them back and then you the other ear you send it back to and there we have our two little ears and now it's time to make the two little it's time to draw the hands which are the um which are just hands uh which are this color this peach color and you make the five for the thickness e long one and then you make a three for the thickness and then you click and then you make the five for the thickness and then you make the um hand which is just a circle a feet feet which is just a circle and then you draw a line right through it chop the line through it and yeah you just spin it with that thing you know how to use that right and then you reshape it to make it look like a s oval with the bend inside so like that like something a horseshoe would look like and then you have to extend your little make a line right through it chop a line right through the foot and then you make it you reshape the line a little bit so it looks like it's a line like curved line so yeah and now we just have to make this go to the back you hold down shift for both of those and then group it to the back group and then send them back and then you ctrl c ctrl v and then you have the other side of the flip horizontal place on the other side back and now we have to make the arms which is just a duplicate of the foot but just a small a lot smaller and the line inside their hands are just different and then yep we have that make it a little bit smaller and then make the line inside ungroup it and make the line inside delete it just delete it and then make a new line and cut it right through just a straight line no crooks no anything and now right here we have to make it now group it and now we can make it go to the back and you control c control v it and then you make the second arm perspective and you flip it horizontal and then we have both of the arms finished so that's our gopher guys feel free to pause anywhere you had trouble with and yeah um this looks so the first one that i made looked a lot better than whatever um i drew right here so i'm just going to delete it gone and now and we have this which is my original gopher and every single time i draw something i want to make a variant there we got futuristic we got lever and everything so yeah and um you can also make some costumes you want to be creative with your thinking you can just uh make like you know ghost you can make ghost you know be creative have fun you can make like ghost uh gopher gopher ghost gg and um yeah you can make a bunch of things on lot on that you think are really cool so it's just some art that you could do in your free time so yeah you can do whatever you want make it uneven do whatever you want you can make this mustard yellow and then you can make one the outline yellow you can be creative with your thinking there's millions of things that you can do with this uh thing and yeah you can just be creative with your thinking so so yeah uh i don't know what this is right now but okay uh and yeah we have mr gopher man so um we have our gopher here mr gopher all messed up but okay it's all fine just be creative and you can make your own animations with these things that we taught you how to draw like we have our penguin for example we have that we can you can make a thing like if you made futuristic penguin you can make the futuristic penguins beat the jurassic penguin you know or you can make penguin meets gopher and stuff like that you know have some fun with that and um please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below what else you want us to draw and anyways see you guys next time you
