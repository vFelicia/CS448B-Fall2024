welcome back guys this is kids from playground here and today we're back for another video and this is not the same as normal in any of our videos it's not scratch actually not python either it's grip patch scratch so if you didn't know gross batch made his own scratch and it's in his video and links in description you can go to this channel and you can and we have um the link for the scratch and this is not made by us we the chris patch made it so he's a very very good coder if you haven't seen any of his games you can actually see them uh they're really fun he's a yeah he's pretty he's really good uh so let's get into griff patch scratch um uh let's get there so so okay so this is the game that i made it's very similar to um so it's um so if it's a scratch game so kick that ball and then remember kids don't try this at home it's very dangerous don't dance in the middle of the road kicking buses and kicking balls so so as you can see it's just for you to bounce around the ball and it's kind of satisfying if you get a good kick or something where you knock down the tours or something it's very satisfying so anyways let's start it's already made a new project the first thing i'm going to do is ask you to share like and subscribe this video that's the first thing i'm going to ask you to do yeah do that please so anyways let's just name this um uh ball game so so there's a new physics extension over here so when you click this expansion where you normally get your translate text to speech or pen or any of these things um there's a new thing physics box 2d grip patch physics so you can get the physics and we're going to have the physics over here there's a bunch of physics and a bunch of new blocks so that's very cool so um i'm going to show you some things that i tried i mean like i didn't try everything so you guys can go to griff patch scratch and go there and like try anything you want there's a bunch of new physics blocks and uh so if you if you if you know if you know this place and you've been here before and you've tried all the physics box comment in the comment section below so yeah uh anyways let's start so first thing we're going to get so we're going to be the beach ball and the city watch bus let's get those two i'm also going to change the backdrop this colorful city that's the one that i used and i'm gonna get some sound on this thing i think i'm probably gonna get is uh the video game number one number two we're both gonna find the number one for this one because you know it's just good music and then go forever and play sound video game one until done next thing we're going to code up is the scratch cat so these are one of the things i experimented with so when the green flag is clicked there's a new physic block and i mean pointing direction 90 so you want to point on the right side and then i'm going to get the physics blocks so there's a physic block called go to x y in world i don't normally know what is it's basically is i think it's the same thing as this but you have this in world and you can change this a little bit so i have a coordinate so it's negative negative 60 and zero so there's also an enable thing so you can do it for everything so so you can enable for all sprites and they'll make everything have the physic and then normal and you need normal you can i don't know what precision does but you can you can try that out we've got the forever loop and then step simulation so there's a bunch of new blocks yeah like what i said so that's it for the scratch cat and i mean that's not it for the scratch cat there's still a little bit more code this is going to be a very simple project so when this when this sprite is clicked the most key part it'll push with force with force you can do any force you want you can do one bajillion i don't really care but you can if you want to and then you can just make the scratch must fall but i'm doing 75 and 45. make good numbers of that and next thing we're going to work on is the beach ball it's very simple as well and then when the green flag is clicked it will go to the position 75 0 and they'll go forever if then if that is touching sprite 1 which is the scratch cat you see over here um it'll spin with force to make the ball have like a little spin with force like like a little spin like if you ever play tennis and sometimes when you hit that ball it spins that's basically what the spin is and then change velocity let's change velocity by s x 10 and this by 20. and the city bus all you need for this is when the green flag is clicked and go to a position so that's all you need really simple i made it go to 129 x and negative 120 why i can do 130 actually that's better number and i'm a point in direction 90. so let's been so yeah this is basically the game so that ball went up with because i wanted to see the the differences from scratch so there's a bunch of different differences and griff patch coded a bunch more blocks in so that's very cool anyways please like share subscribe and remember we have a gaming channel links in the description so please up to that we might be posting some other videos i mean like i haven't been posting much because i like this i just like the uh how the griff patch made this app so really cool get that links in the description or you can go to griff patch's video and find that video and then get it in so it's really cool i love it so fun video overall i'd like to try something new so anyways bye
