hello and welcome back guys to the kids coding playground today we'll be doing a ninja platformer so here we have our ninja platformer 2 so this is going to be a walk through of the game so about two years ago my dad made a tutorial on the ninja platformer one and it was kind of buggy so here we have the second one so we've been working on this for a while and we made it improved it so now it's not as buggy anymore and we'll be probably launching a tutorial for it soon but in the meantime here we have our walkthrough for the game and if you would like to try the game uh yourself then you can click on the link in the description and we'll have the game there so basically just use arrow keys to move around and one two and three to use the sword kunai and glide so let's play the game so we have to break the box to get the gem to get into the portal so you know the portal so you can use the sword or kudai so we just play two we can kill the medusa then we destroy this we get a gem and we can just go into the portal just kill the medusa we can kill the destroy the box and then we get into here so here it's telling us to glide so we can glide up into here so we can destroy the flower thing so we can get to the portal so we can kill the medusa and then we get the portal so here we can destroy this look up the portal is going to spawn on top so you can glide up there and gliding is necessary sometimes so you can jump up glide to get up there slide using down arrow key this line destroy the box i mean the barrel slide back and then we're going to use the glide to get up to the top we're going to wait until the middle passes oh and as you can see we got hit so we died and we're going to fly up again and then we're going to go to 9 so we can take out the medusa to get to the portal next let's glide up here to destroy this barrel slide into and jump over the spikes destroy that and glide it to the top and then that's it that's pretty much the game destroy this and then go to the final portal and yeah that's pretty much it for our ninja platformer two this will be a new series probably coming out soon um it's much better much more improved than the first one so yeah it's pretty much it for this tutorial uh or a walkthrough thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share and subscribe and i'll see you guys in the next video
