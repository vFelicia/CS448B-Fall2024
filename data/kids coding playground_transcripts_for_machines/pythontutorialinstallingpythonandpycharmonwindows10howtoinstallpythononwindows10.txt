welcome back everyone to kids coding playground here and today we'll be doing a video for beginners on how to set up pycharm and python and so i i'll be showing you guys using the virtualbox because yesterday when we made the video on python i didn't show you guys how to like set up python pycharm stuff like that so we'll be using our virtualbox here uh to show you guys how we're gonna do it so we searched up downloading python and then we just have to click on one of these websites and you can just download it from there so now um sorry if we can't show you guys everything it's because the virtual box can't really cooperate with our camtasia recorder like every time you record the mouse doesn't go into the virtual box but anyways just click on the first link when you search up download python and then we're gonna have to click download python 3.10.1 right there so it gets it down the latest version i'm using windows so we're going to use that as you can see once you click the download button it will download as you can see uh it has been downloaded down here and so next we're going to go into downloading pycharm okay so next we're gonna install pycharm so all you have to do is just search on pycharm or google and then we're gonna install the one with jetbrains.com and pycharm the first one just click on that link and then next we'll get into the downloading part okay so once you've clicked on the link you just want to click on the download button in the top right and then it'll show you two options depending on what operating system you're using so now let's click the download button okay and next you have to select your operating system uh either windows mac or linux so if you're using any either mac or linux you have to click on those two tabs but right now we're using windows we're just going to download the community version which is the free one so we're just going to click download so right here we have our pie charm uh it's downloading as you can see in the bottom corner so yeah it's taking a little bit longer to download than the other one so let's just wait it out uh we'll we'll start recording when it's finished one eternity later okay so now after it's finished downloading um you're gonna have to open your windows explorer and then we have the two python and the uh pi charm first we're going to start with the python next you want to double click on the file python that one and then we're just going to click the first option that install now that includes id le and all that stuff so just click that one also don't forget to add the python 3.1 3.10 to the path so please check the box right there to make it work okay as you can see our python is now installing it'll take a little bit just wait so once it's finished we'll continue recording okay so now it's finished finally so now setup was successful so now you can just click the close button and then we'll verify that the python has been downloaded so click on your window if you're using windows um just search up cmd and open your command prompt and once you open the command prompt you can put a few scripts in there to check that the python is here like i showed in my last video um to check your version of python you just write py and then space dash v so as you can see python 3.10 has been installed so you can see it's showing up right there so now that you have pycharm in your uh your windows explorer just click on your pycharm file and then it'll show up a little setup thing and then we just have to complete the setup so just go ahead and click the next button once you click next just set it up to your default path and then after that just click the next button again go ahead and check all of these boxes once you have got to this part after you're done checking all them go ahead and click the next button after you've checked all the check boxes and click the next button just click the install button and then after you click install we'll see that will show that pycharm is there okay so after you've clicked the install button it'll start installing so you just have to wait a little bit it'll probably take a few minutes so just click the install button and once it's done we'll show you what to do next the next day okay and then once it's done uh installing pyrocharm um you can either reboot your computer now or you want to reboot it later so like you have to reboot your computer for to install pycharm so we're just going to manually reboot it later and we're going to click finish right here we have just rebooted our virtual box so after we reboot it we are going to show you that pycharm will show up so we're just going to wait for it to load a little bit okay there we go so now you can see the pie chart is on the screen so yeah that's how you install pycharm in python once it pycharm is installed just double click on the app and then after that you have to like check the terms and conditions just like click the check mark and then click continue so on this screen we're doing data sharing so you can either send it or you don't send it we're just gonna put not send either one would work so as you can see pycharm is now loading so we just have to wait a little bit for it to boot up and then we'll show you okay so now it has boot up we're gonna like to show you guys some like we're just gonna make a sample project show you that pie charm works so obviously to start a new project you're gonna click the new project button so we're just gonna go ahead and click on the new project button and show you a sample project project on pycharm so right here we just renamed our project to hello world so you can set the location of the project and then right here just is all the stuff and we're just going to make a
