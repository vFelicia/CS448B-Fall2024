so welcome back guys today we will be doing another scratch project this time we're gonna do a project on render shark and today we'll be learning about custom blocks what is a custom block you ask custom blocks is a reusable code block that once it is written it can be reused without repeating the same set of code anywhere so you don't have to keep on recoded repeating your code over and over again you can add many functions to a custom block okay so this is the project we will be making today as you can see we will be making a backdrop we'll be getting a shark shark sprite from the library okay so first of all we need to rename this project to render shark then we'll delete the scratch cat go to the sprite library and upload shark we'll be taking this one today okay first we have to set the size to 75 obviously cuz it's too big so first we'll always drag it when you click when you like click block then we need a forever loop so everything inside the loop repeats forever until you click the stop button then we'll need to add an extension which is the pen extension right here just click on this once and you'll get all the pen functions so first we want to erase all because we don't want extra stamps to be shown in the beginning so we need erase everything then we'll first really need to make a custom block then after that we'll we need to make a custom block you name it render shirt okay so we need to define render shop first so we need a show bring the show of the shark then we switch costume to shark one so it won't be shark B which is the other shorties and then we repeat 20 times which means everything inside here will repeat for 20 times so then we'll need the pen function stamp stamp is so like make layers of a sprite and then we'll change Y by 1 so it will repeatedly go down go up go up so it'll make an effect that looks like it's stamping so we'll need to get a change Y by 1 oops ok so now we will be needing the go to 0 0 because we want the clock the shark to stay in the middle then since we already have the set size to 75 I don't think we'll need that so then we'll need to do render shark which is the custom function then if you put this right here that means it will define this block of code right here and then we'll need it if then statement if then right arrow right arrow is clicked right arrow just click then it will change the degree' turn by 5 so it will just turn right by 5 if you click the right arrow then we'll need to duplicate this code we'll make we'll turn it to the left left arrow and turn it left five degrees so now so now we have the code so if we try it out then they'll stamp but I'll keep on repeatedly stamping if you want this to stop doing this you can go to my blocks and check the run screen without refresh so now when you press play it won't keep on stamping so finally we need to make a backdrop so we hit the backdrop button go to backdrops select like a blue color maybe turn up the saturation to a 100 it's like like a skyblue color go here we don't need outline this is going to make it look bad then we drag from here so yeah so I censored it now this is a blue background so now let's go back to the code back to shark okay so let's try it so as you can see when you hold down the right button it turns right when you turn the left slot it looks like a 3d figure because it's stamped a lot of times so finally you need to save your project and thank thank you for watching and see you guys next time and remember to subscribe like share and comment
