welcome back guys it's kids fighting around here and today we're back for another video of scratch so in this video we'll be working on the mother's day card so as you know that this is version two and that i will be doing the mother's day card because uh you know i haven't finished it completely i mean i i added some new things new concepts into the game so yeah that's why i made a version 2 of the mother's day game so mother's day is tomorrow as you know and also thank you for our one year anniversary we have made this a channel for one year now and has been one year and yeah today on may 8th so yeah thank you for all your support on the other videos so anyways i'm gonna show you the demo so first click on the green flag of course and then and play xylo one like the one i used in um in the um other one so i'm eating gummies right now so okay so i'm gonna change the flower color so you can change the flower color that's in the last video i also made the flower color that's my favorite flower message you can write to kcp um yeah and it'll show up there that was the last one and you can click done now some people might have seen my project already you click on the scissors and then you can move it all around if you do not click on it it cannot move and you can cut the flowers it'll go in the base these flowers on the left and the right go to the sides but this one goes in the front which makes it in front this is happy mother's day 231 to kcp the flower and these photos as you can see it's randomized flowers let me let me do this real quick done as you see it's randomized like last time i don't know what i got but i know it's randomized so we are at our old project i just renamed it right now mother's day card version 2 teaching so i just renamed that like right now so um yeah um we're gonna be working on this xylo one's playing this is the original one that's it this one was pretty plain so we decided to add the new version too so it's option i mean like i'd advise you to do version two because it'll be better and oh enhance your game so first we need one three place it around here um and we also need to rename it not rename but we need to add text on it so white text and we're going to name it done oopsies i put on caps lock done in handwriting done done done yeah done yeah so yeah and now we're gonna position this button real quick position this place position this button in the middle i don't even know why the buttons are never in the middle well i think that's for all sprites you put the done in the middle so there we got the done button and i just finished my gummy so i don't you won't hear any chewing noises so anyways we're gonna keep on going so the done button is what we need to make all the scissors and everything that can make the world better so we need the show and when this sprite is clicked broadcast new message go to garden and now we're gonna hide so there we go we have a button called done and now we gotta work on the scissors the garden flower the garden flower and the garden flower which are the three flowers that you cut so and the base so after we have to put all this in i'm pretty sure i have this in my backpack no wait hold on a second okay so but if you do not have it you can download this from this project i mean my last project the one i already shared or the um uh google drive so yeah we'll do that just some technical difficulties we got the scissors and everything in right here so we just got to click the upload sprite i have all this stuff so i'll be blurring this later so we have scissors one base sprite and yeah we have them two so yeah we have the vase and the scissors so now we're going to be working on the vase so the oh we have to make the backdrop so the backdrop is the um where it switches to the garden when you go to garden so it will be when i receive it'll switch costume to the first backdrop which is this clear blue backdrop and you gotta select the backdrop called garden rock after when you selected that you have to go to when i receive garden then it will switch costume to garden rock e so as you can see right now all these bases and stuff are shielding me but click done look we still have this on board let's change that later so we have um to work on the base and the scissors next so the vase should be fairly simple but we also have to put the sprites the flowers all the different costumes are the flowers inside all three of them so we just have to duplicate the flower three times i'm gonna work on hiding all these sprites when done is clicked so i'm just because it has a very small amounts of code so that's better if i do that first so when i receive go to garden it will hide already put that uh when the spray is clicked no wait oh this is the done button never mind uh the done button we have to go to the card and then we will start working up from there so card it will go to the back layer so show and then since if you're in the garden we added the show so it will show and then when i receive go to garden it will hide yes hide and after that it will go when i receive the back to card oh yeah back to carter's gone for now because we don't have that yet so we have to do show on this one there's already this on here so let's just put the sprite and put this so when the green flag is clicked i hate how it zooms out when you just i'll put the block in it'll show and then go to garden and it will hide and then now we're gonna work on the flower this flower yes the flower and then we're gonna do the when i when the green flag is clicked it will show so we have the flower and when i receive go to garden it will hide and then you just have to do this to basically all of the buttons so i'm just going to drag this over there yeah i'll just do that and i'm just going to drag this over there yeah and then we got everything we need here and then i just drag this over here oh yeah right there and then that's what we need over there so yeah go to garden let's right click yeah oh yeah and we also need to make this thing go to the front layer to show that when i receive go to garden yeah yeah this thing also needs that we don't we didn't need that never mind never mind let's look at the wrong thing and then the card color yep we have that and this thing go to garden let's just drag this right on we also already dragged two in okay so go to front layer and i'll show and it'll go to the guard backpack card we're not doing that yet so what i receive go to garden and we have everything yes and yeah you have to hide the variable so then when i receive because there's two variables there's the button and the variable and then you have to hide the variable so you can't see it anymore so hide bearable message and it will hide so we have that done and then that's all we need right now and yeah oh yeah and also this we also have to set message to mom let me show the variable because we were hiding it earlier so show and then it will show and now uh that's all we need okay so let's just work on the flowers and all the stuff next but let's look at this as you can see done all of it's gone except the vase and the scissors because i didn't do that and now we gotta put we're gonna put the duplicates of the flowers these flowers yes these flowers so we're gonna make three of these three of these and each of them can be named a different thing like in my original i think the name was uh garden flower one the first one garden flower one for the second one you guessed it garden flower two and the third one garden flower so yeah uh sort of reduced spaces uh because i'm so used to typing those things so anyways we're gonna put all of that together and yeah so yeah we have the garden flowers and now we're gonna work on garden flower one so when the green flag is clicked oh yeah we don't need any of this code not a single bit of these code or this one i'll delete all six blocks delete all six blocks now we can go back to garden flower one and as you can see when i drag this in and you need it to hide so you gotta go when i receive go to garden i'll point in direction 90 oh and i'll go to a position i have it at some coordinate negative 21 positive 10 negative 10 and then not positive 10 and um go to the front layer so that's what i have for this one go backwards one layer two one layer so it will be in front of the back it will be in front but not almost in front if you get what i mean like it will be behind the vase but in front and behind the scissors as well but like it's still in the front layer so then it'll switch costume to any of the pick randoms one to ten and then it will show it will go forever and you need it if then if then the scissors and mouse down touching scissors and mouse down so that means if the scissors is on it and when the mouse is down during it when you click this you hear this this this this that means it will that means it will cut so yeah we have mouse down and yeah we do that you know a change flower cut by minus one so let's just do this flower cut by minus one because you need three flowers and we're gonna delete um take that out for now and it'll start sound low loose so we have a sound low loose and now we're gonna glide to the tricky block of the tricky block plus 150. so the tricky block is this one we need two of those but first we need to go glide one second to x x position of the vase so they'll be on the base in the vase in the vase so we got to change the back you probably you guys probably get the deal by now base x position and duplicate and instead change this to y position oh yeah we also need the plus 150 like what i said yeah to make it go up a little bit because it will be directly in the center but if you do the plus 150 it'll be hanging out of the vase so that's what we have right here and we're going to stop this script so i forgot to get the code the scissors so i'll be doing that next so the scissors and we have the scissors so we're going to coat them with has some code so when the green flag is clicked it will set flower cut to three because there's three flowers and that's when you when you make the variable but i made the other flower first and then i'm going to go hide and then let's go to the garden and that's when he starts showing so go to negative 106 negative 100 and it'll wait 0.1 seconds so this weight is for if the scissors will go in the front layer because if you go to the back layer you'll be snipping the flowers from the back so you need the 0.1 second weight to so it will be in front of the flower and everything else so we have this and wait 0.1 seconds it will go to the front layer and it will show now we gotta wait until so just wait until uh let me click this real quick wait until we need to end so it's touching the mouse pointer and mouse is down which is if you click on it you can start dragging the scissors all around and we have that so it'll go forever so this has to be there to make this script work not the script but like this forever loop and now go to the mouse pointer you know if then if then the flower equals cut equals zero that means it will stop and go back to the back to the card so let's do this zero flower cut hide wait two seconds right test back to card and it'll stop this script so we have that done now we gotta work on the rest of the flowers so we're gonna test this so we have this so we have actually didn't put the show on the button so you need the show to the show on these two buttons i already did it for the message actually didn't put that in so show and make sure you guys do it too so i make sure you guys i'll put the show in and now you can change the flower color and now you're going to click the done and then you've got the scissors you can cut the flower and you'll go to the base on the top and now we got to go the base and then the rest of the flowers so let's go to the vase the vase um we have to code this and the vase is when the green flag is clicked it will go to this position it will hide when i receive go to garden oh show so we have to put a little bit more code than that and we'll go to front layer and then show so it'll go to in front of the flowers not the scissors because the scissors has the delay which means he'll go in front of the vase as well so it will go to front layer and show and there we got it and now we gotta work on the other flap the other garden flowers which i'm gonna look at right now so we're gonna do the left one first which is this one yeah it doesn't matter which one it is but let's just do this so the left one which basically has the same code as this so we're gonna drag all this code to the left flower we just need a little bit change and then that's all we need for this one so we're going to find the new position for this flower so we're going to drag it around here and then put this on and then we need to instead of going to the front layer we got to go to the back layer because it's behind the middle flower and switch costume yeah yeah we all got that but then now we need this x position of vase minus 20 because it's on the left side base minus 20 and the y is the same and stop we got to make this turn to the left by 15 degrees yeah right there and there we got it now we gotta work on the right flower so that was really quick and there we go we got this in this and now we gotta work on the right flower which is this one and then we have to first make the show and drag it somewhere in the right maybe here so and put this put this find my new position go to the back layer just go you don't need to make it go backwards any layers so let's put this back on and then this one we don't need to make it go back any layers too the left flower and the right layer flower and then so we have that and then we need to make um this turn the other way in degrees this way instead and instead of minus 20 we got a plus 20 because it's getting larger and we got this so we have this so i'm gonna try to do this so flower color message and look we have the scissors and i just cut that one so and then we can start this all over again we have to do back to the card so we need to do that so as you can see i made that but we don't see our car so we gotta make it go back to the car so we gotta put the original things like the card when i receive back to card then it will show and now i'm just going to put this for basically everything except the buttons this this and that's it so let's just check if i have that back to card back to card back to card so there we have it oh i did i don't think i checked the hearts no i did back to cart and look so let's look at this project okay so as you can see i'm going to go snip snip snip so in this card will show up we're going to do back to card for the message like what who you want to send it to so we have this and when i receive back to car then it will show variable we didn't need that a show variable uh message so you have that and there we have it our project so let's do this i'm going to move the left flower out because it looks too close to the scissors as you can see it's not too close but if you have a different variant of a flower it will be a little bit too close to the flower so i'm gonna move it around up there around the garden rock so yeah let's change the position to 190 take that out put that in drag it back down and there we have it the thing the mother's day card so i'm gonna try to design my card so flower color i really like this one i made and yeah and then card color i really my favorite color is blue but of these i think red is my second so i'm going to take red and then message to kcp one year so kcp one year yeah that's where i'm sending the car and then done now to cut the flowers click on the scissors and there we have it we have the vase and it says to kcp one year happy mother's day 21 we have the hearts and we have the flowers so that's basically all we had all we had to do in 27 minutes so anyways us a like share subscribe and comment and who you're gonna send this to i mean like it could it could be uh father's day and you could change this mother's day to father's day or something but just comment in the comment section below uh who you're gonna send this card to oh yeah we also have a father's day
