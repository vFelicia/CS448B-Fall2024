welcome back guys it's kids quitting playground here and today we're back for another video and this is rock blaster 1.2 so this is my old game rock blaster so um yeah all these loves favorites all these remixes and views thank you for giving me 7854 views 146 remixes 76 favorites and 95 likes so thank you for all your support on this video uh just like all like all these people so thank you for doing this so in this in in this game we're gonna add the rocks going the speed because i made the speed for all all sprites only so this thing i made it all sprites only so they should be for this sprite only and that's what i did wrong so this was before uh no for all this sprite only not for all so yeah so that's what i did wrong for the rocks and yeah now this variable is over here and then spaceship we have um uh score no lives now so lives we are going to add lives actually so in this project we're going to add lives so because people are requesting for lives because they think the game's too hard maybe because one shot kill and then for the laser in the end of the game when you die or something uh the laser just you can keep on shooting it if you click space so as you can see look bam bam bam and there's no rocks and you're already dead so we're gonna change that so these so this is our original game so i'm gonna show you my original game so so we already changed the speed because yeah we already have the speed done and then but the we're gonna die so you know we didn't have live stream and it says will breathe so yeah that's what we have so i'm going to make a new project and start this game all over to a fresh start so save as a copy and then now i have to see my copy instead change it to 1.2 so this is rock blaster 1.2 um it's going to be more enhanced version but i doubt it's gonna get more views than the original one because original is always better than copy so because original always better than spinoffs so yeah um we're gonna start with the rocks so we're gonna add the speed first we're we're gonna add a sh uh we're gonna delete this show we may not need that show here and then game over we could keep we are going to keep that yeah when i start as a clone go to this this but this time we need a show and then we have to set speed we already done the speed so speed yeah i'm going to show this yeah we already done speed so yeah just change it to for this sprite only not yet yeah for this right only and just name it like speed so that's what uh you're supposed to do and yeah so that's all you have to do and then instead of a broadcast message here because we have lives now we have to do forever instead of vodka forever so over here above the repeat until let's first just clear this i'll put this on the side first and see what we need and what we don't need so i'm gonna code this new script so if then touching rocket ship then hide and broadcast hit spaceship so we have to oh yeah we also have to put this in i'm gonna put this first and broadcast hit spaceship because we have wives now so he's way different and then um i always get confused from the hit spaceship and wait we need to wait instead of broadcast just regular just a weight and then um we can this is uh hit spaceship and then this is a go to and then i already have at the position i'm just gonna drag this in so after the broadcast just follow my lead i'll just try to go slow and then click this block show and then put it under go to and then we have to change x by speed i i actually could take this whole block in and put out what i get out so i actually don't need that i'm gonna put change x of speed first and then uh i'm pretty sure this is the same code yeah and this is the same code so we don't have to change this because this is the one this is the score so we obviously do not have to change this and this is the rocks position so yeah we don't need to change this either and then we can just throw this away and then now we have to work on the rocket ship so the rocket ship has a little bit more code than normal not that much so variables we gotta make live which is lives because multiple so um yeah we have that set score to zero and set lives to five you can set it to one you can set it a million i don't care what you set it to but i'm gonna set it to five because it's probably the most relevant so in those set size of 50 point in direction 180 180 180 180 um and forever touching forever you just don't you don't even need touching rocks because it doesn't have to wait you don't need this so yeah touching the rocks yeah so we don't need this anymore because you're not gonna die from one hit one kill so now we need a forever and then put that in and then we have game over we have to keep that and then when i receive hit spaceship so we made that variable i mean broadcast message uh then change live by 1 so it will lose a life every time it gets hit by a rock or you can make it 100 lives lost or something i don't care and then you need it if then so over here drag this over here if then you need to or if then the lives is less than zero then you'll lose so i'm gonna take this lives is less than zero or equal to zero because you could die from five rocks exactly or you can die from six rocks so yeah let's put this in yeah so that looks fine and then broadcast game over yeah broadcast uh game over yeah not hit spaceship sorry and then after that laser time so lasers also have a bug game over i don't think they have a bug as this uh yeah game over is always the same because it's always game over when you die so anyways let's do this so um we have some code left and first we have to so ah then we have to add something to this so i'm going to delete this real quick because we do not need this and after that we need to go forever zoom in a little bit because i don't think you guys can see that uh if then so if then um the key space is pressed which is yeah that's the key space so if that's pressed then it will wait until not keep spaces pressed so wait until where's that block wait until so this is for that you cannot spam the space key so if you just hold it go like something like that so if you add this code it will not spam it not spam it so key space pressed it will create clone of myself so we have all of this code done and yeah we're good because on the old code we did one space key espresso create clone of myself which you can spam so um we decided to make this so after because of that you can also shoot because the game is over and we want to keep the code the weight of the a different way because um people notice that when you die they'll just you can still hold the key space for us and you can shoot after when you die so we changed this in this um one so yeah and then yeah let's see how our project is first of all we'll screen it so the rocks are moving at a different momentum so and look the lives are going down so as you can see you can't even spare anymore see more good i'm clicking it do not hear this do you not hear this so uh that's what we have so you cannot spam afterwards so um yeah i'm gonna try to get some score so we have to kill the rocks so they're moving a different momentum so they were not moving in a different momentum on my nine month one so that one my old one my old project so they were not moving at a different momentum so some are slow some are quick some of the speed of sound all different so great and we also added the um live so you can just die now you don't get one shot killed so that's really annoying if you do so that's why we decided and you cannot spam or or do the thing after when you die so yeah great so i'm going to show you the code for all the sprites i have so let's just zoom in a little bit no no one more out yeah yeah you guys can see that right so um i'm going to make this smaller so then you guys can see that better so if you do this um yeah feel free to pause whenever you need to so i'm just reviewing over the code so you can also zoom into your youtube youtube video so yeah and then the rocket ship this is what we have so feel free to pause laser i'm trying to move these together so that you guys can see it better so look laser laser feel free to pause game over we didn't work with the game over today but you can change that i know if you didn't add it in the last video so anyways so in the backdrop i could also add some music because music is always better we always add music and sounds for our thing cause sound so i'm gonna get a sound i don't know which one i should get probably um a good one like yeah this isn't space space i'm gonna take dance space i like this one so let's put this forever i think it's not loud enough and i i think it's fine actually so play sand dance face until so i just enhanced the game a little so i'm not spamming actually flicking it up so you can't spam look i'm holding down the space key like you cannot spam so you can try that for yourself so yeah yeah so and then i can so nice so this is what we have for our game so you can check this out because i'm going to share this uh so please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below whatever you want to comment i don't care about your comment unless if it's a comment because yeah why not you can comment uh you can comment look at this game or something and
