welcome back guys it's kids coming playground here and today we're back for another video of scratch and today we are doing an earth day project some of you might have already seen that on my profile um uh because i already shared the project so you guys probably seen that but today i'll be teaching you how to make the game so yeah let's get started some music april 22nd is birthday if you did not know then please help me clean up some trash in the ocean and it'll just grow larger and guys i'm eating something right now so yeah so there's a little diver he's collecting the trash soda cans there's a trap turtle save the turtles save the trees save the earth we should always save the earth because that's where we live and earth is important so look i saved the fish now the portal opened and now i can enter it look i'm gonna get the bag let me get the soda can real of course so do your part clean up them now on the third level this going to be the last level so sort of can that's normal oh yeah and sometimes you can get stuck i couldn't do anything about it so the diver's legs are a little bit long so you can not you'll get stuck so the only way to get unstuck is click r to reset so sorry guys but i couldn't figure out anything because the diver has really big flippers and if you didn't have flippers or swim this would be really way better you can cut off the flippers if you want but i mean like he's not a diver anymore so it says you did a great job thank you for your help and then that'll be the end of this game so let's get started so let's get started so first we got a scratch cap um so we have to do our cat our earth our maze our bag everything so i'm gonna do the cat so when the green flag is clicked i'll show and say april 22nd is earth day and then so i'll also say we need to do our part to help and keep our earth clean we have to keep our earth clean guys do your part help the world out so and we have one last thing that you have to say sorry i'm still eating my gummies guys so sorry next thing i'll say please help me to clean up some of the trash in the ocean all right so now we can finally code because i'm done eating my gummies so yeah broadcast zoom in and then this zoom in will do a lot it's the start of the chain so we have to get our earth i'm gonna drag both of these earth you'll find out why we need both we don't need both but like i'm just going to show you uh so now there's two earths in a parallel universe so the earth this is the baby earth which is the regular earth we're going to work we'll not not work with but i'm going to demonstrate so when you duplicate it you can make one each every larger a little bit larger because that's what we did to make the zoom in so that's basically what we did to go into the ocean so yeah and we can just keep on doing that you get the point or you can just go on google drive and download everything we have so right now i'm making the earth larger and larger you have to center it so then it will stay in the center and will not go off off the thing so so this is basically what we have five earths and then this one we made 10 earths and it'll slowly get larger and then number 10 is just big so as you can see that's number 10 so you should basically get the point right if you zoom in and that's important maze so you can customize your own mazes it's pretty fun you can drag like you can just customize your own mesis i mean people can be creative and make their own mazes all around so that's great so you gotta use the rectangular blocks these and then you gotta drag them like that and then you get a piece so or you can drag it like that which would be impossible to get to but that's fine uh so yeah we have that and then there is the maze so we need the bag the turtle the fish and the soda can and the um and the portal and uh they already dragged the fish i think maybe it's still loading on it and then we need the still saving and then we need the soda can and then we need the portal and then we need the bottle so we have seven spur no no it's not nine sprites now we need to continue on the earth so zoom in is when you zoom in into the earth so then you can get started on the real project so when the green flag is clicked it will show then we'll switch costume to earth which is the first costume it will go to zero zero and then when i receive zoom in it'll repeat 10 times oh wait 0.1 seconds one and uh switch costume any next costume and then broadcast and ocean and this is where the big broadcast is because this is where everything starts broadcast oh an ocean i wrote broadcast so an ocean so now we gotta go back to the cat and make it hide so and then it'll hide and then now michelle april 22nd is earth day we need to do our part and help and they'll zoom in into the earth and then you'll see the diver and everything so now so we need to hide after that sorry i didn't put that and now we can get started on the maze the and basically everything else so when the green oh we gotta get the diver sorry that is the main thing we have here diver diver diver two and then we have the maze so when the green flag is clicked it'll go to zero zero and it will switch costume to costume one which is the first level basically because um costly one no hide it will when i receive an ocean it will show of course because it will show if it's in the ocean and then you need to so we're going to work on the diver next because the diver is the most important and so we have when the green flag is clicked it'll set level to one so we're going to make a new variable level level 11. and now we have to do set level to one first level is always home one so we have to name this happy earth day i forgot to name it and then i'll go to x 170 negative 170 and now the x is 135. why why why and the x is what negative 170. it'll point in direction 90 and it will hide so that's the basically the diver code except we have a big chunk for the left arrow and right arrow keys oh so um this is to get the diver over there i'm just changing the size to 40 real quick just to get the diver all the way over here so when i receive in ocean it will go to that position the point of direction 90 of course it'll show it'll go forever so this is for the left arrow right arrow type of thing and then you need an if then statement touching the color i'll go show this real quick if it's touching the color then i'll switch to the next level uh eyedropper yellow stop save now and then so if you did not notice from my demo when you collect all the trash it will be yellow but if you don't it's going to be black so that's how it is and then you have the diver so touching the color yellow it will hide it'll broadcast next level it will stop this script and then we need to if then all the arrows so this will take quite a while so if then the up arrow is clicked pressed same thing uh then it will be if then the touching if then touching i gotta make the backdrop if then touching the color you gotta make the backdrop you gotta make the backdrop for the so um i'm gonna make the backdrop i actually did not need the backdrop right now so you need the if then touching color this is the best i can do to prevent this then it will change y by minus 10. and then so now we need to do set rotation style to all around because one of them on the left side is left right so it won't flip over so you need some rotation style to all around a point in direction zero and it'll move ten steps it will wait 0.1 seconds so we got the up arrow and now we can make the down arrow oopsies which is right under the up arrow but instill in the forever loop so instead now you gotta go down arrow and then instead you gotta change y by ten that's pretty obvious and then you gotta set rotations out all around still and then this point direction is 180 so it'll be like that and then it'll move 10 steps and wait 0.1 seconds left arrow is way different but i'm just going to duplicate it so then it will feel it's almost the same a little bit different so it says x so left arrow change x by 10 and the set rotation style to left right so it will not flip around because if you did left left side it'll be a back stroke so you want it freestyle you know point direction negative 90 and move 10 steps and wait 0.1 seconds okay so now we're going to do the right arrow which is pretty much the same as the left arrow just a tinge difference and it'll change x by minus 10 sub rotation styles are all around point in direction 90 and then there you got it right arrow so now i'm gonna make the backdrop all around left and left and right is all okay but now i'm gonna make the backdrop so just a shade of blue uh a shade of blue so you can just make a gigantic square because that's and bitmap it's not the best so then you need to do this and then you gotta go like that doesn't matter if there's a blackout line you won't be able to see it anyways so now we got that covered now i'm gonna make the bag so in my original game i had a double backdrop i just switched the the first backdrop so i think that's fine you don't really need it backdrops don't really matter unless if it's like an animation plot or something so then so i'm going to demo the game for you so so i'm gonna put that back in wait a second so i'm gonna broadcast zoom in so there we go we have the diver moving and still can get stuck so i think there is a way out of this so this is i would do the reset code because there's nothing that i can possibly do about this if you can find a solution you guys can come in the comment section below and see what you can do and then we can get off of that idea and make our original a little bit more better i mean i it's still not it's still i still can't do it like i still can't put it i can't i still can't get him out of this maze but that is absolutely fine uh we do have a redo button that's the best i can do for this one so yeah now we have to do we're almost done with the diver we'll do the rest later so you need r to reset so and click on look we reset it chuck r i'm gonna move a little bit or get stuck in the wall what am i gonna do r so that's all we have for now and i'm gonna also put back these lines so then the cat can say something and then now we have to work on the bag so the bag we have to work on so when the green flag is clicked it will hide oopsies too close and then when i receive an ocean then it will go if then level one if you make your level one different it could end up in a different spot because of the way it's positioned so if then level equals one you'll go to this position i have already so the back has to go to one i mean it's fine but you know just here let's just put it here it's close enough there's only three digits on the x away and four digits in the y so and then the um duplicate nope nope not that on level two it's going to be a way different story than level one so on level two it will be a different position so look level two is different level three is different so this is where level two is you put it anywhere you want so i'm putting it over there i'm pretty sure the original is over there if i'm not mistaken so and then level three it's a whole different story as well as level two so it can be over there but i'm gonna put the same coordinate so it will work all level 3 negative 173 positive no negative 114 and it'll show e and then it will go forever we're almost done uh bear with me on the turtle the fish the cannon the bottle it's actually not even that far because we all we have to do is just change just a little bit and then we'll be done so touching diver two oopsies dive into then it will hide and it will change items to pick up by minus one so we have items to pick up to change items to pick up by minus one you know stop the script so we gotta make the items to pick up five but first we have to put all of this into here make the items to pick up five on each level so i'm gonna work on the maze so we can do the when i receive in next level then i will so the diver broadcasts it right here then i will change level by minus one i mean plus one and i will go if then else if then the level equals four no four if the level if four is greater than level which means it is level four which is the end three i mean it's greater than three which is basically level four it'll set items to pick up so um this is on level three and this is on level four now so there's one two three right here and this is level four and i'll set items to pick up to five in the beginning of all the levels next costume and it will broadcast an ocean and wait you know broadcast cleanup finished that's all right yeah i think i did and then it will goes clean up finished and then that means it will hide this thing so clean up finished then it will hide and you basically got to do this for all of them so on the diver on the bag on the maze itself it already has it on the turtle on the fish on the sorry on the can on the water bottle and on the exit so we have it all so on the diver let it go wow it didn't even save you didn't even put it in so i'm going to put it back in the diver i remember putting it in the diver right there and then let's see let's see now just zoom out so i can see in the bag right in the turtle and the fish in the bottom can in the bottle and the exit so we have it all and then now we gotta work on the bag which are we done we are done with the bag so these three scripts so now we just have to do this and put them in different spots this this this so now let's work on the turtle so let's see where this will go so we're going to move this to the exit as well and now i'm going to work on the turtle so you also need this on all of them this on all of them and this so i already put it there so when the green fla i mean the thing is negative 184 then the y is negative 106. so sorry guys i'm on the turtle so that means this is 142 this is 122 150 30 159 seven so we have that so you can just adjust and move wherever you want but these are my old coordinates i had from my old game so this is why i'm using these precisely numbers now fish level one is 153 level negative 122 negative 118 negative 60 76 negative 123. now the can uh so let's move that move that negative 106 negative 43. that's for the can 173 102 negative 184 and five so yeah now we have to work on the bottle so the bottle is negative 23 y negative 107 negative 23 negative 107. 150 108 so that's for the bottle and now the exit so this is remember you don't have to have the precise numbers as me but you can do that if you want to 190 40 190 negative 121 negative 5 or negative 123 so that is it so we need the forever you need the if then items to pick up equals zero then it will switch costume to costume too and then there we go and back to the earth and then the cat and then we will end this so if there's no more um so if the items would pick up equals zero then i'll switch to the costume costume two which is basically the yellow one and not the black one so we have that and then now we gotta switch back to earth in the cat so so i changed the back so it'll be the same as the old coordinates so now we gotta go back to the earth so when it is cleaned up then it will switch costume to number 10. it'll show it will repeat 10 times so it will just shrink it'll wait 0.1 seconds and it'll switch costume to costume number minus one so go backwards basically um so we need the costume number minus one so we'll go backwards and then now we'll broadcast thank you we're so close to be finished so this cat is when i receive you and it will say show say you did a great job job thank you for your your help and then for four seconds and then now it will stop all first we have to make the music so the music is when the green flag is clicked the switch costume to back draw oh we don't have backdrop one that's so the other one so we have a backdrop one but not a backdrop too so that's still blue so then we'll play emotional piano so we'll put that i'm gonna set the volume to 25 real quick and then when i receive in the ocean it's the same thing so we already have one backstroke so you can make two if you want to but let's check out our game sorry i like one on each side so burrito so you see the items of pickup is working getting the turtle save the turtles save the fish save the water bottles save the world so you can see it's working so oh oh yeah one more thing i forgot to do the exit so it will turn black when it's not completely finished so we need a switch costume to costume one right over here and then that should be great so as you can see this is this new scripted code we added the switch comes from the costume one so i'll see you when i finish what i just finished so i'm gonna add it in the diver to set the items to pick up back to one fives because it keeps on going negative one for some reason and i did the exact same code as the last one uh and somehow the last one is getting set for some apparent reason i do not know why and for some reason this one isn't getting set even if i don't even put it but the other one is not even getting set and i didn't even put it so now it's working so yeah so as you can see um this is the let's see like the portals black i fixed that and look i'm stuck so let's redo and then we need to again and then now we need to get the water bottle and now we gotta get the fish he's stuck in some net gatorade bottle so now we gotta get in and then look we have level two i honestly hate getting the soda can i made some parf we got it and the last level it's been 35 minutes and 26 seconds so almost 40 minutes i'm about to beat the game so i'm going to show you the whole game for you guys to see and we are done it took 40 minutes but like the globe is going back you did a great job thank you for your help and that is the end of the game so please like share subscribe and comment if you can fix the glitch on the diver getting stuck in the walls if you can please comment please please please please comment so we can fix it and everything will be in the google drive so see you guys and happy earth day you
