so welcome back guys it's kids coding playground here today we're back for another video called happy diwali happy diwali to all viewers who celebrate this holiday is a festival of lights mainly celebrated by hindus the festival usually lasts five days and celebrated between midoctober and midnovember the wall diwali's symbolizes the spiritual victory of light over darkness good over evil knowledge over ignorance so i um i'm not indian so i do not know much about diwali so uh i have some friends that are uh are indian so they celebrate diwali so um yeah so we got all this in wikipedia and the wiki of diwali so um and yesterday we were watching a movie and there's like so much fireworks going on we couldn't even hear anything and that was pretty cool they were going on like 11 until 11. so yeah let's just start happy diwali we'll be learning these following concepts from scratch pen wait until broadcast messages control sprite with mouse and sensing blocks shout out here are some viewers who would like to give shout out to coquelin sentiment mo can you make an indian game diwali is coming and i'm in here yeah so here it is right here and we had a community post for 2k subs thank you everyone that's subscribing to our channel and if you're not subscribed already please subscribe and you can always change your mind later subscribing is a free way to support the channel so uh you can either click yes or no or i'm not sure zero percent is i'm not sure no and yes so i forgot to click on read more before i took the screenshot so um uh it's about python and if you wanted to learn python so we will be posting python videos and trinket.yo but um python is a little bit harder and advanced and yeah people also pick no i'm not ready and uh we'll still be posting scratch videos we haven't been posting mainly now because of school work and there's a lot going on on the school work so yeah so i we're posting like once or twice a week so now it's like once or twice so yes that's a great idea no i don't think it's ready so we'll be posting more scratch games are really advanced so yeah because you guys seem to like python better than scratch and somebody wrote andrea la shiva best scratch video yeah thank you for that comment and yeah uh blubbus bella bubbus were you born with a special advance in intelligence no i actually was not born with that yeah we're just going kids so yeah so i'm gonna demo the game so i'm gonna full screen this and let's say i'm on the game so it has some music and so you click on the diwali candle and it'll follow your mouse so wherever you go it'll just one set of rockets it says happy devol so that's basically our game so we are going to start now so new project so yeah we don't need the sprite cat the cat sprite and i do have things in my backpack which is the diwali candle which is um just the candle because you know there isn't a candle in scratch so um there's a diwali candle i got on online so we have everything in the google drive so we can um put that all inside the google drive and remember to download it with your main account not the school account or else it's gonna block the images so you need it with your main account and also before i start please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below for what else content you want let's drag everything else inside rocket and we have something flash the sparkles and we can pick the backdrop it's right over here i think it's called the night city and we also can drag this costume inside the backdrop so it has two costumes flash just whenever you blow up the rocket it's uh it's gonna flash and i i don't know why i have that back backpack but uh this was the flash so it's already named flash that's probably why we did that so anyways um let's start so firstly i mean first i need the um diwali candle so let's code the divali candle so when the green flag is clicked so you need the pen because the pen is what makes the thing so if you've never seen the makes the flash it erases all it meant because we're gonna race and then if if you haven't seen our july 4th firework game you can literally see that in our video so please watch that video and like it too yeah like it and share it and also yeah you just have to um please just watch that because we're also using rockets but i think the rockets are a little bit different i think they're actually the same i'm not sure but you can go there right now and just um watch that video so when the green flag is clicked erase all it'll go to the middle because everything wants to go to the middle and it'll say click on the candle then move the candle to light the rockets for three seconds you can make it long if you read slow or shorter if you read quick so yeah and then when the green flag is clicked well wait two seconds i'll wait until let's wait until right there wait until you need two ands and and and so if you put an end in the end it'll be three and and and if you put and and and and and together just two ends then it will have three slots so um if the rocket rocket one lit so you gotta make a new variable called rocket one lit because there's three rockets as you can see in our project um we demoed so equals y and the rocket lit 2 at the rocket with 2 also equals y and yeah you just need rocket lit three two as expected rocket rocket lit three i'm pretty sure it's about that correct right rocket let the rocket one light i put this okay so we can just change this so um we can delete this block we can rename this rename the variable rocket lit 2 to rocket to lit because we already have one lit for that one so it's a rocket to lit and then you can also rename this random variable sorry about that rocket three lit and then we could just duplicate this and change this to rocket 3. and then i'll broadcast a message and wait uh fire rockets and broadcast record broadcast this time happy da volley and stop the script also when the sprite is clean then it will go to forever go to mouse pointer and when i receive happy diwali then it will stop all the scripts in this spread so we are almost done not almost done but we're done with the diwali candle now let's work on the so i'm going to show you how to draw a rocket if you don't want to take hours in the google drive or download one from online so we actually drew this one so it's just pretty simple you just need a triangle you say reshape a square or a circle and get a rectangle which is just a square make a few lines on it four then get a curved line and one of the rectangles that are on brown so i'm going to show you right now so i'm going to change the outline to no outline so i'm going so you can click the shift key so it will make a perfect square or a line and um we can reshape it this is the reshape tool um so you just need delete and you can make a triangle really simple and you can just use the pointer and move it a little bit and you made the top of a firework so basically that's how you draw the top and then you just need a rectangle which is orange orange rectangle with lines on it so i meant um yellow a rectangle not orange orange rectangle so you're gonna need to make a perfect rectangle and put it in the back and make few lines and i know my art isn't that good right now so um because this one looks better my original one so yeah so you just need a brown colored back that's like a really long rectangle and you can put that in the back so and then you also need some lines so outline is like blue let's make the thickness higher to five and change the brightness and color a little bit and make some cool lines across i mean that's optional but it looks just cool so i'm done with the lines for them and then you can make the curved line just need to reshape a regular line with the curved line so you can just draw a regular line then reshape it just a little bit so i made i made the detail a little bit different than the last one i think that's what i did but um just add it on and it looks pretty good sorry about that so flip horizontal and add it on right over there so you can also um add uh some other things some other details if you want and also you can also you have to make another costume which is the burn costume so just duplicate that costume and as you can see in costume 2 it has the little burn effect so you can make that burn effect if you want well you might have to to show that how how you how you're supposed to do it so to make the burn effect click shift and make like a little triangle um thingy that looks like a burn so you don't have to click shift just make it like random random random because it just looks like a burn so burns are supposed to look random i guess it's fire so that's why so you just have to click on that and add it on and that's how you make a second costume so as you can see that's how you make the costumes so let's just delete these two and let's get started on the tutorial so we're already done with the divali um candle so let's work on the rocket so when the green flag is clicked it will set rocket lit rocket one lit to end because it won't be burned unless the diwali candle touches it and it will go to i have a coordinate already put for me so it's a negative 150 x and a hundred y and also i'll switch costume to costume one and it will show and also i'll go forever and if then if then so if then it's touching the divali candle then it'll switch costume the costume two set rocket lit to y set rocket one lit to y not rocket two lit or rocket three lit because it's gonna rot unlike the other rockets so rocket one lit to one and stop the screen inside not outside because you can't put it outside of forever loot not inside here but inside here so stop this script because you don't want to stop it all or also stop everything else so we have to do when i receive fire rockets oh wait one second will start sounding gum and it'll glide one second so i think we put this inside so you just need gong um it's inside the sprite library i mean the sound library so glide one second to negative 150 why a hundred and it will hide and brought oh yeah this one's supposed to be negative 100 sorry about that and hide in a broadcast bang so we we have to make the other rockets so i think this video is taking a long time so we will finish a little bit more of this so we can just duplicate this rocket and change a little bit stuff so rocket to lit and set it to n rocket to lit to y and uh we have to change the position to zero and negative 100 that's correct and glide one second to zero and a hundred and then instead so we have to make it 1.5 seconds because our plan is to make it go like pew pew and then pew so that's that's why we're doing this so now we can duplicate this and we also have to make bang too sorry about that so we could new message bang two so and then rocket three um rocket three lit rocket three lit and then you gotta change the position uh to 150 x so that's positive and negative 100 and then glide to 150 and wait two seconds and a hundred y and broadcast bang three so that's basically all we have for this code and then we get started and show you so click on the candle then move the candle to light the rocket so right here light light light so we didn't put the sparkle effect on all of that yet but i did put the sparkles here so we'll see you in the next part so we're gonna make the sparkles next and the happy diwali so that's in this right library and um please like share subscribe and comment in
