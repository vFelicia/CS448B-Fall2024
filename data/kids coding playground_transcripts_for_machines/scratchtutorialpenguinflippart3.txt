all right guys welcome back to the channel so uh this will be the last tutorial uh for the penguin flip game if you have not done the uh the the first one in the second one so i suggest you to do that first so after you work on the first one and the second one you can work on this last one this is the last uh and final change to the penguin game what we are going to make is we gonna make a fish that will fly up and down in here between the ice block and the iceberg here and the penguin can jump over while the fish is up in the air he can catch it if you catch it then you get some extra points so this is what we're going to be working on today all right let's get started so today so we're gonna add a fish first so we'll look for fish here so we'll type fish so we can take this fish actually this fish actually have a couple of different costumes we are going to use the uh costume number three here i mean this looks like he has some wings that he could fly up in the air so we'll be using this fish all right so we'll set up the gear the fish right now so uh we'll go back to the coal we'll drag in the event when start we always did that when the green flag is clicked we'll set the fish around 50 so this fish is a little too big make it fifty percent and then we will point in direction um point in direction zero meaning that the fish will be pointing up so the fish will be rotated and then pointing up and if i run this you can see the fish is pointing up right that's how it will look like so you see the fish is pointing up with these two coat so next i will say hi so we don't want to show the fish when the game begin okay and we have to define a new uh function for the fish so what this do function we can use it um to uh to call the uh um different block we put different blocks in here and then we can make a call later on so we're gonna fish jump so this function is called fish jump so uh what we do is we will make the fish jump up into the air and then come right back down so we will need a loop here so repeat uh 20 times then we have to go into here say move random step basically we want to kind of make the fish kind of go higher or slower and we can use a uh operator here let's say pick a random we'll put 10 to let's say 15 steps and then we will add this weight condition here 0.1 so kind of make the fish slow down a bit when it's moving up then we have to change the direction again we want to point to 180 meaning the the fish is going back down so i will point downward so we'll repeat it again duplicate this code put this over here so now uh we'll do the same thing right so that it jumped all the way up into the air and then it turned around and then come back down that's what this code will do okay now that we have the code done here be sure to click on like share subscribe and click on this notification bell to receive all the latest updates from this channel thank you okay we'll make the fish jump by broadcasting uh some messages so that the fish once the fish receive some stop uh this message will start um making the jumping action so let's add this here so we'll add the broadcast message here at the end and we make it a new message called setup fish so this is setting up the fish for the for the for the game so what do we want to do when this uh setup fish is called i'll move this over here a little bit so we'll say when i receive set up when the fish is getting set up what i want to do i want to go here say uh go to a random call the x and y position so the y uh we will put it as negative 150 kinda a little bit in the bottom so as you can see if you move the fish you can see right what what it is so you can see this is negative 154 we put it around 150 right so and then we'll put a x position so what we want to do is we want to set up the fish between the ice block and the iceberg here so we'll have to to look into the position of the x of the iceberg okay so what we can do is this what is the way random we'll say pick it random instead of a 1 to 10 will to change this to a negative 50. so negative 50 is somewhere around this area here so this is like kind of zero right so negative 50 is somewhere here so we want to keep the fish between here and somewhere here so we're gonna we will take the x position of this ice block and we will subtract some some some x value here so that make get between this this and this so what we have to do is we go to sensing uh we have to take this one and then we will have to also use operator uh minus so we'll drop this in here with the select the iceberg first and we'll say the exposition of the iceberg so you run this this explicit is 174. so you say okay i want a minus maybe 70 right and then this whole thing if you do that minus 70 you see this 104 so we'll pick a random between negative 50 and 104 that's what it means so oops so i am going to either zoom back out i think i zoomed in too much with a little bit more complex code here so we'll put this over here so i have this right now so it will be a no between this negative 50 and whatever the x value of the iceberg minus 70 and the y is always in the bottom when the setting of the fish so we also have to say point the fish to the 90 degree just in case the fish is up in the air and the fish have to restart again with make sure to point the fish back up and then we have to say show showing the fish and we have to call our block called jump so when we call this a setup fish we'll call this method this method we'll call setup fish again so basically it's kind of like an infinite loop right so this calls this this one called stats and then we can trigger the setup fish broadcast somewhere else too so that when it start it can keep on going so the fish will kind of come up and down up and down here so we also have to set up another um event here so when um okay when i receive with another one set up fish what we are going to do is we're going to put another forever loop here so what we don't want to do we don't want to combine this together we don't let this do its own job and this one can also do its own thing because it's a forever loop here we don't want to cause any problem for this right we have to put it under inside underneath right it won't make sense so we'll keep it as a separate one so um we'll need an if condition here okay now if the uh if the fish uh touch the penguin or you said say penguin touch the fish is the same thing basically if the if they touch then you know we want to make him disappear and we're going to give some points to the uh to the player so we'll touch the penguin so we can say change the score so we will say change the score by let's say 50 points so we get 50 points to the player then we'll hide the fish so that after you catch the fish the fish disappear then it can the fish can come up again so because okay all right that's done for now um so what we need to do okay so we will actually have to wait until the iceberg finish setting the position then we have to set up the fish right because we don't know where the iceberg is going to uh generate so we have to wait until that's done first before we can set the fish so we have to go back to iceberg here so after the iceberg received get ready from the penguin right so it will set the position uh somewhere here so after this we have to call um broadcast a message say set up the fish so once this is done you the event will go back to the fish here so the fish here will have will run these two coals so we will find the position of the iceberg uh subtract uh 70 um because uh the when you find the percent iceberg is probably here in the middle right so you have to subtract 70 you kind of move it somewhere here so between that and and then 50 uh between somewhere here and here so we'll generate the fish after that cause the jump the jumbo call this set up fish again so it kind of the fish will jump up in the air down up down up down like this right so now that we have it ready let's uh kind of test this out and see how it works so let's start so as you can see the iceberg generated and then you see the fish coming down and the fish is coming back up so the fish should never uh you know kind of touch the iceberg so you see it's generating between here and here right so uh let's if we stop it again we'll stop it again we'll start again the iceberg will come in different locations and you can see the fish is kind of between that so you see the fish is between the iceberg and the in the penguin so he's always between that those two points so this gap here so because of this function here we're trying to find the position between the iceberg and the and the and his block here so the fish is always between that so we can jump up and catch the fish so let's see what happens if we jump up so you see we get the 50 points and then 61 because we landed on the ice block iceberg here so let's try again so so we got him so we got 54 for the fish and then 10 points for the uh the uh the iceberg here so total 60 and then so that's why you get 120. so you see we missed it we still got the fish but we did we missed the iceberg so only 50 points so um okay i'm not doing well in this game okay it's all right so game over so you see how we came over the fish is still kind of moving that's not what we want right we wanna when it's a game over the fish should be stopped moving right so we have to uh make some cool change too to fix that so what we have to do is we're going to go back to the penguin so here we see right touching blue color right so either he's standing on this eye block or he's hitting the edge we want to stop the fish so what we can do is broadcast a new message you say stop fish okay so when you do this it will it will broadcast the message and we can stop it so we will need this something similar so we will also want to touch the edge we also want to stop it say stop the fish all right so now we have the uh both the uh the fish um getting stopped here and then also here if it's touched the blue basically this iceberg here or if i touch the edge basically if it hit the top here the bottom of the c it will call this broadcaster's message so now we have to go back to the penguin so in the penguin so when we are not opinion so whether go back to the fish so when we go back to the fish um when we receive stop fish so we have to say um stop let's go back to control so what we want to do is say stop other script in the sprite basically we'll stop everything here or this guy here and then when the penguin get ready to launch again the fish will start again so let's try this now all right so the fish is up in the air so we catch it as you can see the fish didn't come out right until until i started back over here so let's say if i kind of lose on purpose right so you see the stop the fish stopped moving right until i started again right so so no more game over the fish stop moving right it should not be stop still moving right because we have this so we can stop the fish from moving or you can say you can also add here after this say hi to spry or something like that but that's up to you uh so pretty much this is how the game works so um so i think we got everything the penguin right we got the penguin the code for the penguin again i can show you here so we can go through it a little bit so you have the code here to to make the finger and flip this is making the pigment go back to the start this is the the green flex click we want to do something like this um what what we want to do with the penguin right we can go to the start position and this is when we receive the jump what are we doing here checking if it's touching here or touching the edge right and then we have pretty much uh then you understand this if you don't go back to the previous two video and trying to understand uh listen on it again basically this is kind of touching the blue color basically this uh spike here if you touch that you want to give them the point right making the position of the the penguin standing on top of the iceberg and all that and playing the sound and moving the finger back to the starting position if we touch the edge you stop the fish and then we minus the light right same thing here then the ice block is pretty simple right not much coal here we just kind of put them in the position iceberg we have one added one coal right this one is after the iceberg is generated we want to broadcast a message to tell the fish to be set up before that we don't want to set up the fish because we don't know where the iceberg will be generating from so after that then the arrow the arrow is pretty much the same as the before right we didn't change much uh when the when you click on the screen they will broadcast this jump which calls the penguin uh jump message here which will launch the penguin in the air and then the fish is uh the same we did that today for this lesson so this one is when the fish we created the uh the uh the definition of fish jump here uh we make the fish going up and down pointing zero uh when we point zero meaning it's pointing up uh 180 meaning pointing down right and then we have these two uh condition m2 event here what we want to do is calculate the ice bark iceberg and the position here between that before when the fish to move why this is setting up the fish to see if it catch it touch the penguin if it touch the pink when you give 50 points to the player so this is just making the fish uh smaller right in the beginning and this is stopping the fish basically once you catch the fish and you land it on here or the ocean you have to stop the fish from moving right so this is pretty much uh the video so uh please like subscribe to the channel and we will create more fun video alright thank you everyone have a good day bye you
