so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding playground today we'll be working on a rock blaster 2.0 the rock blaster 1.0 has got many views over the past month so we decided to make rock blaster 2.0 it is a more enhanced version with a shot of of the rock blaster 1.0 game you can use the shop logic for other games as well and i will be uploading these sprites in the um description below so just click show more and then you can download it from our google drive and then we will be learning these following concepts in scratch we'll be learning variables repeat until loops broadcast messages touching other sprites controlling the sprites with keys custom blocks and a custom sprite and let's get in so i'm just gonna go into the so rock blaster i'm gonna um go full screen so i gave myself some extra money so i can show you so you just shoot i added some extra aliens and all that stuff and when you press p it pauses the game and there's a shop and you can click on the shop we just drew a shopping cart and they could buy different things like this is a scatter shot you can buy that force fields you buy 500 each like that you can buy different skins and then the force field will go up by the every time you buy it and you buy a different skin let's say i select the skin it's a blue spaceship and you can click f or force field so then it'll protect you for five seconds yeah and then you have the scatter shot shoots triple this will protect you for five seconds so it's pretty cool and then you can also get other other skins like this one that is pretty cool and then when you die let's just say game over so that's pretty much the game so i'll let's start a new project so first we'll make some variables we'll make some variables to our um game so we can delete the scratch cap for now we will not need that we'll delete the my variable we do not need that as well we won't just make the money for now money that's to buy stuff and we will get the um speed um we'll need some more variables later in the future for um like buying stuff we'll need variables so i have these all in my backpack so i have the two spaceships so i accidentally didn't put all of these i only got a couple of them so let me just drag all these in so for the rocks right i have some costumes along with it these uh i got this from the sprite library but these three are from online you can just get whichever uh cost costume or like alien you want and then you can just put it in here and then you can use the magic eraser tool from 2.0 to erase the white background so you can watch our video on that if you want to learn how to do that and then um for here we have we have we just have blue and red one and then we have this this skin and then uh we have the laser with triple shot and the single shot so for triple shot we just like duplicated two of them on each side and then next we have the game over one nothing too special about this one and the shopping cart this represents the shop i guess and we drew that by using by just drawing a line line line line and you can just draw your own shopping cart like we did or you can just get one from online like we did we just drew this yeah so you can draw one if you want and then we have the exit button just a circle and then we exit and then we have the nebula background so what we did was get the backdrop from here nebula so we got the nebula backdrop from here then we uh convert to vector copy ctrl c and then we paint a new thing and then ctrl v so that's how we uh put that as a sprite um and then after that we have the pause button so when you press p i was thinking that if you press p it will pause the game and the shop will open so um all what we did was just draw a circle with two lines to make look like a pause button then we have the this this is just like the button to buy the by the spaceship and each shot you hit an enemy is 100 points so this is not that much actually and then we have the force field um sprite and i taught you guys how to do that in the other video the uh uh two player uh space shooting game so if you want to learn how to do that then you can watch that video but what we did was just draw a circle without with with outline and then erase this part in this part to make it look like a force field and then you have this um this one is not really purchasing this is the default uh spaceship skin but if you want to switch back to the default spaceship skin then you can just click on this that's what we did and then this is the other cool spaceships again looks pretty good this one and then this is the purchasing the force field 500 each and the code for this one's a bit different because you have to you can buy multiple at a time and then get the scatter shot which is 5 000 points okay so that's all of the sprites right here so let's start with the player so i'm just gonna go to the red costume because you always want to start with that one first so one flat clicked we want to set the money to zero since um in the in the beginning you don't want them to have some money left over so i'm going to set to zero and then we want to switch the costume to costume one red costume so this is red costume blue costume and cool costume okay so i set it to the first one because uh this is the default skin and then we will broadcast a message called start game start game and then when i receive start game then we could go to the front layer let's go to the front layer so this goes front and then we want it to go back a little bit so we want to go back backwards and zoom in a little so we want to go backwards back 10 layers so it won't go it'll go back a little bit and then we want to set the size to 40 um this is already 40 because i got it from my backpack but if it isn't for you then just set it to 40 and i'm actually not sure if they still have the spaceship and 3.0 scratch but if they don't then uh you can just get one from online um but this is from 2.0 i'm pretty sure and then in the beginning i wanted to make it go to negative 180 y 0 and they get a forever loop this is for the movement forever if we're only doing the up and down arrow keys so if up arrow key is pressed then we can change the y by 10 we just duplicate this if the left arrow i mean down arrow is clicked then we'll go down by negative 10 change the y by negative 10. and then uh we'll also need a uh and that's it for now so this is just the movement so as you can see you can move up and down now so that's what we have and then next we can work on the um aliens and the space rocks and whatever you want to call them so let's make a new block called create enemies create enemies click okay so we're going to have to define this real quick i want to make it go to the back layer because um i had this bug earlier where um the aliens would show up when you're in the store because it's not all the way in the back layer so you want to make it go to the back layer switch costume to the rocks that's just the first default costume and then you can show set size to 50 so i'm pretty this is already 50 but if it isn't already then you can set it to 50 and then i'm gonna repeat five times since there's five costumes as you can see five costumes and then i'll do next costume create a clone of myself so change the costume while creating clones and then hide down here and then i want to set the x to like 99999 so the original uh the original sprite will be off the screen and then we can when i start as a clone when i start as a clone we wanted to go to pick random so we're just doing this to give it a little bit more uh a variation to the game so pick random so i'm going to pick random 180 to 240 and then for the y i'm going to do negative 150 to 150 so it's going to be like somewhere around here and here of spawn somewhere near the edge so then um remember the speed variable we want to set the speed speed to pick random negative four to negative seven we're doing negative because they're moving to the left i did negative four negative seven because i think that's the right speed it's pretty good so we're gonna repeat until repeat until touching the player touching player and then we'll change the x by the speed so it'll go whatever number it is so like if the speed is 4 negative 4 then i'll go negative 4 steps so change x by the speed and then if the x position is less than negative uh 220 so like somewhere around here if it's less than that position so the x position is less than negative 220 then we'll make it go back go back to this position so i'm just going to duplicate this put that in here and um that's all we have for now and then we also want to do this when i receive start game we want to call the um this block right here this script right here i'll call this so then it will actually spawn some stuff so now i will play it so i'm going to show you guys now the demo but first i'm going to hide these because they're a bit distracting and so as you can see are uh moving around like that and they're spawning but if you touch it you'll stop them because uh we have not done anything to do take damage yet or lose so now we have the spawning and the movement down uh and the next video will probably work in the laser and maybe the shop so thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share and
