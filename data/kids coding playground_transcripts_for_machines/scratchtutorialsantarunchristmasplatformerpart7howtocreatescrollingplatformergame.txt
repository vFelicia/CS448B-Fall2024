hello scratcher welcome back to our kids calling playground so today we are doing the santa run part seven i think we probably have a couple more parts to go before we finish the enemy is kind of hard so today we're gonna plan to work on the spike and then the uh maybe the um the next level okay with the igloo so um we're gonna do that so for now let's pick up the igloo sprite from my backdrop i think you guys have this already in your i might have uploaded if not i'll check later so uh this is pretty simple you have that i just got added some ice block put it in here in the igloo okay i believe you guys have that if not i'll update later to the drive to boot right so um okay let's get started so last time we did the uh the sound so this is all for the sound make sure you get the correct uh list okay the soundless if it's one then we play the sound after we play the sound we'll make it back to zero okay so that way you know you will not play this down multiple time uh same thing in the other one and then last time we also work on the background scrolling so uh this is the code for that so you miss that you can add it in okay uh so today we're gonna work on the include to after you hit the igloo the center will jump up and then we can move on to the next level so when we move on to the next level we need to call the uh level two here okay so now we're gonna do the spike first okay okay let's move on to the spike so the spike is uh really similar to um you know other other thing that we had like the virtual ground you know uh what we can do is uh we can copy some of the code from from the virtual ground or what not and then we're gonna change it okay so for now let's grab this grab the reset grab the setup grab the movement grab the clone and position okay i hope we have all of that let's just kind of space it out a bit okay move ground setup reset and then start okay so we are going to change a bit for the spike okay in the beginning we want to actually hide it okay let's drop all that uh we actually don't need to set any position because it's gonna be move around with the spike so uh placing the cone myself we don't need this okay delete that because we're actually putting at the wherever the position is we're not moving 480 like like the other one we're not going to use one we're going to use number here um so what we're gonna do is okay so this one will be a little bit different we will not put the x here okay what we're going to do is we're going to say clear clone myself and then we can put the show here okay and then um when i create that when i create a clone myself so what we're going to do is we're going to move them to the position when i start as a clone okay so um i'm going to move this to this x and y we have set it up here right the x and y we're going to change all this later okay don't worry about that so for now let's just continue with this one um what we can do is we're going to use this forever loop and then we are going to get a if condition here okay and then we are saying sensing with touching the main character okay basically this character here and then we'll use another control here inside this if i'm gonna check the animated type so what happened is uh when you um this animated type is like when it's like dying or something like that we don't want it to die again right so what we're going to check for zero so zero meaning uh the uh center is still alive nothing had happened to him he's well and good okay and then we are going to use the another if statement here okay here we are going to check uh you remember like when the center died right um the sound i recorded myself uh here ouch in like whatever you like so that's my sound recorded so we're gonna play that sound so the ouch is the second one right so what we're going to do is we'll go back here and then we say um let's get the operator here uh go to the uh the list now we make sure you select the sound one okay number two so basically if it's item number two is equal to zero then we'll replace it okay replace item number two with one so that way it will it will play okay so when let's say easy this one when it's one then it will play and then we'll set it back to zero so when we wanna play we wanna make sure we set it to one so we when the spike hits the center we want to play the sound right also we want to set something here called hit so this is right here one is touching it okay okay sorry about that um this is actually inside here when it's actually uh animated type is zero so we don't wanna keep on broadcasting when they touch the character only if it's not dead we want to broadcast one time i mean set this one time so that way you know it will know that it's get hit and then we'll deduct one life on it okay so put it inside the um this condition here the animation type equal to zero okay so i'll explain i'll explain how we actually use this head so this hit is actually go to here you see this right then somewhere here so the hit is actually here in the animated sprite here so when it gets hit we'll make make it dead and then we'll do this uh that animation okay all right so it's right here okay now let's go back to the this one here so we want to make sure that when it's uh when it's reset we're gonna delete all the clone when it's set up we're gonna change this out a little bit okay so exactly the back layer will make it go to the front layer okay so we want the spike to show up okay uh what i'm going to do is i'm going to make it point in direction 90 and also make sure your spike is uh so so we should use this one um this not this one because we're gonna flip them upside down so uh that's why you wanna use put the spike on this one all around okay so um when you play this we are going to put the clone at i have some coordinate already done but i'll show you why what you can do okay uh negative negative 95 okay so so as you can see um later i'll run there and then you can see it but uh not yet this is not ready yet so um we have to fix something else let's see if everything is good we have the g scrolling done this is should be good the position one um clone that that's fine uh the clone one that looks fine let's throw this away and then the position one that looks like it's fine and yeah that looks fine now let's just try it out so let's save it okay so let's see we have any uh yep there's a that's the spike is here okay so as you can see this spike is here so uh what you can do is um you want to know the direction right you can put it anywhere i mean you can put it anywhere for me i put in the background but it doesn't matter uh you can put it like in the main character but main character and all this is too many things there so we don't want to put it there so what you can do is this when the m key is pressed basically the mouse or whatever i'm in position so we're gonna say let me see if i have those variable um yeah i have a mouse position so we're going to set this so set global mouth position okay i'm going to use some join here and then we're going to use another joint and then we are going to use a plus sign as a plus sign okay uh we're gonna use the mouse button i think it's in sensing mouse x and then we're gonna say plus the scroll x okay put that into the first join now we can put a comma here and a space and then we can take this duplicate we're gonna use mouse y uh this one we can right click and say scroll why or you can just delete it and drag one here okay go back to sensing so almost y then we'll put it here so you can see so it's joining this comma and then this put that here and then you can call this thing called show variable mouse position okay all right so let's just check it out so let's run it so let's say i want to put a um put the spike here you can click click the m key you see this is 40 80 whatever negative 80. so if you put here you can put one like let's say duplicate this 40 negative 95 whatever so because i'm using 95 right so it will be correct so you see so if you if you have it at negative 80 or whatever it might be too high you can just adjust that so let's run this you see every 8 is too high because even though i push the m key here right so you see i push the m key here because you have to put in the middle right so you see this is too high so yeah you know it should be somewhere here so i have negative 95 so you can just adjust it okay adjust it any way you want okay so i have it like this then i have two right so you see i have two okay so that's how you put multiple of these uh little uh red spikes so let's go back to my coat i still have a little bit more to do so um i have some um some of the spike let's say i wanted to uh flip him upside down i'll delete this i don't need the first one uh so if i want to flip it upside down you can change this direction right uh to negative 90. okay and then we're gonna create some chrome here actually uh i'm gonna create a rows of spike i already have coordinates for it so if you don't have it you can have to move it to that location and put it so for me you know i have it as 184 negative 26 1902 negative 26 i should have duplicate from this one so i have less typing but anyway let's just finish that uh this is one nine nine five and two zero seven zero okay so this is the row of spike where center can slide through so i turn it upside down and then you wanna turn it back up then you have to say point direction 90. i'll do one more clone i think i have one more spike at the end and my original game i'll put one more here uh two two four five zero and then that's negative 95. okay so that's my spike so let's run that real quick so you can see you have the center here and then you have the row of spikes coming up see there you go so i have to slide through if i don't slide through and get stuck hit that and i'm gonna die so see so this is the last one so this is that row of spike and i flip it back upside down i'm gonna flip my right side up and then i put this last one so you can click the mouse here you see it's 240 50 you see that 249.95 so somewhere like that okay so that's how it is so for the spike okay so what we're going to do is we're going to add this include the in that the center jump on it goes to the next level so right now i don't have any code so just grab the code from here let's move it from the spike one the reset to set up three so this one four five six and seven okay i think we have all the coal the clones down here movement here you can place them any way you like but i'm trying to put them the same as the other one so kind of easy to see okay all right so we have the igloo so the include i'm trying to put at the end so we actually don't need all this too many things here so let's throw that away oops we'll leave one of the clone okay let's go from the top first make sure that is correct so we want to high in the beginning the position plays the clone position that is the same so show okay the other one the position that should be the same okay things change there the clone here is we have to that is not gonna die right so when i touch the main character what we want to do is we want to podcast broadcast events saying new message next level okay and then what we want to do is we also want to stop this uh script so we don't want to go forever okay stop the script and we can trash all this okay so we have the scrolling i think the scrolling is fine the x and y is scrolling very good uh so this one we want to put it at i have it cornered down but if you don't you have to go to the end and try to get it so you remember we were like really close like two thousand five hundred i mean four hundred fifty so somewhere down we go three thousand three hundred so we're gonna put it at negative sixty okay all right so now let's check it out so um oh this will still not work yet because the next level we haven't coded yet so let's call that first okay so let's go back to our main character okay let's call it here when i receive a next level okay uh what i want to do is i'm going to stop everything else stop other script in the sprite okay i want to stop everything we'll broadcast a message now we're broadcasting wait sorry new message called victory okay whatever you like so that means he got to the end and then we're gonna broadcast a new message call stop new level okay that's already there okay so we're gonna do this victory dance and then we'll podcast a new level and then this is a next level broadcast when you touch that igloo okay so you glue will touch and call that okay all right okay so now let's go back to the center so we need to fix the uh because we broadcast victory right we want to make him dance a little bit so um center here uh when i receive uh victory so let's zoom in a little bit uh what we want to do we want to stop out of script in the sprite as well okay and then we're going to change this level so we're from level 1 we're going to change it to level two change level by one okay and then what i'm going to do is i'm gonna switch the cost to uh jump okay i'm gonna switch the jump custom and then i say uh repeat 15 times and then i will say change y by five okay and then look next costume uh and then uh switch it back to the first costume actually oops sorry i don't mean him to jump up so now we're going to change it back to negative 5 okay and then after that we want to stop the spoon stop this grip okay so when i get to the igloo it'll jump up i just repeat 15 times i think that's i have 15 costume of jump costume or something let's just take a look so let's look at jump you see i have a jump one two jump yeah 15 you see even 16. so yeah so doesn't matter so i actually have 16 but anyway so i repeated 15 you can repeat 16 if you like doesn't matter uh okay yeah i repeat 15 because we already switched it to the first costume so second let's go into the next costume right so that's why it's 15. okay got it so 15 is correct uh because we have 16 custom and we already switch it to the first one so now that this will go to the next custom right so what you had to do is uh for the next level you have to make your clone if not there was nothing for the centers to stand on right he'll fall okay so let's go to the ground i will do real quick um same thing here we'll do duplicate we'll say two and we are going to use the uh switch to costume number two one and we will place the clone at zero zero zero one i'm just gonna do two for now uh but but whatever it is you know depending on how many custom you have for number two so for me i have what what seven right so zero two one two two seven two eight see two eight so actually it will be it's starting on zero so it will be until seven so you can duplicate this this is two let's duplicate this again so three four five let's duplicate two more six and then seven and then put this back in okay so now we have the level two done for this so same thing here so you want to put this here and call that level two and select two will be one two three four so seven right okay so we got all the background and this guy done so you need to put more spike of course level two you're gonna have to add spike right and then for the igloo same thing if you want to go to level three you're gonna have to add that so for now let's just test it okay let me take out the mouse position let's see if it works let's make it bigger screen okay all right santa's jumping around we don't have the any enemy at the moment pretty easy so okay so you can see they have a include here yep so if i jump on it so you see center jump now he's on level two okay so this is level two so i had yeah built you can build it any way you want so i built it like this so this is my level two a little bridge and uh this is a little slide so so this is for me for my original game i put the uh another um we call it the include here so it goes to level three okay all right so this is fine working fine so as you can see we can go backward as well right so okay all right so i think we'll stop the uh stop the tutorial until here so next time we can work on the items the snowflake and then the enemy i think we're almost done maybe two more uh video i think the enemy is a little complicated and explain that pretty well also the item okay all right guys thank you for sticking around and be sure to give us a like and thumbs up and share with your friends about channel and i'll see you guys next time bye you
