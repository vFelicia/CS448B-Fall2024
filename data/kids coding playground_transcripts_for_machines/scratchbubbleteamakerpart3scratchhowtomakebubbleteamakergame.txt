thank you hey guys welcome back to kids clothing playground channel so today we'll work on the third part of this uh bubble tea making game so uh we're almost done maybe one or two more episodes should be done so let's go over what we had so far so let me just run the game real quick uh to just remind you guys Where We Are so here where we the cat saying that making the bubble tea and film the ingredients so what the customer came in and then we dropped the tapioca pearl in here and then we pour the tea and then what we have to work on is uh right now we're gonna have this syrup come in and we're going to drop the syrup and then shake the bubble tea and then after that we keep the straw to the customer I'll give the straw to put the straw on the bubble tea and give the customer but that pipe work on it for the next next one so let's finish the part where we add the syrup and then shake the cup all right okay so let's go over real quick because this is uh the code for the cat so if you miss anything just pause uh this is for the customer this part is for the tapioca uh scoop this is the actual tapioca pearl but this one is the cup where we have the tapioca on it this is the teapot this is the actual teacup with the tapioca together and this is the tico so right now we're gonna work on the syrup okay so the last part where we have stored syrup here that is where we're going to start our project so once we get that broadcast message we'll go to the syrup bottle and we'll apply the syrup bottle here and then we're gonna start putting the uh you know the syrup down to the pla to the cup all right so let's get started so let's go back to the syrup bottle so while we have the message say start zero break so let's go here so here let's put down the uh when green black is clicked uh so we're gonna put them at whatever position here like behind the cat here that's fine then we're gonna put in go to back layer uh so we want the syrup bottle to go to the back left but it's kind of have to be a little bit in front of the uh customer but also behind the cats right so that's what we say go to back land and we're gonna say go forward two layer so the bottle has to be in front of the table as well so we're going to go forward to there and then we say show then we're gonna have the message like the start zero so here we say start syrup so what we're going to do is we're going to make it go to here but uh what we have to do is we're going to take the same color and put it here right click duplicate so right click duplicate and then take it away so what happened is when we start the game again with that same go to click the green flag right because you know we saw the next customer we have to do the same thing so that's why we put it here okay all right next I'm gonna say Glide one second how we're gonna put it around 55 and negative 35 that's what I had so so this is kind of like you know you click on it you can see kind of like right there so you can just move your bottle anywhere you want until I get the perfect position okay all right so I put it back already so as you can see I can run the game without um test the code without running the whole game just clicking on the code block itself okay so that's a little trick okay so next we'll say wait a couple of events and wait until okay we're gonna wait until the mouse down just like how we had for the uh you know other stuff the tea all right and we're gonna broadcast a message oops sorry I've got the wrong code broadcast a message new message called poor serum okay so pause here and then we can make the drip sandwich then we have the strips down here I actually use the strip sample in the library but I kind of cut it short a little bit so that kind of match when the syrup drops down so you can cut it short just using the you know the sound and you can just drag it so like like example like this so you want to cut it short right you can just say hey I want to cut this part off then you can do it like this and then you can say delete so we do that it will become shorter okay all right so let's go back to our code so here Sam we're gonna play the drips down until done okay after that so for now let's go to the uh the part of the circle we later we'll put the bottle back so so here next we're gonna go to the syrup uh actual um Sprite okay so I'll say my green flag is Click when I say hi so we don't want to show the little serum you know drip and what we receive uh pour syrup so now we're gonna just put the syrup in so remember we had a prawn a pro up a variable we need to create so just like the T we have to create one of the counter for the uh for the syrup as well make sure you select this one I say counter I put a lowercase C so I know that this is for this Sprite only okay so here is a counter you can see the name as well okay I can hide it for now okay so next we're gonna set the set the counter to zero and then we are going to get into the position so 18 55 so you can see this somewhere here so if you see the bottle maybe I'll go back to the bottom right I click here so it's kind of like you can see that it's kind of dripping from the tip of the bottom kind of thing so that's how how I made it so you can put it anywhere but you know you can put it even like right here so I got the customer but you can put it right right here right or whatever okay so let me send my customer back sorry about that so let me put it back I think we cannot see the you cannot see this uh the uh now you can see it sometimes when you click on it it goes back and forth so that's kind of annoying okay all right so we're back over here and I'll go just continue all right so next we're gonna say repeat uh 10 times I'll say create a clone myself then we're gonna wait a little bit each time or wait um one so that you can actually see and then we're gonna increase the counter so change the counter by one now we're gonna use it uh if condition here so put that under here so here we're gonna go to operator and then we're gonna say use equal uh what we're going to do is we're going to say hey the counter is equal to 3 that's where we uh you know send the uh send the broadcast message to fill the serum so we're gonna broadcast another message here and the message name will be fill zero okay and then at the end of this then we're gonna put purchase another message and this one we're gonna call it uh put syrup bottle back so make sure you guys give a good name for your for your message to you know what to do okay so we have to create a call myself right so we need that uh when I start as a claw yeah when I saw this clone uh what I'm going to do is I'm going to slide over a little bit here and then kind of use the if condition so similar to the change color that we have for the T and the and the cup so we're going to try to do this chain color so that we can fill the next uh person you know do a different color okay so I'm going to use the operator greater than we'll have to change color variable if it's greater than zero so zero without base color so after if it's changed like every time you can change like 50 or 25 whatever if you do that then you're gonna set the new color effect so we're gonna set the new color effect of that chain color variable okay so next we're gonna make it go to this position same position I think I move that you know a little bit so you can put it you can put it back 1855 okay and then uh what I can do is hit show you don't actually have to be in the same position just you can't move whatever you like you know you can move a little bit higher a little bit lower you know and then we're gonna say repeat until so we only have the teacup for this one so we don't need to do the other one we just repeat until touching the teeth because the other one is high already okay and then we're gonna change the um y y minus five to make it drip down okay and then at the end we have to delete the clump so when you use clones you do that okay so we are done with this serum so now we go back to the skill oh bottle so we have the syrup in the beginning right then we're gonna say hey Glide syrup over here right and then you say pour syrup we're waiting for the uh poster right waiting for that so so you can see if I click on it the strip drop down but I made this serve to show right it should be high right in the beginning so let's we can test that again so we'll go back to the T we don't have to I mean we don't have to do the whole thing again right so we we can just click it click this let it go back so as you can see the syrup come in we're gonna say hey um so I'm gonna click on it so you can see that it drip right okay all right so we have all the coal ready okay all right so we have the syrup looking correctly but now we're going to change the cup right to match the syrup to fill up right so now we have to go back to the cup so we have something called broadcast uh field syrup right and then put syrup back right so for the broadcast uh fill syrup so we're gonna do that first and then we can put the syrup bottle back so here go back to the cup and we're gonna say when I receive uh field zero here so here what we're going to do is we're going to change the custom number to 11. so if you look at 11 is this one you know without the T So 12 I mean without the syrup 12 is starting to have the serum on time okay so we're gonna say 11. um because I repeat uh five times and then forecast next class two and then we will do a little weight uh 0.2 second uh and then what the very end wait 0.5 so you kind of just make sure that you kind of sync the you know the syrup dropping down and sync the uh changular custom so you can adjust the the wait time okay so after that all the thing is done we're gonna broadcast a new message call oh yeah we have the podcast uh put the syrup back right uh yeah we don't need that actually uh yeah I think I made a small mistake before okay so let's go back to the syrup we can take this out we're gonna use a little bit of weight before we move it thing so we're gonna take this one put the syrup bottle back right just take this out sorry about that so I think I made a little mistake I have like podcasted twice on my original game so in the syrup we can take that out we can we we can do it over here so we have to say um so we're gonna say here a new message here we're gonna say put the put this your bottle back okay so that is actually a little bit better uh that way you would do a little bit of weight then we broadcast that then we'll do a wait one second so that way you know when you trip the Finish stripping the uh the syrup it doesn't immediately go back the the bottle so that looks a little bit better that will switch the costume to 17 which is the last costume before the I think it's a little one 17 yeah yeah the lids go on yeah okay and then we're gonna broadcast a message called Shake here we're gonna say um new message called Shake all right so we have podcast the uh put the bottle right now we're gonna go back to the bottle and here in the bottle we say hey when I received the put the bottle back they're not gonna apply back to my original position so glide back one second we'll glide back to 210 which is what we have in the top here in original position okay so we have it good right now let's let's test it out from the beginning so now let's see okay so we have the the customer walking in okay still works the cups comes in fill the bubble and then within t then the syrup Clyde here so we can fill up the syrup and now we have the lid and then you can see the syrup bottle came back okay all right so that is where we are so now we're gonna make the bottle Shake here all right so let's go back so where we have the cup oops sorry that's I can't so we broadcast Shake right so here what we're going to do is when I receive Shake uh we're gonna point in 90 Direction so basically when we shake the bottle what I'm sure that it's always going to start at the correct position so we'll put that 90. and then we say start the sound start the sound Shake sound so we don't want to block it we want to start it so just play until then you can block all the code down so we want to say start cell then we are going to say repeat 10 times motion we're gonna say turn to the right 30 degree and then do a little bit of weight 0.1 and turn to the left 30 degrees okay so what this does is it's kind of move and turn the box I mean the top cup left and left and then I mean right to left so let's say if you click on this you can see that they're gonna shake and they have the shaking sound and then move left and right so now we're gonna do the other side so what you're gonna do is that you can say wait 0.5 right here we're gonna do the other side so this part we can kind of duplicate this on the side so we're gonna re reverse the code so this time we're gonna shake the opposite so we're gonna go like this and like that so this time we're gonna shake the opposite basically we shake to the right now we're gonna shake to the left so left weight and then right wait and then at the end okay all right so let's go back down we're gonna put this over here okay and then what we can do is we have to put the cup back straight let's put the cup back straight first before this one okay all right so let's test it out real quick so we all we have to do is click on this so you can see it shake to the left right left and then we'll put it back straight okay here after that we can start the sound again so we're gonna do up and down so we're gonna start the sound again uh and then we'll have the repeat hold it 15 times okay so here we are just gonna change the Y so I'm gonna say change y 'all by ten I'll wait 0.1 and then we have to change y by negative 10. okay and then we'll do away again 0.1 and then we can broadcast a new message here this one we're gonna call it put straw on so this will put the straw onto the cup okay so let's check it out real quick so now we have this on um so let's click on this thing to test it out so you can see the shape to the right the left and then it goes up and down okay so now what is next is we're gonna broadcast the straw to put the straw on and for the straw to come on uh we're gonna do that next so next one so we're gonna put the straw on and then we're gonna give it to the customer and we're gonna light up the icon and um and that's it should be the end of this tutorial so that we'll have one more tutorial coming for the end where we put the straw and then give it to the customer the T okay all right thanks for tuning in today and see you guys next time bye
