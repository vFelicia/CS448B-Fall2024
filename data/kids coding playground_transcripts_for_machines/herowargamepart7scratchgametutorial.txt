welcome back guys it's K playground here today we're back for another video in scratch and today we'll be working on the seventh part of the hero war game so if you haven't checked out the previous Parts is also on our Channel and it will be in the video description below so all the parts before the seventh part and also if you have any problems Che uh with our game uh you can uh check out my account gumbuster 98 and I have a project over there hero war game and you can check the code and see what you have wrong so today we're going to try to code the second boss um so first let's drag almost all of the scripts from The Siege monster to that one so the old one let's just drag this one let's drag this one when I oh let's drag this this one let's dry this one this one this one and this one all right uh we actually don't need this one cuz this one's to summon peons and the old one does not summon peons so we have these six pieces so the first thing we're going to do is check what the siege monster P it's the old one sieg monster HP so let's rename this variable to the old one HP the old one HP so it'll hide variable the old one HP yeah so when I receive we're going to change this to new message old one spawn it it will set the old one HP to 8,000 so that's less than the seege monster but is it's a range attacker and it's very dangerous with its in tangling Vineyards so and then it also show variable old one HP okay after that we're going to have when I receive old one spawn old one spawn then I'll go to this position pick random show and then it will not uh repeat until touch player it'll just point towards player cuz the old one does not move there we go and we will have all right so when I receive start game forever if score is greater than 1,250 then it'll show it'll broadcast old one spawn and it'll stop the script good so now we will have this old one dead script so let's actually do this so uh let's actually work on this first cuz this one actually broadcast the old one dead so when I receive old one spawn forever if touching projectile on her is equal to one it change old one hpus 180 broadcast Del era and then if if it's less than a broadcast change score by 500 a broadcasting Siege monster dead it'll broadcast old one dead old one dead so touching projectile is equal to two it'll change old one minus 250 and then we'll just change this to old one dead and then if it's touching projectile and her select is equal to three then uh change old one HP minus 350 Fair Queen stronger and then it will broadcast old one dead just like that and then first ability here two the same thing old one dead same thing for this one just old one dead you just change it like that old oh no not not old on dead and that's the same for the second ability here two it will old one dead and then after that for the apprentices star here c 2 uh it will broadcast old one dead and let's continue and if it's touching second ability and here to three it change old one hpus 100 if old one HP is equal Z old one HP is less than zero 500 and then old one dead so since the old one can't move the shield is not affected so The Shield is does nothing against them so you actually need to delete this thir ability thing so if it's touching player know set hit player old so each one do different damage values we have to make a new variable for each them so hit player old it will set hit player old to Y broadcast hit player and it will not move Nega 10 steps back cuz that would just be really bad you're just moving 10 steps back so now um we can change this so when I receive old one dead it will broadcast do all this and there we go all right let's move on to Old One's vineard the vine ball this is where the old one shoots these huge projectiles at the enemy and first of all let's I think it's about the same code AS really the you know the um projectile so let's just move this on to the vine ball we don't need any of this but so we have this over here so when I receive old one dead it will actually so we need parts of this code it will repeat 100 times so it can shoot up to 100 Vine balls if you don't kill them by then it'll stop shooting Vine balls but it'll wait 3 seconds wait 3 seconds and then after that it will show and it'll go to old one so we need this see go to Old one the old one and then after that it'll Point towards player you'll shoot in the player Direction Point towards player and then it'll repeat until touching Edge or player so or touching Edge or touching player Oh move 30 stats oh move 10 steps made it a little slower so it's easier to dodge and then it'll hide after that and it will go to old one old one the old one there we go we don't need none of this all right so when the green flag is clicked it will go to old one go to old one the old one the old one okay and it'll hide and then when I receive zoom in a little bit when I receive old one dead old one dead then it will hide and then it'll stop all the strips in the Sprite so let's get the stop all the strips in the Sprite right over here here here and then now when the green flag is clicked forever if then touching player then it will change lives by minus 30 so just 30 damage which is pretty decent I mean yeah cuz it's range anyway all right so let's move on to the vineyard this is what the old one spawns out to kill the enemies by poison damage and changes the color effect so let's do this so when the green flag is clicked it will hide it'll go to x150 27 and it'll go to the the back layer go to back layer then when the green flag is clicked forever it will forever if then touching player then then it will actually if touching player then it'll change the lives by minus five so the base damage is five but it also has poison damage so that's also really strong even if you're not on the vineard change life of minus five it'll wait 05 seconds so five damage every .5 seconds and then now when the uh when I receive old one dead then it'll hide stop all the scripts in the Sprite and now we have to do the old one spawn part so the scripts in this Sprite all right and now let's add the when I receive old one spawn then it will repeat 100 times so it's the capability of spawning 100 times then it will go to x so this is a pick random position so it'll go to x we need two pick randoms or you can just yeah pick random let's do this 00 to 200 that's the position and then let's duplicate that let's put it oh yeah put one in the X put one in the Y but instead change this to 100 so it doesn't go all the way up and then it'll show it will wait 5 seconds and then it'll hide so that is the essentially The Vineyard code so now let's go back to the player and see how that works so let's go back to the player also We'll add the old one damage after and the peon damage under here we have if then so under the show if then touching Vineyard yard then it'll repeat five it will change color effect by 25 it will change Lies by minus 5 5 then it'll wait 4 seconds so wait4 seconds change color effect change lives then it'll clear graphic effects after so under here all right so let's add the peon damage and The Siege and the um and the old one damage so let's duplicate this put it under here and if hit player Pon equals y so peons will do 30 damage actually really strong not going to lie um and then now let's duplicate that again and if hit player old one go y old BL is negative 120 doesn't matter if you get into them anyway you're going to die anyway so let's duplicate these two so and then set hit player P on p on to end and hit player old there we go so now let's work work on the zombie King actually let's do the mysterious man first cuz that comes in order before the you know the zombie King so let's do mysterious man so when the green flag is clicked the mysterious man is pretty much a necessity so win you know it'll go to x this position then it'll go to front layer go to front layer now switch costume to costume 2 then it'll show I mean yeah and then it'll hide sorry then when the when I receive old one dead so after when you beat the old one it'll give you some heals so then you can fight the wicked zombie King then it'll wait 4 seconds you'll switch costume to costume 2 which is this one so he comes in like and he gives you some medicine switch costume 2 it will show it'll wait. five seconds know switch costume to costume one switch costume to costume one then it will say it'll say you'll need this for the wicked zombie zombie King and then after that it'll switch costume the costume 3 it will say take some heels for one second and it would change lives by 1,000 so of course you can alter this amount like um if you want it more challenging honestly I would say um I would recommend make it more challenging cuz 1,000 is a lot of health and then it will say poof for one second and I'll switch costume back to costume 2 which is the poof and it will hide that's the mysterious man code so now let's work on the zombie King so the zombie king zombie King essentially will be taking a lot of code from The Siege monster because it's pretty related to the SI monster because it can also summon peons so let's also just drag them all in quickly so that the big one get this one and then the SI monster spawn so let's put them all over here um yeah very crowded let's just move some of these around all right so let's get to work so when the green switch on cost one hide and then of course we need to change this from Siege monster HP to zombie King h HP so it'll hide variables on be king HP when I receive King's spond so we need to make a new message King spawn then it will go to x yeah that position and it'll show and then forever repeat until touching player yeah move point one steps so and then I also need when I receive uh King spawn so we're going to change this to King spawn it will show varable zombie K HP and then instead it has the capability to repeat 12 times it'll wait 8 seconds it'll switch costume to costume 2 so and then it will broadcast death ray so let's actually summon the peons now so put those up there and then it'll broadcast death ray death ray this is where he steals your HP and uses it for himself and then it'll wait one second and switch costume back to costume 1 costume two oh no uh yeah so it's kind of cramped so this is actually going to be cost so I may have actually deleted costume 2 when I was making the first project so let's actually drag that in from the backpack I'll be right back all right sorry but I now have costume 2 duplicated in my thing so oh gosh let's make a new costume let's duplicate it onto here yeah so this is costume 2 so let's just put drag it up here this is costume 2 where he's hitting the shield and creating the lines I'm sorry if I told you to delete that in the first part but we actually need that for um the animation so if you go to my project and you could just take the costume from there so we have 1 two three and then four so yeah we do need this costume or you can just draw it yourself it's pretty easy just get the costume one move the sword like that to hit the shield and then draw two little red lines so when I receive King spawn it'll uh show variable Z King HP repeat 12 and then switch costume to costume 2 broadcast death rate broadcast summon peons wait 1 second and switch costume to coste costume one so let's continue here so when I receive King spawn King spot then it will it will so zombie can HP to 15,000 pretty strong tching player wait. 5 seconds and then when I receive start game if score is greater than 2,000 then show and the broadcast King spawn okay and now um when I receive we actually have to add this beam touch thing so this is what happens in the death R so when I receive beam touched or or that's from the death ray so let's actually code that last so let's do the big script after this one so when I receive King spawn it will do all that switch costume costume three and there we go so now let's code this big stop when I receive King spawn then forever if touching projectile blah blah blah blah blah blah and then it'll change score oh it won't change any score because it um won't change any score so let's actually make a new message King dead actually this is King dead I'm so sorry King dead so it'll do all that when he dies and then we have one broadcast King dead and it's searching projectile blah blah blah it will broadcast King dead again and then same with this one C King dead not King spawn King dead and then first ability of hero sctc one it will blah blah blah broadcast King dead won't change any score and then second ability here select is one broadcast King dead just like that and then second ability to two 60 broadcast King dead so it's pretty repetitive here and then it'll change zombie King blah blah blah and then it'll take out the score and then broadcast King dead and then now if it's touching second ability and here go a three it'll change Zombie h King HP and then broadcast K dead take out the score and then if it's touching third ability and he like go three it'll actually move 25 steps back it'll keep on changing um the zombie King HP and just like that we have King dead again so it's searching the player then it'll set hit player King to make a new one hit player player king um and then I'll set hit player King to Y and broadcast hit player and a move NE of 10 steps back now let's add this onto the player so go to the player sorry I don't know why and then we'll go to player and then it will it will set hit player King to y or change lives by 680 so it's basically a death wish if you want to go right into there and various Escape you're going to die automatically basically and then it'll set hit player King to n and there we go and now let's move on to the death ray I think we're going to stop here for now today and code the death rate in the next part because the video is getting quite long so anyway please like share subscribe and comment in the comments section below what else games that you want I'll see you guys next time
