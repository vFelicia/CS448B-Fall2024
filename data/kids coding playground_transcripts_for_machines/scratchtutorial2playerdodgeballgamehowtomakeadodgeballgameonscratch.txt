welcome back guys it's kidscodingplayground here and today we're back for another video and this video and we're doing the twoplayer dodgeball game today we will we are working on this twoplayer dodge blocking the objective of the game is not your opponent's hp to zero players must avoid getting hit by the balls only two balls can be thrown at the same time to play dodgeball game we'll be learning these following concepts in scratch variables forever loops broadcast message touching other sprites controlling sprite with keys so i'm going to demo the game so i have my dad with me to play hello yeah so so there's music and i'm the blue dude and then i use the right arrow to shoot uh the left arrow to shoot and for the red dude the red picot he uses um d to shoot so that's nice so you can throw two balls at this given time at the same time so so as you can see i once has played two wins so we will be making this project yeah so let's make a new project thank you before i start please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below what else content you want so first i'm going to take out the sprite i'm going to sprite library i think it's called pico yes pico pico walking because he's supposed to be walking up and down so we have pico walking you can also duplicate this dude but first let's get the beach ball and we're only doing one and then we'll duplicate it afterwards so let's just do the variables so you gotta make a variable called player one hp and then player one ball counter you also need player 2 hp player 2 hp and also player 2 ball counter also need speed the speed is real this is really important so it's not for all sprites if you click this it's going to be wrong if you click the ok button for all sprites it's going to be wrong you have to do it for this right only so there we have it but we have to hide some variables right now and these three so you can also um change the backdrop the backdrop is we can also we can change to a basketball a gym that's called gym no pass basketball one so there we have it and for the code we need to get the sound first i i did dubstep so let's just search up dubstep yep dubstep and when the green flag is clicked it will forever play sound dubstep until done so until done and you also have to work on pico and first you need when the green flag is clicked um set player 1 hp to 100 so i'll have 100 hp when you start a point in direction 90 because it's facing right go to this position but i'm going to make it go to more in the middle so maybe here maybe let's do negative 180 0. and then um set rotation style left right um so one will not flip around we'll want flip over and i'll set speed to zero speed speed so i made a mistake and i put speed inside the beach ball so i'm gonna delete the speed variable from the beach ball and go make speed for pico for this spiderman only the speed so and then it'll set speed to zero go forever change y not set y change y by speed and if on edge it will bounce so this is pretty simple um when the when the w key is pressed www w key is pressed i'll set speed to three you just have to duplicate this and it's still set speed to three but it's set minus negative three so it's s negative three so as you can see i'm just to try it it's w and d so right now we haven't coded everything yet as you can see it's it's working correctly it's going up and down once we click it once so there okay so so when the green flag is clicked it'll go forever next costume like it'll forever change costume and 0.1 seconds for until changing back to the same next question so 0.1 second so we do not want to do it inside here because it will mess up the code and it has a weight so it will mess up the code very and it'll injure the code basically so let's just keep on going so when the green flag is clicked it'll go forever if then touching tennis ball we do not have the tennis ball yet but we can get it from the sprite library right now that's the tennis ball that the other dude throws so if then touching tennis ball tennis ball then it will broadcast player one got hit so we'll be still working on player one so when when i receive player one got hit it will change player 1 hp by 7 and if then player one hp equals zero that means it'll broadcast player two win because player two killed player 1. so i'm gonna just do this real quickly broadcast player 2 win and then when i receive player 1 got hit it will say ouch for one second so we put the ouch in a separate thing because um if you put it here it will mess it up and if you get hit twice it'll only register only once so that's why we need it in a different um broadcast so i'll show you later so we're gonna work on the beach ball so when the green flag is clicked um it will set player one ball counter to zero you know hide when when i receive no when the key d is clicked because press you will press yep if then the player one ball counter is less than two player one ball counter then i'll create clone of myself because we don't want to spam and like keep on clicking the d key and drink so much balls everywhere so yeah and then another thing for the code for the beach ball is when i start as a cologne change player one ball counter by one you i'll go to player go to play go to the pico so i'm gonna change him to player one i'm gonna change his name to player one so go to player one it will show and point towards player two because you're basically hitting player two so point towards player two we do not have player two yet but we can so i will duplicate this duplicate and here's player two they will not have the same code but i will do that later let's go back to the beach ball and point towards player 2. repeat until you need an or statement no or operator function touching player two so that's when it's touching the player two or touching edge so not there but duplicate and then more touching player or touching the edge it'll move six steps change so after this not inside it will change player 1 ball counter by 1 and delete this clone so to disconnect this code right over here or else it will not work right now so i will disconnect that and i will replace it later and fix it so so our beach ball is all done and our player one is all done too so yeah i'm gonna test it let's click save now and as you can see his balls out and yeah so yeah so we just have to fix the player two code so when the green flag is clicked they'll set player two hp and set player one hp to 100 point in direction negative 90 point direction negative 90 set rotation center left right set speed to zero forever change y by speed and if on edge bounce so that's we we need that so instead of touching tennis balls touching beach ball then broadcast player two got hit player two got hit and instead of w it's up arrow instead of s it's down arrow and then when i receive player two got it change player two hp by negative minus ten and then if player player 2 hp equals 0 then broadcast player 1 win complete opposite so i'm going to change this to player 2 got hit and and then i'll broadcast player one win because so we'll be working on the tennis ball now so when the green flag is clicked you might have to change the size of this so i'm going to change it to 215. yep that's around the same size and then beach ball um you just have to drag everything into the tennis ball and then you just have to change it up a little bit so just drag everything i hope that's everything yep that's everything you go here so one two three okay there's three scripts that's correct and then instead set player two ball counter to zero and then instead of d it's left arrow and then and then i'll change this to player two ball counter and so i just did this player two goals i just change it you have to right click the variable and then you can change it and then over 2 and create call myself that's correct and then when i start as a clone change player 2 ball counter by 1 go to player 2 show point towards player 1. repeat until touching player one or touching edge move six steps and then change this to player two ball counter so i might change the color of player so costumes i'm going to change all of his co um costumes to blue maybe this one and then i'm going to use the fill change this this this this this and this right and i'll have to do it for all of them so i'm almost done please ctrl c and i'll just change this to the eyedropper and do that and pick a walk for and yep we have it and yeah we also have to do that you win spread so i have it inside my backdrop right here so i have the player two wins so the one sprite so i have all the costumes here so the first costume is player one was second couplers player two wins so yeah so when the green flag is clicked it will hide when i receive player one win oh show and switch costume to costume one which is the player one win this one because player two wins second costume and stop all you have to duplicate this and change this a little bit player 2 win instead or show and switch costume your costume too and also stuff all so there you have it so i'm just going to demonstrate it to you guys so let's swipe so i'm the blue my father is red and so i'm gonna shoot twice so that that's it for this video please like share subscribe and comments in the comment section below see you guys
