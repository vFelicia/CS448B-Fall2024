welcome back guys it's kids counting playground here and today we're back for another video on memorial day as you know no memorial day is tomorrow on monday so happy memorial day and i'm gonna show you the project that i made for memorial day so let's see it to play some music there's cloud fighter jets and two little army soldiers and a flag this is at least i know i'm free and i won't forget the men who died who gave that right to me it doesn't happen memorial day and this is just a nice animation you can shoot if your grandfather or your father is a veteran so yeah um yeah thank you for all the uh troops and the things that saved america so um in my original project i actually had god bless america and amazing grace but i used god bless america on my original project but i'm pretty sure youtube will give me a copyright strike if i actually play it on the video because it's copyrighted and you can if you want these sounds instead of the scratch sound you can go to our project and export the sounds so yeah so yeah export there's the button yeah right click and export the sound so yeah anyways um let's get started okay so um let's get started we do not need the scratch cat so yeah with the paint some clouds so i did not upload the backpack so it's just white and we got to make an oval shape on one of the sides let's do that whatever so yeah so let's make up we have to make an oval shape on this side around that big i can't see a thing i should upload the backdrop to see if this is large enough and then make another oval about that big so here's cloud number one and you just move this one across to this side and you got cloud number two and then you can duplicate that again and ctrl c ctrl v the this one and you can put it over here so there we go three types of clouds and let's just get the backdrop blue sky so you can actually see it i'll decrease the size later or yeah let's decrease the size later so now i'm just going to make these smaller because i don't think of my original project i decreased them i'm just gonna make them just a little bit smaller so yeah uh i think there's the right size almost just gonna make this one a little bit smaller and there we go we got some clouds so now we're gonna work on the clouds so when the green slag is clicked go hide go forever create 0.9 weight 0.5 seconds and create clone of myself so when you get to create when i start as a clone of scent size to um a pick random size because some clouds are larger than others if you didn't know you've probably seen the sky before so yeah you guys cassette size pick random 50 to a hundred percent some clouds are larger than others so now it'll said ghost effect because clouds have a faint color they're not colored to clear so it'll set ghost color set ghost effect to 50. so it'll be faded and it'll switch costume to pick random one to three so it depends which costume you're gonna put so and now we're going to put a go to go to x negative 200 and pick random 75 to 100 random 75 to 150. so now we have the x and y like where it's gonna glide and everything so we're gonna finish this we're gonna have a show and we're gonna have a repeat until uh we have x position is greater than 250. which is right here if it's greater than 250 around here then it will change x by pick random five to ten and delete this club so let's see the clouds now oh then we got the clouds okay they're on the top and now we're going to work on the flag in the flagpole so this might take a whole while because of the fact that this has over 70 costumes and i'm recording right now and it just takes forever oh i actually went pretty quick it wasn't that bad sandwich costumes 75 so uh the flag we have to draw the flagpole for the flag of course because why would you just draw a random flag with no flagpole so the flagpole uses to paint a new sprite and you need to make a really really long long long long long uh pole so about that big and i'm gonna make the oopsies and then i'm gonna make the top of the flagpole yellow let's go for like that type of yellow cool oopsies no outline so shift and draw a perfect circle right on top and so now we put the flagpole on the ground and we put the flag on the flagpole so there we have it but first we have to do the flagpole and make looks and go to back layer front layer and then we click it so we'll go to the front and we delete it so that's how it is with the flagpole and now the flag all we need to do for this one is you know the flagpole and for the flag all we have to do is when the green flag is clicked it will go to negative 70s it doesn't matter it's fine and it will set ghost effect to 25. ghost effect to 20 now 25 and it'll go forever and go next costume as you can see i'm going to code the flagpole real quick to make it stay at this spot so when the green flag is clicked it will go to this position so that's all we have been possible and so let's see so we got the flag we got the flagpole we got the clouds moving so we are probably halfway i mean like we don't have much so now we need the fighter jets number one and number two and yeah you can download from the google drive or export it so when the green plug is clicked it will hide go back a layer it will wait three seconds so the first plane the second plane around the same coat just slightly different and we need a forever loop and a show and we also need a go to x two negative 225 and why a hundred oh yeah let's see yeah so it'll go to here yeah i already got the coordinates right here but then it will glide one second to negative 225 uh oh positive 225 and positive 100 so now we have that you know high and wait a pick random of seconds pick random one to five seconds as you can see the fighter jet is about see look we have the fighters and now this is around the same code so we're going to just going to drag this thing in and when the green file is placed instead we put it five seconds and then the planes come at different times negative 225 so i'm going to change the y to zero and i'll glide one seconds to 225 zero i'll pick random and there we go we got fighter jet number two and now we just need the soldier now all now we need this soldier and so yeah let's save this you want to see it first military plane they're both coming at the same time so yeah basically get the point so let's just look at uh the soldier statue number one the one that's like kneeling down when the green flag is clicked it'll go to 100 negative 62 and it will go to the front layer and it will show and the soldier standing will when the green flag is clicked it will go to and then it will go to this position and we'll go to the front layer and show so you don't really need the show but just in case if you're like uh playing with it and seeing the project that means uh i advise you to put the show just in case so now we have to work on the text it'll take me forever to type this so i decided to backpack this so it's just and i'm proud to be an american where so you basically get the point at least yeah so um you just have to type one segment at a time so just type them one by one like and on stuff like that so uh the best way is to cut write it all and then slowly delete it down so i'm going to show you some copy this real quick so i pasted it and look so to make the first one duplicate and uh well you can do that and then and then the first one you just do that and then you delete all of this and i'm i think i actually started as i'm and i'm proud to be american so all i have to do is duplicate that and then i'll go to here and then i'm proud so yeah you basically get the point and you slowly make it to a whole sentence and yeah uh to be i'm proud to be an american but i don't really remember the whole thing but like you know like yeah so you basically got the point so yeah uh or you can just export right uh sprite if you're if you just don't want to type it uh so now we're gonna do this when the green flag is clicked it'll go to 488 already there it'll hide it'll switch costume to costume one it'll wait 10 seconds and it will start showing so we'll go to the front layer oh show and repeat 17 times through all the costumes starting from number two because number one 18 costumes so 17 times wait one second next costume so if you want to make like more costumes than 18 then you probably got to do repeat 18 times or something 19 times and then next costume and then broadcast happy memorial day um happy memorial day and um i'll wait five seconds and it will hide the last thing we have to do is the no not the elastic but like we have to do the uh the spinning on the happy memorial day but right now i'm going to show you it so you got everything you got the planes you got the soldiers and it'll start saying it and i'm proud okay so yeah you get the point okay so uh now all we have to do is the spinny spin for the memorial day happy memorial day and then i'll go costumes and yeah you just have to write happy memorial day regular layer okay uh sorry uh you just have to write it and then yeah and just use text and you can use handwriting like what i did and then or you can just export the sprite if you just don't want to do it and when the green flag is clicked it will go to zero negative 100 it'll hide and when i receive happy memorial day i'll point in direction 90 and it'll go to a front layer so then it will be in front of everything it will show set turn to zero so you have to make a vr variable turn zero i'll go forever and change turn by four so slowly go like so you get the point the change turn by four and then it'll turn there's a tricky part turn 15 degrees you get that but then you have to get this this block abs of abs and you have to put costs cos of divide turn divided by 2. that gives it the turn effect so this is more if you know it'll turn and make a positive number or a negative number and it will that makes it turn left and right so we have one last thing to do and it's the sun so yeah just put it drag it up there doesn't matter where you put it you can put it on the ground if you want to uh and then all you have to do is oh yeah we have one thing add the sound you know go to this and then i'm also going to make it go to the back layer so yeah uh and this backdrops so when the green flag is clicked it'll set volume to 20 percent and it will go forever and play a sound called dance slowmo okay this one and it we'll play this until done so yeah you can download the other sounds like amazing grace and god bless america and i don't want to play this because that's copyright oh yeah we have to name it to memorial day let's look so yeah you basically get it so um i saw the sun was in front of the airplane so i'm gonna make sure the sun is always in the back layer by putting a small weight in front one second away and i found that i spelled happy memorial day wrong happy has two peas not three peas so as you can see the planes are in front of the sun now and the soldiers and the flag and everything so so yeah i skipped a little bit so yeah you yeah it's working so yeah please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below what else games you want so anyways goodbye oh yeah and some people commented um their comments and some people wanted a godzilla versus kong thing because it was on um hbo max or something and i haven't watched it yet uh i i've heard that some people said it was not that good but let's still let's see and we have ninja versus zombie game and uh so and we
