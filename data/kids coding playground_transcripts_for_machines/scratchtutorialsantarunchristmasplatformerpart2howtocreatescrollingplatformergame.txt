hey guys welcome back to kidscoolingplayground so today is january 1st 2021 so uh happy new year to everyone around the world i will continue with the uh this center uh platformer school platform game uh we did uh so as you can see we have the center here sliding down and then you have the main character uh so we have two costume okay the shorter one for the slime center and the taller ones for the standing up center okay so that is how that is i think uh some of the uh viewer asked us if we could give you all the uh ground sprite uh i only gave i think the first four uh because i want you guys to make your own it's pretty easy to do uh you just have to just copy from the previous one and then just add some stuff like from the bottom here you have the tree and everything right so you can just take that and then kind of edit it it's pretty easy okay if you don't know how to do that just watch the first video again okay so uh without further ado let's go on to the code itself um we are going to create a few variables uh so first we're gonna create some of the global variable so for global variable meaning is for all sprite i just have it as a g and then underscore so that way it's easier to to see right for all the uh variable that is uh for all sprite only so first we're going to create one called animation type so this one will help us to chat track what the player is animation type is like is dying or jumping or running stuff like that so we'll take one of that okay so next we'll create another one for our g underscore direction so this will kind of keep track of the player's direction so left and right then we're gonna go create one for gravity uh i mean i i had the gravity as a negative one i mean you don't if you don't want to use the gravity variable you can just have it negative one everywhere but i think having a gravity variable later we can change it or you know if you want to change some other place you have to just use the variable it's it's quite easier okay i said i did the same thing similar in the manga so i'm gonna go a little bit quicker on this uh since uh if you guys have not worked on this uh among us i suggest you work on that one first before you come to this one so this one's a little bit more complicated than the among us platformer because this one is like scrolling and then we change some of the code related to how how they use a sprite movement okay so next one we have g underscore is player dead so this will keep track if the player is dead or not and then and then we can you create one more rg mouse position so this will help us to you know when we're putting items or stuff on the ground or traps so we can uh check where it is and then next one is g on ground so this will check if the player is touching the ground or not okay so next we'll create a g run so this will keep track of the player running and then we are going to have the global variable for scrolling x and then make one more g uh right now we're not using the scroll y but in future you know another game you know you have a platform that scroll up we can do that so let's not create that for now let's not use the scroll white we're only going to use scroll x for now so this one doesn't have a scroll y for this game um okay let's make one more g will slide so this will keep track if the player is using the slide motion uh for the centers to slide down okay uh we'll have a few more uh g underscore uh speed x and then we'll make one more this is the velocities for the jumping ah okay after that we'll make a uh so be sure to have it on the main character here and uh we are going to make some um for this sprite only so i'm going to use the lowercase for jumping okay and then um okay so i am going to have this one the deviation for this sprite only it wrong sorry deviation okay we are going to make a few more variable uh for this sprite only as well we are going to say change x so this is for the scrolling part we will be using that then we'll make a few more say that uh i think we'll do level so this one now just because we are doing display we're not going to use the g so that will show up on the screen and then we'll make one more for life like how many light the center has okay we have a few more i know we have a lot of variable so this one is score for the score like when they collect the uh points and oops sorry and then we'll make some more uh so this one is for the sprite only we're gonna have something called start position x so this is for the position x for the sprite only make another one start position y so this is for also for scrolling okay okay so we have everything i believe that we needed at this time uh the timing and everything we can do that later so let me remove some of this we don't need to see this for now let's take out all these and we are going to only keep track of the level and the life and the score for now okay so maybe level can go here live can go here and then score can go into the middle all right okay so we are going to go to the custom block we're going to make our first block called reset okay you can click on the run without refresh for this one really really doesn't matter but run well refresh is probably faster but this is basically we're going to reset the variable what we're going to do is going to put the center somewhere like 200 0 so we'll drop down and then we are going to reset our variable so let me zoom in a little bit so here we'll say set so we're gonna reset the first variable if player is dead we're gonna say uh false so he's not dead okay then we'll duplicate this uh we'll do the uh gravity and the uh velocity and stuff like that so the velocity will reset it to zero uh on the ground we're gonna put it zero on the ground as well and then the uh we are going to put the uh um velocity of h of gravity so gravity we are going to use a negative one so fall down one one step i'm in one small position the y we're gonna use that and we are going to um something called g animation so this is the animation type kind of reset that to zero and then we're gonna use the uh g scroll x scrolling so we don't have y we don't need scroll y and then we need jumping so we have reset the jump also so jump is the uh for this sprite only okay so reset that okay okay we're gonna create some um sound uh for that so we are actually using a um something called um the list so using a list we can have like different uh position uh for the uh item later on and also the sound so we're gonna use that so for now let's create some of the list variable okay make a list so here we go global item x position list okay i'll make another one item y position list so i'm creating all the variable up front here so that way you guys can you know refer back to it if you need it later on so don't have to go to a different type of video so that's why i'm creating all this at the front so this is item type list and then one more this is a sound list so okay so these are all the lists that we are going to be using so this will keep track of the item where they are and what type they are so you can have many type of item and this is the sound okay all right so we're going to create a block called clear list you can say run without refresh here it really doesn't matter for this one so we are going to clean up the list so say delete um delete all okay so we are going to say okay x position y position the type and the sound okay we're going to create another block and shall i sound okay so uh this one what we want to do is we're going to initialize the sound array list for that so that way later we will use it to play the sound so when we jump it will only play like one time so the among us when i had it the sound you know when you jump it will it'll play the sound multiple times right when you're holding down the up key so in order to fix that we'll use this um this is actually better so for now what i'm going to do is i'm going to run a loop through so here uh i only have like a couple of sounds so if you have more sound you have to initialize the loop uh the with the loop higher so let's just initial i5 i don't have too many sound actually uh just a couple of sounds like jump sound later if you want to add like other sound and you can initialize it higher so i'll explain more later on so for now let's do a repeat five time and then let's go back to the variable we are going to say add okay zero so uh zero midnight is not playing the sound one is playing the sound so like zero is like a boolean value right it's false one is true so we're gonna use zero and one so this is an initial i uh basically when i run this you see that the sound list will have five things so let's say if i click on this right if i show the sound list you see it will have five zero okay so that's what it does so when i clear this it will delete everything okay so these are the uh um the block for us currently for resetting the sprites and all okay all right next we'll go to the uh when the green flag is clicked we are going to say uh set so we're gonna set set the level to one so first level and then we are going to set the live so let's give him five okay and um we are going to set the size of the cent uh set size to 30 but i might it's already 30 but i'm just setting again just in case and then we are saying go and say show so this is for the black main character okay and then what we're going to do we are going to broadcast and wait so this one we're going to broadcast i'm going to start new level and wait so what this is going to do is going to set up the whole game for us okay okay so we had created some of this custom block right so the reset what we're going to do is we're going to call the clear list and initialize sound so later we call reset or call all these things together okay so okay that's good so far so now let's move on to the next part so we have something called start new level right okay so we're gonna use this when i start as a new level i'm gonna call this reset so every time a new level will start it will reset all this stuff and then i am going to broadcast a couple message here so we will broadcast one message called reset so this one is actually going to help me reset the other sprite like the enemy the spikes and stuff like that at the position so that's why we did that and then we're gonna broadcast another one called setup so the setup will actually help me to set up all the sprites the reset will delete all the clones on the on the other stuff okay and then we'll call one more here this will say start game so start game will be the message that actually helped to start the game okay so this is starting a new level new level we'll call the reset set up the everything and then call start game okay okay so we have this start game uh what we're going to do is we say start game and then we'll go to look uh we are going to say change change calls effect by 100 okay so we have the change goals effect 100 so that will hide the main character but we still need to have this watch show so that way you know it will be when you touch the ground it will be push the character back up basically you need that in order to uh you know have the character be standing on the ground okay next we are going to use the repeat until okay so we'll grab a repeat until put it down here and we're gonna get an operator here variable and put this here so basically we'll repeat keep on doing this until the player is dead we are going to set the position the starting position okay and uh the x position and then we gonna start to the y position okay stop this thing okay and then we are going to broadcast a message and we're going to call this start all control okay all right okay all right let me uh continue here let me take this guy out okay we're gonna make a new uh my block it's called movement control so select run without refresh here okay okay so we're gonna work on this movement control here okay we are going to get this so use the if and else here and then we are going to use the operator a n get another n okay i'm going to explain what this is going to be okay okay so oops we'll put this out here then so when key down is press down arrow and then we are going to duplicate this a right arrow so basically to slide you're gonna push it down on the right and then we are going to have one more check make sure like the animator um the type is zero so basically we want to make sure the user is not dead uh the player okay so this is a animated type we're gonna say zero because that's the defining that player is not dead so we're gonna put all that in here okay all right so what we have to do is we have to go through the slide first because life's combined with the right and left so i don't want the left and right arrow key to work while sliding so we have to put this first into here before we do the uh the left and right movement okay and then we are going to use another one called if another if inside here so this one is important you guys can pay attention here we're gonna use the not and then we're gonna use the equal and then we are going to use costume number two so we have custom number one and two basically there's a shorter one and this is a longer one so this is two and this is one so basically if it's not two we are going to switch the custom to two so basically if you're doing a slide i want to use the small costume this one okay so the hitbox is smaller okay okay and then we are going to say set and inside here say set the direction let's set it to right okay and then duplicate that uh set the run to zero so he's not running so basically one make sure that he's not running and set the slide to one one min is a true okay so that means he's sliding and then you can set the speed uh x to 10 so when it's sliding we're gonna make him go a little bit faster okay next we are going to have a if an else statement again down here i'll grab this uh if and else in the control put this in here okay and then we are going to duplicate this one on top i'm going to put it down here so now we're gonna do the left key okay left arrow key and then same thing uh put this here sorry and then we'll put this inside here okay so it's not costume 2 we're going to use the small costume and this time we are going to say left okay and then the speed we're going to say negative 10 so this is going backward okay the left side okay now we are going to the final else here we are going to take this block again so this time will be a little bit different we are going to check if it's not number one so that means this is not the sliding motion they're gonna do the running motion so it's not number one we are going to switch it to number one okay okay so we're gonna grab another if and else we're gonna put it inside here ah let me see i did not hide anything behind it yeah i did move this down a little bit okay all right so now we're gonna check the left and right movement we're going to use the operator and and then we're using the key again so now we're going to check the right arrow key and same thing the animator type is uh still zero so it's not that the play is not that then we're gonna let them move so here we are putting right okay slide will be uh run will be one okay and then slide will be zero and then this will be positive seven okay so uh running is a little bit slower okay and then the else part we are going to throw another if and else can do okay so let's grab one more if and else condition put it in here duplicate this put it here this will be the left key and then duplicate that put this in here it's gonna go go left okay and then run this one slide is zero and this is negative seven okay all right and then otherwise we're gonna put all this inside here can't delete this so nothing here zero for running zero for sliding and zero for the speed so that's like when it's idling okay okay so we are going to go to the center what we're going to do is we're gonna make the center follow it real quick we'll do a quick code to test okay so go to here so when green flap is clicked okay uh we're gonna set the size to 30 as well so 30 size and then we are going to set the rotation style here okay left to right so this is the same thing as selecting this in the middle okay and then we are saying say go to go to front layer okay and then we're gonna say show okay and then we have the event last time right we broadcast some event which is called uh start all control we are saying we're gonna make it go to the main character okay so for now that's what we're going to have let's just check it out okay so before we do that we have to call the custom block right we just created here this movement control so where's my start all okay so we have this dot all control right so same thing for this we are going to say when i receive uh start all control we're gonna call this block let's see if it works i'm not sure i think it does let's see run it let's see nope not working yet okay so you know we're only setting the speed right we actually haven't moved the move uh the hitbox yes so we actually have to create another uh custom block for that okay so we'll go say more hitbox okay run without refresh okay so we are going to put it here for now oh we forgot uh put one for the parameter here say speed x okay all right so let me zoom in a little bit so here we are going to say change x okay by the speed x so make sure you guys use change check not set x okay and then we are going to say set the uh okay set the deviation here to zero and then we are going to say use the repeat until and use the all operator and then use this and then grab the deviation equal to eight so this is kind of actually testing if the hitbox uh hit the platform or not later on okay and then we are going to um so maybe we'll do that next time so let's just say move the hitbox for now okay we'll do this next time so i think it's uh taking a long time so we'll say move the hitbox and then changing the x okay so we are going to broadcast another message here new message check platform detection okay so we will set that up for next time so this check platform detection we want to use here and then for this check platform detection we are going to call the move hitbox okay and we are moving with the g speed x which is set by the this okay so for now let's just use this let's just check it out okay so i can change my uh loops i forgot to put this back to 100 i was testing something earlier so we'll hide this black box let's test it out so as you can see the santa claus is moving right but um it is not it is not changing like the slide and all that stuff right but uh so far it is moving okay so this is where we are so far so our next uh next tutorial we'll walk on cinder making him turn around moving and and then some sliding and then some platform um detection okay so this is what we have so far all right so if you guys uh miss anything uh just take a look over here so this is what we have so far for this on top okay and then this is the movement code okay you can pause the video if you need there's a lot of code here and then we have the uh control okay the start game and then the control and the move hitbox all right so this is the end of the video thanks for sticking around guys i will see you guys next time and don't forget to like share and subscribe to our channel and if you enjoy the video give us a thumbs up that's a good way to support us thank you see you guys next time bye
