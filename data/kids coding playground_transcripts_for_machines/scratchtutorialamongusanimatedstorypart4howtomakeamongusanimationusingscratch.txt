hello guys and welcome back to fitzcalling playground so today we are going to continue with this series um the uh among us animation this is part four so um let's just go over what we had last time we did the club we did the uh the shooting with the laser gun the infinity garnets right so now we can work on the lightsaber and then also we'll finish the stage one to stage three we can work on stage four so as you can see these are the the code for the uh the cyan sprite so far so if you miss anything you can kind of pause it and kind of take a look okay and the manga sprite this is the uh the one that they have multiple costumes that you could like kill them and then door here okay orange i don't think we have anything i don't think any of these have anything i don't think so and they might have some like just moving here and there but nothing much uh the sonic power this is that then i think we have the portal this is how you go into the portal from stage to stage this is the club we have that call ready the gauntlet so this is uh the code for number three on it and then we don't have this i don't think so nope not yet not yet and we have the story continue this is the beginning when we switching the the uh when the starting the episode and then the power one yeah we have this when we at stage four will hide it okay that's about it okay and then we have some code in the background okay so so let me take this out so that the sound will not come you know a little bit better while we're testing okay all right um okay so we'll start with the cyan i think i want to get to the full stage we need to put them at some position right so what we're going to do is we're going to go to the fourth stage i mean you can select the stage 4 here and then just kind of you want to put them at whatever stage you want so like let's say you want him to be on this side or this side doesn't matter um i think on my code i had it on this side so we'll just keep it like that for now okay we just duplicate this call this uh stage four right back grab four we'll put him at negative 192 98 is fine then we have 198 here on this one and then with the mixture we'll point in direction 90 because we want to face the right side and then switch costs to one and show okay so it'll be somewhere here okay and then i'm going to go to the uh the among the sprite which is this one so for my manga sprite and i had on him on this side so we'll keep it on this side so as you can see the door can't come up because i push the uh i push to start and then i switch it to that one so the door shouldn't be here for stage four so don't worry about that when we run the code will be fixed so let's duplicate this let's put this for stage four we kind of have it nicely organized so that way you know you kind of know where things are so what i'm at this point is fine and that's fine so hope he's somewhere on the right here okay and then he's facing this side so negative 90 meaning he's facing this side finn's left so what we're going to do next is uh work on the uh the lightsaber okay so the lightsaber has old cold i think the lightsaber and the rings always work on both so the ring is kind of like a circle kind of thing of blue thing okay so we're gonna make that kind of next to a lifesaver so um what we want to do is uh when start okay event when green flag is start screen file is clicked so what we want to do is we want to hide it in the beginning we don't want to show that the sword right and what we want to i'm going to grab a forever loop here and motion we'll say go to cyan okay and then point in direction just like how we did before right in direction of the cyan character okay so we'll take this take this put here select cyan and back and then select direction okay and then we'll grab some if an else statement uh basically we're trying to match the sword chart on his hand so you can't move it so i already did it so i know the coordinates for it so what we'll do is we're going to grab the equal here nope sorry great okay so we are going to take this so you remember we were talking about the direction right it was um sorry stop so uh when we say it's a greater than zero meaning is actually pointing to the right then what we want to do is we want to move the sort somewhere to the right here right okay so you have to say set set x duplicate this say cyan exposition uh and then a weather add some value because this kind of would have moved into a little bit further because if you put it just exhale be in the middle of your stomach so that doesn't look good over 75 push it out a little bit okay and then we'll duplicate this and what we want to do is on the other side we're going to push it to negative 75. okay and then we want to set the y sorry now we'll set the y set y outside here and then we're going to use the inside x position we'll use the y position and then we'll move it up a little bit so i'm going to say plus 25 move the y position okay all right so so if i click on this so let me move him over here if i click on this guy i'm gonna go back to my lightsaber you don't have to run the whole call again so what you do is hey where's the code oops that was my mistake click on the wrong sprite when i was coding so we're going gonna just drag this all the way put it on this guy we're gonna go here okay instead of d3 so we're gonna clean up the code in the ring sorry about that that was my mistake drop this okay should be in this site saver so we're working on the lightsaber at the moment okay and then we are going to use event when the number four key is pressed we want to show this guy and it is not in progress okay if nothing is not talking or something like that so grab this over here and then operator not and then we use the equal variable outlook in progress not yes meaning no okay and we're gonna say go to front layer show okay we're gonna have to broadcast a message here say saber spin so this will spin the saber uh wait for two seconds and then hi okay so let's just try it out so when we run it okay we're gonna push four so you can see that it actually here right it's in the side so you see if i'm on the right side on the left side right uh right side the saw is facing left when i'm on the on the on this side the soil is facing the other way okay so the light saber is working so what we want to do is we're going to put the little ring around the right lightsaber uh we're gonna go back to the ring the cover the ring so similarly you know like the cold for the uh for the sword so we want to do something similar but we will not be using this cyan we're gonna have to look at the position of the lightsaber so what we can do is take this code drag it to the ring okay so now the ring has this code so what we want to do is we want to go to the lifesaver instead okay and then you have to use the direction of the lifesaver okay and then same thing right the lightsaber is greater than zero okay the direction then we would put the tens in lifesaver here so make sure you change all of them okay here's a plus 10 and this i will do a lifesaver minus 10. okay and then we want to move it up a little bit so lifesaver 25 is good okay and this one make sure you select the y position okay sometimes when you copy over this thing get messed up and it changes the the code a bit so so this is so far that so this part is done so zoom out a little bit we'll the effect of a spin right so but before that let's grab the uh one grab another stop when it's like flap is clicked what we want to do is we're gonna say clear the graphics effect then say hi and then say forever okay we are going to change the you know we're going to change the uh the little bit on the on the ring so some effect but let's just use the fish eye okay okay by 50 and then we're gonna wait zero one so we're gonna make it pretty fast okay like one tenth number one ten maybe 100 of a second here i guess you can try different way see which one looks better for you so let me just i think this is what i had earlier so let me just try like this first see how it looks if we need to change it we can change it so put it back next 50 so positive 50 other 50 negative 50 negative 50 okay so let's see how it actually looks so you see that so when it runs so you see how it kind of like this blinking kind of thing so that's kind of what we want okay all right so when we receive we remember we have a saber spin right so we're gonna call this for this guy so when we receive saber spin uh you're gonna make it go to the front layer so in front of the sword say show and then wait uh two seconds for it to show up and then we'll hide it hide the ring okay so let's test it out so now when we save number four you can see it's kind of like like that so like that so as you can see the among the sky is not dying right when we do the sword so what a call that so let's stop here and then go to the uh among us sprite what we need to do is kind of let's duplicate this one actually so instead of club uh select saber spin and now we'll say we're touching the rain actually so basically touching this ring what we want to do is um yeah repeat 205 is fine uh we can select a different effect like pixelated and let's try for five not completely gone right uh and then this one same thing so if it actually kill this one then it will open the door allows you to open the door open the portal let's just try it out so number four so you see how it pixelated it kind of died you can go into the door right so that's what we want to do so you can see and then it kind of got to kill him okay all right so this is working fine okay uh right now we're gonna call for backdrop number five which is like the group of uh among us kind of discussion in the uh voting right that's what we had in the beginning i mean on my um animation so we'll do that so go to here and we can just duplicate number four push it to number five so we want to kind of put him at this position so i had the coordinates already so i will just say 989 i mean it is 68 negative 68 and negative 10 so it will be somewhere like right here and then we're gonna put a table here and then put the other guys around and we're gonna face not even being put into the right okay and one thing is i want to make him to go to the back layer because he's in the back of the other guys right so let's put him in the back layer okay so in stage five you'll be at this position so same thing you know for other sprite that you have the code for right so stage five where to do something as well here okay we might not need to do anything with this among us i don't think stage five we're killing any of the manga so we might not need that so it'll be automatically high so what we need to do is we're gonna create the table right so the table let's select this first costume and then we're gonna have to put the among us uh guys around it so let's let's just hide this one for now so hide this one and we're going to hide this one so we'll get a little more space let's put on stage five here just see how it looks and we are going to put the table and let's see how that looks so in in stage five so you want to test something right so what you can do is you don't actually have to do all of them to to start from the beginning to the end right to test uh what you can do is go to your backdrop right and then you just say switch to say backdrop stage five so when you do that they will have all the code put it in place so when i hit this it actually runs the code for stage five here right so here's right here so what we see you see the tables coming we'll put some code for the table as well so the table i just showed it right so where to say you know like in the beginning of the table shouldn't show right only at stage five will show so let's go in the beginning first when green flag is clicked so we want to move the table is not broken like the table and then we want to say i think the dialogue setting i don't know where i have that about setting maybe here okay so here at this stage we want to um let's see the setting okay the dialog settings already know here so i think we do it with that so we don't need anything like that here says let's put them at this position or whatever position you like just grab that put it here and then we will say hi so high this so this in the beginning will high and then a stage five one one two one show it right so let's say switch back to stage five uh what we want to do is we're going to set this dialogue to yes i think that is actually talking so we don't want the uh the sign guy to attack them okay set dialog in progress say yes okay and then we're gonna show this variable i think the we had among us like that they choose thing like who was the uh the imposter i think uh so we'll put it somewhere here so we use that i think in the the first uh episode you actually use that later on and use the gold team so we'll just keep it the same okay and then uh we have a list so we want to show the list the name list on the side i think i have prepopulated this list with this and i think before actually we were going to pick a random but since we are going right now we are going to just make the gray guy to fly in space so what we're going to do is it's going to be always great okay so anyway we'll show this list so you say show if let's say the list is high you want to show it okay so we can say show this so when the stage file will show the list and then we'll say and then um we'll have to show the uh show this uh table right so what does it look show table and then we have to broadcast a message say vote so we're gonna vote here for this thing okay so when i receive vote um just gonna wait for a couple of seconds let's say three seconds it's trying to make it look like it's everybody's voting and then we have to say set so set the imposter i mean before actually we i actually had that pick a item you can say pick an item like i said right create an item and you can say that random right uh from this list right let's say two to six or something like that that's initially what the code has but since we have the uh the animation saying the great fly out right so we're not gonna do that so no need to do that so we're just gonna hot code this to gray so hardcode meaning you just put the same thing over and over again that's what we call hard code okay and then we're gonna broadcast another message we're gonna save new message say vote finish finish poll or whatever finish vote reporting okay all right stop this so that's done okay now let's call the uh the among us uh the brown one we'll put them you see when i click it it's over here so what we're going to do is let's finish up the table with all the uh among us sprite right so we'll say custom number one so brown one custom number one is this because number two is kind of is mad or something i just created that just draw a little you know draw a little squiggly line red squiggly line okay i group them together so so we're gonna stay with the first one and then we say clear graphic effect just in case you know they don't they destroy the uh the brown white so stage i mean episode three so we need to make sure that we have the clear graphics effect and then position we'll just keep it at this position and then we'll say hi so we'll hide in the beginning okay and then you know we have a backdrop five right just like how we did for the other one so i say when it's backdrop number five we wanna go to the front layer since he is like right here right he's right here so one making the front layer of in front of the cyan guy so say go here go to front layer and then show okay so we're done with him for now we'll buy to go back to him later to do some more code let's go to the green one so the green one is like somewhere here as you can see right okay so the green one same thing let's do one green flag click i don't know why i have the set rotation style on the green one not sure why i think maybe it's needed because he's spitting later on or something uh so i think uh after spinning right so i don't want him to spin again so that's why what this set rotation style left and right on number uh on backdrop on the under on the beginning right okay so just keep it like that okay and then we have switch to custom number one in the beginning so green as what so the other one is just put two water chocolate on him just draw the little uh you know the uh oval kind of thing and then it's like use the this tool so draw a circle and use this tool to reshape to the pull up to drop creative droplets okay so he's kind of scared so next is i want to clear the graphics effect and then we are going to put him at this whatever position that he is in right now and then we want him to point to the left side so negative 90 and then we'll hide them in the beginning okay and then when it hit backdrop five will show so we'll put back up number five uh what we want to do we want we want to put it at the same position just in case you know later on we these guys runs around we want to put them back in the same position right so so that way you know when you're testing you can just click on like a switch icon switch i mean switch the like this and then it will run the same code so it's always good to put the same position that you want okay and we also want him to go to the back layer actually for this guy because sense he's actually over here on this side we're here see if he is in the front there he'll be on the thunder table so we want to make sure that he goes to the back layer okay and then we'll say show okay so so far that's what we have okay so after green will work on purple so similarly purple also have the similar code let's just drag this to purple and let's drag this to purple okay let's fix it so purple will put at the different position um so i think where's purple propose this one okay so negative 90. so this is good so we'll put a different position for him okay so but same one same thing here and then we have the custom one we have to clear the graphics effect put him at this position pointing negative 90 meaning left side and then high him okay and then uh at the backdrop number five we can put the similar thing here just in case we need to reuse it later and then we want to make them go to the front layer actually purple's in the front all right and we can keep this actually we want that's fine just reset them just in case okay so because you can make him like turn around talking left and right so it's always good to have it the same so that you can retest it you don't want to start from the beginning okay so this is done um for now so purple will talk later but let's go to blue so similarly for blue we have the similar code let's grab purple's code let's move it to blue and then we'll grab the same thing move it to gray let's do that purple blue and great okay so next let's we'll come to first so blue similar okay i don't think blue have more than one costume so we don't really need but it's fine to put that no harm okay click graphical effect i don't think we need that we may not need that well we're probably good to have in case you know blue get killed later on or something uh with the hope uh with the portal and then final quarter right they sucked it yeah yeah right maybe blue will be part of that don't remember so yeah let's keep it okay let's keep that let's keep this this position with the change right and then blue house blue looking like he's pointing to the right side right so let's point into 90. okay so similarly we'll use the same thing about this part so blue should be going to the back layer send it back on the table we'll take this this here okay so we are good with that so far okay so blue is here and then what else we have gray like gray so let's take the same color as multigray oh i think we're ready so clear i have to go okay custom one that's fine so gray is what it is right here so we'll move to this position negative nine is good throw this away duplicate this one throw this away go to the front layer okay this is good so blue should be back layer okay this guy should be front layer bubbles from there okay looks okay so for gray he's gonna be the one who's getting bowled off right so we need to say when i receive vote uh finished voting okay so uh okay before actually i have a if condition because you know the impossible was randomly picked but um so we don't so you have to check it but since we we know it's always him so it might not need it but i had it before so we'll just keep it so let's go to variable uh imposter it's great so since we're setting grade right in the in here right then on the table right was selling crazy imposter right so it was great then you say or say something say no no gonna broadcast a message here okay i'm gonna do a broadcast and wait i think either one is fine we don't watch i don't think it matters okay so we'll say new message say see ya so this is for the uh for the for the uh scion to talk back so let's go back to cyan now okay so we'll coat it in the bottom here see ya okay let me zoom in a little bit so let's say take a look say here and we're going to use the join to get the variable name okay let's see put a module in here i think you guys played one of the uh question of the week right we said last time my apple banana how the joint looks right so this is basically this one joining this one putting it together plus another one here so let's say c yeah comma you can put a space so you want to join this variable imposter so impossible variable have what you actually have the word gray right in here right so we'll do that and then we say put a space here okay so put that so see a great space imposter okay so that's how it would look like so after this what we're going to do is we're going to test it once so we don't actually have to go from the beginning so just kind of click on this as you can see all the all the sprites are here okay that is incorrect since we did not click the start flag so this guy had this this icon right let's just click the start black once okay and then stop and that won't click on this so you see when you click on this you see how how the door is here so yeah so what we can do is this well to make sure that hides it away so let's just put just for now let's put this here okay and you don't really need it but since we we don't want to go from the beginning so we're going to kind of hide them like this so and let's put this also let's say drop 5 will hide this one because we're not using him right okay and then the door let's just say back your fiber let's hide the door for now okay so that way you know we can test it without the goal from the beginning and this one we have back up five high okay good so let's run it again right okay i'll stop it what i'm going to do is i'm going to click on this so you can see it hide everything and this one the list shows up and then say no uh so we're still missing something okay we need this imposter text right okay that's what we're missing okay let's go to the imposter text so you can control here so in the beginning we'll hide it okay and then when we get to uh backdrop number five we want to show it right so backdrop number five we're gonna make it go to this position where i see right now okay that's the emergence that's too high let's go to negative 18. and then say 150. and we want to use this costume imposter okay so we have to say switch to custom number one and then we'll say show okay now let's see how so we are going to click on this again so oh that's good so no no no it's not b so we'll still have some problem right so this variable is not showing the variable imposter it's not showing up so we need to make sure that show up when it's stage five i don't know when let's see i think it's at the table right so we'll show the list and then we have something like finished voting or something right we can use that okay let's do this in the beginning we'll say behind this hidey list also and hide the variable imposter okay when actually wait when we back to backdrop five we'll show it so show the this and the imposter how about that okay all right let's try it again so let's say this is high oops doesn't matter we'll get reset so let's say we we did not have this right and let's see what happened okay background five you see so so when it goes to backdrop five right let's see i think i have one mistake here so we we we need to clear this right in the beginning so whether say set okay enclosure to blank okay so now should be better so now let's try okay this will not clear because it doesn't stop right so yeah and then click start first so let's click start okay i'm gonna go here and hit background five so wait three seconds you can't pick say great no it's not me right okay so please say see ya okay so cyan the science say something okay let's try again okay how come that's so fast oh sorry put on the wrong spot okay okay now it's correct okay let's try it okay so no it's not me see a great imposter okay good so we're good here so we are going to stop right here uh the video is not too long so next we are going to kick him out on the space gonna make him kind of turn turn turn and then we will be done after that will actually will show the uh you know the uh this costume oops not this one i think it was this one so it will show this that you know he's flying through space and then we're gonna continue the other one all right okay so thanks uh for watching please like share and subscribe to our channel and comment down below you know if you have any questions all right see you guys next time bye you
