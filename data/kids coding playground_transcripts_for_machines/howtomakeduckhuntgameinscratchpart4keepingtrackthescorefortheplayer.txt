hey guys welcome back to the channel so today we are making part four of this duck hunt game we might be able to finish it today uh for this part so let's get on to it so last time we got the duck flying and we will shoot the duck and if you miss the duck flies away let me just demo it once here let me take this list off we'll need it in a bit so let's see let me put my volume down a little bit not too loud okay let's start so you can see the duck is flying so you if you shoot the duck the dogs comes out and uh if you if you miss the dog and then it flies away and then the dog laugh at you that's what we had last time so without further ado let's jump right in so we'll fix some issues so i forgot to make the duck uh like i'm making the duck sound so let's work on that for right now so where we had this so here we broadcast next stock so basically every time we the ducks fly calls this and broadcast next stock so we can use that method use that broadcast method so let's do that real quick so you say when i receive next stock okay uh what i'm going to do is go do a little bit of weight 0.5 and then i will get this forever loop and then i will get the operator and the if condition here let me zoom in a little bit sorry about that okay so let's get the operator same thing that we were using the tux shot right the variable to see if the top gets shot or not so zeroes mean no the duck is still alive then what we do is we're gonna play the sound i will pick this one duck sound okay after that we'll wait two seconds so we don't want to be too noisy on the duck okay so let's try it out real quick save this let's run it so you can hear the duck sound see see the duck mix okay so when you start it you see the duck sound right okay cool so that's done okay so what we're going to do is we're going to work on the duck uh after you know you shut the duck the duck died and then we want to restart it right so what we're going to do is we're going to go back to the doc you can see that the doc has something say start broadcast start again okay so after you caught the duck or you know the duck laugh at you they've called it start again right so using this start again we can start the the duck flying again okay so let's move on to the duck so what we're going to do is we're going to grab this say start again we're going to check get the operator here okay if condition so if the uh operator we're gonna use a greater than and we're gonna use this variable called dot count so basically if we have more than one duck i mean all the ducks are not dead yet right the account is greater than zero and we are going to allow them to call this block say fly duck fly okay so same thing we'll duplicate here and here we are going to do a weight so basically we don't want to duck immediately come up after it got shot we're gonna wait a little bit you can do whatever you like but uh for now we're gonna use like one two three second weight and then what we're going to do is going to reset this variable for the duck duck shot okay not the count but the duck shot so we're gonna reset this variable um sorry i forgot is if an else statement sorry guys sometime do it too fast i made a mistake let's drag this in here throw this away okay all right so the infinite statement so what we will use it for next level later so we'll use this count make sure that we have enough ducts we still haven't finished all the ducts so we'll after that then we'll wait and then we are going to reset the duct shot to zero meaning the duct is not dead yet and then we're gonna animate ducts so we're gonna call this enemy duct okay so basically these two will call the same block these two blocks here okay all right and then if actually when we finish all the duct test no motors then we can broadcast a new message uh something like next level so that is after you get all the ducks so right now if the duck is dead um you know uh the new duck will come out after three seconds okay so let's try it out real quick so you can see so after we shot the duck after you wait for three second one to three seconds we'll see a new taxi but we haven't fixed these yet so we will fix that but uh you can see right there's new duck coming out after the duck you know even if we let's say we miss the shot and it flies away i want to fix the shot here the shot is still not working so whether we set the shot right after the start again so let's do that okay so first let's go to the target so target what we're going to do is let me zoom in a little bit so i'm going to say start again so start again what we're going to do is we are going to call um stop add a script in the sprite and we are going to kind of duplicate this part here and we're going to call this so what we're going to do is we're going to stop out of script here stop the control when when you start again so and then we reset the dot uh shot to zero and then pull it and then control i guess if i did it here then i don't actually need to do it here yeah so here we already reset it right so actually i don't really need to do it here actually okay so i think that was a copy so it doesn't matter if you have this or not it doesn't really matter so we have the duck getting reset here so the enemy ducts or the duct will fly so you can take this out and just have the uh enemy ducts here and then leave this over here on this side okay all right how about like that okay we'll keep it consistent okay all right and then in the shot here let's go back here so we might need to make some changes here in the shot but before we go to that one let's finish this target then we have one more broadcast right we have the broadcast for the next level right so we broadcast next level we also want to start the script so we don't want the people be shooting you know when we are changing the next level or something like that so let's do that stop out of scripting sprite so i think we're pretty much done with this target so let's go back to shot here so in the shot here when we uh just like this one right when we receive um start again what we want to do is we're gonna switch the first costume all right back to the shot so switch costume to which is has the full wallet okay so this one right here okay all right so let's just test it out real quick okay all right so the stop spline so we shot him so you see i used up one bullet so he can reset it you see all right so you see dirt ducks come out reset so if i reset all my only bullet you see ducks flies away the dog laughed at me and then you know the bullets come back and then you see the duck okay so that is working so what we need to do is we have to fill out these ducts here okay all right okay so what we're going to do is we're going to duplicate this one so the duck two is similar to duck one this second duck here we'll put it here we'll move this guy somewhere here like this uh what we're going to do i already have to coordinate them so uh it is negative 20 and 150 okay and this one is a little bit different we're not going to do it here uh for the flashings one because since the uh the ducks will be a little bit different so we only want to flash it when it's actually that ducks being uh fly okay so we have to check something else so we don't want to do that there so what we're going to do is um also we'll change this piece here so we're looking at the second duck so we're gonna be using item number two from the list so basically this list item number two okay so we're gonna use this one okay so if it is one then we'll knock it as red otherwise it'll be white right if it got shot and then we are going to have another message here say um when i receive our next stuck okay so you remember the ducks here it broadcasts this message here next up when the duck fly so for the second one we'll have to use that okay so what we're going to do is we're going to wait for 0.5 of a second so they let the other stuff get set first and then what we're going to do is we are going to use the if condition here so we're gonna surround it like this so if the item so let's take this i will say zero so basically when the item number two is actually zero meaning the duck is starting to fly then we're gonna mop this guy and make it flash okay so this is marking zero that's happening here you see this when the duck fly every time it takes that index and replaces zero so they know which duck is is is the one that is active okay so similarly let's make just make another copy of this so we'll just show you how it looks like okay let's duplicate this this is number three so for number three i put in a different position it will be a negative five okay and then here we'll change it to three and then we'll change this also to three okay so i think that is pretty much it let's just test it out real quick okay so let's start you see i have three ducks all of them are white you can see zero let's flash in the first one right these are negative so i mean they haven't used yet so let's say i take out this guy so you can see this becomes zero and this starts flashing you see that so now this is the duct that's flashing so let's say i miss this so i miss this okay it becomes negative one and then mark the guy zero so this guy flash so now i hit this button so it will become red see that red because this is one so now this is number four duck says you can see it keep moving up keep moving keep moving right so if i shot it say number four becomes it and now number five right very simple so we use a list to keep track of that so very easy to understand so next we're just going to duplicate this okay one two keep going three four five six i think one more ten right so one to 10 so 10 ducks okay so we did number three right so number four so number four i have a coordinate as well number four i have it as 10 so that 10 we'll change this to number four let me put more together i guess you can see let me do this okay so change this to four change this also to four okay number five we'll change it to five five okay and the position for number five is let's see why i have it 25 okay oops 25. okay let's call number six six six and then what did i have 40 okay 40. okay so number seven seven seven okay and then 55 okay number eight go eight and eight and then what is number eight seventy okay number nine nine and nine number nine so basically this is number nine and then we are going to use um 85 number 10 10 and 10 here and number 10 is 100 okay so let's check it out so let's start you can see all the dots are lined up all these are negative ones if i shot one it becomes one so now it's zero then marking the zero one so you can see the third one marked at zero i missed so that flies away marks at negative one so now it's number four so as you can see right pretty easy to understand number five now is zero so you you get the point so let me just remove this for now you guys you guys understand now so let's remove so at the end you know just okay come on all right so at the very end after we finish everything what we want to do we can start a new level so i missed that not a good shooter i am not a very good shooter okay okay so i made a mistake here we need to fix it so we cannot put the weight here actually we put a weight here or actually messed up the last duck when it broadcasts the next level because what happened this duck fly here it has a count with the duck minus one so if if it starts again if it's subtracted the minus one would happen it will broadcast next level and that will stop the game so what we want to do we cannot use the weight here we're gonna have to move it somewhere else so what we're going to do is we're gonna look like this we're gonna move this so this one we actually going to move it to here you see here i put it actually here i added the code here so basically i added this weight here so before the duct shows up uh before earlier before it looks like this it doesn't have like this it looks like this exactly like this i added the weight here instead okay so don't put the weight on the uh start again they're actually going to mess it up so move that over over there and also at this point five of a second here so make sure that this block execute before this block because what happened is stuck fly it has the uh counter here so what happens if it does the counter it will try to if it runs really quick it might execute the next level which will stop the uh the target so in the last stock we couldn't shoot it so make sure you change that okay so it should look something like this so all right so make sure you have the 0.5 a second weight make sure this guy runs first then go to this guy this guy will do the subtraction of the duck count okay all right else it will not work correctly okay okay so that we got that out of the way and the weight is over here in anime ducks so now let's try it out so so same thing here we just shoot and then we get to the end the last stop so what we want to do is at the last stop uh we want to broadcast start a new level so that way you know we can restart again okay so what i'm going to do is going to paint a little sprite here it's going to put the text in we can choose any color we can use a gold or yellow and let's just use handwriting saying good job well done okay all right so what we're going to do is uh put it in the middle so we're going to duplicate this and then we're going to change the color for this one and then we'll the next one say not that not bad maybe you can say try again something like that i think that's why i had not too bad okay not too bad okay something like that doesn't matter so we're gonna put this in red or something so okay okay so what we want to do is um if the player makes more than seven ducks they get up seven out of ten then you know we can display the uh good job otherwise we can display the not too bad try again okay so let's go back to the code okay so when green flag is clicked i'm going to hide this okay so you remember we broadcast the thing say next level right uh from here right we have the ducks we broadcast and then say next level right when there's no more ducks so in here we say it is next level um what we want to do is we're going to create a new variable called index so this is for the loop we'll use it for the sprite only now what we're going to do is kind of look through it and see how many uh ducts the player have shot okay and then we're going to check the number of duck hit okay okay and then we will have another one here another variable says number so it doesn't matter for this prior or sprite doesn't really matter i think we can just use for this one um so here what we can do is um we'll set this to zero so now we're gonna try to see how many ducks this player had done you know shoot down so we use the forever foreign repeat repeat until now let's use this one repeat the number of times i will use the length the link of the duck shot list so basically we'll repeat 10 times we have 10 ducks right so here's a if condition here if we use operator and we're going to get the item item might item and then we're going to use the index so what we're doing is uh we're going to loop through the list and we're going to check if it's one so basically when we shoot the ducts we got the duck down then we mark it as one right remember this here right we shot we marked as one if we missed negative zero negative one and then zero is the one that's uh running so it is one that means the duck is dead um what we do is we're gonna count it okay and change by one okay and then make sure you when you use loop you have to increase the index okay change the index by one okay so that will go on and pick up the next next thing on the list i will go down and pick up each one of them okay and then calculate how many ducks this player hit and then we'll use the fnls here and then we use operator and put number of ducks here greater than seven so we have more than seven ducks you know we'll switch to custom number one else we'll switch to custom number two so number two is the uh no not too bad you know but try again kind of thing and then we'll do a show and then what we can do is i'll do a little wait here maybe three seconds or something before the next next game i'm gonna broadcast a new message called restart okay so this is what we have so far so what we're going to do is we're going to put the restart here in the restart we can we're going to do a little bit of weight because we have to set up something else to do away for one second and then we're going to hide this and then we're going to reset the duck count okay so the duck will have 10 ducks again and then we'll broadcast a message say start game so start game will have a brand new game and then we'll run this code again and then we'll run the docs code you know for start game um then it's like right here now we have to start game right broadcast.gaming english the same thing as where the dog after the dog kind of like looking for the ducks here broadcast stock game so the reset also does the same okay okay so stock game will you know do the stuff up here let me swear this let me zoom out a little bit okay let's see right here i guess right here start game so we'll do these kill okay and then start cleaning up the list remove the list add everything to negative one and then start the you know the game okay okay so what we need is um we have to go back to our little ducks here we're gonna have to reset all the ducks to white so we have the message of reset right so when we say restart um what i want to do is uh switch the costume to the white dots okay so we're gonna use we're gonna need this to all for all of them so just drag and kind of put them here three four and so on okay seven eight and ten okay so we have all of them so you can kind of move them here you like okay so that's why we need a one second delay on the restart we want to reset all the white ducts okay let's do that okay almost done start and restart okay so i think we're pretty much done let's see if it works okay let's try it out so let's make it a huge screen we'll take out this thing here my throat is killing me having a sore throat talking too much okay so let me take out these variable index number ducts okay all right let's start again so you have the ducks so i'll go through real quick here so let me just pause this i guess okay with the last stop so not too bad try again you see that and then it restarts and then you have the little dots again so i guess i can put this in the center right we can do like um center make it look go to center zero zero okay all right so let's try to win this time okay let me try to win this time okay let me pause this okay so we're at the last duck here so let's do this yes so i have more than you know seven ducks you see it says good job well done and then it starts over again okay i hope you guys like this tutorial so that's pretty much it that's the dirt we're done with the duck hunt and then you can do your own i guess the the thumbnail if you like okay so for the thumbnail i'm just going to just backpack this pretty easy just show you i'm gonna drag it over here so the thumbnail basically it's pretty easy this is the code for the thumbnail so uh in the beginning we just reset the timer and then if the timer is greater than 01.1 that means that when you stop then they'll show the thumbnail and then we'll hide the score we'll put this to the top and then we'll glide it down and then when this game is start we'll show the variable so when when you stop we should hide the score okay so that's pretty much it um i think that is everything okay yeah that's pretty much everything i believe okay so let's try this so yeah that looks good and then when we stop it the thumbnail comes down okay there we go so we're done with this tutorial it's kind of long so oh yeah so one more thing make sure you reconnect the dogs okay for the couple here remove this put this back trash this okay so now the uh when you play it you have the dog moving in the beginning and then they'll jump in the back and then i'll start the uh you know the game okay all right okay that's it all right guys thank you bye anyway i hope you guys enjoyed it and uh yeah give us a like and comment below okay and forward to your friend if they like to learn about scratch for our channel thank you very much and see you guys next time bye
