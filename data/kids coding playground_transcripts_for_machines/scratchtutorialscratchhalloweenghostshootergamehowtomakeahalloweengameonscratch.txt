welcome back guys it's casey on playground here today we're back for another video in scratch uh so today we're i'm back for another video but first i have to mention that look at this box here watch time from subscribers not subscribe 93.9 subscribe 6.9 look how much people are not subscribed to the people that are actually subscribed so would you do me a favor click that like button subscribe button uh share button uh comment comment yeah just comment and yeah so do me a favor and subscribe we get plenty of um questions on how if if you have like what uh oh do you have a halloween game do you have a money simulator game do you have blah blah blah do you blah blah blah blah blah so you can search this up search what halloween enter uh so you'll see all our halloween games from last year we have the memory card game and the feed the ghost part two we have the halloween game so we have a bunch of things for you to do so people are asking us a bunch of those questions so do that uh before you comment so this is the project i'll be making today called ghost shooter so ghost shooter is a fun game that we made like a few minutes ago so you just start this thing and as you see there's uh some music playing in the background or inside a hut and um you click to shoot and you can shoot the ghost down by shooting them you get score and look at the top left and as you can see whenever a ghost hits me my health decreases and then when it gets a certain amount of health it will um actually uh start flashing so uh and once you get you die more and yeah just to look a bottom right please look at the bottom right we have 10 health whenever you get hit by a ghost hit me ghost yep if you lose one you lose two i lost three and yeah this is basically the concept of getting hit so i'm gonna start a new project okay so the first thing we're gonna do you already know delete the scratch can and um um now we have to get our pumpkin our ghost our laser the hp bar and the game over but luckily most of the things are in the backpack for me to use but first we have to get the ghost and then we have to get the laser which is just the button so a bunch of people are asking me from different projects they're like where's the laser uh where's the laser it's just a button but then we just renamed it so if you actually look this part just rename it laser so um and then yeah that's all we need and then we're gonna make the game over and stuff later but we're gonna get the pumpkin we actually drew this from our last year's halloween game so put this in yeah from our smash the pumpkins game from halloween and we have to take the health bar which is actually really easy to make so if you don't know how to make it's just a bunch of squares and then you connect them together and duplicate them we're going to show you how to draw this um health part partially real quick so let's do this so uh we have this look we have the green we have the yellow we have orange so you get a fairly decent sized box and um let me get a box so you get green fairly decent and then you use the mouse ctrl c ctrl v and now you have your other box you connect them together and then you can do that again just say control v now you have four boxes and basically so on you get eight and then you ungroup them and get two and then you know it's real easy yeah we got two yep there we go so this is basically how you do it and then we wanted to be extra fancy by adding the little pumpkin on the uh side of the health bar so we just take this ctrl c ctrl v and it's really large but you know we'll just shrink it yeah so that's basically how you become fancy fancy and um and the coloring is you can like color it like any way you want but you know we advise green and then whenever you lose a life it turns gray so and one more thing yeah the death bar is all gray so i mean like you can make this orange if you wanted to but you know just how it is i'm going to show you the coloring method we have so the first three squares or green and then starting right here they become yellow yellow yellow and then we have the orange and then yeah so on and yeah so you just duplicate it like so oh you get the thing and then you change it it changes one gray square and then you're basically set and that's basically how we made the health bar so i'm gonna delete that real quick uh okay so uhoh what's that a little all right so um and now let's get everything set up so we have the witch's hut so that's our backdrop you use any other backdrop like woods i would also advise woods but i use witch's house because we barely use witch house only these woods and then ghost i think this is 50 if i'm not mistaken i'm pretty sure this is the size 75 actually i'm pretty sure it's 75 75 and then um the laser is 20 and then the pumpkin is regular sized and now we just have to color the laser we decided to make it green so um just a type of green so first you have to ungroup it and then you get this and then you like you can make it any color you want but just green is just good and yeah just like basically find some green shades that you like like brightness not the brightness yeah so that's basically what we did to make the lasers delete this one and now um let's get this started so the laser's finished everything's finished let's start with the pumpkin or the jackolantern so we have to make a variable but we'll actually do that later first because we haven't got the debt but just put the green flag and we're gonna make a variable right after that so uh score like always we always do score and set score to zero always score to zero and we'll go to x well i'm gonna find a good position x zero i was doing this on the laser so sorry about that i'm gonna do it on the pumpkin pumpkin mushroom first uh so green flag that's pretty easy to not sure if you can see that but uh set score to zero and um now we're gonna get the position so go to x of the pumpkin i'm pretty sure in the pocket right now go to x0 negative 136. so it will be like over here and then we'll go forever um it'll go to x go to mouse so we get the go to and then we go here mouse x because we don't want if we didn't mouse why you'll start floating in the air and we don't want that to happen because if you put your mouse here just go all over the place and then we have um if then if then the mouse is down then we will wait until it's not mouse down so you cannot spam the command so where's the wait uh here we go wait until not mouse down and we'll broadcast fire pew so yeah fire oops fire and when the green flag is oh we haven't done that so let's just go to the uh place where it gets fire so we're gonna do the laser and we'll come back to the pumpkin later so when the green flag is clicked we will point in direction zero which is pointing up so uh the laser won't go sideways around wonky or anything point direction zero and then we will go hide and then when i receive fire it will create a clone of myself and when i start as a clone oh my gosh where is it when i start as a clone uh it'll go to x so it'll go to x x position of pumpkin so this is the tricky block this one backdrop stage so uh um pumpkin let's actually rename this real quick oh we'll do that later but yeah anyways let's just that was kind of cringe seeing the one uh and um we have plot okay so this is what we've been doing for a while now so we have the plus sign here we have a 50 and we have the y position of pumpkin the reason we need this is the plus 50 is because we don't actually want the bullet to come out of its nose because it's going to be like here and it's going to shoot up through the nose so we want it to start at the stem and all the way up so we have this done and then it will show repeat until you need a or repeat until touching edge or touching ghost so that's the ghost so it'll stop when it's touching a ghost or a uh edge so it'll move ten steps so keep on going until it touches that edge or ghost it'll delete this clone terminate the clone and yep let's i'll try this so let's see what if this works or not so pew pew pew yep definitely works let me shoot the ghost yep works so next we're gonna go back to the ghost i mean just go to the ghost and let's do this so the ghost uh so when the green flag is clicked it will oh wow this thing has decent amount of code so hang in there repeat five clones so there'll be five ghosts at a time it'll create clone of myself and i'll hide so when i start as a clone it will switch costume to ghost a which is this costume and then it'll show and then it'll go to x we'll go to the pick random negative 180 to positive 180 for the y i mean the x so then it'll be like around here to here here is like so just pick a number like that like you know from here like here something like that yeah like 180 here and we have like over here yeah so just like do that and we're going to do the y real quick so if you want to use my coordinates that's fine as well so pick random for the y it's negative 20 to 120 so here we have like like negative 20 yeah up here we have like 120 yeah maybe up more but yeah that that that's the deal here so um now let's put the forever loop uh if then else always forget the else if then else the uh else the pick random is greater than five so we're gonna get the greater sign the pick random one to ten is greater than five so it's a fifty percent chance it will come down and swoop at you so if you want it lower you can make it lower but we just did 50 chance it'll come down and try to sweep you out so it'll glide uh where's the glide there uh glide two seconds to random position we actually have to get the this slide and now we're going down here and we'll glide two seconds of oops say glide two seconds i'll pick random of this and pick random of this so there we have that and now we have to move on to the next part so when i start as a clone it will go forever um if then touching laser laser then it will die so if then touching laser then it'll switch costume to go see what's the switch costume so it will turn into ghosts screaming like ah so switch costume the costume c and yeah and now we're gonna wait 0.5 seconds and hide and then wait 0.2 seconds i mean not 0.2 and wait two seconds and now it'll switch costume to back to ghost a so it won't act like it's screaming anymore so switch costume back to ghost day and it will show and now we have one last code for the ghost and we are basically done with the ghost here so when i start as a clunk where's that uh then it will go forever and if it's touching the laser then touching laser then then it will broadcast delete laser because we don't want them to phase through them uh like like uh piercing so we want to make it go bam but if you do want to do phasing you don't really have to really have to do this so delete laser and then they'll change score by one yeah change score by one so you get one score so i'll give you a second to absorb this feel free to pause if you need it and yeah we're gonna go back we're gonna go to the uh hp bar so we're gonna show you if it works or not we we so basically it works right now so we're good to go so we have to make the hp bar so let's do the hp bar uh so actually the hp bar leads back to the pumpkin so let's do the hp bar so when the green flag is clicked it will switch costume to costume one which is our first beautiful costume with all your lives in it and the pumpkin so we have to do the got hit first sorry guys because we have to make the get it hit i think that's how you lose hp so when i res when the green bag is clicked it will go forever and then if it's touching the ghost then it will broadcast got hit which is a new broadcast message uh so i'm going to make a new message drag this so broadcast got hit and white you have to put that weight go ahead and wait add the weight and then wait 0.5 seconds and now let's go to the hp bar because after the pumpkin it leads back to the hp bar so we already got this set up so let's do the big script of code not really big but still when i receive got hit it will go next costume which is the lost one life costume so and then if then the costume number equals 11. so i have to get an equal sign if the costume number equals to 11. which is the last costume when we'll have to broadcast game over and wait game over see a costume number is 11 that's the last costume everything's gray that's the costume so and then um you need a if then statement now if then uh under if then uh the costume number is greater than six it'll start blinking so pew pew start that uh blinking spree and uh whenever it gets hit and then it will hide okay so this is how you do the blinking hide wait 0.2 seconds show and then we duplicate this duplicate this and then we have another weight 0.2 seconds and then hide and then wait 0.2 seconds and show so i'll give you a second to absorb this code feel free to pause and so now let's um go make the game over so i told you earlier that i'll come back to the laser and finish the script of code so when i receive senior when i receive delete laser then it'll delete this clone and now we're done with the laser and now we have to work on the game over sprite so we just have to paint a new sprite so we just need a dark red and then we have hand handwriting as always and we write game over make it pretty big and put it in the middle and now we have to go to the game over when the green flag is clicked and go to zero zero hide and then when i receive game over and it will show and stumble and now we're gonna go to the backdrop and finish off the music so when the green flag is clicked we're gonna use a sound you can use any sound you want but we use cave so then it will set volume well you don't really have to do this but optional set volume to 25 and then go forever and then place down cave until done so we're done let's test this out get hit oh i just lost a life oh no i lost another two lives because he was gliding around i shot so this is pretty much the game and so no need to uh so just go to my project if you're uh want to export the hp bar or the pumpkin or anything or the game over uh just go to my project go to gumball098 or laser or whatever go to gumball098 um and then right click and export it and use your uh regular account if you're in
