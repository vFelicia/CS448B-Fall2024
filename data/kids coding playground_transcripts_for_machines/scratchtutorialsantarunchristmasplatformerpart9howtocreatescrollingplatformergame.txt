hello guys and welcome back to kids calling playground so today we're gonna walk continue our center run scrolling platform again so this will be the part nine of the tutorial so we're almost done uh today we're going to try to work on the item so this is the item uh we will be working on today uh so they will make the item on the uh on the on the game so that the player can collect okay so uh this is what i have for the code on the main sprite so far okay so if you guys miss anything you can kind of uh copy that down okay just scroll down like this right here and then this is the other side of the code so if you missed anything you can take a look also the our application our game also will share online so you can actually take a take a copy of that also so you can take a look at that but if you want to follow along so this is what we have so far for the main character and then the animated character uh very simple right here so all the code is here um so this is part where they do the run animation and slide animation okay and then the ground really simple this is what we worked on a while back okay and then virtual ground similar to that except the back layer uh background scrolling this is that and then the spike uh also i actually made a mistake over here uh here should be the sound list not the item list okay so the spike when you landing on the spike wasn't making the you know ouch sound so make sure you say soundless okay so same thing i think i copied it from the enemy so my enemy also has a map error so let's fix that so this should be the sound list okay and then the enemy is what we worked on last time that was uh kind of complex i think if you did not understand that please watch the video again uh part eight that is the enemy code okay so um the sound is the same uh we have the uh sound here and then the igloo we have the code for the equal okay so we're gonna work on the item today okay okay what we're going to do is we're going to take something from the uh from the spike okay we're going to take the one screen flat high reset delete place clone ad we also need that position we need that as well and then we when i started the clone i think we can create that it will be different a little bit different so it won't be exactly the same okay all right let's move on to the item i don't think we need the when i start as a clone i think we're gonna do it a little bit different this one okay so what we're going to do is uh we are going to reset the score set the score to zero okay okay uh placing the clone we're gonna have a lot of code for this we'll move this here this one is pretty much the same we don't have to change that uh we're gonna have to create a couple more our custom block and then maybe some more very uh lists i'm not sure i'll create the item list if not we'll create it okay so first we'll create this new one called cleanup item chrome let's select that without refresh to look hide it and then we are going to say delete this clone so we're going to put this over here okay all right next we are going to create more uh custom block so let's go to our custom block just see how many we have so we have to clean up right uh what we're going to do is we are going to um create some more we are going to create a um a list of uh things that we could keep track of like a level and then we're going to create like setting up the item list so what we're going to do is we're going to create a new custom block called setup item list okay so click on this call set up item list so this will keep track of what type of item we are going to be using so you can keep it without refresh you can create a we need three variable x y and then type you can use label as well if you want to put a label so that's easier to see but uh you can do it with or without doesn't matter i think on the original game i didn't have it i think on the tiger i did use the label so easy to see um okay so we didn't so for now i didn't have it as a label so that's that's fine so what we're going to do is uh i think in the beginning of the main sprite we actually clean up the uh the list right let's see let me see if i have all that yep so you have the x uh item position x item present y and item type so we're going to be filling up these three lists so we were using the sound list you guys are familiar with that so next right now we're doing the items so we created three uh variable here right these three one two three so we're going to use that for our item so let's go back to the item okay uh what we're going to do is call add we're going to duplicate three of this okay so we're gonna add the x to the uh item x position so we're gonna have three lists that keep track of our item this is why this is the y position for that item and this is type is basically the item what type it is so you can have so for me i have only two type i have the uh snowflake with the white one and then the blue one so you can have actually multiple items like a cherry chess or or something like that or a apple or something like that so you can do multiple things with us so you can have like multiple different type of items for your character to collect like heel potion and stuff like that you can do all kind of things but i'm going to just show you two items and these two items one of them is giving one point the other one give five points so this is for simplicity sake okay you can make your game however you like okay so we're gonna define um another custom block okay here we'll make it something called a level one item okay okay you have to select this so what we're going to do is we're going to create a list of item that we want to set up for level one so let's say if you are playing the game you want the item to be here you can click the mouse m button to show you the position like 1 and 25 negative 25 so you can add that to your item so like let's say you have one over here 170 whatever whatever you want right so we're gonna you can push the m key where we coded for the back here the end position the m key so you push the m here show the position of your mouse okay so let's go back to the item so you can get this coordinate when you're moving the game you can see wherever you want so for me i already have some of them already defined down i have checked so i'm gonna use my coordinates for now but if you don't know when you're playing your game you can put it any way you like okay okay so for me what i'm going to do is i'm going to call this one set up item so level one let's say i want this negative 75 i want a item here and then this is the x position and now we want to the y position negative 35 and i say one one meaning the first costume which is the white snowflakes okay so let's say i'm just gonna do a couple one i mean i cannot do all of them since i have a lot of items so in the original game we have a lot of item so uh let's just do a couple um 75 negative 35 and then one and then i'm putting one more here this is um 460 uh 55 and then i say two okay and then we'll do one more let's say 710 20 and then i say one uh i think i have a little flower here i'm going to do 8 10 so x 7 10 8 10 and then i have a 9 10 just couple more then we should be good okay all right so this is what i have so far i mean of course you can put much much more okay okay so this is just defining which one we we want and we're setting up into this list so here we are going to have a setup uh when i resist oh i forgot to copy that okay let me copy setup over here it will be a little bit different so let's put the code here let's continue this part i'm gonna zoom in a little bit okay so we don't actually have x and y i shouldn't have copied this over but uh that's fine uh we're gonna rename it uh instead x and y we're gonna rename it to item rename item x okay so this x is a small x right i have well which is the uh the for this sprite only so if you click on this you see like item y so this is a for this sprite only okay these two so we're gonna rename this to item y okay so i'm going to put all of them in a name called item just like the enemy so easier to see easily keep track of and uh what we need is uh we need to make another variable uh do i have item type item oh well i don't have it so okay i did not finish all my variables yes in the beginning so this is item type okay and then make sure you select for the sprite only okay see item type for this sprite only and then we are going to make some more for the sprite only item animate y so this is going to use it to keep track of making the item move up and down a little bit and then make another variable item loop index and then we'll select this so this is gonna keep track of our loop when we're creating those items okay so these are all the item variables we have okay i just took it out and then i took out the mouse so that's not blocking it so what we're going to do is we are going to set this up so we have item x item y item type okay and then item two more so we always need to initialize the variable item animated type y and then the loop so this one we're going to start at one so scratch use the loop when it loop do it use one okay so we're gonna do that so let me take this out okay so for level one what we're going to do is not delete all this code here we're going to put it go to the front layer and what we're going to do is we're going to call level one item so when we call level one item what it does is it gonna go call this block and then it will you know create you know create the uh the item uh the list for us and then we'll create item later so for level two same thing you know if you have level two right now uh let me make one more right make a block called level two item okay i didn't have an acid in my code before so run without refresh cool so level two item move them over here on this side so and then you can set up your whatever item right so for now let me just take one doesn't matter where i put it just take one okay so for level two we're gonna call level two and change that to level two okay all right so this is our setup so basically we want to put where the item is but we have the thing is we have not put them all so what happened is we're going to loop through the list and then get all the item and put them together so we're going to call the place the clone so we have to place the clone here right on top let's see place the cone here uh this one we actually have to change the code a little bit so what it is is um okay i need that so uh we need to change the costume so the place the clone we're gonna have to three things not just x and y we need a type as well so let's edit this and then add one more and then say type so that's different type of item right so let me move this out a little bit so here we have x y and then we're going to duplicate one more say type oops sorry type delete this grab this drop it down here now you have the type now what we want to do is we're going to switch the costume so say switch costume and then we're gonna use this variable type okay okay so we are setting this to this and then we're setting it over here okay so this we have one two three so usually in scratch if you give one that will use the first uh custom second will be second custom or you can give name so i'm just using one two three so here after i place the clone what i want to do is i'm gonna change the loop index okay change it by one so basically it starts at one so it will pick the first item on the list so let's say we have a list here this is our item list right uh where's my item list just i always doesn't matter which one it is so almost the same right so let's say you see when i run the game let's say populated this item so these are item on my list so let's say okay uh number one uh it's the first one you know number two is a a different type a different one so whatever it is so one one one one it might be different okay from uh i think this is from the before it wasn't cleaned up so you know where to clear up so you know uh so this is like the position i mean this is a type of item it's gonna have and then you know we just run to the list and then display you know create them okay all right so now i i just run it so you see when after i run that you see this has changed so now this actually match up with my stuff so you see one one one two right one one one so seven so one two three four five six seven right so when i run that you see it created this and then the x position so you see that 75 0 whatever right so this is the x position and then the y precision and the y position is you know same as this so you see you understand right so far right so seven so this is the x this is the y and this is the type okay so this is the three of these will make up where the item is okay cut it all right so i think everybody got that so we're gonna take this off okay so now let's go back to this setup so we're not done here yet in the setup so we're gonna get a repeat until loop okay and then we are going to repeat until oh sorry not repeating to repeat sorry repeat with a number so we have uh we can use the linked it doesn't matter which one you want uh get it's gonna be the same uh because we all populate all seven right as you can show you earlier so let's just take the list of item and then we are going to call this block place a clone so whether we want to place it we want to get the first right the first item of that list the x position so we're going to get this one right so how do we get the one so you have something called item right so what we're going to do is we are going to get the so first one of x position so if i click on this you get negative 75. you see that negative 75 right if i say 2 it will get zero you see that so what we are going to do is we are not going to use one or zero we're going to use the index okay so we start with one right the index is one right and then every time you place you call this place clone it will place the clone right and then after that it'll increase the index by one so basically we're going to go through a list and create all of them so one two three four like that okay so you're going to place the variable called our loop index where is that item loop index one so when i say this if my item is one it will get set negative seventy five see when the loop index goes to two it will get zero so four so on and so forth okay so what we want to do is we're gonna do three of these okay let's duplicate this duplicate one more time so what what three we need we need the x position the y position and the type so x position y position and then the type okay so those are the three things right subtract this put it on the first one is the x position check this put it in the second one y position extract this put on the third one the type okay all right this is a little bit long but that's how it looks like okay so after that i'm gonna put high and then move it to the left okay now let's go back to the uh main character okay the main character here we are going to have to do something so we're gonna have to broadcast a new message okay after anime monster okay we're gonna broadcast something called animate item okay anime item and then we're gonna broadcast another one sorry new one called item detection so we can detect item put that after the uh anime item okay okay so now let's go back to our item okay so here you have to pay attention so uh this is uh kind of critical so how we gonna make the the animating of the item and also how the item's getting detected okay so so we have a lot of space here let's do this over here so when i say receive anime item what i'm going to do i'm going to call this position block which is the one on top if you throw up so this guy okay i'll call this guy uh you remember the uh operator we're using the negative right put that here duplicate this put this here and then we're gonna put the item x on the first one item y on the second one and then we're gonna use the uh cheese speed and not sp g scrolling it so i almost got it wrong like last time scrolling why okay so now these are these items will be placed okay so to make the item animated uh we are going to use some if condition so first if condition will duplicate three of them actually okay three condition so the first one now we're going to do less than second one we're gonna make it greater than and then last one okay okay and then here we we're going to do is kind of have a change also uh animated uh where is it item element y by one okay not set okay change by one here we're gonna set animated item to zero so what we want to do is when this item is equal to 20 now you can play around with it but what i found is like around 20 that's good when they keep on going up is 20 we're gonna set it to zero okay resetting it and then if it's less than uh 11 so i'm gonna duplicate this guy oops oh man so many variables put it here i'm gonna duplicate this one again put it here so it's less than 11 i'm i'm going to change so this one we're gonna change the item y okay not the enemy y and white and y so making the item move up okay same thing i'm gonna put this over here say this is item y again and then move down so but this is going to be 10 all right if it's less than 11 we'll do plus one uh greater than 10 we'll do minus one okay if it's zero we'll go zero and then so now that's what we have so far let's just see how our game actually works so let me hide this one for now let's see if it works i don't know that's it so see okay so you have the uh the item is animated so if i did not have this code then it will not animate you see so you can see it kind of stays stationary it doesn't look very good so but we you have this and you can make it animate okay so so far we have the item animated but the character jump on it we don't it doesn't detect it right so we need to delete this clone when the attacher jump and touch it and would increase the score so that's what we're going to work on next okay i stopped it already so now we will work on the detection okay so we have the broadcast that's uh say item detection earlier right so what we're going to do is we're going to get this say uh when i item detection where is it yeah right here okay so item detection um okay we are going to use this if condition here and then we're going to use sensing um touching we're going to use the main character i think we will use the main character for all of them but you can use the animated character which one doesn't matter so i'm using main character i think all the uh detection will use the main character okay so we'll use main character here okay so here what we can do is we're going to check okay so if i'm going to do first check operator use the equal sign and then we're going to use the variable item type so we just set that item type based on the type here that's coming in right so item type is one which is the white uh snowflakes we're going to say change the score by one so snowflakes gets one point the white snowflakes and then we want to play a sound that you actually picked up the the snowflakes right so same thing uh we're gonna use the if condition here put that under this okay and then we're gonna check uh using the equal and work with zero so basically meaning if it's the sound is not playing we're gonna play it so for the sound uh you can go back to the sound block you see one two three four right number four is the thing sound number five is another thing sound so basically there's two different sounds that we're playing so the first thing sound okay is this sorry okay so the white snowflake will have this sound okay the blue snowflake will have this down so just different sound you can have different sound so that you have looks you know sound a little bit better if you like or you can use the same sound doesn't matter but i have different sounds for my two sprites okay so what i'm going to do is going to check on this um if the item so the the sound we're gonna put four okay so um that's the the sound that we want to make if number four is zero i'm not going to replace it number four with uh i have to make sure i get the right one so last time i also messed that up right so make sure we're on the sound list okay sound is replaced with one okay so if it's not playing uh building zero not playing then we're gonna replace item number four and with one so that when you go over here you see item number four is one then it will play this thing sound and it'll replace it back to zero okay got it i hope you understand that pretty simple okay after that we're gonna have to clean up so we're gonna have this clean up clone right put that here okay so similarly we're gonna do it for item number two so let's duplicate this on the side we're gonna call this number two let's say the blue one we have five points and the blue one we're gonna make a different sound okay so change that to five five i change it to five it's because of this right because of this five things sound two okay that's what i'm in okay so after that you cannot put it into bottom here okay so the item detection looks like this okay all right so we got that so far so now let's just try it out see if it actually works or not so let's see let's run it save it so you see so you zipping so this is a sound right let's jump over this this is the blue one so you see the blue one had a different sound so this is all the uh i only put it just at seven right so anything you can put it like let's say you want to put one here click on the m so you see it's 1031 and then 18 or something right so what you can do with this is level one right so we'll go back to level one just duplicate one of this and you put one three one zero and then let's say negative eighteen doesn't matter all right so whatever you want there's 18 and then we say let's say we want a blue one so we'll put two so if i go to that around that position you'll see it so let's try it again so you can see i'm not gonna jump over that so so let's see so you see that blue one right here right here right there you see that so if i touch the blue one it plays a different sound see is it it plays that thing sound too so that's how you control it and then you have the score so the blue one gets five points the white one gets one point okay okay let me stop this so i think that is done for the item but apparently i did not have all the items in here right but you can fill it up so fill up wherever you want your item fill more up here in this list then it will create it for you okay so now uh let me zoom out make sure you guys get all the code you know sometimes you know you might miss a call too let me go back over here take this guy out okay all right let's go back to the item so the item we have these item variable write the anime y to make it move this is a loop to go to the list to create the item this is a type of item item x and y okay okay let me zoom it out let's just you guys can see all the code okay so this side is like a reset setting it up right first the green one okay this is cleaning up delete the item after it got uh detected basically the sender touch that you want to delete the item this is like placing the clone where you want to place the item and this is like uh changing the loop basically after you create the item you go to and create the next item and next time next item this is a setup so using this we can set up this calling this to create the list to keep track what item at what position and what type and this is animating the item basically this is uh making the item to raw to move up and down a little bit which is broadcast by the main uh sprite here okay so this uh animated item and then item detection okay after that we have the setup so the setup is called uh in the beginning right at the game when all the setup uh the clone and then level one you'll call the level one this guy this guy will call the setup item and then the setup item will will add it to the list and then so forth and so on and after that we're going to go through the loop and then place all the item into the game and then this is the detection when they touch it we want to play a different sound give a different score or you can say like hey give it live right extra life you can do that right let's say you have apple send a touch apple you want to give it to your life then you say change life by one right so many things that you can do but i mean uh for now we're making a simple game we only have two things i'm just changing the score but you can do many other things and if you don't like the center you can replace with a ninja or whatever and then it will be the same thing on mario i think somebody mentioned on the chat like can we do a mario game this is pretty much the similar right inside santa claus you just replace it with mario character anyway so i hope you guys understand this video i hope you guys like the video if you enjoyed please give us a thumbs up that will really help us out and comment in the below on the in the uh if you have in the video if you have any question and we'll try to get back to you all right thank you have a good day bye
