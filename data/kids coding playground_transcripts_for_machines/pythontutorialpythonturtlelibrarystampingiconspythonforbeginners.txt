so welcome back guys to another video on kids coding playground today we'll be doing another python tutorial so today we will be doing a stamping project on python so it's like the scratch on scratch how you can use pen on python we're just going to be stamping like icons on the screen so you can use in any image you'd like so like here we have an image and then apple so usually you would want to get a 64 by 64 for trinket.io so this is like 256x256 but if the icon is too big you can like go into an editor and make it a little bit smaller so yeah um or you can just go to the description below and in the google drive you can download our sprites if you want so without further ado let's start a new trinket so let's click new trinket and click python first first things first we're gonna uh rename our thing to stamping icons so stamping icons and i'm gonna actually make the font a little bit bigger so that you guys can see it better okay so first we're going to import the turtle so then we can actually pen use the pen import turtle so we're going to import the turtle okay so the turtle in python is a preinstalled python library that enables users to create pictures and shapes by providing them with a virtual canvas the onscreen pen that you use for drawing is called the turtle and this is what gives the library its name so yeah it's basically like a pen in python so we also have to import some sprites into here so let's import the sprites so what you want to do is click the image library and then upload a new image so we're going to click here and then we have all of the python stuff so we're just going to get one of these i already had these predownloaded um you guys can do whatever you want or you can use these same so we have two space invader monsters i guess and then we're gonna get a spaceship so we're gonna get three sprites and click done so save it and then now you have the three um things from alien uh space invaders so now you wanna click main pi to go back to the code okay so now let's uh make a new variable so let's define the variable my turtle turtle so we're going to define my turtle equals the turtle dot turtle um and then you have to put a parenthesis at the end and then you can add a semicolon if you like and after that you want to get a canvas which is the um basically the stage or the backdrop in scratch you can put an equal sign canvas equals turtle dot screen and then put a parenthesis and you you could put a semicolon and then after that we're gonna add all of the sprites into here so canvas dot add shape add shape and then we're gonna go here so right here we have all the sprites so we're gonna get the alien one dot png so ctrl c and then you gotta put some uh you gotta put quotation marks and put that inside and then next we're gonna put another canvas dot add shape and then put a uh parentheses and a quotation mark and then go into here we're gonna copy paste this alien alien3.png go back to the main pie duplicate it here and then finally can this add shape and then we're going to put a quotation mark and a parenthesis and then we're gonna get the space invaders.png go back to main pi and duplicate it so as you can see we're and then after this we're gonna get one last thing print we're gonna print the canvas dot get shapes shapes and then we're gonna add a parenthesis so when you play this all the different sprites will show up down here with the alien 1 alien 3 space invaders and these are just like the other stuff within the turtle so that's that's what the print thing does it'll just show up right there and after that we're gonna start working on the turtle so first we're gonna make the turtle go up so we're going to do my turtle turtle dot up and then put parentheses and ascend and i also forgot to put semicolons right here um it's optional but i like to do it and after you do that my turtle dot up which basically means moving the turtle up and then we're gonna uh set the x and y position of the turtle so like in scratch we have the go to block in python we have something called go to as well so just do my tool dot go to and then you put a parenthesis negative 200 and then you put a comma zero so this is just a random position i just picked like somewhere somewhere like right here i think and after that we're gonna get something called moving forward so we're gonna do my dot forward so this does what it says just move it forward and then we're going to do this so this means moving forward 50 steps so we're going to put my turtle dot forward and parentheses 50. so this basically is a moving steps in scratch basically moving 50 steps and after that we're going to get a my turtle dot left my so this basically means turning the turtle left this is turning the turtle to the left side 90 degrees so this hurdle is facing this way so turning 90 degrees to the left would basically mean the turtle's facing up right now so the turtle will be facing up now so after this we're going to add another thing we're going to say my turtle forward 100 100 steps forward so forward and i'm going to do 100 steps okay and that for that we're going to get the shape alien1.png so we're going to get my turtle dot um shape and then we uh alien this thing just copy paste it ctrl c ctrl v and then after that we gotta stamp the thing we gotta stamp the alien1.png so we're gonna do a my turtle dot stamp and then add a parenthesis at the end okay now i'm gonna run the code to show you guys how it works so as you can see the turtle is moving right here and the space invader is showing up so now we have one of the space invaders showing up and now we gotta stamp the other ones so we're going to enter again after it's done stamping we're going to make it turn right so basically i'll be facing like to the side so we're going to do my turn dot right right um and then we're gonna do 90 degrees as well okay um and then after turning right 90 degrees we're going to make it move forward again so we'll just move this way we're going to make it my turtle move 100 steps again forward 100 and then after moving forward 100 steps we want to make the turtle face left again making it face straight up like this alien invader right now spacing space invader it's alien so we're gonna do my turtle dot my turtle dot um left left and then we're going to do 90 degrees okay after turning left we're going to start after like you're right here or something we're going to get the other shape so my turtle uh dot shape dot shape and then we're gonna get the other one so copy paste it the alien invader three so alien three a little bit okay so after this we're gonna stamp it so after we get the shape we're gonna stamp so my turtle stamp and then we're gonna add this semicolon and after this we're gonna add um we're gonna stamp the last alien invader we're gonna stamp another purple one so we're gonna make it uh turn right again so it will face this way so now move this way so my turtle dot right dot right and then we're going to 90 degrees 90 degrees after turning right okay after that we're gonna make the turtle move forward again dot four this is like pretty much the same thing as the other parts and after that after moving forward we're gonna get uh turn left again so then he'll be facing up so that will be upright my turtle dot right i mean sorry not right left so we'll be facing left 90 degrees so and you have to do left 90 degrees i'll be facing up again after you get the left we're gonna add this alien one png again so just to copy paste this okay after copy pasting it we're gonna stamp it of course so i'm gonna do my terminal and then put a parenthesis semicolon after that we're going to finally um get the space invaders so we're going to get the shape space invaders so we don't have to stamp actually like we can just move to the position if you set it before you can just move to the position and it'll actually become the new um sprite so we're gonna actually do this instead we don't have to stand we're gonna do my turtle dot shape and then we're gonna get the space invaders okay so then just put that in here and then semicolon okay so after doing this we can just move to this uh place we want so the place i've got to was a negative 50 negative 100 so we're going to do my turtle dot go to negative 50 negative 100 and then we're going to add a semicolon so i'm going to show you the whole game and i'm going to show you them step by step so if you run it it'll be like that it'll change like that and the space in favor so now you got the three little aliens and the space invader so um if you would like to comment out something like making it not able to run in the code just put the pound symbol in other programming languages like slash slash but this is python so it's gonna be fun so i'm gonna show you um um the first two okay so uh let's get it up to here so now it's played so as you can see it you can stamp the two things and let's say we do comment it up to here up to this stamp so now you can see when you run it um you see the three space invaders and then after that it will become and then the spaceship will go down here so yeah that's pretty much the project we're working on today so i'm gonna run it one more time for you guys to see it so as you can see it's a pretty cool project you can do so you can save your project like that so yeah thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share and subscribe and ring the notification bell and i'll see you guys in the next video bye
