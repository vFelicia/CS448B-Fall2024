so welcome back guys it's kidscodingplayground here and welcome back to another video this is actually part two of treasure island so in the last video we did all of this jazz um we did the sailboat coding and we also did the backdrop because the backdrop has barely any code and we also drew the backdrop and all that stuff so we also um so if you haven't watched part one yet please watch part one before you watch part two because um you probably don't know what's going on right now so i'm gonna drag around here if you have it if you missed any code so this is just it this is all the code for the sailboat so today first i will code the pirate ship so yeah you can change your pirate ship to 25 or whatever you want because some downloaded pirate ships are bigger than the other or they're too small so you can change whatever size you want so this one was a little bit big so i changed it to 25 so when the green flag is clicked i always have to use zoom in oh go to l point in direction negative 90. i already put on the do not rotate a left right um important in direction negative 90. so and then you'll go to this position you can make it go anywhere let's go around here start like around here so that won't be that bad so go to here and then oh forever but forever um move 1.5 steps so that's a one and a half steps five steps and then if then touching touching that way touching's in here touching this cup any this collar right here because it basically there's an island right here so if it's touching here this island right here because there's an island right here so and it's green it'll point in direction 90 and go backwards and then if it's on the edge it will bounce so yeah so so my pirate ship was started out pointing on the right side i wanted it to be on the left side because it's walking left so i put it on negative 90. so let's try it out as you can see the pirate ship is moving but not shooting a cannonball yet so um as you can see you have to put an island right here so then you'll go backwards once it touches it okay so that's basically um and you also have to put the if you if they get the treasures i'll stop other scripts in this right so next sprite we're going to work on is the ball the cannonball um we have to always start off if flag clicked it always zooms out all right there i'll set the size to let's say about 70 or 75 or something like that let's do 70. um i'll hide in the beginning you need a forever loop but wait one second it'll create a clone of itself so you'll make like duplicates of itself and then when i receive got treasures whenever you've got treasures stop other trips in this sprite so this is for the clone it's a really big chunk of code let's move it down so it'll go to the pirate ship because the pirate ship shoots out the um cannonball a point in direction point in direction um i think it's actually point so it's actually this one so it's point in direction not 90. we have to go to sensing and get something pretty special it's called backdrop of stage you know as you can see if you change the first one um it doesn't it doesn't show you x position or anything like that so you gotta change it to pirate ship so then you can change the exposure position or all the stuff but we're actually using direction so we can put that inside there um let's make it move 40 steps the cannon ball moves us 40 steps and then it'll set the y to negative 150 so the um the move 40 steps is to put it at the tip of the pirate ship if yours is a bigger or smaller um then you have to make it different so if you you can set the y to negative 150 is to adjust the cannonball around the ship to make it um shoot from the front because it's because you have to adjust it if it doesn't match later that means i have to make it around there and then you need to repeat until a or a or statement and another or statement it's touching the color this color the the cannonball will keep on going until it's touching this color touching touching edge or touching the sailboat oops and i'll move 10 steps and i'll delete the clone after afterwards so the ball is i i think it's way too big so let's test it out as you can see the ball is way too big so um i'm gonna decide to change it to 30 to make it more smaller as you can see that's about the right size um let's make the y negative 130 instead let's save the project and you see it's like going from the top of the pirate ship let's test the game one more time so as you can see the sailboat is following the mouse point arc and if it bumps into the green it gets red or if it touches the pirate ship it gets wrecked too you can also gather the treasures in and it stops everything so let's see if the cannonball works as you can see it says the ship has been that's basically it for the game please like share and subscribe to our channel and comment in the comment section below to see what content you want to see next thank you everybody you
