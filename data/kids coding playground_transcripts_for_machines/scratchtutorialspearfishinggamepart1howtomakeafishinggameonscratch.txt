hey guys it's kids coding playground here and today we're back for another video and it's called the spear fishing game today on our scratch tutorial we'll be working on this game the objective of the game is to catch fishes by throwing a spear at the fish avoid the puffer fish if you touch it you will lose hp so one of our viewers right here the small shout out said we should make this game so we decided to make one so spearfishing game we'll be learning these following concepts from scratch variables loops broadcast messaging a controlling spread with arrow keys and custom blocks so i'm just going to demo the game so as you can see it plays some music i think it's like a it sounds like an ocean music there's some fish other swimming around in a puffer fish if you touch the puffer it changes color effect and changes back to the regular version and it keeps doing that and then that's what you should basically do and then you just you can catch the fish with space to throw and i caught the fish and you can also catch them from the head too see i caught one from the head there's a so yeah so i sped up the process as you can see um i'm losing health i'm trying to kill myself right now let me show you what it says when you come at 10 hp so 1 hp of 10 as you can see it says game over so we're going to start our project before i start please like share and subscribe and comment in the comment section below what else games you want so let's just start a new game so you can rename this to spear fishing game in the beginning and just delete the sprite so i already have things in the backpack for me like the sprite the trident and they also and you can also get the diver it's in here diver diver so i think i use this one yes i use this one so i'm going to show the trident and then i'm also going to add i also have the fish so the fish already has all the costumes fish one fish two so it normally comes with fish one fish two and fish three and fish four actually you have to rename this to fish one and this is fish two it's actually fish a b c and d and then you also have to make fish one dead one so that's a fish one and it's dead one because this is a first death and fish one death two that's from the butt and fish two dead one so this was it from the head but this one and this one's from the tail too this one's from the tail and then this one's from the head but the another fish this one's from the butt it and it's just a pattern so here you go so it's all the costumes you need so anyway so we're gonna show you how to drill the trident so it's basically um just a line and just three spikes you can just use a reshape tool to do this stuff and let's paint the new so this is just a triangle you can just make the square the rectangle and then you can just use the reshape tool and turn it into a triangle really quickly so you can use you can also click delete to make it a triangle so there's two ways to make it a triangle you can just curve up the edge and then you got a neat triangle and then you can just copy paste it and make the third one longer because all tridents have this type of thing and you can also do it for that one too and then you can also get like the brown color and then use the rectangle and make the um like the part of like where the spikes where it holds the spikes and you can also reshape it to make it look more like a i don't know what shape that is more like an oval and you can also make the edge like the spear you start with a line you can also click shift to make a straight line so there you go to try to so here you go this is your trident so we can delete this costume we gotta group them together and rotate them to the right so let's just delete and you can just rotate it just group it all then rotate it there it's uh tried it here we go i think it was made the other way so it's fine it's a negative 90 actually so we can make it positive here we go and yeah that's how you make a trident so i'm just going to delete that and let's get started in the code so we also have to get our backdrop first i think i use underwater one and i'm going to the diver and go to the code so we're going to make some once you create it created the trident you have to load it into the fish and group it together and put put it in the fish so i just got fish here and you can go to the spear um group it ctrl c ctrl v and then add it here this is actually ish a2 so it's basically the death and this is from the head so that's what it is and you can also duplicate it again and make it from the tail and you can also hold shift to make it even so here we go um that's how it's supposed to be so i'm just going to delete this and let's get started on the code so i'm just going to move that right here and let's go to the variables and we have to make some variables and then make some variables fishes which is fish i actually don't think it's plural it's just fish i think it's fish it's fish and hp those are two variables you need for the diver and then the backdrop we already did that in the backdrop we can also add the sound so when green flag is clicked let's just get my sound i use ode song um and when the green flag is clicked it will go forever and play sound ode song until done that's it for the backdrop and then you have to work on the diver so when the green flag is clicked um it'll set hp to 100 so that means in the beginning it'll have 100 hp and it'll set rotation cell left right so it won't will not flip over when you move him to negative 90. and it'll go forever if then the right arrow key is pressed is pressed everyone knows how to do this right arrow key is pressed that means i'll point in direction 90 and change x by 5. we just duplicate that please duplicate that and change it to left arrow and point in direction negative 90 and change x by negative 5 and then the up arrow is just a little bit different you can just duplicate this but you got to change it to y instead and you can take out the point in direction part and then change y instead by five and this up arrow you just duplicate this one so i'm just going to put that whole thing and down arrow instead and change y by negative five so okay so i'm going to show you how to move so it's simple it's moving it's really fine you can't feel those gears yet because we didn't code that yet and then i'm gonna work on the spear so you're gonna go to my blocks and make a block called go to diver so i'll go to the diver in the beginning go to diver and then it'll go to the front layer let's just make this a little bit bigger we'll go to the front layer go to the front there and hide right there and i'll go to diver two that's basically the diver so go to diver two and then point in direction direction of diver so it'll throw the spear wherever you're pointing in the direction where the diver is pointing direction so it's point in direction direction you need this one it's a little bit tricky get to change the one behind it and then you can change the one over here and then point in direction of diver so here we go now when green flag is clicked it will set fish to zero it'll go forever and it'll go to the diver if the arrow key are not the arrow key if then the space key is pressed then broadcast fire this spear broadcasting white fires because it needs to wait a broadcast fire the speaker and then you have to work on the spear more so when i receive fire the sphere i'll show that's when you click spacebar and it'll repeat until it's touching that edge it'll move 10 steps and i'll keep on moving until it touches the edge and then i'll go to driver so i'm going to show it as you can see the spears are coming out fine that's basically what's happening and then let's work on the fish so we might have to make a part two later but let's just work on it for now so define move fish it'll go to random position i'll be at a random position and we have to make a variable so we have to make a new variable just for the sprite and it's called costume name and delete this so costume name costume name and then for the sprite only okay so set costume name to join pick random join fish so the fish now pick random one to four fish no one one two four costume of the fish so as you can see there's four fish types one two three four and that's fish four fish three fish two fish one okay so let's keep on going so and switch costume to costume name and oh show it'll show and go forever if then it's touching the spear then it'll broadcast got fish so you're gonna make a new message got fish and i'll move five steps if then if then statement it's touching the edge then if it's on the azure bounce so yeah so as i call the function you have to do if the green flag is clicked go to front layer and set rotation style left right rotation style right right there and call the function so here you go so i'm gonna demo the game as you can see it's this fish are bouncing around and then so in next video we'll be working on more fish a puffer fish and the spear killing the fish so anyways we're going so please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below for up what else videos you want so anyways goodbye you
