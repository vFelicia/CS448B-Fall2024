hey guys welcome back to kids coding playground so today we'll continue our center uh platformer game here uh these are the code last time i'm trying to go real quick with this so i'll explain in the second video uh with this part how that works so this is the movement the sound for the initializing and then the resetting the variable and all and this is the movement control that is for like sliding uh left side right slide and then the left and right okay so that's the code for that and then this side is uh the uh those podcast message for checking platform and all and move the hitbox and we have the uh the center where we are making it to go to the uh main character so the enemy is character called the main character so today we'll work on a little bit more making it uh you know maybe detect the platform and all so let's go back to the main character okay okay so what we're going to do is we're going to do the jump control first and then we're going to work on the detection okay so here click on this make a new block jump ctrl select without refresh okay let's put it over here we'll take a if statement here let's zoom in a little bit okay and we're gonna use the operator and so basically both condition is true then they'll execute that uh we'll use a knot and then we're gonna use one more of this so basically we're gonna check if the up key is pressed and the player is not dead we'll let him jump okay so the player is dying so we should not jump so go back over here key put this here i will select the up key and then we have the variable that keeps track of the player g player animation type all right so basically it's a not that then we're gonna use the if condition put this here okay and then we're gonna check here's the all operator and operator here gonna check if the plate is actually on the ground and it's not jumping then we'll let them jump we'll check on the ground and so ground is the weather global variable right the underground on the ground one meaning it's on the ground jumping jumping is the uh for the sprite only this variable is for the sprite only you can see right the main character okay and if jumping is zero meaning he's not jumping then we'll let them jump so we'll say set the animation type to zero okay uh set the underground okay to zero because it's jumping set jumping so we have the one this leaping off jumping will mark it as one i mean true and then we're gonna change the velocity as well um changing the velocity where is it here uh to 15 so when it jump it it jumps 15 um up y up okay and now what we want to do is when we jump right you remember the among us when we jump the o1 it has a lot of sound so we don't want to have that multiple sound so only one time when it jumps up we have only one sound so what we're going to do is we're going to use something called uh here okay so what we're saying is if we're going to use the uh the check for this guy uh let's use operator first put this here and then we're gonna check the list so this is uh the item on the list so you can say you can use whichever uh one you want so for for me i put one for the jump so i put up basically put i'd uh put the item one so i'm gonna put the item one uh right now i'm checking the item one of the list is zero meaning is is not being played then i set it to one so that we can play that sound so i'll show you what i mean so you're gonna replace the item one on the list the sound list with one so basically let's say now you have the sound list let's say where is it let's show the sound list so let's say when we initialize the sound list is zero now if we push the up key right i'll call this obviously okay so we'll have to call this first i'll demonstrate to you guys okay let me move over here uh here we will call it okay okay so uh move control and then the jump control let's go back over here so if i push up okay if i push up so since we have the code for the underground it won't show like let me take this out i'll just kind of show it to you so let's say the jump controls here if i push up you can see right this sound let's change the one so that way i will let the sound know later to play the sound the jump sound so let me uh so let me put this back in so let's put this back in we'll put it back in here okay so since i have not touched the ground right that's why when i push up earlier didn't work but uh once it touched the ground you were able to jump this okay all right so we have to call here so continue on okay so let's move over here where we have the call the start all control i'm gonna have to move this guy somewhere else else later but for now let's keep it here uh we're gonna get the if and else block here and then we're to use sensing i'm going to put if the up key is pressed we're going to change the velocity so make sure you use the change not the set okay so change the g velocity either by the gravity with gravity variable okay so when you're jumping up it can't pull you down slowly but once you're not jump up we'll make it go a little bit faster so we're going to say change the velocity like this and we'll make it multiply so basically negative one times two will be negative two okay and then we are going to say change the y position of the of this main character by the uh velocity okay okay so so far this is what we have okay so i'm gonna finish up the move hit box i did not do that last time so let's finish this up for right now so um for the move hit box we are going to set this deviation here to zero and then we are going to repeat until repeat until here okay let me go in a little bit more and we're going to use the oil condition so always like basically either this or this is true or run whatever inside um we're gonna use the uh equal here we'll take the deviation here and make that eight so we kind of keep track of the depth when the uh players hitting some um objects and kind of check if we need to move the player back up a little bit okay or you know set the y to zero or or using the zero minus the deviation so kind of push him back not run into the wall okay so and then we're gonna use uh this knot and then what we're going to do is we're going to say touching so uh instead of the uh you remember we have ground right we have virtual ground so not the ground we're going to touch the virtual ground so that way you know that player can step on you know different things in the ground so right the tree you will not be able to stepping on the trees and the virtual ground does not have a tree as you can see or only have the ice box in this box so it will only be stepping on these these things right so that's why we want to do that okay let's go back to here okay so we're going to say change the y okay change the y by one and then we're gonna change the deviation here by one as well and then we need another if statement underneath here and then duplicate that and we are going to use the change by x and change y and then we are going to use the uh operator here use the minus okay duplicate one more minus and then we put zero now minus the speed drag this down and then put zero here again and then we are going to minus the deviation okay if it hits a we're gonna push it back to whatever the minus that position so putting back wherever he is okay so we won't able to walk past the wall so as you can see we have no ground touch so now it's gonna fall right because of the uh changing the y so um over here on the other one is changing the velocity so it will keep on falling so uh we have to because of the negative gravity right so unless we push up it will keep on falling every time okay so we're going to make the call to detect the ground okay okay so next we're going to check if the player hit the ground so we're going to create another block here called check hit ground and then we're going to create a boolean value okay it's jumping okay boolean value not this one okay now we'll make it run without refresh okay check hit ground okay so we're going to code this one down here maybe i'll zoom out a little bit okay later i'm gonna have to move this around a little bit let's move this over a little bit i'll organize it later so for now let's just keep it like that okay so this is for checking if the player hitting the ground so we're going to use a repeat until okay and then we are going to have the uh not operator and then we're gonna go to uh sensing take this we're choosing virtual ground again so everything we're gonna do is gonna relate to the virtual ground not the ground okay so the ground will look like the virtual ground so so everything for touching the uh the ground uh we use a virtual ground okay and then we're gonna create a if and else here okay so i'm gonna take this drag that down and we're gonna change the y change y i minus one so it's jumping you're gonna pull them back down um and then we are going to reset this variable g velocity to zero okay else we're gonna change the y by positive one plus or resetting this to zero and then we're gonna have one more uh saying it's on the ground to be one here okay after it touched the ground we have to push him back up a little bit okay make sure that he get back up and we have the if condition here so put that inside here and then we're gonna check if it's jumping so let's check so if it's jumping we'll set it back to zero so after jump with set it back to zero so that he can jump again if he wants to okay and then reset this oops don't need all that we're gonna need the jump back to zero so now we're gonna go and grab this code and we have earlier checking the platform right so what we're going to do is we're going to go a little bit more on this one uh the the the one that we just call we're going to take this out and then we're going to call with this greater than so basically if the g velocity is greater than zero we can call this uh check the ground okay so basically if he's jumping up we'll have to check and make sure that you know the user always touched the ground so let's take this um okay all right okay so this is what we have so far but we're gonna create some more code for like if the player drops into the water diet as well so what we need we will need a if condition here so if condition and then move this over a little bit okay so here we will use the operator less than so and then we're going to check the y position of this uh animated uh this main character so the y position is less than negative 150 so basically when the when the new uh player is like right here right there's negative 130 or so somewhere here so negative 150 basically jumped off and fall into the water it will die but i'm using the black box but anyway i'm just showing you the santa claus the same thing santa claus will follow the black box so basically if this black box drop under 150 we're gonna make the uh the uh user die so we're gonna have to reset the scrolling um x so we're gonna have to stop back in the beginning so we haven't got to the scrolling part yet but uh for now just put this here and then for the uh falling into the water we have a different sound so let's say like this sound number so i'll show you what i mean so here with the sound so jump is one right so you can see it so it's like a whip sound and then the water is number three so uh it doesn't matter so so what we do is we're gonna put number three for that sound so in here what we want to do is um it doesn't necessarily have to be in the same order as this but uh basically the list whatever you want to use for the list for sound you're going to use that to play so you have to remember where you are so for this lesson for falling off the water we want to play the water sound so uh the plunge so what we're going to do is we're going to take the if condition here put that in here and then same thing with that check that we did earlier and then using the list so the item in the list so number three so we're gonna use number three for now for that so basically okay if it's the plunge sounds not being not playing and the player is falling down then we're gonna play it so what we're going to do is we're going to replace this uh replace item number three with one so basically it will replace this number with one okay so later we'll play the sound and we're gonna call the sound to go through the loop whenever there's any uh one or play that sound okay okay so we're gonna change your life uh so if we fall off the water we want to change the life so change here change life by minus one okay and then we are going to check uh if uh use the operator here if the life is equal to zero so basically we lost all the life equal to zero then broadcast came over okay message okay okay all right so this is for this so far okay so before we can test it we're gonna have to go to the ground uh make sure you select this show okay so they're gonna show the ground we're gonna make him try to stand on that uh what we're going to do is right now we're not we don't have any scrolling at the moment so what we're going to do we're going to put it in the zero position okay put it in zero position and then do the same thing for this okay just drag this dump it over here okay so now if you play this if i say you see um so as you can see i forgot to make it uh select this so make sure it's showing up so now i play it so you see how he's standing on the virtual ground and not the uh not the uh let me take this list out so not not the actual uh spread ground right so you see you can see he's jump up he can walk like this right so we haven't done any of the walking but as you can see he's he's on the virtual ground so one thing you have to do is make sure that the actual ground is in front of the virtual ground okay so uh uh you have to say uh go in front okay so what we want to do we wanted to hide the virtual ground so uh um this one is front it's okay i think it should be okay this one don't need it the front let's go to the virtual ground and what we're going to do is same thing like the uh main character we are going to use the change uh ghost effect okay by 100 and then we have to have the show also okay over here we'll just grab the show for now okay so let's test it out so as you can see we have our santa claus kind of moving like this okay you can jump you see jump is actually stopping at the uh detecting the ground we haven't make the santa claus like changing the the left and right right so we can do that okay so we will actually have to stop here uh next time we'll work on the santa claus to uh able to move uh you know changing the actual uh animated costume uh so that we can make him uh move and look and better but for now we'll have to stop here for now i think that one's gonna take a lot longer to explain how to change the costume logic but uh as you can see we can we have the center he can walk left and right uh he's not turning around yet we'll do that we'll do the animation next so we'll stop here for now thank you for watching guys uh be sure to uh give us a like and thumbs up on the video uh we'll make the next video next episode of the tutorial later all right thank you have a good day bye you
