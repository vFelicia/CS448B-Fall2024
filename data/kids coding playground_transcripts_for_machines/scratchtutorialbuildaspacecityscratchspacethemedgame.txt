welcome back guys it's kids coding playground here today we're back for another video described today we'll be designing our own space city build a space city let's play it so you see there's a little character and you're basically the leader of the smaller space city and you can build whatever you want have our building here so that's one building two buildings three buildings four buildings or do you want five buildings so i'm just gonna go three buildings and you can click on these to design your own decorations so you see our trees you can on and off and you have our lights and our dome so that's pretty cool windmills to get some clean energy and none so just reset everything so if you use five you turn on everything and you click this it'll turn it back so this is clear all so yeah it's pretty cool build your own city make whatever your creativity says so yeah so that's what we'll be creating today so i'm going to create the project so so of course we delete the scratch cat and the first thing we get was is um a ripley so he's our astronaut and the size of 50 if you're not mistaken pretty sure it's 50. and um when the green flag is clicked it will go to this position and it will go to the front layer so now we're going to work on our little thing that holds up the city so we have our ripley so we just finished our ripley so now let's get all our sprites in so we need the dome that holds up the city the number sprite so choose how much buildings you want the building itself the um the tree or light or window and then we have our trees our our lights over here to get this one and our cover or slash dome and our windmill that's all our sprites we have so yeah so let's go over each sprite so we're gonna start with the cup the little thing that holds up the building so we have two colors we put the two colors together by using the function and i'm a duplicate so we can yeah it's just an oval with the same color and we have our lines we just draw lines that are the same color as the oval they have to blend with the same color on the top of the oval so it looks realistic so and the outline is 10 so we use that to so i'm gonna draw the oval for you real quick so we have a circle we have a circle and we just reshape it looks kind of like a boat so yeah we put it over here and then we click on this little dot and click backup space and then you can delete that and now you got your low oval so now let's move on to the next right sprite two also known as the numbers so it's just a circle and um all a number inside so one two three or four or five and that's how much buildings you want in each one so you can write anything inside there four and five in the buildings uh so my dad drew the buildings so all of these buildings so this is building two this is the three building one four building one five building one and these are just the individuals so yeah we've done the building and this is the one so this is tree and this is the lights this is the dome slash cover and this is the windmill which is um the windmills and the clear off so we have all of these and we have our trees so we draw a tight of a flat square so draw a flat square so we do that and we rotate it and reshape to make it look kind of like a parallelogram so that's the top of our tree and we do that with the sides so we can put that on and then this is just a line so uh yeah now we're on the lights so this is just a line with a circle and another circle and another circle so it's just yeah pretty easy to draw you see it's just a circle with outline and a green outline and a circle which is all white and a no outline and there's a little stick for the light which is 10 thickness and now we're on the cover so the cover is um just an oval type of shape cyan color no outline yeah and the windmills or are just lines that kind of look like nut lines um rectangles and circles that just kind of look um that are just i mean another just resh shaped so we see we have our reshape tool and we can change what the wings of the little windmill and the circle inside no outline gray color so yeah this is our review over this uh so this drawing so now let's begin but first let's get our backdrop so our backdrop is going to be search up space so you can either use space space 81 or space 82 but i'm just going to use space 82 for this demonstration and so let's start we have a ripley done and now let's do the dome so when the green flag is clicked i have the coordinates and it'll go to the front layer never done that let's get on the button so we can let's go the button so when the green flag is clicked we'll go to the front layer and it will switch costume to costume one and it'll go to i already have the coordinates you know create a clone of myself and then when um when i start as a clone it will go to the front layer so as you can see we have all the different numbers on one sprite so that's really cool so we'll teach you how to do that and it'll switch costume so we'll switch costume to costume number plus one so it'll start going to the next costume so you see costume number plus one because we start one two three four five and it'll add up all the costumes we'll add the costumes and we'll change x by 35 so between oh we have the first one it'll move 35 and then it'll go to the second one and third one and fourth one and fifth one and that's all in one sprite and it's pretty cool because it says one two three four five and now we're going to change x by 35 and we need if then if then you need not if then the costume number is equal to five can't go more than five buildings because that's the max we have here then it will create clone of myself and now when this sprite is clicked so um when this sprite is clicked we need to create a new variable so i'm going to create all of them in one go so it's called building numbers so whatever number your building is on so we have to finish up our variables so we have show hide cover so that's our dome we have show hide light we also have show hide tree these are the trees and we also have show hide and you guessed it windmill how about we have all of our variables down so we set building number to costume number so that's gonna be whatever costume you choose how many buildings you choose one two three whatever you know broadcast a new message called change building so the next thing we're going to work on is the building itself so let's click on that so when the green flag is clicked it will go to the position we already have it at it'll go to the back layer because this would be behind the dome you know from the donut would not look as good and i'll switch costume to building one and because that's the default one so it strips up like that and then when i receive change building so we have change building then i'll switch costume to building number so i'm gonna test it out real quick so we have our numbers already so one building two building three four five four four yeah so it seems to be working so now we're going to work on the sprite to change the trees and windmills and whatever so when the green flag is clicked you'll go to the front layer it'll switch costume to costume one and it will go to x we already have it the position and it'll create clone of myself and then when i start as a clone it will go to the front layer you know switch costume so this is the uh the same thing that we did with the other sprite you know switch costume to costume number plus one so you see i'm gonna add the costumes right now and now we have that it'll change x by 40 so it's just a little little gap between both of them and and then you need to if then so if then not so this is what what we did with the other sprite but it's just a little bit different so equals five if the costume number is equal to five then it will create clone of myself so we use five because we have five costumes you see one two three four five and if you wanted to add something extra like um electricity dome or or whatever you would have to do six uh six instead of five so keep in mind so when this sprite is clicked then it will if then if then costume number equals one which is our trees so if the costume number is equal to one then you'll broadcast show trees we have a lot of so and then we'll go to the trees later but let's just finish all of that first so show trees and then we duplicate so if that cost numbers equal to two this time then it'll show lights instead of showing trees and we just duplicate it again so we have five things so custom number equals three then so do show lights we have to show dome and after show dome if costume number is equal to four then it instead of showing dome it'll show windows windmills my bad show windmills and then if the costume number is equal to five which is our last costume which is clear off then it'll broadcast clear so we have all of that code done let's just organize it a little bit so yeah so yeah we have feel free to pause here but we also have one more last script of code so when i receive clear all then it will set a show hide windmill to negative one and then it'll also set show hide light and show hide cover and then show hide tree so we have all that and it will be minus one so now we have to go back to sprite two so let's go back to sprite two so so my bad it was actually not spread to building so when i receive not change building when i receive cleaner all then i'll switch costume and building one that's the default you want to switch the costume back to the first one and now we're done with that um we're also done with sprite six which is also our um change thing so now we can move on to the trees so when the green flag's clicked uh it'll hide because you might not want trees in your uh place but yeah you might not want trees inside your space city so it will hide in the beginning and it'll go to the position we have it at and it'll set you know set show hide tree the one that we made earlier to negative one and then when i receive clear all the no hide because you cleared everything and now when i receive show trees then it will go to the front layer it will go backward one layer because it's in the front layer but it's not uh it's not like completely in the front like there's still one thing in front you want to be behind this little you see this little dome over here that's carrying the buildings you want to be behind that you'll go back with one layer and it will set show hide tree to show high tree times negative one so that and then you need if then else so if then else if then show is equal show hide tree is equal to one then it will show because one is it will show else it will hide so the reason for this is we set show hide three to negative one and negative one times negative one is one so if show high tree is one that means you'll show so one is shelf negative one is hide so uh and the next time it'll be one times negative one we which equals negative one so it will hide because you click on it so let's just try this out let's just show so when you click on the tree focus on the show hide tree variables i'm gonna put it up here so you can see it so focus on this so you click on the tree you see it goes to positive one and that's when the tree spawn when you click on it again it'll be negative one and that's when the trees go so you can just yeah so we're done with the trees and now i'm gonna do the lights which is basically the same code but we just uh change it a little bit so we put in everything so so when the green flag is clicked instead of set show high tree with my bad oh there's a set show high tree oh yeah and we need to change the position we'll set show hide light because this is the lights and instead of going to and here it will go to here and then it'll clear all shark and then show how i treat should have light to negative one and then instead of show trees it's show lights then it'll go to the front layer and it'll go backwards two layers because it's gonna be behind the trees so it'll set show hide light to show hide light times negative one show high light times negative one and if show hides light is equal to one then those show elsewhere that's basically the same code so uh let's do it for the cover so let's put this in the cover so yeah let's do this so is we have to change the position again over here and then uh we need to go to the cover so and it'll set we'll actually add something extra and we'll set the ghost effect so it looks cooler so it will set ghost effect i'll set my bed ghost effect to 50 look cooler in this have set show hide light uh it's going to be show hide cover and that's the same and no instead of receive show lights it's show dome and we don't have go to front layer or go backwards two layers and put this on and we go show hide light instead of doing show highlight we do show hide cover and we change this from the show hide cover and we change this to show hide cover and yeah so the change is variable if you don't know you right click and then you can select whatever you want but we're going to show hide cover because that's the one for this one and then uh we're going to do windmill so bear with me this is the last one so we're gonna drag this all in so let's go to our windmill here so instead of setting ghost effect we don't have that anymore and we'll go to a different position so by this position and i'll set show hide windmill and when i receive show hide show windmill then it will go to the front layer so we need that again go to the front layer go to the front layer and then it'll also go backwards three layers so it's actually going to be behind the trees and the lights and we have go backwards three layer and then in instead of set show hide cover it's show hide windmill instead show hide coverage show hide windmill over here and then show hide windmill oopsies show hide windmill over here so we should be done so let's try it out so i'm gonna hide all the variables first so let's go with variables bam bam bam bam bam so let's uh test it out full screen so i'm going to click on tree works turn it off turn it on lights work turn it on turn it on turn it off the cover windmill and clear all so let's click some random stuff clear all works as well so in the building number two three four five so let's do everything so yeah it seems like it works so we've got for today so please like share subscribe and comment in the comment section below um what else content you want for us to post and we might do that idea so anyway see you guys next time you
