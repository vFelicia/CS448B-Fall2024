welcome back guys it's kids coding playground here and today we're back for another video of scratch of course but first we need to get a shout out so some people in our channel who's been subscribed to us for a really really long time asked for a shout out so the number one person i'm gonna get a shout out for is scratch world he said can i have a shout out yeah sure we'll make the next video so scratchboro uh is a um uh a scratch youtuber so he makes really cool content and gaming with core i am your 300th sub can i get a shout out um so yeah this is a shout out gaming with core thanks for being our 300th subscriber cool scratcher your channel's growth is impressive thanks it is slowing down a bit now compared to a few months ago so cool scratcher makes really cool skits and scratch projects they always make me laugh and they're always really funny you guys should check out his channel and help him get to some get some subs uh code boy hi kids coding playground can i have a shout out um we said yeah so uh yeah uh he asked for a shout out so he's also a coding youtuber i i think so so yeah these two i think that are coding youtubers because of the name scratch world code boy of course and then ssn kozop said also can you give me a shout out please i'm trying to grow my channel it'll be amazing if you give me a boost here's your boost okay so please check out all these channels uh all these channels like scratch world gaming with core uh he might have a channel like i have content i'm not sure but cool scratcher code boy and ssn cozop so guys please check out their channels and thank you now we'll continue the third game first i gotta rename it really important so it's a more marvel thor game so i think some marvel thor boss fight not mistake so yeah more marvel marvel thor boss fight so you guys uh so this is part two yeah this is part two of our video so i'm gonna give you a quick a quick recap of what we did in part one so this is what we did for thor so if you you guys can copy that off feel free to pause whenever you need it so yeah hammer throw attack and lightning so yeah feel free to pause remember the hammer not much code maybe one more zoom out you can see it all yeah so this is all we have when green flag is clicked tied yeah this is when the when you click two and the hammer goes dragon walking which is the dragon so if he comes to your elven stone you die so yeah this is all we have like touching the hammer um attack dragon stuff like that lightning we don't have all the code yet because we haven't even coded the bugs yet so just of the lightning gif rocks so we have rocks um a goto and a go to back layer that's it not much like you can see this right you can see this right you can see this clear right duh alright son we don't have anything so we will do some things for the sun and now we're gonna work on the bug so i think she's called the bug ladybug two yes great so the first thing we're to work on on ladybug 2 is when the green flag is clicked clear all graphic effects so then because they're going to be coming in different sizes and shapes no not sizes but probably shapes because we're gonna do that send um clear graphic effects make clones so we're gonna make a new my block like always when we always duplicate these type of things to make clones of it so yeah make clone and then what define make clones so first i need to put make clone right here so it defines this to here define me clone repeat five times create clone of myself so i'll create five clones at um one time so great we have that finished hi and then next we have to do when i start as a clone uh where's that yes here when i start as a clone so this is a big hunk of code we have to do i'll go to front layer so go to front layer so where is that all right here so right there and set rotation style to the left right so we have it right here set rotation style left right so it will not flip over but once you kill the bugs they will flip over to give extra zest and animation to it like a cherry on ice cream so yeah that's basically uh so later we have to set the rotation style to all around and then now uh change color effect because they'll come in different shapes and colors not shapes and sizes um change color effect by pick random one to 300 so there would be so much uh variety of colors from ranging from like red to like brown to like gray to the you know the colors yeah basically magenta blue light blue okay yeah let's let's continue and then set x so we have to make x and y for this sprite only okay you hear me for this sprite only if you don't you screwed it up okay i'm just kidding but you have to do it for this fight only so it will work so this is where it's really important so we're going to make x y with a spread only so yeah great there's a big part you should not skip this and then set x so that's why people are sometimes complaining in the comments sometimes they just do it not and from from the sprite only so yeah so set x to pick random 0 to 200. so feel free to pause yeah and then set y to pick random negative 150 to positive 150 and then go to x go to y so it's um i don't really understand that so go to x x go to y y so it's going to be x x y y y over here and there so x x and y y and then show um point towards door so it will point towards thor just as it says look directly at it it'll go forever um oh wait a pic random of seconds one two three before it will collide to one second glide to one second to the tricky block so the tricky block right here so in there and in there oh no so here and there always change the back you guys probably know the deal by now so exposition of thor and y position of thor so you guys are following along if not feel free to pause i can't believe i'm saying this like the fifth time but yeah because this is a big hunk of code i don't want anybody to get lost so if then if touching thor thor then it will broadcast attack for attack i'm gonna make a new broadcast message oh no no no no attack no uh attack thor do i already have that no i do not so because the bugs attack them the dragon just is lightning immune just walks closer every time if it hits the elven stone you get so that's how it is and then broadcast attack four hide and i'll set x to pick random zero to two hundred so yeah zero to two hundred and we can duplicate this block and just change it to y instead and do instead pick random negative of 150 to positive 150. it'll go to x go to y so go to x y down here go to x go to y so hope you guys are following along we're almost done with the big hunk of code hide i mean show not hide show no wait i'll pick random of one to three seconds so great we're done with this gigantic hunka code so i'm gonna zoom out a little bit i i don't believe that you guys can see this that well but if you zoom in your computer you probably can probably see this or chromebook or whatever you're on so yeah um it's really long really really long so yeah and then now we have to go back to thor and do some code with it so and then so thor so thor has a 125 hp that's decently enough amount for me to win i mean like if you can't win that easily then i advise you to put more health but if you can win really and you want a really big challenge you probably feel like 50 or 40 health well i probably that's i think that's possible but it's just really hard and then um so when i receive attack thor it'll change hp by 5 so that's negative five so um i just tested the game and it looks like it's fine so i'm gonna be on the bug so when when i receive kill bogs because thor broadcast kill bugs if i do not have that yet kill bugs i didn't make that in the first part i think i i think so stop other scripts in this sprite because you killed the bug of course and it'll start back later because of the block so uh set rotation styles are all around so that's when it flips over and dies sadly oh i mean not sadly that's that's not that that's good that's good if they die that's good because they're blocked they want to kill you too so that's good point in direction negative 90. um glide 0.5 seconds to x negative by so i'm going to drag x real quick so put y to negative 150 x and then wait one second just one second not that long and then broadcast create clone again so when we broadcast create clone again we have some code to do so broadcast new message create oh no clone again so start all over again so create clone again oh my god this is cursed oh my god did i turn on caps blocks i might uh turn off cast blocks oh yeah i did turn on clap clock sorry guys so create clone again so this should be fine yeah create clone again and delete this clone so yeah and then when i receive create clone create clone again it will wait one second and then start all over again by putting the block make clone so then it will give all the way back here and then define this and then it'll start all over again so that's great so yeah let's try it so we got to make the you and you lose sprite but first i'm going to work on the sound because i feel like that will help a lot to enhance the great games um things because if you make the sound and just add a simple amount of music it can just enhance the game by a lot so movie two okay yeah great so yeah put that in um until done and then now we have to do the uh you win you lose sprite so let's just write it out so i'm using handwriting so so it's different so first i'm gonna go to um you win sprite so i'm gonna make it a tinge of dark green type of greenish and yeah that should be great uh and i'm gonna type you win oh it's not handwriting i wanna make handwriting you win win so let's make this like this big no that's not big enough maybe this big yeah that should be great and then you lose it's just the same thing but change it to i centered it and then i'm gonna this thing's off the board so i'm gonna set it to zero zero afterwards you lose so yeah easy costumes and then now we have to work on the code of you when you lose so when the green flag is clicked it will go to zero zero i'm gonna see if it's too big and high oh i made a hide make a show and see if it's i think it might be too big yeah it's too big i'm gonna make it a little bit more smaller sorry guys i'm gonna make it just a little bit more smaller so you guys don't make it as large as mine so guys um we're gonna work on i just finished it so looks great um yeah so when i receive you win you win because you won you win you won yeah i'll go to the front layer so it'll go in front of everything so it won't hide behind the sun or anything um and it'll switch costume to costume one and next it will show and stop and then you can just duplicate it instead use you lose true blues you go to front layers which costume the costume two because it's the second costume which i made you lose and the first costume wishes you win so yeah uh uh yeah um so i'm gonna do that and then show and stop all so let's do this so as you can see the bugs are attacking me great and um they're back there so i'm gonna electrify them see if they're dead and then you come in in charge of the dragon the dragon isn't that hard because the bugs are the only problem in this game in my opinion you might think the dragon is hard but in my opinion honestly the um the uh dragon i'm not sure if you can hear me right now the live indian the dragon is way easier than the fog so ah more dps let's go dps and then uh i'm sure if you guys can hear me actually like the you lose is working great and then we can also make the you win i'm gonna try to win okay guys so guys um i'm gonna be hiding these two useless bear i mean not useless but like useful variables away because it just enhances the gameplay because you know i always do that stuff yeah let's move this to the corner it's not saving that well okay there we go oh no what happened a normal readout great and then look and i'm gonna try to win so guys i lost okay i'll be right back i'll try to win this time guys i lost again because it glitched for one second and i just lost like 20 hp i'll try to win i totally did not just pause the game and make a you win come out yeah so you can win okay i'm gonna try to win for real okay um i'm gonna lower down the dragon's hp so then i can win really easily so i'm gonna hide this sprite um i'm gonna make the dragon wait a second i just deleted two zeros and let's try okay look one hammer you win easy okay change this back to five thousand so it does work okay guys so
