so welcome back to the channel guys to kids code and clear ground today we'll be doing a video on how to do highscore vomiting so remember the Apple capture game I made a while ago I just added the high score function to it so as you can see when you wash the Apple boss score well on an OP we change to the highest whap because that's the highest power so if I stop the project to play it the high score is still saved as 45 ok so now how do you do this I will show you so first I'll delete this code and delete this so I can go step by step show you how to do it okay so first you have to make a variable called high score so you want it to be cloud variable cloud variable means it will be stored on forever in the server until you change it so there you have the high scoring cloud variable I'll just move it on this side okay we'll need an ifthen statement you can just add it right down here you need a greater than sign so if the score you scored is greater than the previous high score then you set the high score to score it's pretty simple yeah Bob Bob so you see the fastchanging Bob and that board goes up that's the fast corn so if you stop it the high score is 35 stop because it's dirt on the bottom variable so I hope this video helped you guys with your games so please like share subscribe and please comment down on this video to give us some feedback thank you for watching you'll see us next time
