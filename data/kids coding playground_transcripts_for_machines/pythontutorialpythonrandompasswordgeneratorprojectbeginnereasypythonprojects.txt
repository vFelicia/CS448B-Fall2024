so welcome back guys it's kids codingplayground here and today we'll be doing another python tutorial we'll be doing a video on how to make a password generator so going now from now on we're going to be using pycharm instead of sublime because pycharm is an id and you can like it can debug easier like if you ever to make a mistake it would find the mistake and inside sublime you cannot find it would be harder to debug so yeah so from last time remember when i misspelled a word and it wouldn't work well in pycharm it would auto complete the word and then so it's pretty much impossible to make a mistake in your spelling and we'll be making more scratch tutorials we just decided to do some python tutorials because we haven't done them in a long time and we'll be doing something for 10 000 subscribers soon so thank you guys for all your support on subscribing to your channel so without further ado let's start on the video so open up your pie charm by double clicking on the app and then we're going to create a new project we're going to start off by renaming the project to random password generator it's a random password generator we're going to create the project so it's going to create the environment just wait a little bit okay so now it's done okay so so now we're inside our pycharm so to like get the scripts and stuff so we can type we're going to uh expand this and then we're going to right click on here we're going to click the new and then we're gonna do python file so right click on the random password generator thing and then to get the python file and we're gonna rename this python file we're gonna name it random password generator uh random pass or generator and then python file click ok and then now we can type in all the scripts and it's right here so this is basically the project uh the folder and then this is the file inside the folder so this is like the random password generator you don't have to name it the same thing but i just have the same name it doesn't matter okay so now let's start getting into the code so first we're going to import two libraries so import so import see it already auto completes for you import random and then we'll go down one line and import string so as you can see it's kind of grayed out right now is because we haven't used these libraries yet so once we use them it will not be grayed out so don't worry about that okay and then next we are going to be defining uh the length uh the function we're going to name it random password so we're going to define random underscore password define random underscore password length and then we're going to do the input so i'm going to show you exactly what this means after so put colon so this is like a like a function and then you put anything down here so we're going to define four variables so the first one is going to be lowers so these are all the lowercase letters so i will show you exactly what this code means after i finish typing this part so we're going to put string string oops we spelled it string dot ascii ascii and then as you can see it already um auto completes for you so i want lower case so you just go down and then it'll auto complete and the next one i'm gonna do uppers upper case so operas will be equal to string dot ascii and then uppercase you see autocomplete again and then numbers will do nums is equal to string dot digits see auto complete and then finally we have the symbols is equal to the string dot punctuation so okay so i'm gonna print all these and show you what each of them mean so basically the first one lowers is printing out all the lowercase letters from a to z and uppers is printing out all the uppercase letters and from a to z and then the numbers are all the numbers and then the symbols are basically all the punctuation marks all the different symbols okay so we still have to be inside here so i'm just going to go down to lines and then i'm going to print and then we can instead of just calling this entire thing we can just call the variable so we're just going to copy paste it into here so print the lower pieces print uppers and then we're going to print uh prints the nums and finally we're going to print the symbols okay so to run a project remember you click the run and then all right also my bad we forgot to call the function it's like you have to call the function like in scratch you know how you have the custom blocks you have to call the function okay so like since we have to like call the function so down here we're going to call the function so we're going to do the random underscore password we have it right there and then inside here we're just going to put 10 for now so that's how long the length of the password will be so we're going to just ctrl s save and then run run so we're just going to run it right here and then as you can see it prints out everything so abcd all the letters from lowercase all the uppercase letters all the numbers and all the possible symbols so that's exactly what we need so that's that's basically what all this means so i'm just gonna comment all this out um because we do not need this anymore so and okay so instead of putting a hashtag in each one or a pound symbol you can actually do this so we're just going to do let's highlight all this all you all you have to do is just ctrl slash and you can uncomment and comment stuff so that's pretty much it oops nicely deleted so that's how you comment in uncommon stuff that's just a shortcut okay so after that we want to let's delete this part and then after that we want to go back in here so use we need to be inside the function so we have to use a tab so we're going to do use oops caps lock use all underscore characters so this is like combining everything to make a password we're going to make it equal to lowers and then we're going to plus the uppers and then plus the numbers and then also plus the symbols so we're going to add all of them and then under that we're going to print use all characters so we're going to print the variable use all characters okay okay so now we have to call the function again i might have deleted it so let's call the function um we're gonna do we're gonna do the random underscore password and then we're going to do the plan inside we're going to do the 10 for now okay so i'll run the thing for you so run okay so inside the run as you can see it puts them all into a single row all the different characters into single row so that's what this part does you add all the lowercase all the uppercase all the numbers and all the symbols together and you print them all in one line okay so that's what we have to do there okay so next we're going to make a temporary variable so we're going to do i'm going to name temp and then make it equal to random dot sample so this is basically you're combining all the different characters you're going to pick random characters from the lowercase letters uppercase letters numbers and symbols going to make it all together to make a random password so inside here we're going to put parentheses use all characters autocomplete comma and then we're going to do length underscore inputs like that and then next we're going to print temp okay so there we have it let's run the project so let's click the run button so we're gonna run the password generator so you can see it's in an array now so it picks some random letters w three uh comma i'm not a comma y t i and so we don't want it like that right so we're gonna put a script down here so it won't have like this it doesn't look good and you can't really see what the password is so we can run it again so and it'll give us a different array this time so as you can see the array is totally different so it will just keep on generating random passwords but we don't want it in this format so we're going to add some code so it won't be like that so we're here we're going to do we're so basically just going to join the array for characters into a string so we're going to make a variable mean password password is equal so basically this is like the join function from uh scratch so here we have password so like i said this is basically like the join function so here we have the commas and then we're gonna do dot join and then we're gonna get the temporary variable into here so temporary is gonna be like combining everything so we have the password and equals to this this is like the join function and then down we're gonna go down one more and then we're gonna return password okay so okay so i just put these just to show you guys how it works so now we can just comment them out and then next we are going to be doing like the returning the password and then printing the return password so we're going to go down two lines and then we're going to write return password so let's move this one a few lines down actually and so return password underscore password is equal to random random password just random password underscore password here autofinish and then inside the parentheses we're just going to put 10 for now but later we'll be doing another variable and we'll substitute in there so we do we'll just put 10 for there for now and then under there we'll do print and then we'll do the return password okay there we go and this thing we do not need it anymore because we have it right here so the return password is basically the random password and just prints that so that's the variable make it to equal to that one and then you print it okay so now let's run it so you see we have our password right here it has 10 characters so you see we have 10 right here what we want to do is make it to the player or the user can put how much ever uh how much characters they want in their passwords so instead of 10 right here we're gonna above here we're going to make a new variable so we're going to make it length is equal to and then we're going to do the int input and then we're going to put another parenthesis and then inside here we're going to put a message welcome to password generator how did that generate and then please you guys can put whatever you want here please enter a length of space or a password what we're going to do instead of putting the period we're going to put like a little uh less than symbol so we're going to show or greater than symbol so then we can show them where to type like a little arrow so it's going to be like that so there you go we have that we can add a space in between here to make it look better and so that's pretty much it for this project um and right here instead of 10 we're going to have to substitute the length in here so however the long the person wants to put it it will be in here so length okay so that's pretty much it for the project so let's run the project so as you can see it says welcome to password generator please enter a length for the password so let's say i'll put like three okay three enter and then it'll put a three character password yeah so that's pretty much it and what if i want a 12 character password then it has as well as character password right there so let's say you don't want to use make your own password you can just use the script so that's pretty much it for this tutorial yeah so password generator thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share and subscribe and don't forget to ring
