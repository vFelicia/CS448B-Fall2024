you have not clicked the subscribe button please smash the subscribe button click the like button as well and ring the notification bell so without further ado let's start on the video so uh we're gonna start out on the enemies so we're gonna be broadcasting a message at the bottom because this is if it's touching the rocket ship so let's broadcast a message called game over so the player can actually die when it's touching the enemies so i am going to go to the um uh the um player and then in the player i'm gonna do um what uh when i received game over game over stop other scripts in this break and then um also we're going to go back to the enemies uh when i receive game over we are also going to stop other scripts in the sprite so then the rocks and enemies will not move so stop other scripts in the spring so now we have the code so now the player can actually die and then we have to do go to the game over we have to go to the game over um sprite we have the game over sprite here so uh when i receive game over game over so we have to go into the um game over sprite and when i receive game over i want to show uh and then stop all stop all and then we want to do a one flank clicked go to the front layer go to the front layer we wanted to go to zero zero because that's the center of the screen and then we won't hide from the beginning okay so now we have all of the uh code done here and you can also play some sounds like the losing sound play lose until done um so then it'll let the player know that he lost he or she lost so now we can work on other buttons so this button right here so this button all it does is you can change it back to the original skin and before we continue to the other um sprites there's one bug we need to fix so as you can see if after you die you can still shoot so to get rid of that let's go to the laser and then we want to do when i receive um when i receive game over then we want to stop other scripts in the sprite so i'm going to try it now and now you cannot shoot as you can see you can't shoot anymore um so next we want to work on the buttons so as i said let's move on to the other buttons so what what this one does is just switch it back to the normal skin so now let's add some code for the um buttons so let's get up when i receive start game when i receive start game let's switch the costume costume one costume one which is the um regular costume and this one's like one selected costume so you want to keep it on the first costume and then you want to hide in the beginning and then get a one flag clicked zoom in a little bit when flag clicked we want to hide and then switch costume to costume one um so reset everything as well in the beginning and then when i receive game over we want to hide the sprite game over we want to hide this sprite and then when i receive open shop we have to um we can just get it from here actually just drag and drop this code into the the yellow one so this is the sprite so you can select back so we will not need to purchase anything so all the code is the same except for the x and y position so i set it at negative 175 and y is 80. that's where i set it you can set it anywhere you want if i set it over there and then um instead of uh this one we gotta switch we have to make a new message called switch to red spaceship switch to red spaceship so i'll switch back to the default skin and so yeah that's it for the um this one and then we have to go back to the player um not the player the uh laser sorry about that we have to go back here and add one a little bit of code so when i receive pause game we want to actually stop all stop other scripts in the sprite and delete this clone so when you pause the game you can't shoot anything so it'll delete the clones and stop other scripts in the spring when it's paused game so next let's work on the um other purchase buttons so for the player we need to switch the color for the spaceships so in the beginning um we already switched it to the red costume so when you when i receive when i receive switch the red costume red spaceship then we want to switch costume to the red costume red costume and so that's uh the thing and then we need to do one more thing when i receive pause game then we want to stop other scripts in the sprite okay so now we have that let's move on to the other skins and um force field so for the cool spaceship right here we need to make some new variables so we will make a one new variable called cool spaceship purchase status rules space ship purchase stat pass like we did to the other spaceship we did the same thing so for the uh for here we can just drag and drop the same code into here and we can also drag and drop this piece of code right here and here we just have to change some stuff up and then we can drag and drop this this and this we just have to uh change the code uh a lot so let's move i'm just gonna separate everything so let's do that and then for here we need a new x and y position so for me i did uh excess 75 in the ys80 um you can do whatever you want of course and then instead of check spaceship purchase right here we have to make a new message called check cool space ship purchase so then it'll switch the costume to the cool spaceship and then for here we're going to have to uh when i receive a check cool spaceship purchase right here and then instead of right here we're going to use the new variable cool spaceship purchase status and then instead right here we're going to broadcast switch to cool spaceship purchase status strictly cool uh spaceship new message switch switch to cool spaceship new message new message and then you stop the script that's all the same and then i made the price instead of 1 000 to 2 500 to buy the skin because it looks a bit cooler so we're going to change the price and instead of negative 1 000 we're going to negative 2 500. and then instead right here we're going to change it to cool spaceship status to unlock switch costume costume 2 and instead right here we're going to do switch to cool spaceship switch to spaceship else we want to set the uh cool spaceship purchase status and switch costume to one and right here instead we're gonna have to use uh the checks spaceship purchase check cool spaceship purchase okay um and right here we're gonna have to do the cool spaceship purchase status for the variable and this has to change as well to this cool spaceship purchase status so yeah now we have we just changed everything in here let's go back to the player so for the player we're gonna have to like change the costume so i'm just going to duplicate this uh i'm going to receive a cool switch to cool spaceship right here then i'll switch to the cool spaceship this one so yeah that's the costumes and um and before i go any further i will show you guys um the buttons so i'm just gonna so as you can see now you can die and then um i'm going to set my money to like 5 000 so i can show you everything so i'm just going to press p open the shop click here and then i can just buy one of these and i'll set it as the costume and now as you can see i have the cool spaceship and same thing goes with the other costume see if i click this select it now i got this costume and if i um and if if i do this one this one's the free costume so let's say i already buy this one and then i uh come back so let's say i go back here and then i go back let's go back and then i can reselect this one and then exit and then i get this one again back to the normal red station okay so now we have all that down so i think we will start stop right here and in the next video we will work on the force fields and the scatter shot so thank you guys for watching don't
