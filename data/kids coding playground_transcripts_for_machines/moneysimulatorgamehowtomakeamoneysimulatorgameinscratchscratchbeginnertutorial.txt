welcome back guys to kids coding kilogram today we'll be making a project in scratch called money simulator so basically the point of the game is just to collect money you move around this grid i'll show you a demonstration of it after this so basically move around the grid collecting as much money as you can we might add some extra improvements to it at the end but for now this is the game we have right now also labor day is on monday so um if you want to check out our labor day animation project you're more than welcome to check it out um yeah and you can tell us what you did over the labor day weekend in the comments section um all right so without further ado let's get into the project so basically you can move around it can it's just moving in place right now we just made it look better by doing that in the original project we didn't have it every money you collect you get one score and we might want to we could probably remove the pop sound that's kind of annoying honestly but yeah that's basically it so it's pretty simple project you just basically run around getting these uh things the money all right so let's start a new project file new oops and then okay so let's rename this project i'll probably name it uh money simulator okay money simulator we'll keep this scratch cap so i'm going to keep this at 60 size i think this is the perfect size so let me drag some stuff from the backpack you can install this from the google drive in the uh description below so we have the money and then we have the grid oh yeah that's for the backdrop so we go to the backdrop drag it in so now the grid to make our lives easier these grades are actually spaced 60 steps apart like almost 60 apart like in scratch so perfectly 60 apart so it's easier to use so yeah um let's go to the scratch cat first let's rename this right to the player so player we go to the code and then when green flag clicks inside the player we're going to make it go to negative 30 on negative 30. so if you run it we're going to make it go right here near the middle i guess this is basically the middle maybe we can make a little bit smaller i don't know maybe 55 yeah that's a little better 55 looks a little bit better so yeah the negative 30 negative 30 is basically the middle and then we're going to make that point direction of 90 degrees and we're going to set the rotation style to left and right so it won't flip upside down when you move it and we're going to get a forever loop so it will likely be moving i forgot to zoom in uh forever next costume next costume and we're gonna wait 0.1 seconds 0.1 seconds and then we're going to do the movement now so we're going to do when down arrow is pressed then we're going to point direction of 180 point in direction of 180 so to the bottom we're going to point to the bottom and we're going to start working like start moving 60 steps to the bottom because i already told you each of these squares are 60 steps like that uh perfectly 60 steps and then if on edge we're going to make them bounce and duplicate this down arrow we're going to do up arrow now so up the upper arrows press one point direction of zero which is pointing up and we're gonna move 60 steps and a fun edge will bounce uh duplicate the up arrow we're gonna do right arrow now right arrow we're going to point the direction of organ point direction of 90 which is the right side uh we're going to uh one same thing this is the same and move 60 steps if under bounce same thing and then left arrow we're going to do negative 90 and move 60 steps if on edge bounce so we have the movement so as you can see you can move around the grid all right so yeah that's pretty much it for the cat pretty easy and let's go to the gold so inside the gold we're going to make a new variable so i'm going to name the variable money all right for all sprites and when green flag clicked zoom in we're going to set the money in the beginning to zero and forever loop forever we're going to set the x uh i'll tell you why we have to do this in a bit after i finish this one so we're going to set the x to negative 210 plus pick random zero we're gonna multiply pick random zero to seven zero to seven and multiply by sixty all right so basically negative two ten is this side this is negative 210 this grid right here this last row and we're gonna add it to the pick random zero to seven times sixty so uh let's say the number picked random is zero so that means it'll set the x to negative two ten so it'll be right here so you might be wondering why we're doing seven when there's eight grid eight grid squares like one two three four five six seven eight it's because we're already counting this one as negative two ten so we're going to only need seven one two three four five six seven so d7 and we're going to multiply by 60 because each one is 68 across 16 steps and then we're going to get another script let's get a set y2 duplicate this small piece and we're going to do negative 150 negative 150 is this bottom row this is all negative 150 and we're going to add it to zero to five because there's six blocks one two three four five six and we're already counting this one so we're gonna only need five and we're gonna multiply 60 again because of the fact that each one is 60 across all right and we're going to use timer for this so we're going to reset the timer right here and then so basically if the timer is like greater than a certain amount then the money will go somewhere else so we're going to wait until wait until the is touching the player or so we're gonna do touching player oops touching the player or the timer is greater than three all right greater than three so the timer is also greater than three then we are going to if we're going to get an if touching player so we can do if uh touching player then we're going to let's start a sound uh we're going to start this sound called water drop i think it's in the sprite library and then we're going to change the money by one all right in the future we might add some other stuff but for now this is all we have it's working perfectly fine so now we have a simple moving around beginner's tutorial uh we will add some other stuff to it and later maybe like some traps or like some enemies that can attack you and you can lose lives or lose a game yeah so maybe in the future we'll make another video based off this project and also in the backdrop uh we have a little bit more code actually so like if you want to make it a little bit visible more better you can make it like when green flag clicked uh you can clear all graphic effects and then you can set change the ghost effect by 70. i had this my old project i think so once you run the project it'll be a little bit oh no wrong one ghost sorry accidental the wrong one so yeah as you can see it's a little bit dimmer i guess yeah so yeah maybe like if you want this you can keep it i don't know like i don't know if this is really necessary just make it like a little bit easier to see but yeah that's pretty much it thank you guys for watching don't forget to like share and
