foreign scratchers trying out new ideas for Scratch projects is a whole lot of fun and right now I'm playing with simulating a multilegged creature using inverse kinesmatics yes it's Spidey cat ain't they the cutest and since I'm right here at the start of the process I thought it'd be fun to share it with you all and make this into a devlog I'm not even sure what kind of game this will be and nothing you see thus far is set in stone so as you watch and get ideas drop me comments to help influence the game before it finally gets released on scratch exciting stuff so let's rewind just a tad and see just how this project began with a fresh project and not having the heart to delete scratchy completely I kept their head and gave them a new body the legs need to move around so I'll leave them out of this Sprite next for the level I just need it to be filled with interesting platforms for our spider legs to interact with how we actually move the spider I'll also work out later for now they can just follow the mouse pointer so with the scene set we can look at adding our first spider limb just one I want it to reach out from the spider body and attach to any nearby solid wall that it can find easier said than done perhaps I can sweep the area around the player with a fake leg looking for collisions so I drew that fake leg scripted the loop and when touching the level I recorded the direction in a list of possible contacts then we're free to pick any of these that seem best hey you might like this did you know that to pick a random item out of a scratch list you can copy and paste the word random into the item of list block and that actually works how cool is that turning off the run without screen refresh and the leg now points at any wall within its reach and yikes that's quite jiggly lots of possible contacts then obviously all except down here now to make things more stable we would expect the leg to pick a contact point on the wall and then stay with it but for that we need to improve our detection and find the actual point on the fake leg where the wall contact actually occurs for this I will create a smaller second costume and shoot that down the leg until it comes into contact with the level recording that point as Target X and Y then once we've found a Target we position the leg there and then point that back towards the player's body this week and repeat until the player becomes too far away to keep hold and then we'll just need to find another place to hold on to and there we go this is far more stable I love how the leg stays attached and now rotates in place I'm less Keen though on how the leg extends through spider cat's body to fix this then we'll need to give the spider leg a knee joint this allows the body to move right up close to the foot and the leg bends to accommodate this is so cool and it's called inverse kinematics it sounds dead hard but in reality it's just a little math so here's spider cat and here is their foot we know the leg is made of two parts if they are the same length then this will make the math a little easier so the first half of the leg can be swung freely around spidey's body forming a circle and the other half we want to be touching the contact point so again you can swing around there making a second Circle and this is interesting can you see where the two circles intersect that is where they cross over well that is the point that we need to draw our legs knee brilliant so is there some math we can use to calculate this point well of course it's just some simple trigonometry for this right angled triangle we know the length of half a leg is 40 pixels and we can get the distance of the contact point to the player using the distance 2 block and divide it by two trigonometry tells us that angle is equal to Arc cause acos of the adjacent divided by the hypotenuse perfect we can plug that into our code but first i'm going to switch to using pen so that I can easily draw both halves of a leg without having to use two Sprites or clones oh here it is with a simple line in pen without a knee looks cool but you wait until I add the ik inverse kinesmatics to prove it works I'll pop a circle around the player and the contact point where they cross is where I expect the knee to flex we want the distance from the contact to the player and then we'll calculate the angle to the knee using that acos or a sign as I did here whoops now I'll have to do a subtract from 90 to make up for it next we move forward towards the knee and let's give that a test oh guys guys look at this that's some beautiful articulation and do you see how it's matching the expected circles crossover perfectly yeah it's looking quite spiderlike over here now I think we are ready to up our game and add in the other seven legs for that I think we'll swap to using clones so the erase block has to go in the main player Sprite and then I'll create the eight clones oh wow this is looking exciting there's a bit of flickering as the legs go out of range I think we can fix that easy enough though I probably shouldn't be doing the trig on numbers that are not valid yeah yeah when out of range don't even try to draw the leg that's better hey isn't it all the legs kind of form a spiral around the cat remember how when we drew the circles to calculate the knee joints well there is always two possible intersections but we are only calculating this one so our knee always bends the same way clockwise we could mess around with that for example when the foot is to the left of the spider make the knee Bend in the opposite direction how does that look cool feels like a cross between a crab and a plasma ball it looks dead cool in certain areas of this level like this vertical shaft I think what I'm going to try and work on next is having the legs transition from one position to another rather than instantly teleporting like they currently do and perhaps assign each leg to a body position to keep the limbs spread around the body and stop them crunching up into one place also now that the legs follow the body we'll have to start thinking how the body should follow the legs if you know what I mean after all the body should be being supported by the legs hey and I've had some great news you guys must know Crystal keeper 7 right well he's amazing at game art and it looks like we might even get a collab up and running here now that would be awesome go and take a look at his YouTube channel and scratch account and you'll see why I'm excited can you imagine what this game would become in fact don't just think about it post your comments under the video and take a look at what other people are saying and vote them up I think there's a heap of potential and I'd love to try some of the best ideas if you wouldn't mind smashing that like button on this video to get things rolling then I'd appreciate that and do subscribe to the channel and make sure to click the Bell
