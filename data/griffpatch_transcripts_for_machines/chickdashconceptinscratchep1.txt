hi it's the Griff patch I'm just making a small screencast here to get some feedback really I've had some ideas for a new little game and I thought myself it'd be really cool to perhaps create some YouTube videos of the work in progress so I can like keep you up to date on how I go about building a project not quite sure if it will work whether you're interested or quite how deep to go but so here's a start I mean I can always do other ones so this is the idea I had chicken burn I'm not sure I like the name chicken run perhaps chicken chick who knows and yes I know it's Easter's past it just happens to be a cute idea and I don't really mind so what I do as I came up with this idea for a game where you have a hen sitting on her eggs and off she goes with other little chicks only leaving one egg behind and that's gonna be your character so you hatch without your mum around and you have to to cross the level to try and catch up with her so that's the premise of it I thought that was quite a cool idea and in my thoughts I was kind of thinking of our games like Super Mario or kind of that kind of gameplay Iraq a really simple dynamic where you get to run across a level and avoid obstacles and it's always smooth and fun so to begin that journey I had to draw a little little chick guy as you can see here's where I started off starting off with a more realistic chick shape and this process a pivot 'iv and then I started to change the idea this guy here with a bit more retro pixelated I quite like the style of that wasn't quite what I was looking for getting closer this is getting very close to how I've ended up at the moment and I started playing with colors of legs shape of body colouring things like that and in the end this is the guy I've come up with which I like the most notice how I faded out his outline a little bit to make him fit in with his legs and quite nice it's twice as Pixley as it needs to be so you didn't scratch you can draw in between these pixels but to make it retro looking I've kept it to this grid size which i think is quite nice the animation for him I've put together here any five frames for his walk cycle his legs are bending backwards of course being a chick if you look at this one here his leg goes out backwards and then forwards and when they're fully stretch cuts a straight steel that was a bit of a challenge so you can see here let me stop the project it's still reading cuz then they can see the different frames so he pops up he'd like to turn around he comes down and then it goes back to start now I don't know whether I'm gonna have to add more frames or not but that's the that's the basic animation so look I play this you can see him run it through there we go yeah well that's quite a little running animation now of course you ever seen a little chick their legs go like the clappers they don't go slow like that at all so let me speed that up so you can see what it looked like sped up I don't worry about these scripts for now so if it's running at one frame a second one 30 frames a second it's like this so it's quite cute I can also put in some background surprise just to give you an idea what it looks like ah I know what's wrong there we go serious running on a scrolling little background now that might not actually be fast enough what I've done in these scripts down here if allowed me to change the speed of how fast he runs it is you might notice he ran backwards fast near and forward so now he goes like this so this legs are actually going faster than the frames that I've created so he's actually only showing two or three of the five frames as if cycles around but I might make a different one cycle for him depending on how I'm feeling and how the game pans out I've also made him little jump and double jump which might change the graphics to again but I like the idea of it now you jump twice you can't to each or anything so that's the idea I can also switch in some slightly different graphics for the floor there we go you can imagine what you might do with the graphics there so that's quite cool not you also see I'm shooting at them if I walk off the edge there's no actual collision detection with the flaw at all but that's the whole thing when you're starting to develop a game you don't go jumping in and do everything you just do bit by bit to get a feel of what what's working what isn't so there's a lot more to do and a lot more scripting to do I could back down from this and run the YouTube video from an earlier point and show how I've made the script so far for example this nice scrolling here where I can face the direction on it scroll so I'm got a lot of running space and I can see what's coming that's quite cool I'm like I'm sure to do that how to do the animating frame weights at the moment he cycles slower if he's running slow and he gets the faster he goes faster and all the little bits and pieces in here and the costs of jumping and double jumping so we'll see how this series goes really tell me what you think and yeah see you on scratch
