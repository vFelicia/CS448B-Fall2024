hello fellow scratchers the theme of our third official Griff patch Academy game Jam was feed it and wow some of the entries are absolutely mindblowing we received over 180 submissions and after literally days of playing through them I'm thrilled to share with you the top four projects from each category why not try to guess the winners before they are revealed and guys keep watching until the end because there's some amazing entries in every category believe me you don't want to miss them guys let's get started best arcade game with over 50 entries the competition for the best arcade game was intense Kaden John kicks things off with their game feeding the fire isn't it cool a very fun game that keeps you on your toes quickly feed the fire with oil before the drops can extinguish it pull out your umbrella to block the drops and when powered up even shoot steam to snip them off from afar next up it's pesky rabbit by Strider 2013 where we get to play as a speedy White Rabbit feeding our faces with carrots I love how very rabbity our movements are but watch out for the hunter out to have his rabbit pie but gosh once you reach full carrot your fearsome carrot breath is Unleashed I can't tell you how entertaining this combo is and you even have a more tricky night cycle to deal with where it becomes very tricky to see that Hunter just how long can you survive the black tiger 7 sneaks into the arcade category with this little gem named feed the cat the trick is to keep their hunger bar topped up while making sure not to eat anything that would disagree with scratchy's rather delicate tummy it starts pretty easy eat the burgers carrots tacos as they fly across the conveyor belt but the speed ramps up quickly and then things get out of control it's a brilliant game that keeps you coming back for more and last but not least Feed Me by just a lemon dude and you can tell from the title screen that this game means business and it does you play this little dude facing off against an unending onslaught of wacky mutations armed with only well a rather awesome rapid firing Cannon which is lucky because you need it the fact that we are feeding these enemies of bullets is made plain when the large Ms burst into the scene I love everything from the great enemies the clean score projected on the ground behind the action and the handrawn Crosshair wow just don't die trying to collect those tempting powerups oh bother so wow each of these games is a blast but the winner is Feed Me by just a lemon dude a welld deserved congratulations considering the competition in this category best Gathering Survival game oh now guys Gathering games these are the games where you must go out to gather resources to complete your mission and oh man have I got the best games to show you it's just a shame only one can win in feed it nuggety 7 has you stranded in a Strange Land where your job is to appease the sleeping Beast by keeping it well fed yeah I guess eats in it sleep and its favorite food is rocks and trees which it just so happens you can pick up in abundance at least to begin with the items get stored in your fast list inventory which means you get to choose when to return to feed the beast preferably before their hunger bar drops too low but don't overfeed them as resources don't grow on trees you know um next up cool Koda 13 presents slime servant in this polished game you need to pick up food scattered randomly throughout the world and bring it to the Slime King but be careful if you run out of energy you will lose so you must eat some of the food yourself only don't let the Slime King see you do it or he won't be happy it's a wonderfully addictive game and I love going back to try and beat my last score I just wish the key for eating food yourself was different to the pickup and give buttons because I kept accidentally eating when I was trying to give to the Slime King and that's game over ah nautical nourishment by word four is for those who like to explore the depths of the ocean initially things look quite simple but the controls and the visuals as you begin to dive deeper really start to draw you in the story is that you need to gather enough underwater resources to cook up some great Seafood to feed all the fish who happen to be swimming all around you most delightfully I'm told using my boids tutorial a great job because it's very well suited to this game wow we can use some of our collected resources to buy upgrades which really helps so we can die deeper and for longer and oh my gosh what was that don't hang around to find out but curiosity and the need for more resources quickly bring you back down to the depths what a great game so that brings us to the last entry in the Gathering genre and this is called kindling by top script and their sister rain soup shark and what can I say about this game oh wow so it's a beautifully scripted adventure of two kids camping in a forest and within moments of the opening dialogue beginning I was hooked and I mean hooked it's witty clever endearing you get set to the job of gathering firewood from the forest to feed the fire sound boring oh man okay I forgive you you didn't know better I do and I mean I've played this game all the way through three times already and I never skipped a line of the dialogue it is genius and so that brings us to decision time and I feel sorry for the others in this category because they're all winning material but top scripts kindlein is my goto game congratulations to you and your sister well done best casual game moving on to the slightly more relaxed casual game genre we again have some stiff competition just look at these wow the moment I first played Burger Mania by paban 00 Z I loved it a gigantic monster burger is destroying the city obviously because it's hungry so we must feed it the levels are presented in classic Casual Gamer style and we try to stack the burgers to match the order get it right and you have one happy monster get it wrong and well you wasted precious time and the city is one step closer to destruction as the levels progress the orders get more complex and the gameplay more hectic it's quite the ride so you might think there's no game to rival that but you'd be wrong because w111 004s offering monster Cafe is right there at the same level and as they themselves mention perhaps they should have kept this for the Halloween Jam nonetheless this is a wonderful feeding game presented in the most impeccable manner use the curse keys to select each ghost's desired dish in a frantically spooky Race Against Time and then just when you think it's all over the pace picks up and you have to double time it oh yeah and then we have sling feed by scratcher Greg 96 and our poor Pooch is stranded on a distant Island without food well no problem we have a handy catapult and a pair of fruit trees what could go wrong each level our dog sends us his daily food requirements apples and oranges and it's our job to get them to him this is one of my favorite Renditions of a pullback catapult that I've seen on Scratch and the sounds are just ace too I wish the dog were a little less static and the levels a lot more diverse but the basic gameplay is topnotch and very wellcoded H floating dog is at an ultimate difficulty level or a bug who am I to say and that brings us to the last casual game of the group eat it up by Malo and Ouija when I first saw this I was like what but then I started playing nine crazy mini gamess all packed into one project and the first few oh my word I split my sides because they are so delightfully drawn and hilariously animated hats off to Malia and Ouija on their brilliant art Direction the games themselves are fun rather easy there would be much more playability if a high score was included on each mini game perhaps however not playing through each mini game is simply not not an option for anyone the experience is just too good so the impossible task a winner but who will it be it's w11104 with monster Cafe congratulations on this spooky Masterpiece best animation in death by cake by Blue bat games a young slime all alone except for his trusty cake Master encounters a dragon the only problem is he has bad aim this amusing animation instantly stands out for its great atmosphere conjured using clever use of sounds music lighting and dynamic shots but is it feed it enough to win in feed it by llama boy High we follow the conversation between a dude with his super cute chick oh that's my new pet name chick chick and a friend what impressed me was the obvious amount of clever scripting that went into choreographing the text and speech with the character movement and scene changes and gosh that cute chick let's do it with a little polish this would be fantastic and next up feed MIT by real polite TI I love that classic Pixar intro have you seen M by the way the water scene is my particular favorite and the voice acting really brings brings this one to life wonderful job and finally Y where are my waffles B 15 writes about her animation waffles welcome to my newest animation it's about waffles and how much I like them I was entranced by the excellent natural voice acting and expression of emotion this fun encounter between be and a waiter had me in stitches I hope you find inspiration to bring us more where that came from but now we must choose a winner this is so hard Bluey b games entry was certainly the most impressive technically but BV 15's waffles make me laugh every time I want to give it to you both but the winner is death by cake by Blue batty games well done best restaurant game so there's been plenty of food themed games in this feed it game Jam no wonder then that we should have a very cool batch of restaurant theme games too let's find the best I'm very hungry in the sandwich Machine by Squiddy the awesome you take the role of a sandwich maker at the beck and call of the krg that's cool rectangle guy if you didn't know now you must listen carefully to what they ask for and then press the down key to go to the kitchen space then pops up the menu on screen onscreen buttons were perhaps a bit of a missed opportunity now use the menu to deduce the ingredients for our order and once acquired drop them one by one into the sandwich machine funnel and whack the button and out pops your sandwich hopefully this tastes amazing all that and you have to fend off rats if you happen to hear them from the shop front it's a clever idea let's see how well it Stacks up against the competition because next up 1748 879 brings us restaurant Tycoon this time we are controlling this little Pizza serving robot and it's super fun dashing around the scene popping pizzas into the oven letting them cook while delivering the pizzas to the customers who have sat down at a table to spice it all up there's also the upgrade shop which allows you to boost your pizza money to the skies if only more customers would come in I guess it could be a quiet day in pizz land here's another restaurant game by Saro named fivestar restaurant clicker first thing you notice is the wonderful story and smooth text engine and then into the game graphically it's simple but distinctive you use keys or the mouse to control the game on the PC the keys are much quicker as the orders come in select whether it's an appetizer main course or dessert and then plate up the ordered item as quick as possible to send it off the quicker you go the better as the game progresses things get a lot more hectic which makes it really fun I'm just not sure if the difficulty is an illusion or not as I did expect to have died when the orders overflowed but apparently not and then lastly undercooked in Scratch by Dave Maceno I'm not sure I've ever seen scratch cat and his friends depicted as cute as this before they're adorable but then so is this restaurant game where your scratch Friends Place their orders and you take the role of scratchy getting to work grabbing ingredients and assembling Burgers right on the work surfaces like a pro I just love how this game has been put together it may be a little rough around the edges but man totally forgiven because it's a real joy to play see if you can beat my best score of 520 and with that after much deliberation the winner of the restaurant category is indeed Dave mungu with undercooked in scratch cuteness combined with skill with an awesome assembly mechanic just couldn't be beat great work best farm fishing game so there were not many entries that fell into the farming or fishing categories so I've rolled them into one let's see them firstly we have another Masterpiece by the legendary not a school account where the world has grown desperately short of food so we must farm farm farm it's kind of a casual clicker combined with a set of farming mini games and man it looks so good you just want to eat it how is this not on the App Store seriously the graphics and sound are topnotch and the upgrades are balanced to make you want to keep playing I'm not sure which zone in the fields the fish or the chicken coop drives the most income but it's fun trying them all out out I think perhaps all it needs is some more idle income where strategy can play more of a role where you don't have to be present at all times but seriously wow next up we have fish a far out fishing game by mnm 3344 oh man that poor cat it's so hungry we just have to feed it if only we had some food well no problem let's fish but first we need a rod not my first choice of walking mechanics great got the rod let's fish and this is really fun when you get a bite you have to reel it in at just the right speed and hopefully you don't get a boot a boot a boot ha and then you get to sell it I cannot wait to get enough to upgrade my rod yay yay and then sell sell sell oh what oh no I think I was too eager to click the cell buttons and now I've broken the game it's so unfair and what about that poor cat and now pigs and chickens it's animal feeding by crowy Wally and I really really want to give these animals their food I've only got a limited Supply but I'll be if they don't just keep walking right over it it reminds me of my pet toad but seriously I feel like I may be missing something here piggy free food just open wide well there's a shop where you can buy more tasty food if only I could afford it yeah this game looks nice it Scrolls and everything I think somebody else must have played this just before me and now the animals are all full yeah that's it so finally game Vision TV brings us feed the fish ah time to sit back and relax in this delightful aquarium simulation drop in some fish Nemo check Dory check mustard yep and the Exotic one check spice it up with some nice furniture and then the fun bit throw in some food oh thank heavens these fish know how to eat the happy sound of munching fish so what do you think who wins this category yeah it has to be not a school account with farm farm farm well done on a wonderfully polished game best strategy sluzzle game everyone loves a puzzle right well okay so caged by dabman 67 is a horror survival puzzle you find yourself on a ship in charge of feeding the Beast and there's really not much to go on can you piece together enough to both feed the beast and survive the night great atmospherics with a lot of potential oh nice the delightful gobbles is a card game brought To Us by scratchy long legs 25 where you have to take in the cute gobbles the brown cards and then feed them using the purple cards the food cards but be careful to use the right combinations to feed them just enough but not leave them hanging around too long as they will just leave and you'll lose that round I haven't quite grasped the intricacies of which gobble likes which foods but if I had plenty of time I'd love to play all the way through as it's a real treat with its cute graphics and pleasant narrated Story the user Hollow song has created this fascinating game dragons and kingdoms where we must protect your kingdom from The Fearsome Dragon you do this by balancing your resources planting fields of wheat to make bread and stone to make bricks the trick is that when the dragon attacks you which he will do at certain times you get to choose whether to feed them bread to buy yourself extra time to build up your resources or well otherwise the dragon attacks and then HS Battle Stations did you manage to construct a good defense if not then I'm afraid you don't stand a chance on the other hand with good logic solving yeah I don't think that Dragon will be coming back in a oh my uh moving swiftly on feed it by Robo doog 81 is our last Puzzler and we we take ownership of a green yet very friendly pet dot our goal is to take them safely through this maze only they won't follow you unless you feed them a treat the downside is that they get a little bigger with each feeding the plus side is that they'll follow you for quite some time until they lose interest and then you just have to feed them again problem is get too big and they won't be able to fit through these smaller gaps I love the concept and it certainly had me playing levels over and over again trying to get the best route such that I could feed my pet just the right amount to get me safely to the exit very cool idea but who do you think is worthy of the title of best Puzzler game Gobles by scratchy longlegs 25 for a very unique feed it project that is worth exploring and will keep many a scratcher busy for some time to come excellent job special mention and now my friends we come to a quick fire round of special mention projects no specific game genres just a lot of games that I really loved and wanted to share with you feed it by Nuno game a simple food collection game where you mustn't let the food touch the floor start slow and gets frantic I love it I wonder how far people can go feed the beast by Nether Dragon 222 another feeding the Beast Style game sadly there's a bug so you have to manually hide the thumbnail before you can actually play it please fix this because it's great because then you're treated to my favorite Beast feeding animation of all time I cannot get enough of these little pigs this was my favorite frog game of the challenge always good to see a frog or two you hop around catching the black and golden flies but just be careful not to eat the infected red fly oh no feed the clbo by V OE is probably the simplest scratch projects submitted but this new SC rer has somehow stumbled on a winning formula because it's using the when key press blocks you have to stop moving to press space to eat the berry and get score holding it down can yield Oodles of score if you time it right but that clbo moves around so randomly it's a real skill to know when to move and when to hold down space I love it feed thy creature by Lemonade bucket is a fun monster feeding arcade game it looks great and plays not so great it feels a little buggy but once you learn how to get that hand to grab the people then it starts to fall into place this game has a huge amount of potential and I really love it so keep at it feed the duck by wbox my singing oh my gosh the voice acting is killer I'm hungry can you please take me down to the pumpkin patch so I can get a pumpkin I love this so much thank you but if you have a duckling at home or duck please do not feed them any fast food and what awesome advice thank you and lastly House of the unfed by edca a crazy take on the classic bat bouncing game where you have to try to feed a weird mouth bouncing the ball off the walls seems to help but then every now and again the mouth pops off to the shadow realm the only option is to follow and continue the fight there if it wasn't for all these crazy ads getting in the way I mean what why and so if I had to pick a final winner for the most fun of the special mention games the winner must be feed the clbo by Vee although there's Limitless room to improve this game its very nature makes it fun I dare you to try and beat my score I think it could be a big hit so thank you everyone for competing in this month's game jam and a special congratulations to all our winners you'll find a link to a scratch Studio featuring all the top games under the video so do go and give them a play they're simply amazing until next time though continue the amazing work and scratch on guys
