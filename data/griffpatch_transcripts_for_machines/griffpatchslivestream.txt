okay I have enabled my audio can anybody hear me anybody getting my audio stream working I'm kind of looking it says my stream is healthy he's after that pause that you can hear me anybody hear me hello hello hello great I'm assuming that art is working I am going to have a go at playing my game once more and this time with some audio and so hopefully you'll hear that now I'm going to try not go mad because my word this game really for straights okay let's talk it through a little bit so here we go so I got the start the game down pretty well but it depends where I managed to catch my hammer this bit it's all a bit of luck really where I have all lands okay that was quite good and that is very nicely if I get there in 16 seconds I'm very happy usually this game is so slippy mines bit better and oh man well there you go all saved but it's not gonna be a good time for that okay let's do it again nope no oh my goodness come on come on come on come on get in there I've managed to fix little bug that was happening around here which was that you would get stuck in the ground and slowly rise up ah I had originally fixed it for the hammer but not for the player I discovered so that was why that was happening that's very nice that's fixed now this bit talking and playing at the same time reducing go together but no this is the bit because you have to get it have to get it just in the right place now Oh groove it's a bit annoying as it comes in the wrong place white get it and I have attended Cetus yeah yeah okay going well I thought talking at the same time was not gonna be a good idea right let's try it again it's getting worse and worse okay we're off bookshelves okay now so little flick across here and then you can start PO go back and forward between the different objects on the screen no no no okay try again much better no boy getting stuck on dogs ears and this time little slips now little slips what hold a moment speedrunning is just too difficult I'll tell you one my habits need to be gripping on the side of the bus now this is not going very smoothly come on scratch cat do not fail me now you're like flipping around all over the place know how that guy had got under two minutes now on this game managed it I would love to see a video of that happening it must have been literally perfect nothing alike what I am just doing for you here absolutely killing the game but you know you can't be the best at your own game sad as it is I think I do enjoy creating them more than I enjoy playing them although I have to said I do enjoy playing this game there's a really good jump and I love that that is one of my least favorite bits except for the bat which almost falling back to this bit it's just so dependent what is dependent upon catching that hammer the right place it's just luck now those who've seen me climbing here before know this is problematic I'm not working out where the top was not bad three life we've got such a bad time of it here 5 minutes 25 Oh see that's like the best we've run in a space I've probably ever had if only I could tack that onto the end of a really good start run I'd actually be there for a chance of getting a good time ok let's give it another go now before I do just to let you know those who are interested in doing speedruns I've just added a feature to the start this game which is if you press Q and R at the same time it resets this game at the time keeping the same sound settings which means if you ask be drilling it and water quickly reset you can it's kind of like quit and reset event on cue in our oh and if I were speedrunning that is what I would be okay I'm gonna do it you said go now 14 seconds to this point that is like the best generally when I start missing up so far so good no but there's so much potential to give off yeah this is I shouldn't look at the time if I look at the time did I stop panic I'm actually doing well okay no no no don't oh cool now pull on it now because it comes up you didn't pretty well okay keep this going yeah yeah yeah no no no no no no no no yeah hmm oh you do not watch having there let's go nope let's not go go do you like landing a good start oh my goodness 12 seconds No oh goodness come on no no no no no no no no no no oh right clique of death oh it was going so well it was going so well no oh come on speed runs go I spent so long building this ah building this level out of scratch cause costumes I have to look my way through the library first thinking what categories of objects I could use and what shapes of objects are in the categories because I have to be able to build a level out of them and the problem with lots of lots of the costumes man lost pom with lots these costumes is that they were very bitty I needed shapes that were quite solid because otherwise you get caught in them so I went to the really blocky colorful objects the level I put together in adobe illustrator because it let me break the level up into many screens and then export them all back into scratch again a screen at a time which was very handy to try and make the level look as much as the original shape of the original games is based on as possible it's made of around 160 full screens and to begin with I was exporting them as the standard oh stop talking soon because starting to do relatively okay maybe it's a trick maybe I should talk while blank so they were the usual okay I'm gonna stop talking here because this is a bat yes now go to class little bit come on yes okay concentrate now no mister mister okay Christmas tree oh my goodness Oh No Oh sausages sausages design this game tell you so the usual levels are made up of 480 by 360 pixels bitmap mode but it does support double resolution so to begin to begin with the levels all in the normal scratch resolution I would have been nice if I could have exported them as vector but as it come on it's just it's not talk for a second let's get at this tree oh I just got no power left in my am yeah ugh about ah funny thing is I've never made it to space in the real game fact I Honey you made it anywhere in the real game that little chimney bit is probably the hot tub or where this I forgot so trying to implement a space scene I was really working blind because there wasn't hardly any YouTube videos of anybody getting into space except for when they complete the game and they're really good at it so they all go flying through space and do the games I have no idea where the takos should go in space not little those tacos in the real game and I had no idea where they are I had no idea how much gravity there was I could just see that there were being sucked towards the planet for tacos so I did my best with that so I don't know whether it's actually anything near accurate or not but nobody's complained and really frustrating so it probably the power line yes so I was saying my export at all these levels screen at a time at originally the normal there's 640 by 480 no 485 360 size but then I changed and managed to explore them a double resolution and that's what they are at the moment which actually looks a lot nicer and scratch was quite happy for me to exported like that Oh so the way I put the level together was I found a highresolution map from the original game not both eye high enough that you could see the shape of everything anyway and then I was able to lay my level over the top of that and put the scratch costumes which I exported from scratch and I'd pop them into illustrator and then I started 200 then I started to remodel things a little bit so like all these rocks example there's only two rocks in the scratch library and so I had to change their color a little bit variety I also used the puppet warp tool and various other tools illustrator gives to bend them into roughly the shape that fit the level some things I had to walk more than others just to be able oh my goodness oh what a save no okay my changes back I really hated that maybe the unfair she'll be a bucket here in a real game with some pretty awesome physics going on but what I didn't want to do wasn't make it lag and the amount of cost you sensing I'm doing this game is quite huge well that's the end of my my speedrun yeah the bass sensing I doing this game is quite a lot so what I'm actually doing at the moment as I moved the head of the hammer and the player and I work out how much velocity I have to move each one for each frame and I move it through every pixel but it's moving between the two points every frame so it's doing a lot of sensing what it means that that yeah yeah it means that the hammer does not go through things and nor does your body well I say go through things I mean it doesn't go through I'm gonna restart this this is it's not going well Oh like yourself that when it goes right it's such a nice feeling but the readers not last long because just doesn't go right through long enough no I'm just we're just going thank you yeah right up we go I really hope that the guys who get the fastest scores on this game will be able to screen record them because it's so satisfying seeing I'm actually going to run where you're not messing up all the time so it's screen casting this not my goodness the most exciting things you guys cuz there's no way that saved by pixel Samoa have you noticed that even the sounds change when you scrape on something I think I guess that's really quite pleased if that works the physics in this are not model accurately at all I was wondering about going back and reworking it to use a more authentic physics system where I've modelled both the hammer and the player but that would have required a lot more work might not have worked and I would not have been a released a project so in the end I was doing which was just using general kind of scratch sensing and then that kind of the best guess approach which is often serves me well and I think is using a lot of games at least it used to be now that we have physics engines it's probably less than oh yeah it's it's try going this way oh I missed it I could have caught that it would have been good a good space maneuver as it is I'm just going to float hello off I go well three minutes 24 wasn't too bad a time was it I really like to get maybe two two and a half minutes I reckon I could do it but it might take a lot of blood and sweat but why do then I keep at it it's not is that no I'm like just wobbling across the floor oh well let's go with it sometimes you certainly make up for a bad start some genius move later on Bosse you get across this really fast I've discovered it like we know if only I could hello these moves consistently I would not have believed it possible to get these at the Times the other day when I was releasing the project when I released the project my best time oh I shoulda grabbed my best time was 20 minutes so I was rather shocked was first the first high school that came online I think was six minutes I thought yeah that's good and then some guys started playing it and I got I got three and then now two and it's just blown me away oh my goodness come on oh please no no no no no knows that come on grab it grab it please grab it you're the mercy of scratches bitmap pixel detection different boots normal could be good no not gonna be good if I can't reached it we said I go oh yeah yeah maybe it's a job oh my go into space at the edge of the level come back I put that on so that you couldn't go bounce by going downwards interesting fact they actually did use Oh oh man I used the same gravitational physics as I used for my atmospheric ball game where you could orbit all the planets so that was quite fun at that time where they would make you so that so quickly after releasing the first game atmosphere cool test project seemed it's 38 almost not the fastest but it's still pretty good I would have been very contented with that the other day no come on no series I love cherries by the way it's my favorite fruit I have a cherry tree in the garden nice black cherries it's quite young a few years old and very first year that we had it I have noticed a lovely red cherries on it and I went to bed one night woke up the next day and the birds had eaten every single sherry and I was very very sad the next year I put a big net on top of it the last few years because I've dangled two CDs from it instead my wires and they can work a treat strangely enough I don't think it's the content of the CD it's because they they rotate and so we're taking a song great she'd learn the names of all these bits I know this one's called a chimney oh I have to call it the watermelon now it's amazing what practice does for you slip Oh apart from that yeah practice these games over and over and do get well the letting go to the point where this particular game dry just so crazy there you just lose control of the things that you thought you could do we suddenly canting at all and what I was trying to I really wish I called of that because that was really good when I was earlier trying to record my games so that I'd better put them on YouTube not the screencasting but actually recording the pressure of having the record button pushed it was quite phenomenal and you do quite well without it playing but then as soon as the video means you're calling you do rubbish Oh I'm sure there's a smoother way of doing this that bit okay Oh sausages I was coming away then oh no no no no no yeah that's that's just unfortunate I'm afraid that's not a good not a good route so it's three spaces oh don't I how many of you guys actually got over it it's nice thing other do it but it would be nicer to do it a little bit more style than I have been managing here yeah are you guys watching how many are there Wow well it's nice of you what are you saying anything it's a look oh my life how am I meant to read that then right this is very sad I seem to be plummeting back to attack her somewhere below me no I am right that's at least in this game right I get this stage my QR key doesn't work that QR key is so new I haven't even updated the About section to say that you can do it it was a requested feature for people doing speedruns that was a beautiful scent oh and there we go no so good it's just so so nice up to that point when it goes wrong it really goes so those books then I use it the staircase they were just books though ah die cut from the scene of the witch's cottage she's one of scratches backgrounds one of the few which is actually a vector background most backgrounds in scratch of bitmap which are really hard to use for this game so there was a few things that were bitmaps which I converted to vector which is like a tracing feature the big book case which is to the left of the book staircase this was not saying most of the stuff I've got on the level varies cuz it looks so much nicer ah and there goes my chance of like record to me I was close that was really close this space space the one thing that is easier in my version of this game is the arm action with the hammer as you get closer in towards the body in the real official game it kind of does this little bit where switch is over and it can get stuck on a climb inside loop and an outside loop and I think in my version that's easier you can kind of pull the axe quickly across your body which I find very convenient but so I wasn't too bothered about trying to change it the I noticed that the guy in the pot in the real game also he leans towards where the Hammers going so when he when you move the hammer to the right he'll lean to the right of the pot which means he's kind of doesn't he doesn't need to stretch as far with his arms because he's leaning towards where the Hammers going where's my guy's arms look a little bit unnaturally long Oh but for the sake of having to try and simulate leaning I decided stuck all these little nooks here get in the way I'm pretty sure there's no little looks in the real game so you probably get caught a lot more in my game but that's not weird with our bigs Oh Oh big fall a big fall right ah these scratch blocks here I screenshotted them from within scratch took them from the menu at the side I just used my browser to zoom in using the browser's native zooming I'm in a really big and then it's green shot at them and imported them in and they look pretty good Oh here we go again it's better over oh my goodness getting a bit stuck on everything now no no no like DejaVu be nice if there was a way of just launch get myself back up there of course they could because I'm Thor did you know that Micah Thor's hammer yeah it's true there might be a bit of debug in here that lets me fly it's quite fun if I was Thor how else you see would I get to the top of the level to test it out not what I would use such a thing Myron's lifecasting hat Oh in fact to get that record that will be very cheating Oh what do you guys all see in the Easter egg yet where you fall in the water and it makes your head grow bigger it was something that occurred in the real game when you watch youtube videos you can see there's clips of the Easter eggs and what one of them involved is it's actually it's all mesh kind of starts turning inside out and getting really big as you fall in the water a few times so I couldn't resist having something similar and because if I could do with his head getting big each other time seems to be hilarious to me quite sure it's quite a first it was then now but it might amuse you guys and some people have actually managed to complete the game with the big head so congratulations to you guys that's ridiculous strangely talking to you guys as I'm doing this I'm a lot less rayji I was playing it yesterday and to record my lives my video not my live stream and I just got so mad but being able to talk naturally as you play it actually feels more soothing not quite sure why maybe it's just ah takes the edge off it didn't know how it effects oh my playing because I suspect I'm not being able to tap here as much attention I mean like 40 seconds show I got in like 30 usually if you saw my huge YouTube video of my speedrun yesterday and he watched the really quite long outtakes you all saw this bit and I failed it so many times it was almost unbearable about jump but actually I found out a good tip so those at least for Windows users and the reason it was feeling so bad was actually on my mouse I had a wireless mouse and it had precision mode enabled on the windows options precision mode enabled which meant that the mouse accelerated away if you move it fast it's designed to like speed across the screen which is a really useful thing to have enable when you're working in apps and things on Amy's probably quite used to the feature but I believe that if you play any computer game that uses the mouse it would automatically disable that because the game would be in control of the mouse but miss game here in any scratch game we have no such luxury not games that run in web browsers don't have access to that but scratch doesn't make use of it so at the moment that's what they're saying yes mouse capture so our mouse in scratch could go out of the window and when it does you lose you lose control of the mouse in scratch which is really bad suddenly it's not registering anything and you die I've actually tried but some warnings into the game tell you what's happening you might have seen them pop up saying go fullscreen because when you're fullscreen in the least and windows I didn't max it's not the case but the windows it's you don't lose the mouse catcher so that game continues when the mouse is near the edge of the screen used to be suit no I'll keep going I used to be so careful I was about to say going across those to be honest not so careful everywhere but I was so careful going across those balls in the sky because I didn't think it was possible to go fast until I saw someone else's YouTube video playing it and then I appreciated that you could really pick it if you are able I think you've got to concentrate though oh right bat my young friend nice myst too fast too it was only the day I think the day before release of this project that I actually was able to add in slipping hammer up to that point the hammer was actually really grippy and once the hammer was in place that's crystal keeper seven can't tell you because he beat attested a little bit for me no1 again ah the hammer was really grippy and it did mean it was actually a lot easier especially climbing this really annoying tree what we can do in space today no no I'm the big in this space right well I am definitely get it like at some point I'm just not quite there yet quite got the neck so how many times the other guys have gone to space we're really good at this are you lost my train of thought was I talking about we should get talked back to me and tell me what it was that I was talking about one game that I've never made a game of yet and you know I made lots of games of but the games that I enjoy is portal when people saw that portal cube that's it called that's companion cube isn't it in this level and they would always have a hint that I'm gonna be making a portal game well Wow it wasn't it was just because I really like portal and I thought it'd be funny but I do really like portal and I have wondered about making a game based on portal at some point or other just not quite sure where I think it really is quite a good scratch portal game already I'm sure it's the one yes back another thing achieve a metal people have asked whether I had considered making this multiplayer up this game yes I absolutely had I was thinking that would be quite a cool thing to do I guess the idea being you could kind of start climbing mountains and you could see other people doing it too at the same time now it might be a bit laggy problem but it might not I guess the biggest problem is we got quite a few people playing in this game so if it was the usual thing of having 8 players say then it would be I guess the first 8 people to whoever actually managed to get on would be the ones that would be playing everybody else I was on everybody else would have to just be watching but the problem being if there's a lot of people the people you want to watch or the really probably the really good ones if they were the ones they favorite to show for their benefit of nobody else then those people wouldn't be able to see the people we're not very good I mean people who are learning ah I see penance what's going really well so the people who are at the bottom of the mountain who are not showing on the multiplayer we're gonna see the people who are doing really good but the people who really couldn't better see the people who weren't it should be a bit of a bummer because you really wanna be able to see the people who are doing so well so that you can help them cuz that's if you think about cloud platform of fun one of the things that really makes that game fun is that what makes that game really fun is the fact that you can you can help out people I really like that probably one of my most unique games and is that being able to do things yourself help show other people how to do them too and if you could not see in this game the people who were not doing so well then you couldn't help them out so there's a bit of a conundrum I'm not really sure where where to go with it I thought eyes up I've done it you kind of think that we're coming so far that the person might be really good at finishing but no there's actually some Christmas tree branches don't have lips on my purposely did that oh I see now that's Oh Bettis a better space scene still on the best for minutes 35 but I would have been so happy with that yesterday today know what is the rule the high score one minute 46 by DD 886 one it's absolutely an unreal and Java programmer has overtaken Bolton the fish and I am sinking down to number six the two minutes 53 I could have done so much better but I got stuck in space for ages it's so frustrating but I wonder whether this game would ever would have worked in scratch to have to say that scratch three has come a long way since it was first released which is very lucky because when the first released it's really slow prepared to scratch to think what a lot of people quite worried oh it's come a long way I know the scratch team are not super happy with the performance of the script editor they're using block which is a Google thing I believe to make the blocks although the Google's version didn't look anywhere near as nice as scratches scratch did a good job of redesigning the scratch blocks to look snazzy but it doesn't perform well for large scripts with computer behind it still quite slow scratch develop math scratch developer extension for the browser helps a bit because it means I can jump around and find mice find my scripts easier but I do think oh I do believe a scratch team of thinking about whether there's an alternative maybe later down the line no no just to ball it's always worth continuing then you get this far anyway though because I'm just not so good at the bit up here at the moment pardon don't practice it enough cuz I don't get it often enough so history this is where I would be raging if I ever got you guys to talk to no scope to rage anyway I go straight up to the left interesting yeah 433 how much two minutes what's the world record for 33 records 146 my goodness can you imagine what it must be like it's got imagine it it's amazing that's often I do hope you are I do hope you recorded a video because thankful one will be really happy to see it don't look nothing like this it makes me wonder when he plays it as he also dude these amazing moves like me where he flies Oh Oh oh mercy of all this bitmap it's just the pixels when you're watching games like this physics it's really tricky to work with pixels cuz I've got all these little itches my definition is square so the original game all the mountain was built from 3d assets which therefore had nice hit plugins was done yes all the physics was done using maths oh nice edges which means you can impact nice yeah physics are easy nice mathematical shapes when you have bitmaps like we have in scratch you get stuck on all the pixels which is really frustrating so you have to do your best to mitigate that with the scripting and I've done a pretty good job in this sure does get caught it's name record at least like nothing on this tree no mister oh goodness I can eat you fast laughs I am too far to the left I'm gonna get this one nice nearly nice have I got high enough are you gonna complete or are you gonna go back down again I'll close the light I must be so close man I have had it hang in space for a long time before where I just been on the edge of like the gravity of a planet it can be so frustrating really can I'd love to know what you guys do think of the ending whether I've got that right any of you guys who actually played the original game let me know with comments in my my scrap for jet probably is the best place for it I'm wondering whether anybody's gonna have a go creating another level for this game now that the games out because see it's just costumes it's got quite clever system to know which costume to use where you've got a name the costume as a grid location and it just automatically puts them all together the problem of course is drawing them all because you have to get them all to into the lock if there's any demand maybe I should work on a second level but my goodness how many hours did this one take me do you think take pretty well there's famous last words come on booth batch nice not so nice oh just congratulate myself on getting up this bit so smoothly I'm feeling about that I did it goodness yes I can no no no no no no oh please please please please please please oh that was tential it was potential and now time is ticking away that was looking really quite nice we could have managed a two and a half minutes there we could have done could have been my record my record not the record but it's missed missed it cuz of those space tacos it's very frustrating game isn't it and look at that sucked sideways slowly through space back towards space tacker out of context you wouldn't really quite get what that meant would you it's gonna be maybe three and a half three twentyfour space you'd think if you got that far that would be it that you have it you did a good run yeah but that's not a good position to be in scratch cat I think you have to do it again Oh like I was in slow motion [Laughter] think Meryl brought a significant amount of rage to scratch I do apologize I had no idea it was gonna be quite this bad I kind of thought I would make an easier version and I think I have but it's hard to know you know because I can't actually play that we all get in at the moment as my gaming PC's when out of action so I've had to do this without being had to play the game but when I did play it I was really bad and it frustrated me so much but of course in the making that I'm making at this game I've played this game loads so because I play this so much now what I don't know is whether having done so I actually would be really good at the regional game now but my gut reaction is 50 oh you've heard of that you had it consistency's the name and a game Oh popping consistency of falling I don't have it come on you're wasting my time by not sliding yeah that is my least favorite look that a little bit there on that trouser it's so hot so hard to get into and I honestly do not know what it is why sometimes it gets in other times it doesn't it doesn't make any sense to me as to what it is this game I tell you it's funny thing human nature isn't it it's like we like to be punished I think goodness into space all my arms are jiggling it's like they're spasming I'm not surprised after always hard work you would expect them to star spasming a bit I think my fingers will be spasm they after playing this game ah I have seen YouTube videos of people slamming into these bloomin tacos and not like goats obviously and then we all go and just not name what to do with them that was just terrible I'm not even getting not going to do it I'm gonna restart it go I meant to put in more of those comments that you get the start the one that says backwards yeah this comment here I meant to put more of those in I never got around to it I can I was thinking the big point useful like showing people the direction I meant to go in because some people say wait a mintue go here after you get soso bit and I could use those couldn't I'm like comments that's quite pleased when I thought the idea of having the comment of a star there are the fits nicely with scratch not what I actually use them in scratch hobby ever do you guys use the comments in your scratch code I think I would if they if they didn't slow down the scripting area and especially more if they actually rearranged neatly when you move the scripts around the biggest flaw with them it's the father they just stay where they were and you get these funny lines going across your screen where that script is joined on to something Russ semirandom after you've moved your scripts around then whose review guys have got my browser extension for scratch scratch developer tools I think I quit this Matt my goodness is that useful for tidying up your scripts doesn't support tidying comments though but that maybe it's something I should do isn't it really but it's so nice oh no no no it's so nice to be able to click the clean up button I'll have your scripts layout nicely just in one big line like the current scratch the actual bucket game is harder or easier than my back I would guess harder but with my success it's just it's just not I missed it missed it anything that's close to three minutes to be a good time I spend a lot of time floating around in space I really do it's very sad very sad he looks a bit bored a scratch cat I'm surprised he's actually quite surprising I can survive in space really maybe I should like I've been pull out a little space helmet when he enters the atmosphere that'd be cute yeah I'm liking the animation at the beginning out I have this should be coming out of your pot animation I didn't get round to that I was just in the end desperate to share the game ever since thinking about trying to create the idea I was just being so stoked to get a project out that people could play on closing you that wants people started playing it it'll be real fun and so in the end as soon as I have a project that was share worthy I shared it has to be said I don't often wait before sharing a project that it's actually finished a lot of my projects I will share way way early on already completed a little bit of them I guess I'm I'm quite lucky in that I have such a following that people don't really mind oh I just like falling there very much oh I also just like flying backwards and getting stuck on that and missing this this is where they start to rage because the things that is so easy suddenly to start becoming hard I know I've got here in 12 seconds before but it's just still good Oh quite a good time so this is the first nickel break deposition right no I said it can't hit that you know I just was too far mr. caching caching caching caching caching my good ten seconds behind my best pace it doesn't mean I'm gonna get my record because I always make a mistake just looking yeah much worse what we're doing wrong why isn't it cooking yeah I'm not gonna get it now it's like I'm aiming for the tiger and I tell you it's like could I could I be any more accurate aiming for the taco if I could just pop into the code right now and just delete all those tacos it's very tempting very very tempting to go and do that but of course I'm not going to do that it's supposed to be part of the fun not gonna pay for too much longer now I'm not quite sure what time it is where you are where I am it's oh my goodness it's like something believe it no I mean II don't like these bits where I have to launch myself it's like so what what is it about that suddenly becomes so difficult sometimes it just seems to be easypeasy like mine now I just look at the angles it just looks wrong it feels like I'm going to go the wrong way I do so what is it why is it look wrong yes I understand why really it just I need to be on the end well a whale space now stop slow slow slow start make up the pace I see was a beautiful bit of pace my stuck I think I'm getting tired maybe that's the reason sometimes you seem to lose control of the whole Mouse I think so much of it has to be down to body memory from playing it over and over again Doyle said well like I said it I only know I only had it on the thing that let me slip I was good today before I launched I shared this project up to then if you've got your hammer or something you pretty much has had it he wouldn't slip which is why I didn't have the snake in which should be just here and snake takes you all the way back to Stars 11 if you manage to take the snake right to the bottom I did draw a snake I had the asset ready to go snake yes I didn't have the snake because I did try and ridge need to add it but it really did not work with the physics yeah what she ended up happening was the hammer stretched out and your arms got longer and it didn't slide just did bad things but because I had changed the code just the day before I released it and added in sliding of oh wait the time lost time daddy didn't I is that a good route to get up space am i there am I being pulled back I'm being pulled back I didn't make it that's just this now I feel like I was in the middle of saying swing again just like last time the snake yes so I didn't put it into the original listen to the game when I released it because the physics didn't work but since then I have updated the physics and they do allow a lot more sliding but the way it works is that they're really slightly bit when you start to slip only occurs when you're travelling quite fast I think probably fast downwards which hopefully only occurs if you're falling but it does add quite a lot to the game the fact that you can slide a lot otherwise those epic Falls would not be anything like as epic and the game just wouldn't be itself but it does really frustrate another interesting thing that is in this game before we haven't noticed is that the cat when he falls really fast you might notice this is that he goes off screen and your hammer ah can go off screen as well when you're moving the screen Scrolls quite a bit you're moving quite fast but of course sensing blocks on scratch any work on screen no no no no no here look see it seemeth off screen now I'll just show you if I fly up here a second wave drop down I got a screen and yeah I can bump into things so how do I do that let's do it here off the screen yeah bang see I was able to detect that even though oops even though I was off screen so actually what happens is it Scrolls the entire level mom to screen with the cat in the middle of the screen does all its detecting and then Scrolls the level back off screen again before before it shows you what's happening so you don't ever see it happening but the screen is actually bouncing back and forth between you being in the middle and you being where you are visually so that it's sensing in one go and all the visuals in the next go go off frame I guess is a way to describe it ah that was a bit of a late addition to the game too because originally it was the cat was lying in the middle of the screen I couldn't really do it any other way but it works a lot better with a slow scrolling and if that effective I'm going off the screen that's quite important to the game could be nice thank you dog Fox actually sy sometimes it feels like you've got like a real oh man I'm not thinking I was gonna say you get into the swing of it and it feels really natural and then other times completely unnatural she was like you've got no control whatsoever Oh Oh No yes that my record okay I've actually got my record it doesn't say saving was it not 254 was my record 253 I haven't got call there but a little bit of catching on the very end there I would have got my record and I'd have been happy Oh maybe another day it's 10 minutes to midnight here so I'm gonna stop there thank you for watching it's been a fun experience I hope you've enjoyed it and I shall see you guys all scratch I do hope that all the audio has been working for you I've absolutely no idea I've got some messages here saying my streams bitrate is far too high my goodness it's way higher than it
