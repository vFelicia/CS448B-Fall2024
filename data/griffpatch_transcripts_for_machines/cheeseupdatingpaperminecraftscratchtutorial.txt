hello fellow scratchers ever wanted to add your own items and blocks to paper Minecraft well today I'll show you how demonstrating by adding the hugely significant cheese block perfect because it will allow me to show you how to set up smelting crafting and eating not to mention you'll get to see me build my dream house excellent now I've no doubt that soon you'll be creating the most awesome mods of your very own the most creative mods will be featured in my very next modding video so go to town and have a lot of fun and post your mods in a studio Linked In the description under this video okay Shall We Begin load up the latest version of paper Minecraft if you need it there's a link to that too in the description Now remix and the fun really begins just a word of advice this is a large project and if you find scratch tells you it just can't save try clicking the green flag to reset the project and that should solve the problem and it will save once more great I am going to add a cheese block so I need some cheese costumes now you won't be surprised that the Minecraft Community already has some suitable content that I could borrow I could have grabbed the assets from the rat mod webpage but for the best quality I went ahead and extracted the original images from the rat mod source files if you need them to then those will be linked in the description also back in scratch then we need to add the costumes to the tile Sprite this is just full of Minecraft blocks and item costumes just make sure you always add the new costumes to the bottom of the list changing the costume numbers of existing items will really mess up the game so here's my new cheese block we just need to ensure it's correctly sized select all with control a and drag while holding alt to keep it centered the final size wants to be exactly 10 of these grid squares tall or a 40 by 40 pixel costume if you want to go by the costume size now repeat this for as many costumes as you need it's a little trickier though for nonblock items as this sizing is a little harder to gauge it's actually two and a half times larger than the imported costume if you want to know okay I want these cheese items first so paper Minecraft is super meta we have many lists of data that drive the game engine the block data list make it visible contains information on each and every tile and item in the game now we could edit this list directly in scratch but to be honest it's much easier to handle if we right click the list and choose to export it to our computer then we can load up the list in notepad or notepad plus plus if you have that because I love being able to clone the view this opens the same file twice side by side and you'll see why this is cool in a moment this text file follows a record structure each record is 20 lines long and separated from the next record by a single blank line a record exists for every tile or item in paper Minecraft this top record though is a special header record as it just tells us what each line of a record is used for the best way to add a new block is by copying a record that's already there our cheese item is similar to any small item so how about we copy a gold ingot it's costume number 42. now in the text file we search up the number 42. and here we go you can see the title gold ingot and the item number just above it and above that a single space that separates the records so this gold ingot is item number 84. item numbers are not linked to costumes at all it's worth remembering that so select the entire record all 20 lines and copy them to your clipboard we'll drop down to the end of the text document and paste these at the end making sure to leave only a single blank line between this new record and our previous one don't leave any more or less otherwise this will not work so this is where having the second view of this file comes in useful I can match up the lines of our record with the header lines from the top of this document see the description matching up with the description line here now we edit the item number first this must always follow on from the previous record that was 287 so the next number is 288. next we give it a name piece of cheese none of the other settings are important right now except row 15 here tells us which category under the creative menu the block should be filed under perhaps materials that's an eight tile Sprite ID now this is the costume number of this tile cheese is 308 pop that in 308. we get to specify the costume again just in case we want a different costume when it's displayed in the inventory 308 again though and then here's the last change row 19 says root item id well what does that mean items with the same root ID can be used interchangeably for crafting so you might have all the woods with the same number if not just enter its own block ID to keep it unique 288. cool now before we move back into scratch make sure to save this text file to your computer then we rightclick the list in scratch and this time import selecting our updated block data text file okay might be worth scooting down and confirming the new block is there in the bottom yep piece of cake I mean cheese excellent we are ready for a quick test Hi D Block datalist before smashing the green flag and jump right into creative mode under the materials right yes there it is a piece of cheese and the tool tip works too I love that hey is cheese throwing a thing I think I might have invented a new game now I really wish we had cauldrons in paper Minecraft for curdling our milk into cheese but the next best thing would be a furnace smelting milk into cheese will have to do and it's dead easy to configure it's there in the block data header smelt into block ID so just remember that our cheese is item number 288 and then find the word milk in our block list here we go this must be the bucket of milk record I'll just line it up with the headers and then line 12 is the smelting so just replace that zero there with 288 a piece of cheese the next line is important too burn in furnace duration in seconds set that to 10 seconds I'll keep it short so that I can show you it working right make sure to save this file again and then in scratch reimport it into the block data list go go go a furnace a bucket of milk and some coal there's nothing like warm milk on a cold day or cheese what a happy surprise hey where'd my bucket go well back to my favorite pastime cheese throwing now let's add that block of cheese costume 309 this one is a placeable block two so this will be fun we can begin by finding and copying the dirt block as that is the most simple solid block paste it down at the bottom without obligofy single blank line to separate it from the previous record we need to increase the block ID from 288 so this will now be block ID 289 great line up the headings name block of cheese yes it's a solid block this time and the hardness can be soft like dirt 0.5 you can look these numbers up on the Minecraft Wiki digging tool we don't even need a spade s for this so set this to n or no tool required this isn't a liquid it doesn't fall like sand or gravel tile group we can use this to give the tile sound when we walk on it or apply other game properties but no we don't need that for this block now when the block is harvested we don't want to switch it for another block no so leave that as zero we're not smelting or getting hurt by the block ah now then the creative mode category I've decided we should probably recategorize the cheeses under the food studs that's number five tile Sprite ID for cheese Block Wars costume number 309 enter that in and repeat that again for the inventory costume 309. lastly the root ID needs to be the same as the number of the block ID 289 and that's all of it except to go back and make the piece of cheese appear under the foodstuffs category as well a change from 8 to 5 foodstuffs yay save the file and back into scratch import the updated block list feeling good about this we can see the cheese item and block are both in the foodstuffs category yay so cool because now I can finally build my dream house man what's not to love that is so cool and now what would Minecraft be without crafting how about we add a crafting recipe to craft a cheese block from four pieces of cheese and for this we need to locate another scratch list the recipes list it's not as complex as the block data list but still worth exporting to your PC for easier editing if you can you'll see there are only four lines to each record in the list recipe description product that's the item number quantity that's how many items you craft in one go and the recipe itself more on that in a moment just select the top record the four lines starting with the words wooden plank and copy that to the clipboard we'll paste this at the bottom of the file as before leaving a gap of one line between records and now we modify this new record my block data list is still open here on the right so I can find the details or the block of cheese in there copy the name and paste it into our recipe also the block number is 289 this is for the block being crafted the quantity is the count of items crafted just one for the block of cheese one block of cheese from four pieces and lastly we have the encoded recipe let's go over how this is formatted is the crafting table for our cheese block always ensure the recipe is pushed to the bottom left of the table we enter the item number for the piece of cheese 288 and any empty tiles we write in as a hash symbol and now what we do is begin at the bottom left and we write out the three digit number two eight eight if the number was shorter than three digits like say the number seven then we'd pad it out with leading spaces space space seven so it's always three characters long the next number is 288 again so we enter that right after the last without leaving a gap two eight eight and again we would pad that out with spaces to the left if needed then the hash and this 2 is padded out to the left with spaces so this is space space hash we repeat this onto the next line two eight eight two eight eight space space hash and the final row space space hash space space hash space space Ash and that's it I'll enter the completed recipe under the last just so that we can compare and notice how the columns line up and the three digit numbers are all right aligned padded out with spaces to their left good let's delete that old row above that's important so save the file the file then come back into support the new recipes file and we are good to smash that green flag now stock up with pieces of cheese then press T to talk and enter forward slash GM for game mode space s a survival that switches us to survival mode and we can test out a bit of crafting use the space key to separate out those cheeses wow nice the recipe worked that's so cool and so fun let's do it again haha there's no stopping us now how about we add the reverse recipe to split the blocks back into four cheeses we duplicate the previous recipe leaving a single line Gap we are crafting a piece of cheese that's item number 288 and we want to craft four pieces from one block and the recipe code is a single tile of 289 the block of cheese had the rest out with space space hashes and Save and import the text file back into scratch and test grab a block of cheese jump into survival and craft three blocks of cheese make 12 pieces of cheese Splendid and we can craft them back into blocks at whim so apart from building houses what can we do with these cheeses hey villager want some cheese no well wait I can't eat the cheese yeah there's yet another list to be looked at the food data list shall we export it and take a look more format I'll clone it to the other View and we can check out how it works here's a cake which is block ID of 111 in our game we just copy all six lines and then moving down to the bottom of the file paste it in with a single line Gap as normal so we want to eat a piece of cheese that's 288 a piece of cheese I can paste those two lines right in hunger points is next now luckily I can look these values up in the rat mod wiki hunger points is three see stuff that value in and the saturation that affects how long it is before you need to eat again and this value is 0.5 cool chance of food poisoning nah we don't need that and after eating nothing remains so leave that too we are done save the file and go back into scratch and you know what to do import the list and run the project filling up with the cheese now and eat ah ah okay of course I'm not hungry yet well I guess I'd better do some exercise hold on and it's dinner time yeah well
