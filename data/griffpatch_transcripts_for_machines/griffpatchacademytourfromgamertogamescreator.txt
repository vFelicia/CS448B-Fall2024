Academy modules and resources are you new to scratch well no problem module zero is our initial onboarding program for new scratches our tutorial Library gives access to my curated Archive of Griff Pat tutorial videos all off YouTube so add free and fully searchable more on that later and here's the official Academy course beginning in April where we'll walk through the first termly course together it's going to be epic but let's dig a bit deeper first into module zero so that we can see how the tutorials are presented so this module is made up of three videos covering the basics of getting signed up in scratch navigating the scratch editor and coding your first project a visually fun scratch conversation between scratch cat and Nano now as you progress through the videos your progress is tracked and you can easily resume from where you left off what's more if you need to find a specific point in the teaching there's a context aware search bar available at all times at the top of the screen where did I talk about the scratch costume editor yes that's right in episode 1 almost 3 minutes in you'll wonder how you ever lived without it so useful playing the video now and yes the interface is reassuringly familiar with access to the playlist open to the right but that can be switched for the full video transcript searchable of course or the video chapters so you can easily skip around each video also comes fully captioned with clear subtitles and what's this under the video haha we have some Lively comments where we can say hi give feedback or ask for help and last but not least video attachments these were much requested where you'll find our professionally designed course workbook PDFs these are really great and are a wonderful resource that add a huge amount of value to our already fantastic Academy offering talking of value our tutorial library is a comprehensive curated resource of rft patch tutorials you'll recognize a lot of scratch favorites in here and we'll be adding more all the time these videos cover a wide range of subjects from physics to pathfinding and from simple tutorials to more advanced topics best of all you can watch them

I am stoked for this one and as I said we won't be beginning until April and that is super purposeful you see I want to make sure that we all begin and walk through the coding course together at the same time this way we all get to share the ups and downs the exciting moments the bug fixes and your video comments and clever ideas all as a single Community together what this does mean though is
