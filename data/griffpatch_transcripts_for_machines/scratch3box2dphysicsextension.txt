hi this groups patch this is so cool I wanted to share it with you so scratched he has come and you might have known in the past that scratch to let you write extensions but they were really far away in scratch X and hardly anybody was able to see them we scratched three the plugins are kind of much more integrated with scratch like the pen blocks even might have noticed they're now part of the scratch extensions as are lots of other parts of scratch it used to be just native parts of scratch so when you write a scratch extension now they're much more integrated and this has let me write a little extension which of course you can't get hold of at the moment who knows what might happen in the future but here is a physics extension so I've added one in here look as with patch tests in the extensions and when it's added in what I've done is I've set up a whole Atta sprites these have got no scripts in whatsoever they're just placed on the screen like that the main cat has got one script called enable physics for all sprites and the loop saying step physics simulation and that's now running what I have here is when this collector sprite is clicked push with force simply v in a certain direction and that's attached to the cat so when I click the cat it's gonna apply a force to the cat now watch this okay physics in scratch I love it look at that and it's all done using these blocks so the integration is great because it means I can draw the shapes if I go click a new Y right I've drawn I can just import one so if I import in this little cherry here like this one my project there it goes it's all ready to go I can drag things around all my simulations are running and it takes the shape of the object from the convex hull which is already done for us in scratch so it's kind of useful and they go so you can write these projects if I load a different one here's another one I was working on with llamas and and delicious Mexican tasty things and a big apple and you can see so they're all simulating in physics and you don't really like much in scratch to get it to work just the main game part and then the physics take take control of the rest what you love to have a go with that so who knows at some point hopefully I'll be able to put a demo on the web you can have a play with but it doesn't half make for a lot of fun I really hope that scratch 3 will start allowing some of these extensions to be played with wouldn't that be fun
