hello fellow scratchers we recently ran our first game Jam within the Griff patch Academy and wow was it a blast the theme was just too much which was wide open to interpretation and so we had over 150 entries ranging from Platformers to puzzlers to animations and yes I played them all and now for your viewing pleasure I will present my top 22 shortlisted projects and pick eight winners across the seven different game genre as you know scratch has a thriving community of animators and their submissions were simply hilarious many projects played with the theme of too much whether that was too much work or too many potatoes or too many ideas but two projects stood out for their Ingenuity quality control by FR wolf UB follows a story of a mad cat scientist and their super duper quality computer TM problem is it requires all the power from the New York City Power Plant to run it and that turns out to be just too much and so this clever Choose Your Own Adventure begins having found yourself dropped into some strange distant land and with an amusing drop in the visual production quality the First Choice intriguingly bids you to enter a time machine and so now having to click the green flag yet again to start the game strangely things are not the same unfortunately a Time Paradox kicks in and the game ends but this is by no means the only ending nope there are 11 of them can you find them all I really appreciate the effort that went into drawing the animations and a cinematic framing of each shot the text engine is also great but perhaps a way to skip through some of the dialogue and scenes even faster would be a bonus but I'm nitpicking here so yeah very cool indeed up against this we have our second animation just to much ideas by Binky Beaver uh Idea Idea Idea like a number of entries this animation focused on the concept of coming up with an idea however this time the protagonist stumbles across the Griff patch Academy which in turn ignites their brain with too much ideas I see what you did there so they get down to it to making a project and then surprise surprise you actually get to play the game right in the middle of the animation that's really quite unique and I love it just a little warning it turns out that too many ideas outside of the Griff patch Academy can lead to hospitalization due to brain overload just thought I'd warn you like with a number of other animation entries Binky Beaver went to the trouble of voice acting their characters which is always Really Brave and can be really difficult so yeah they did a great job ooh so picking a category winner both of these shortlisted projects went above and beyond but I'm going to have to go with quality control troll very cool and well done so our next game submissions are those that fall into the arcade genre and we had a lot of these so I had to split them roughly between General arcade and all round directional Shooters so arcade games these tend to be all about fast level progression upgrades and yes high scores and I've got five shortlisted entries to show you starting with just to Dango by mnnnn 3344 the kingdom of cringle Mary is under attack by the infamous Dango horde it is up to us to take on the role of the honorable Knight and fight through these delicious bouncing desserts once you get the hang of the first wave you quickly find that things only get harder from there it's really just one big multistage boss battle and we all love boss battles and gosh once you reach the big guy himself it's just too much for me but the repetitive nature of each stage and gradually increasing difficulty lends well to the feeling that with practice you can progress further and faster you just need to figure out your strategy and stick with it it's wellcoded looks great and it's a blast to play is it too much well let's see the competition just too much advertisements by Malo and Ouija and I just love this idea and don't we all hate ads thank goodness there aren't any ads in my videos within the Griff patch Academy anyhow this game is essentially a simplified Flappy Bird Style game the catch being you have to also fend off all the popup ads that are vying for your attention and man the game would be hard enough without this distraction and it quickly becomes all too much very clever and perhaps just a little too real since sometimes you can't even reach those close buttons since they appear off the screen I think perhaps it would be more fun if there was some kind of difficulty progression starting a bit easier but the concept is very entertaining just too much blocks by Bluey bat games and apparently this game has the best death animation ever if they don't say so themselves well I guess we'll see wow what a Polish Game this is the UI is great with lovely transitions this arcade game is simple you take control of this little white dude who must fend off the incoming enemy cubes by dashing at them with a click of the mouse the early levels are quite relaxed but jumping into level two things really heat up and yes that is a cool death animation nice one entering level three well the game gets quite challenging as there really are just too much blocks but I do enjoy the addition of the large explosive blocks that help you to clear the screen of enemies fast that brings a touch of strategy to the game which is a really nice touch the next project is named switch by Swift now this has a much more laidback feel to it a unique Twist on the the repetitive vertical shooter where you take control of two individual turrets each guarding their half of the screen the catch is that only one turret can move at once so while one is cycling back and forward dealing death to a wide area the other turret is focused on a single point of course a simple click of the mouse reverses his behavior so we can defend the entire playing field where this mechanic really starts to get interesting is when the larger boss enemies show up these monstrosities require a prolonged bombardment of bullets to clear them from the screen so now things get a lot harder to manage in general I really love this idea it's fun to play but it could be even better if we had more gratifying feedback as our bullets bounced off the enemies some kind of particle effects explosions sounds or screen Shake perhaps and once you play for a while suddenly you get into situations that are simply impossible to beat which is a little frustrating now the last in this category Diamond bouncer by dxr TC SSH now this is a very intriguing project it's ridiculously simple bounce a diamond off your paddle to revent it going off the bottom of the screen yes we've seen it all before right well not in this too much flavor because now with every bounce we get double yes double the number of diamonds so how on Earth are we expected to cope with this well your guess is as good as mine all I can say is seeing that high score of 30 drives me to keep playing it's tantalizing to think that somehow you could be the one to get lucky and get that top high score and I think I got pretty good with 13 man is it really possible to get them all I don't know but it drives me mad awesome game and yeah it's just too much okay guys they were our five arcade submissions and what a difficult choice is since they are all so good for different reasons at the end of the day I'm going to have to choose just too much blocks by Bluey bat games for their superb presentation and excellent gameplay what swung it for me was although the gameplay does become too much it always feels like you can get better and beat your previous score a Hallmark of a good arcade game so on to the next genre this is the clicker game and although we had a number of submissions in this category only one made it into the short list and that was Johnny buns King of Cony Island by bits of code and what a classy game this is and it's a simple concept you are entering a Hot Dog Eating competition and have to eat as many hot dogs as possible within 2 minutes click the hot dog Button to eat a hot dog but spam it too fast and you start to get indigestion that slows you down faster still and he turns an unfortunate shade of blue but quickly drink some liquids and you can get back into the game again the trick is finding that perfect balance and and stuffing in just way too much that is healthy for sure but it's mighty gratifying when you get into the swing of it anyhow want to challenge my top 247 high score go on I dare you so yeah this is a masterfully engineered game and hold on what you're a coding coach well of course you are oh gosh well excellent game and keep up the good work you win this category the next category I'll call the dodging games there was some Fierce competition in this genre but I managed to whittle it down to just three so here they are don't die by Strider 2013 they have a very pleasant title screen love the button animation here and this is a classic example of this type of game we are keyboard controlled which limits movement speed and it has a catchy tune and the game Begins the important thing is that we are given a heads up to each impeding death scenario hopefully just enough to hour to get out of the way in time the colors are all very nice as is the costume based HP counter the only problem I have is that things do get a bit out of hand quite quickly and there are some useful Health pickups to keep us going surprisingly long but man I do find I almost always lose HP trying to reach them great job though a very good game next up we have two many projectiles by word four this is a similar concept to don't die but with a very very different feel for starters it has less of a party feel almost feeling relaxed but with an odd tension the build up of difficulty is also nice and gradual so it gives you time to really get into this game interestingly the player movement simply follows the mouse this means we can move very precisely yet with great speed if required it's a fun choice and it works well as more and more ways of enemies are introduced to compound our problems each with their own shape light p and behavior to be mastered when this all comes together it really does become too much the question is just how long you can keep going what I love about this one is that you really feel the progression towards the inevitable and yet with skill you may be surprised just how long you can keep things up Okay the third out of three undertale the infinite void by ows 11 this one needs no introduction an undertale boss battle no less and I can can tell you a lot of work has gone into this one be that from the awesomely animated character rig to the very sweet text Engine with appropriately witty dialogue to the crazy difficult everchanging battle sequences prepare to spend a good 10 minutes blazing through this epic demo what I can say is unless you are some kind of undertale battle Pro you don't stand a chance of getting very far the only reason I could see the game out was that ow rs1 made the space key reset your health ha very handy and I'm pleased they did because I enjoyed each fight sequence just to see how things played out after stage 11 the game kind of resets I believe and after I got to 19 the whole thing ground to a halt even so it was a very good entry and a very fine demo of what they are capable of well done you but we have to choose a winner and from these three it was dead hard but in the end I had to go with too many projectiles by water for just cutting ahead of the batch for making a game with great progression requiring skill to advance even in the face of becoming too much so shall we progress on to our platformer games let's see how our contributors envisaged just too much in this genre scratch platformer by JP Calas Pro and what the heck is going on in this platformer why am I surrounded by Space Dogs the level is just so busy and full of stuff going on so it's so hard to know what to do what's more you don't have time to hang around because this rising sea of lava will make short work of you and there's simply No Escape I can't quite figure out if I hit a bug or whether it's a feature but I seem to get stuck in the ceiling and fly across the screen not that it helped me at all and I was soon very much out of lives I can't quite say that I enjoyed playing this crazy chaotic platform but it sure fits the bill of being too much after that we are sure to need some relief and we certainly get that with the immensely Pleasant adventure of Mr Jack by um I all ran namaru well I never knew how badly I wanted to be a bright colorful bird until I got to try it out in this wonderfully creative take on the classic platformer and man I just love how the level has been put together each screen joining to the next to form a large colorful world that Mr Jack inhabits and he has a mission to collect all the fruits and keys open this door at the top of the world I wonder what's inside is this game too cute too delightful too too colorful I'm not sure but it was certainly fun playing it so thank you for your submission and then we move from the bright colorful world of Mr Jack to the dark Eerie world of the cavern of the shifting Shadows by pbne and that's a good way to describe what this game is in general Eerie the whole world is Shifting and moving appearing and disappearing can we navigate our way through this crazy Cave System avoiding spikes traps Falling Rocks or getting crushed by the moving platforms themselves as we progress there are various intriguing powerups that can leave you inverted playing upside down or simply slow the scrolling of the game it's a nice aesthetic and it does play well into the theme of just too much with all the movement and threat around every corner I do wish there was perhaps a progress indicator or score Sonic's fruit Mania by sparkster 1993 well what do we have here a Sonic fan no less and this really is rather a good attempt at the basic Sonic game I'm very impressed with the inclusion of well animated cutscenes and dialogue into the main platform of gameplay so Dr Eggman has stolen the seven Chaos Emeralds and the job of retrieving them is just too much for Sonic to do alone mhm I think we are again stepping slightly outside of what is permissible as a game Jam submission here anyhow it's a very wellp put together project I'd love to see some classic Sonic moves like some antigravity speedrunning but yeah I know it's super hard to get right maybe I can make a tutorial on that one day but it's now time to pick a winner and it's the cavern of the shifting Shadows by Pine 0000 because of its just two Eerie shifting changing levels that are both challenging but simple in design not overwhelming the player with crazy visuals but maximizing on its theme well done Pine 0000 I hope you continue to develop your game now everyone loves a good puzzle and we've got three hot listed entries up for the challenge our first entry is too much Party People by Leo games 20 a delightfully simple puzzle where we are at a party and we must click on all the people who do not have white hats well I think I can manage that oh well okay they really are mingled together just the colored hats colored hats colored hats and it seems that new party members are arriving all the time oh no now a bit of a problem we have is that some of the people we need to click on get unfairly positioned behind other people it would be nice to find a way to get around that what I really do like though is that each time you play the game you get a different rule to look out for be that eye colors or hat colors yeah really nice next up bubble carrots by ear the cool guy this puzzle game requires us to battle the clock to collect as many tasty treats as possible in 2 minutes the trick is that we can only move to Red neighboring squares Brown squares are walls and orange squares well they are game over that's the rules and although it sounds simple it's amazingly easy to get it wrong when the treat you are after is right there next to you and the timer is ticking away I do very much like this game and it's a clever idea with great execution but is it too much so that brings us to speed search by not a school account right away I can see that they've made good use of my Sprite layering tutorial to keep their Sprite ordering in check good job so here we go it's a Race Against Time in this game to follow the instructions given in each round be that to find a cup or to find two matching items or the fastest moving item in the scene and man sometimes times especially on the two matching items it can be surprisingly difficult dare I say just too much I really like the presentation of this game and it cleverly gets around any issues preventing the clicking of items by keeping them moving sorting them from back to front and slowing their motion down when the mouse hovers over them all in all a really wonderful entertaining game so the winner of this just too much puzzle category is speed search by not a school account for polished Graphics solid coding and wellth thought out game mechanics that sit well in the just too much theme are very well done to you and that brings us to the final game genre the classic shooter game although it crosses over a bit with our arcade game category these four next entries differ in that the player can more freely move around the level and fire in any direction so first up the unpixel by weird stuff 123 it's a fine example of this category where you take on the role of a Fearless cube in a world infested with the evil unpixel luckily you are armed with a handy gun that as you progress is upgradeable to help you tackle wave upon wave of ever more dangerous enemies now the upgrades are not only limited to your gun but also boost your speed almost insanely so and you'll find some very much needed Health drops too question is just how long can you keep the balance in your favor I just wish there was some kind of score visible so that you could tell tell how well you did guys you should always include a score next up it's too many gurgles version zero by B danger fish what an awesome title this game looks suspiciously familiar yes it's a great reworking of lemonides we get thrown into a frantic battle against our enemy the gurgles luckily we have a seemingly infinite supply of potatoes to fire back at them and they certainly didn't see that coming and they are surprisingly effective what I particularly like is that the game is set to music which SNS beautifully with the stages of the game dividing it into levels each harder than the last but finally being described as way too much and gosh it certainly feels that way but shock I was able to complete this one was I lucky I'm not sure but it certainly felt like a great achievement next up deserted by mangoes Django it's a very attractive single screen shooter set in a desert where you take on the role of um yeah this little guy now the level is a dangerous place where you must avoid wandering snakes and battle the incoming cacti creatures and this is where the game shines because the cacti are definitely using real pathfinding did you watch my tutorial on that and it works great here but also your projectiles are bouncing projectiles which makes the whole game exceptionally fun once you dispatch a cactus go out and collect their Mana it's just a shame that after a while while of play the game does tend to bug out especially on the second level I suspect it's down to the screen Shake causing problems with Collision detection I'm sure if it got fixed this game would be an absolute Gem and that leaves us with tale of the sidethe bearer by DJ Wacko and oh my was this an unexpected treat DJ wacko did a great job with the coding and I have to give a shout out to ultra catty for the crazy awesome art what a sensational collab the game begins with a simple tutorial where we learn how to move around teleporting being your thing for fast travel then clicking your mouse calls down purple Blast From Heaven you don't have a lot of range but they will be very effective against your foes and these little crates once you've collected enough of these green energy balls you can engage your special ability and call forth four awesome Mega blasts that I would expect to scare away anything silly enough to consider coming up against us and things do start nice and easy these small energy blasts have enough knock back that they can stop the enemies in their tracks and leave you to collect your welldeserved Mana but it's not long before the levels ramp up in difficulty and things start to get out of hand but even so these awesome energy blasts turn out very handy as expected and I didn't find it too difficult to reach the end of this game man I wish it could be so much longer are you planning on continuing this gosh so good but guys do you think this game embodies a theme of just too much tricky well picking a winner is a mix of asking how well the game embodies the theme and how fun it is to play and so I'm going to have to say the winner in this shooting category is too many gurgles by be danger fish for such an intense yet structured battle and although it is set against an unfathomable number of enemies still provides a rout to success congratulations and so yes I did say that that was the last category but I do want to give out one last special award for the most impressive submission and out of all the projects I played this has to go to JD wacko for the tale of the side Bearer it may have come second for the title of just too much but it is an absolutely gorgeous looking game with so much potential and I would love to play more of it so well done you and Well Done everyone who submitted an entry you all did so well and it was a pleasure getting to play your games there's a link to all the projects mentioned and the winners under this video so do check them out and I cannot wait to see what you guys in the gri patch Academy make for next month's game Jam challenge until then scratch on guys
