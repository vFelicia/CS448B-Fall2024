hello fellow scratchers i'm griff patch and today we are adding vertical scene switching to our classic platformer game yes that not only means you'll be able to walk off the left and right hand edges of the screen but also the top and bottom edges too this allows us to build much larger more exciting multidimensional levels not only is this super useful for platform games like this one but also for rpgs or other games that you might like to have a go at coding oh yeah the same basic code can be used for both right though before we begin just quickly make sure to save your projects as a copy and name it episode 6. okay let's get scratching we need to begin by expanding our level scenes click into the level sprite now you'll remember that the scene switching is coded around each costume being named scene and then a number as we move across the level we go from scene 1 to scene 2 then scene 3 and so on now i want to add a new scene not to the left or right but directly above scene 1. what we can do is use the number square technique by saying each upward movement doesn't add a 1 but adds 100 to the scene number that would make the scene above scene 1 as scene 101 then the scene to the right of scene 101 is of course 102 then 103 and so on okay so duplicate the costume for scene one and i'm going to flip it upside down for now to match up with the scene below but you can draw this in any way you like cool then go to down and make it look great i'll add a walkway here now don't forget to name this new scene this is the scene above scene 1 so adding 100 that's scene 101 with a capital s now with the scene drawn and named correctly we need to code up this new scene change click into the player sprite and scroll down to the when i receive show tick last script this is already handling the player moving off the left and right hand sides of the screen it makes sense then to extend it to look for movements of the bottom and top too but look this costume block begins scene hash only has an input for an x position we are going to need a y position for this to work right click on the block and we'll edit it change the text label from x to be x and y and then add a new numeric input naming it y okay so the y inputs should be blank and that's the way we are going to keep them so don't fill in a value even of zero more on that in a moment so duplicate the two if block stacks and pot them right below we need to adapt these for changes in y position rather than x so remove the exposition blocks and in their place use the y position block the maximum height of the screen is different to the width it's 180 pixels from the middle to the top edge so we look for y bigger than 180 that is off the top of the screen mirror that below with a check for y position being less than 180 c hash plus one no now we move up a scene we do as we said we would and add 100 to the scene then for the down script use negative 100. that leaves the x and the new y inputs well the x ones we can blank out as we don't want to change the player's x position when moving up or down a scene but we do want to change the y position when we move off the top of the screen we must position our player back at the opposite edge so a new y of minus 180 and for moving off the bottom a new y value of 180. so that's the theory we just need to modify this begin scene to make it work here's the set x block but now this x input may be blank we need to be careful not to change the x when this is the case if x is greater than blank then set x to the x input good now we can do the same for the y inputs by duplicating that if block switching the x inputs for y inputs and making sure to use the position block set y2 and pop in the y input okay nearly there scrolling down a touch do you remember this very useful custom block we created fix collisions in direction the direction at the end is important here when moving scenes left or right the zero allows scratch to look up and down in case the player is stuck in the ground after the change of scene to get them free in the case where we change scene by moving off the top or bottom of the screen we don't want to search up and down for collisions but instead left and right we'll use an if else block pop a fixed collision block in each and then grab the x is greater than block from up here and we'll use that as the condition when we are setting an x position we want to search up and down as normal for a collision so leave that one as is but otherwise we'll assume this is a change of scene up or down so replace the second zero with a 90 degrees that will search first to the right and then to the left to get us out of collisions perfect shall we dance smash the green flag and up we go jump jump oh no oh man let's try that again if i can just time it right oh it's a bit tricky it turns out but the good news is without thinking about it the scene is of course switching correctly up and down so that's really great oh gosh come on i just need to hold right as i wall slide to keep attached to this tricky right wall yes there phew little celebration now question what happens if i walk off to the right ouch it's scene 102 but of course we haven't yet designed that costume so the costume stays on scene 101 and we get trapped in the wall i think we know what to do though right click into the level sprite and we'll duplicate scene 101 the numbering is not quite so automatic anymore since we have introduced the new 100s it appears as scene 6 but we want this to be scene 102 that's one to the right of scene 101 of course i'll do my flip horizontal trick repositioning the entire scene in the canvas then making sure to unselect all the graphics let's give that a test i'm holding my breath for this climb oh cool i think i've got the hang of it now and then off to the right we have scene 102 success indeed we can switch back and forth between scenes 101 and 102 with ease perhaps i could drop down to scene two oh bother i added a roof to scene two so that's problematic as you can see you do have to think your levels through a lot more carefully when you add in up and down scene changes too we can just quickly adjust scene two pulling back the roofer to leave a gap now test test test test test here we go and drop down woohoo super now everything is pretty good here it wasn't the hardest change to add because luckily weird being quite forward thinking and most of the ideas were already in place from episode 2. before we finish this small episode though can i just suggest one small change to our vertical scene changes let me just rearchitect scene 3 to add a nice vertical wall jump area making heavy use of holding the alt key to drag in a new duplicate of an existing shape now i'm going to duplicate the entire scene costume naming it scene 103 so it's directly above the previous scene and then i'll flip it vertically now i'll clean it up i want to keep the wall jumping area in the same place great now watch this if i get to the area on the level and now jump up here oh i do love this wall jumping what you should notice is that when i jump onto the new screen i'm often very close to the bottom and can slide off really quickly back to the previous screen this is okay but it does make the game a bit fiddly you may prefer like me to actually move the player a little further up when they enter the scene above and it's easy to do click into the player sprite and find that when i receive tick last script here is where the player moves off the top of the screen so instead of positioning us down at minus 180 that's really low down swap that for say minus 160. that's 20 pixels higher up let's see if we could see the difference jumping up here yes so now as we enter the next scene our player is positioned just a little bit higher up giving us more time to wall jump again and see what's going on i think that's better don't you well okay then so this is a shorter episode not so much to cover but there is plenty more to come very shortly but before i close i'm going to just come back to my scratch profile and show you a few of the amazing projects that have been submitted to the classic platformer studio from the previous episode okay so here we are in the mega classic platformer part 5 studio and oh my goodness look at all of these projects there are so many my goodness you've been involved in this it's really great so let's go for the very first one in the studio so this is by jensen6677 okay oh funky i like this let's play wow look at this you have already tried to make moving platforms wow it looks like i'm sitting down on that that's rather cool okay there'll be a lot more on that coming in a few episodes time whoa yeah we'll fix that so don't worry oh oh look at this this is really cool go on come on yes ew it's freaky this is a really good level it goes on and on yep this is it i found the end right in that case let's go and explore somebody else's project okay now going to the top this is the last one that's been submitted part five scripts oh my goodness look at that some really freaky thing going on here look at the background it's all like glowing and like lightning and rotating very slowly but i love the oh that is interesting or is the actual level itself changing it is the level is throbbing as well oh that's so crazy oh that's great oh right oh nice i love this level oh it's working really well oh that's not the end no no there's more up up hey all jump time brilliant oh this is don't go here i don't believe that at all i'm going there didn't trick me i think i've done it it can't be 91 levels 90. it's a timer but i've reached the end i feel like i should have won so let's have a look any more we can have a look at this project's by turquoise man5 oh it's got a story where am i i must go to my house please help me do you want the health bar in the game yes i do look at this lava i'm going to add a lava like that in the next episode somebody's oh whoa whoa okay it's getting a bit trickier this oh no no oh man i'm dissolved try again oh oh it's just oh come on come on come on i did this last time oh thanks like it oh my goodness just jump there we go i must go to my how oh no well i'm not gonna get there now i might okay okay one health left i mustn't die i mustn't die okay i'm getting there right okay no oh my goodness yeah yeah okay what's up in there oh oh let's see it's another one um oh look a bunny here we go then oh cute oh look at the animation it's amazing okay you guys are way ahead look you've got lava what happens if i die in this one oh it's not lava it's happy it's all good right wardrobe wall jump yes go bunny this is brilliant i love the uh elevation oh no that's okay i can't die it's not lava i keep thinking about that previous game i love the skipping that's brilliant here we go oh yes oh no i went out level i feel like there should be more i also like the background of this one that really adds to it okay let's see what else we can have looks tempting nothing tempting platforming resource mobile that sounds clever assume that means this yeah look someone's added click support which one should we try oh look let's do this one really got some little snow effects yes i love the snow look it's coming down oh well done scratcher 99m i like the sun effect ooh they're kind of hazy craziness pretty come on let's jump up here this also reminds me of a movie i've seen it i very much enjoyed that scene where is it gone okay wow this cat's super fast let's go oh no i put my head on this text i feel like i should be reading this but uh i'm just going so fast that i don't feel oh okay i'm not going too fast now oh this bit harder to text let's go down here i knew it i'd have done the same oh tricked me again it said and it's right it did i'm cunning of you some text back to the front oh you genius i'm glad you guys can get ahead and do these things this is really exciting i wonder if you've done it the same as i'm gonna do it oh what's this look we found a crown it's a hologram oh no it's a hologram but the crown was back there what are you doing i don't know oh water kills me it's a bit harsh i like this oh i like this um turn of events so much more egypt i feel harsh that water kills me though it's like i guess cats don't like water do they how far does this go i hope i'm going to reach that scene from the thumbnail do you feel like it's keep yes this is it this is the scene it reminds me of of that scene what movie was it anybody remember put it in the comments this is real oh that crap no no oh my gosh what's going on oh no no no scratching i can't help but click on this scratch cat platformer look at that it's a beautiful blue level and it's all contained which i really rather like in which direction i need to go in it's like a maze oh look it is a maze i'm just trapped in this maze work out which direction to go in get out ah i didn't take the bottom route which is very lucky because i would have been stuck a very tight wall jump oh yes that was fun and oh no oh oh dear i think that's the end that was
