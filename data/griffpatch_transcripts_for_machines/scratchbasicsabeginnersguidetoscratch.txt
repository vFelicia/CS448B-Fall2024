hello I'm griffpatch founder of Griff patch Academy welcome to this Speedy lesson on how to get started with scratch an awesome coding platform developed by the MIT media lab where we can create our very own interactive stories games and animations today we're going to take a quick tour of the scratch website and Editor to get you started on your creative Journey let's start by opening our web browsers and going to the scratch website at scratch.mit.edu or you can just Google it here you'll find a community of creators a gallery of projects and of course the scratch editor but before we dive into that on the homepage why did we take a moment to explore you can view featured projects see what's popular or check out the latest Creations from the community yes it's a great place to find inspiration and see what's possible with scratch go on have a wand around and take in all that awesome creativity Now to create your own projects we have two options either we could join Scratch by clicking on the join scratch button and following the instructions to create our new account it's quick easy and free or if we prefer to stay offline you have the option to download the scratch 3 editor from most app stores here it is in the Windows store and again it's quick easy and free however just be aware the offline editor lacks access to the community scratch features so the scratch editor once you're logged in Click create in the top menu to open the scratch editor this is where the magic happens you'll see three main areas the stage is on the right where your projects come to life the block pallet is on the left containing categories of blocks that you can use to code your project and then the coding area is in the middle this is where you'll drag blocks from the pallet to build your script okay let's create a simple project we don't have to make do with this default scratch Sprite we can start by deleting that one and adding our own you can choose one from the costume library or Draw our very own in the costume editor yes we can have a whole lot of fun in here without ever touching the coding but come on let's make the Sprite move make sure we are back in the code Tab and then find the motion category in the block pallet and drag a move 10 steps block into the coding area now let's make this action happen when you click the green flag from from the events category drag a when green flag clicked block and snap it to the top of your move 10 steps block click the green flag above the stage to see your Sprite move excellent so how about saving and sharing our new project if we're using the online scratch editor our project Autos saves quite regularly so there's no need to worry there however you might like to give it a more suitable name such as my first project if you want to share your Creation with the scratch Community click that share button now clicking on the C project page allows us to fill out instructions and notes and credits making it easier for others to understand and enjoy your project lastly to see all all your saved work click the my St on the top banner and there it is what fun now for those who are using the offline editor you can save your projects by clicking file and then save to my computer it's as simple as that well congratulations you've just taken your first steps with scratch there's so much more to explore and create if you'd like to learn more then head over to my Griff patch Academy to begin your journey from gamer to games creator
