hello fellow scratchers this is a super short but hopefully helpful tutorial on how to create those nice bright trail effects in scratch they were recently featured in my boys video and i got a lot of requests asking how did i do it so without further ado i'll show you i'll start by creating a forever loop so that scratchcat follows my mouse pointer just like this and now we have something to add a trail to so there are two different approaches to creating trails using clones and stamping each with its own benefits and drawbacks first we'll look at the cloning technique drop a crate clone of myself into the forever loop and whew we're off right away you can see that we are leaving a trail of cats behind our mouse and the clones are building up fast in fact within no time at all we hit the 300 clone limit and bam no more clones can be made so the trail stops forming here but not to worry i wasn't envisaging having a trail anywhere near this long anyhow so how do we make it shorter bring in a when i start as clone and a repeat 10 loop after about 10 repeats we can delete this clone the result of this is that each clone will hang around for about 10 ticks of our game and then be deleted that's cool but the effect we are after is for the trail to fade away gradually rather than just stopping all at once so from the looks category drop in a change effect by block and we want the ghost effect for now set the change amount to also be 10 and then run the project and there we go we have achieved a simple sprite trail that's really smart if i just pause the video for a moment i would like to point something out and that is that the trail left behind by a ghost clone is visible through the clone in front of it and this may not bother you but just remember this for now as i will revisit it later on okay so we have a trail that is 10 clones long what if we want longer trails no problem to make it easy create a new custom block naming it fade over and we need an input of frames and why not finish with a label frames and for once we don't want to run without screen refresh that's because this script wants to perform an animation over a number of frames not run in a single quick frame so we'll drop this in as the first block when i start as clone and the following scripts they can move into the new define block nice the idea then is that we can enter how many frames we want our trail to last for let's try 25 frames so our repeat block can now use the frames input that will be 25 right now but what about this change ghost effect how much do we need to change this by to make the fade last for 25 frames the solution is to consider that a ghost of 100 is fully ghosted so if we divide that 100 into frames that is 25 pieces then that will add back up to 100 after 25 repeats perfect run the project yeah that's splendid very cool indeed now we can choose exactly how long each trail will be so we did it so why isn't this tutorial over well because using clones to create trails is not always possible you see we only have 300 clones to work with at any one time and often we want more than just one sprite to have a trail so i'm going to teach you option two and this one uses the pen extension and stamping so let's rewind and go back to our simple forever loop without any cloning in sight now click on the extensions and choose the pen extension brill we can drop an erase all as the first block in our script just to ensure we begin with a blank pen canvas each time the project runs and try placing a stamp block right after moving the sprite in the forever loop and here we go again we have an endless stamping mouse trail that was easy and this time no clones being created and thus no limit on how long i can go on drawing this trail where we do have a problem is getting this long trail to fade out since once we stamp a sprite it's no longer changeable it's just part of the background well then we'll need another trick and let me show you something start with an eraser all and click that and i'll move scratch cat into the open next up make a new sprite and we'll name it fader i'll make it a bitmap costume and then i can fill it pure white yeah that fully obscures scratch cat for now who is behind this fader sprite some scripts when flag clicked go to zero zero this ensures it fully covers the stage and then go to the back and hide that will bring scratchy into view once more and we want to now click into the scratchcat sprite1 and duplicate the stamp block this is what i wanted to show you click stamp and i can now move scratch cat over to the right leaving behind the stamped cat as expected so what happens if we then stamp the white fader sprite right afterwards well no prizes i'm afraid if you guessed that it would stamp the white costume right over the old stamped cat costume they are now completely erased so that wasn't so useful okay then let me set that back up again stamping the cat and come back to the fader sprite once more this time though we set the ghost effect to 50 before we stamp the background so this time when we click the scripts rather than making the whole stage white we only fade it towards white by half 50 white that is cool then once more we can stamp the cat where it is and we get a fresh bright cat back in the fader sprite do the stamp again and not only does the last stamped cat fade away but the older faded cat fades out even further that's so cool this process we can just simply repeat over and over each click of the fade script makes the previous stamped graphics fade further and further away until they finally vanish from view i think you get the idea let's put this into practice stick the set ghost effect after the other scripts and bring in a forever loop for our stamp block this will now continually fade away anything that we tried to stamp in our case that would be our scratch cat stamped in its own forever loop over here if we run the project then well can you see the trail yes it's there very subtle but it is there to make it more prominent all we need to do is change this ghost effect to a larger value approaching 100 let's try 90 wow guys look at that now this is quite a different effect to the clone based trails firstly if i pause it for a second see how each cat is not transparent you can't see the cat behind showing through that makes the trail a lot cleaner and less confused than the clone based one plus we are no longer creating tons of clones and that is a good thing too but the other difference is that the trail does tend to have this screen burn effect like it fades away but the last residue hangs around for a lot longer than you might otherwise expect well that is the way of it and how this method tends to work do try changing the ghost effect to different values to alter the effect it is actually quite fun and you can try each of these methods using clones or stamping and find the one you prefer many scratch projects use either of these but if you saw my boys video i was using the stamping method for my boyds the reason was that i had way too many clones already to afford using more just for the trails so we come to the end of this short tutorial i hope this was helpful to some of you and that you can just slot that into your projects and have some fun it works great in so many different projects and
