hello fellow bug squishers and welcome to this special bug fixing episode of our raycasters series there have been a bunch of common issues reported over the last six episodes so i'm hoping that this video will help round up most of them and get everyone up to date each issue and fix has its own chapter so let's just jump right in and summarize what fixes are coming up fix number one is for the small player syndrome all the way back from episode two this is where only the top half of the level is drawn and makes us look really small or the level is towering above us fix number two is for when only one type of entity appears in our game even when we should be seeing nanos francs and even collectibles this was since episode four fix number three is for the mysterious extra entity bug where this mysterious entity we didn't add would appear in our level fix number four is for entities clinging to the edge of the screen yeah i don't like that fix number five help my walls have turned into sprites looks amazing but just amazingly wrong and finally fixed number six for those who want more than nine entity costumes more of a feature request than a bug but we'll cover that quickly here anyhow so those are the ones we're going to fix today let's get bug squishing fix number one is for the small player syndrome this problem has been reported to me many times since episode 2 and this is where the level's walls appear to only come halfway down the screen it makes it feel like the player is really small but it's a simple fix in the raycaster sprite under the single ray script the cause for this is that you've probably used a change y by block in here when drawing your line and with good reason after all that's often how we do things but in this case i sneakily used another set y2 block a set block not change a pen line will always draw between the previous and new position and you don't need to use a change for that to happen check it out there splendid our walls are drawing as intended oh i'm a poet i didn't know it fix number two when all entities are showing up with the same costume yep all nanos franks and even collectibles appearing as nanos this was since episode four and this one was my bad sorry so unless you caught my fix posted in the community tab then you will be wondering what you did wrong i am so sorry so what did we miss click into the pen sprite if we look at the draw row script here you can see any type less than 10 represents an entity that is a costume to be stamped but if you look at the stamp script you'll see we omitted to switch the sprites costume before we stamp so we only get one type of entity costume showing up in the game no problem before we position the sprite switch costume 2 and we pop in the same type variable smashing the green flag and there you go so simple you can see the collectibles nanos and franks are now all present and correct fix number three is for the mysterious extra entity bug or the dummy entity some of you have noticed a mysterious entity showing up in your game and it doesn't move and it can be seen to switch costumes erratically yes there it is can you see them when we coded our entity sorting scripts we stuffed a blank item a dummy value into the list to initialize it this blank entity was needed to simplify the sorting code but the blank row is now showing up as a naughty random costume the fix is just to get scratch to ignore the blank dummy value in the pen sprite add an if to the top of the stamp entity script checking if the type is the blank value and if it is we use a stop this script to avoid painting it to the screen testing that now and the mysterious entity is nowhere to be found great stuff so on to fix number four this is for when entities cling to the edge of the screen this one is annoying to see too especially with the bigger entities like frank you can sometimes see their costume clinging to the edge of the screen even when they obviously should be fully off screen this is just scratch doing what scratch does as it tries to stop sprites going off the screen we can fix this again under the stamp entity script in the entity sprite what happens is we ask scratch to position the sprite at x but instead scratch places it so that the sprite is still just on screen well that means the x position doesn't get set to the value we asked it to that makes for a reasonably easy fix though surround the set brightness and stamp with an if check then use an abs block to flip any negative differences and then subtract the x position from the x variable that gives a difference in position and check whether the answer is less than one pixel away job done now the sprite will not be stamped when it goes off screen fix five help my walls have turned into sprites woohoo this is a good one i know a number of you have been getting this bug and it looks really funny and it's really easy to explain in our ray cast a sprite under the single ray script we have entered the wall colors as numbers in the draw blocks here and here now if you've used any number less than 10 then i'm afraid rather than being a nice red color as you probably intended we get entities appearing instead but because color hues are cyclic all we need to do is add a hundred and one to the desired color and hey presto we get our red color back no more random glorious repeating entity craziness so finally fix number six for those who want more than nine entity costumes this is more feature than a bug fix if we come into the pen sprite you can see we are only treating types less than 10 as entities but this limits us to nine different entity types or costumes to be stamped so what if we want more well no problem at all we can boost this number up to 100 giving us 99 entity types to play with the downside of this is that we must make sure to add 101 to all our color values that are less than 100 in the raycaster sprite when we're using the draw block cool well that's all the fixes at this time i'll watch the comments and try to pick up any other issues that come up a lot but for now get yourselves up to date because the official episode 7 is also in production and will be out shortly i'm so excited for it we're finally getting texture mapped walls into our vacasters amazing come on if you are as excited as me and want to catch it before
