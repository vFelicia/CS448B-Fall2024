foreign scratchers you may have seen my previous tutorial amazing health bars where we created each Health level using its own costume but so many of you wanted more asking how can we create a health bar with a beautiful fluid animation from Full to empty without those predefined steps and it just so happens I know a really cool trick to achieve just that before you ask no it's not using pen because then we wouldn't be able to layer our health bar over other Vector Sprites like this and we want this looking super crisp and highres at all times yes this looks sweet so how's it done and this is clever the health bar is simply made up of two Sprites the base costume is a fixed half full health bar layered on top of that we have another half bar and this one we slide left and right when combined with the lower bar this can gives us a flexible 50 to 100 health bar how cool is that but how do we explain the lower half well now once we reach the halfway mark we cunningly switch from a half full bar costume to half an empty bar costume and with this we continue sliding it down over the remaining base health bar literally blanking it out as we go brilliant so stay tuned as I guide you through the coding process but in essence you should have got the gist I really like this technique as it only requires three costumes to accurately reproduce any level of Health the base the empty and the full costumes plus because this health bar is costume based we can decorate and enhance it to fit any game genre like those you might see in today's video sponsor rage Shadow Legends

video first and then come back to watch the rest of the video later otherwise let's just Breeze through how I went about it right now guys let's get scratching start a new project now we're keeping the scratch cat Sprite today but let's make it draggable on the stage when green flag clicked and set drag mode to draggable and that's in the sensing category I'm not sure why and now we can drag the cat around in full screen mode nice next let's define how much health our cat has make two new variables for this Max health for all Sprites this is how much health our cat has when they are full I'm going to set this to 200. loads of Health the next variable we need is the actual Health variable so call that Health again for all Sprites and set Health to Max health so they begin fully charged lastly right click the health variable reporter and change it to a slider this will make testing nice and easy we just need to set the slider range to be from 0 to 200 that matches our Max Health great I'll name this Sprite player and we can move on to create the health bar itself create a new Sprite naming it health bar okay so drawing this health bar is actually probably the hardest part of this process because to make sure everything lines up and overlaps we have to be super accurate so take your time and don't worry if it takes a few tries to get it right to make lining things up easier I'm going to switch to bitmap mode then Zoom right in close and with the rectangle tool and a solid black fill count six squares to the left of center and one square up and being super careful that it is perfectly aligned draw the rectangle so that it continues another six squares to the right and one down of Center take the time now to double check your box edges are perfectly in line with the background grid if not you'll have to make adjustments cool this next bit is more fiddly now with a red fill I'm going to use the brush tool at size 2. to just Mark the edge of this costume this is a size guide if you need it but when you get used to using scratches paint editor you may not need to do that at all and so with the solid rectangle tool we draw the inside bar leaving that same one pixel border all the way around we need to stop exactly at the halfway point here wow I wish we had some scratch drawing tools to help us line this all up right with that done I'll just delete that little square beautiful let's name this costume base so this needs just a few scripts to position it correctly above the player Sprite I know you guys don't need me for this bit when flag clicked set costume to base set size to 300 for this video but set this to any size you want and then we want it to go to front of the other Sprites so go to front and then to ensure it moves with the player forever go to player of course we don't want this plonked right on top of the player like this so add in a change y by 70. that's better next up we need that funky sliding Health Sprite come back into the health bars costume editor and duplicate the bass costume then with the selection Marquee tool carefully select and delete the right hand half of the costume I just hit the delete key to delete it then do the same for the leftmost edge too right we'll come back to this but for now duplicate the costume again this costume needs moving a full costume width to the left and this is not a mean feat what I would recommend is again using the brush to paint a marker where the current costume ends and then use the Marquee tool select and drag the main costume over to the left making sure to hold the shift key down whilst dragging to keep the costume on a perfect horizontal level and drop it lined up with that dot nice remove the dot and we should be able to switch back and forth and confirm it's all lined up correctly okay the hard work is over phew let's name the costume full and clicking back into our second costume we can fill this pure black because this costume is our empty costume great so you may have guessed we are going to use a clone to make the sliding health bar rather than a separate Sprite drop in the create clone of myself just before we begin the forever Loop and then when I start as a clone we can duplicate the same forever Loop up here so both health bars are doing the same thing one in front of the other now a clone is always created one layer behind the Sprite that created it so it makes sense for the Clone to be the base health bar in which case we'll drop a switch costume to full just after creating our clone so that the first Loop is now handling the sliding top bar if we smash the green flag you'll see that we have managed to position the sliding Sprite way off to the left don't worry this was intentional to get it to full health we just need to slide it a full health bars width to the right in which case we need to know exactly how wide our health bar actually is checking in the costume editor it's 48 pixels but that is the width including the black outline on either side the inside rectangle is therefore 2 pixels smaller bringing that down to 46 pixels in width we'll make a new variable to store the width in naming it width for this Sprite only and we'll set width to the 46 pixels but don't forget we've set the size of our Sprite to 300 percent that's three times bigger we need to do the same to this width variable the Sprite size divided by 100 is three cool so multiply 46 by that to get the full width of the health bar on the stage that's 138. so change X to move the floating health bar to the right by The Wiz oh I changed the costume when I went into the editor uh click the green flag to reset everything and there we've got our full health bar at last nice work but full health is only the first step now we want this to slide back to the left as the actual Health variable is decreased towards zero to make that easier we'll introduce a new variable naming it percent for this Sprite only rather than having a health from 0 to 200 will represent it as a number from zero to one we can do this by setting percent to the result of dividing the player's current health by their Max health if we run that now you'll see that at full health percent is one and at no Health percent is zero great because all we then need to do is Alter this change X multiplying with by this percent if we run that now you can see how bringing the health bar towards the midpoint correlates to the midpoint of the actual health bar so cool but any further and disaster the bar overflows the bottom of the bar and looks really really weird but if all is well all we need to do is switch our costumes over at this point to the empty bar costume if else and we need to check we are below half Health that's when percent is less than 0.5 half Health drop a switch costume into both sides and if they are less than half Health then switch to the empty costume to start removing now from the health bar otherwise leave the costume on the full costume as that already worked great for the upper part of the health bar we can now drop that in just after we set the percent here okay then we are good to give this a try things are looking good as we drop the health down and even past the halfway mark yes that is now working amazingly do you see that the empty costume is surely doing its job and we could drag the cat and everything stays perfectly in sync I just love that you know one last touch is to cycle the color of the bar from green to Orange and to red as the health decreases you don't need to do this but just in case here is how I did it both the bass Sprite and the Clone need to be positioned these scripts and then both change color so let's make a new custom block naming it position bar and run without screen refresh and take our top three blocks from the main forever Loop go to player change y by 70 and set sent the rest can stay in the main Loop but move these three blocks under the new defined block a position bar block can then of course be placed back at the top of the main Loop okay so the second forever Loop is doing the same job as our Define here so replace those two with a position bar block we can sanity check it still works yeah great so now since both Sprites are using the same script we can set the color in here to affect both Sprites at once set color effect to and we multiply percent with 50 because this should take us all the way from Red through to Green yeah that looks excellent and what's more as we Slide the health variable down the color changes back towards red pretty sweet right so we are done pretty much but this clever approach does have a couple of snags firstly if I just shift this bar around a little somewhere around here ah look where did this line suddenly appear from nasty you may not see this on your project but it's caused by me zooming my web browser larger to make this video things just don't always quite line up as expected in scratch the only fix I can suggest is to add a tiny half pixel bit of red to the right of the base costume you'll see that straight away fixes the Gap problem but when we reduce the health we now see that extra bit of bar on the right so to fix that we come into the empty costume and expand the Black by half a pixel to the right also and that that pretty much does it but there is a second issue and that is the Sprite fencing as we move off screen the floating bar gets left behind ugly like an ugly thing we fixed that in one of the usual ways in the costume editor make a new costume and draw a large rectangle name the costume big then back in the code we simply swap to the big costume before we position the bar that will let us move further off screen and right away we are switching back to the desired costume anyway so all should be good give that a try if you don't believe me see bug squashed great isn't it amazing what you can do with a little clever scripting and careful costume drawing and don't think you have to finish there you can Spruce things up even further try adding another layer like this or vertical gradient fill whatever you want to try but for now that is about all we have time for today if you've enjoyed
