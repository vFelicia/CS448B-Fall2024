hi I'm Griff patch welcome to part 4 of my scrolling platform tutorial for scratch where we left off this tutorial we had a nice scrolling engine but what was missing was that we have this problem that in scratch as the costumes move off the side of the screen they don't go off so you can still see that left hand side the level from to the left and on the right hand side bits of level from the right so what we need to do is solve that so that these bits level move off the screen and are not visible so let's get straight into it and work on that so what we're gonna do is move into the platform as sprite and we have to change this little script a little bit so the way I like to do this on for a very simple way of doing it is is try and get around this problem of it moving past the edge and stopping now how can we detect that that's happened the best way that I've found is it's follows so what we can do is create a new custom block in the platform of sprite and call it position and add to that by opening up options an x and a y number and we're working without screen refresh like this and move you'll go to into position and move the position block into the tick and you can change this around so you can pass in the X minus scroll X and the y minus scroll Y into the opposition so we're kind of replacing this go to X Y with this position custom block now within here you now want to position it at the position that you've passed in so this is doing pretty much exactly as what it was doing already so the moment should just work just the same so the platform's flights are being positioned just as they were before but now what we can do is a bit of cleverness in here because what happens when you try moving off the screen you tell it to go to a certain position and it's not going to position you wanted it to go to that's why it's stuck to the edge so we can test to see whether it's actually gone to where you wanted it to with a little comparison in here so if we do an ifthenelse underneath the go to you want to have an and in this if and then and equals in both sides and put X on one side and Y on the other but then look into the motions block your notice that there's an expedition and a y position in here now this is the position actually the position of the sprite right now so if the position that we wanted a position at is the position that it's actually at in the X and in the Y then it's gone to where we wanted it to go to so we said go to this expedition it's done a go to expedition and then you check to see whether it actually is out that x position and the same with the y so if it is where it's meant to be then we show the sprite the platform and if it isn't where you wanted it and it else you hide it so it's only showing it if it's actually gone where you told it to go it hasn't gone why you told it to go it hides it so let's have a go at that now if you run this every walk across see whether these are disappearing and there you go they are so on the lefthand side here as soon as that goes off disappears it's exactly what we wanted so that is the easiest way I could find to make things go off the screen in scratch 2 which is what we're using here there is a bit of a little bit of a performance decrease when you do this when you when you call show every single time you you position it it could actually cause it to slow down a little bit when you're doing some sensing touching not a lot in this particular case but enough that it would would be a problem but that is actually gonna be fixed in scratch 3 and since scratch 3 has just around the corner I'm not going to bother to go any further further detail of how you can make that even better it works just fine in scratch Lee which is really good I'm looking forward to that so what's the next thing we're going to change in this platformer I think the next thing we need is layer death at the moment if I fall fear no I'm still there at the bottom and I'm alive so we need some way of getting the player to die and come start the level off afresh and for that I think we really need to make the level a little bit more serious because at the moment it's all white and happy let's change the game around a little bit let's change the background to black I'll fill in the background black and let's change our level a little bit to let's make this a white platform so we can still see it let's just run that so we can see it yeah there we go we don't need this level anymore let's go do that let's just create some slightly different levels so level part 2 I'll have a filled in let's go yellow I'll make up very simple thing to jump over there okay and that's up another level duplicate that let's have green and what we want is some lava because we love lava in these computer games just draw draw a rectangle I'm here like the previous level and now let's reshape it click to add a new point I will create a little Basin which will fill with lava like this and now if we make another rectangle and a red one for lava or fill this up with lava and I will send that to the back so it's behind the other object there we go a little lava pit so that's to be little levels it's just play that and see if it looks ok there we go and a lava at the moment of course we can just jump on that lava haha that won't be happening for long so first off let's do the let's code up some scripts to let you play a die so I'll need to play a sprite first thing we need is a new variable and we're going to call that exit all capital and it's going to be for all sprites okay stop that being visible and we need to initialize this exit and we'll do that in the game on sprite it's like game on script and we just move this down a bit so we got some space so set exit and we'll set it to empty string so go in there get rid of that zero and just have is empty like that so exits not anything at the moment now the idea this is that when exit gets set that means that some things happen that it's going to cause us to exit from the current game and that's where this repeat in the play game script comes in so the moment repeating until and it just keeps on going forever because nothing's in there but now we're going to change that we're going to need an operator I've greater than pop that into that repeat loop and use the new exit variable I'll just put it like that so when repeat until exit is greater than nothing and that means that end whenever we set the variable exit to anything at all this repeat loops gonna finish and the games gonna end at least it's no drop out of this bit and actually then it's gonna loop around and start the level again which is what some any idea it so when you die or whatever it is I'm going to drop out of the game and then reset the level right now we need the the death animation so let's add in a new custom block and we're going to call this game die and this is not gonna be run without refresh it's gonna be just like that we want it to be able to refresh the screen this little animation let's get that we need to put that somewhere clean the song and I just move it right over to the right hand side like this okay so what a little animation here it's first of all we're gonna set exit back to empty string like that so no matter what happened or when we die after we've died this exit string is going to be back to blank so the game can continue without exiting that little loop and now we're going to deal with the little death animations let's have a repeat block in here I will get the little character to flash when he dies so I repeat three five five times and we're gonna hide so getting to the hide block that and now we need a weight so that he hides and then he waits before he appears again and we'll just do a really short times a 0.1 second so a tenth of a second and then we'll show and then we'll hide again for another tenth of a second don't need that and that's my loop five times that's just run that if you click on this you can see it running so if I click on that block there we go flash is on and off five times that's a good speed yep I like that okay so now what do we need to do at the end of that so at the moment he ends on the show but we actually want him hidden at the end so let's hide again at the very end after the repeat block and we'll have another wait for half a second just while he's not visible before we then can do anything else so that's our death script so now we need to be able to trigger that death script it says a few places we want to trigger a death one is falling off the edge of the level other one is touching lava or some other type of thing so we'll do the falling off the level first so we're for that one we are going to add a next bit of script to tick the tick the tick custom block I just move that out the way see we've got some space so here's where we're changing player Y you know our current play game script we've got a loop and we've got tick and at the end of it we've got the set scroll Y perhaps call X for the scrolling and the positioning of our person before we broadcast let's move that little bit out of here put the tick back in the broadcast tick and move the scroll X down to the bottom of the tick custom block so in tick now we're doing everything as well as doing the tick of the player we're also setting the scroll and the positioning at the bottom so that's all within tick that makes this a bit cleaner and then at the bottom after we've done the position then we can do our check see if he's fallen off the bottom of the screen or not Zapata put her if condition under the position and I think we need to check is the position of the player why so if position where is the Y the Y position of the player it's less than certain value then we'll kill off the player and we'll choose minus 180 because that is at the moment at the bottom of this level here minus 180 is the very smallest value you can have her before he's halfway off the screen so if he's halfway off the screen then we want to set him to be dead so we set and I we change this to be exit I'm gonna set the exit to be the word die so that should as soon as it sets that to die this little loop here will stop working because exit will be greater than nothing and then we'll go down here and what we want to do down here is trigger the death animation so get your game die and pop it there right so can we try that no before we don't know before we try it there's one more thing we need to do something we haven't done yet is reset the level so we've got this loop here once you die you come back round it calls reset with a broadcast and then it calls set up with a broadcast the setup if you look at the platforming sprite here it's what clones the level that creates it so if we go and do that again after we've died it's gonna create another level on top of the previous level and that's not any good it's gonna keep building up more what we haven't got is the reset part so that's adding a new new receiver here when I received there it is so when I receive reset which is broadcast before setup this all I want to do is delete clone delete this clone like that so all of the bits of levels have been created so far we'll all be deleted at that point when reset is called apart from the original one that wasn't a clone so that was to exist about fine cuz then setup will then create the new clones right let's give it a go I think that's ready to go so broadcast so here's our new level looking good let's fall off the bottom and there we are flashes and resets flushes resets flushes recess great there we go we can die now excellent so the next thing to add in is detecting this stuff lava it stopped our project right all the lava we want to add a new custom block of game which we'll be testing whether we're dying so it's quite a new custom block called test die and I'll do it without run without screen refresh here we go test die and this is just gonna chest where they were touching red at the moment so I'll put a tiff in here and then touching color Oh nope wrong block touching color sorry and we will choose red okay for touching red and we can reuse the existing way of dying so set exit to die okay so if we're touching red we're going to die but where do we call this test form we probably want to call it now whenever we move the position of the player so here we are if we change the pair X change the X reposition and we should probably do it just in there so after we call position we'll also call test I we won't do it in these positions here because that's just getting us back to where we were if we've touched something we shouldn't like a platform we only want to do it as little as possible because touching color is a little bit expensive to call so let's just do it when we first move see if we can move a lot and then again we also want to call it in the change player Y script after that position so test died in there okay let's see if that works so let's go and find that lava there we go touches the lava and is no more all right that's it that's all I wanted to show for this tutorial and we'll add in perhaps some collectibles and things or maybe the new level feature next tutorial all right thank you for watching bye now
