foreign ERS I got super excited the other day watching a devlog by a Creator named game Endeavor they presented some awesome swordwielding mechanics and the most fantastic AI controlled enemy fights I've seen for a long time what's more they gave some great insight into how they had achieved it well in that case I wondered if it might be possible to have a stab at recreating something similar in scratch now that would be amazing so today's video will be the first of a number of devlogs following my attempts at bringing these ideas to scratch beginning with reimagining our beloved scratch cat as a swordwielding um a a sword wielding yes cat no direct affiliation to other sword clad felines right then my first job was to get some decent scratch cat costumes for that we can pop over to scratchcat's personal scratch profile their projects are full of interesting scratch costumes that we can borrow what we need now is a sword and here's what I made earlier you'll notice game Endeavor is using that floating hand technique to avoid having to animate his players arms very cunning maybe we can pull off the same trick with scratch cat oh gosh perhaps if I widen their shoulders ah nice and so that we can wave the sword around without waving the body too I've split the sword and hand into a separate Sprite to the main cat body the game Loop complete with basic movement scripts will live in the player Sprite we've coded that up a million times before now to avoid the cursed lagging Sprite bug caused by Sprites having their own forever Loops I use a simple broadcast to sword Sprite to bring our sword to the cat and then we are perfectly in sync excellent another bug to avoid is forgetting to edit the sword to face right rather than up all three rotating Sprites must begin facing this way as that's what scratch expects now it will point in the direction we ask it to zero for up a little offset and things are looking pretty sweet scratchies certainly enjoying their makeover so on to more exciting things these sword rotation referring to the source material as I do over and over again as the devil is in the detail you'll notice that their sword is always held back pointing away from the target this is in preparation for a swing attack not only that but we have a virtual arm to account for held at 90 degrees to the sword we can do the same by positioning the sword over the player pointing it towards the mouse pointer rotating left by 90 degrees and moving forward that is for the Player's invisible arm then we finally rotate left again to leave the sword facing in the desired Direction string these moves all together into one script and drop in a juicy apple and our scratch cat becomes a veritable Fruit Ninja awesome but look again at the tech demo slowed right down you can see that their attack animation is so much cooler than that the sword swooshes instantly in front of us leaving a white arcing motion Trail to represent the force and speed of the action so cool and we can do that too I just mocked up some Trails using a large Circle including a small second Arc to continue the motion then when the space key is pressed I trigger attack mode and show the motion Trail Sprite and what a difference that makes wow without even moving the sword but it was getting late in the day now and I wanted to quickly complete the sword motion so I mocked it up using a list of directions to Cycle the sword through and it's kind of funny how cool this looks even though there's something very wrong the player's arm is comically able to rotate 360 degrees in a complete circle coming back to the exact spot it began so the next day I studied the motion more closely and I realized I had to limit the arm rotation to a half circle what I had missed was that the sword hand could also rotate from negative 90 to 90 degrees relative to the arm giving that full 360 degrees of motion and bringing the sword from one side of the player's body to the other in a beautiful swiping motion yep that was the key at this point having the sword appear behind the player's feet was getting a little bit old and yet we need the saw to go behind the player's head so to fix this I brought in my Sprite layering tutorial code you must make sure to watch that video It's So useful and it's linked under this video and it made short work of the problem awesome that is much better okay time to make this motion more realistic we want the arm to swipe across overshoot and then come back to rest to achieve this I needed to give the arm rotational velocity and emulate a dampened spring physics system luckily a lot easier than it sounds look here's the code so swingder is the direction of our arm answering velocity is how fast it is rotating this starts at zero when it's not moving then we simply set Target dir Target direction to the direction we want the arm to swing to the Target Direction the 0.1 here determines how powerful our spring action is and the 0.65 is how much dampening is applied so that it doesn't keep oscillating back and forward forever that's beautifully simple and also allows us to easily swing the sword back up again by setting Target der back up to the top with a value like negative 180. it looks fantastic no matter what direction we are swinging in and to avoid having the player walk around with their sword in the down position I automatically set the target to bring the sword backer up if the player fails to perform a second sword attack within a short period of time that makes it just feel more natural not to mention also flipping the player's Sprite and their sword Target when the player faces left since their costume and hands are therefore also flipped now I haven't had the cat moving around the screen for a while and for good reason we are in dire need of a reasonably good walk cycle animation but man can I get those scratch legs to look right why is this so hard in the end I did my best to follow the same kind of Animation as game endeavor's video but I can't say I did them Justice anyhow here they are imported back into scratch and at least now we can feel like we're able to dance around the apple and do some serious Fruit Ninja slicing this is getting so fun and wow our sword wielding hero is almost complete a few finishing touches a ghosted shadow Sprite to keep the player grounded and a particle Sprite using clones to emit dust clouds as we skip around the floor and we are done isn't that fantastic I feel this character would slot in very well to many types of games like a zombie apocalypse or an RPG or some crazy epic Fruit Ninja Extravaganza however my goal is to begin experimenting with the Enemy AI showcased in game endeavor's awesome devlog so do join me next time as I try to harness the power of context steering to bring this apple to life I gotta say it's coming along really well guys I hope you enjoyed this little devlog if you want to see more

creative juices flowing then drop me a comment under the video and share what you are planning to do about it are you gonna try to build something similar in Scratch 2 I'd love to hear about it and that's it for me today so have a great weekend head and scratch on guys
