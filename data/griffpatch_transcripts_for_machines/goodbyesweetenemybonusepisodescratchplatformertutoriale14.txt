hello fellow scratchers I'm Griff patch you remember me yeah it's been too long but over the next few weeks I'll be releasing a number of videos continuing my very popular classic platformer series do you still have that project kicking around I hope so because we have some great updates to add so many scratchers put in their requests and top of the list was that you wished that once an enemy Was Defeated that they stayed defeated but the rest of the level well no problem this shouldn't be too complex load up your platformer projects and blow off the dust guys let's get scratching now you may wonder why it is that when we dispatch an enemy they just keep coming back whereas if we collect an apple or a key the Collectibles are able to stay gone and do not return well that's because our Collectibles are created as clones that exist throughout the game only being hidden when we change scene whereas our enemies are deleted between scenes and get recreated on entering a new scene for this reason we are going to need another means of keeping track of when a given enemy has been squished the best way would be using a scratch list make a new one now naming it squished and ensure it's created for all Sprites that's very important so that it works across clones now we need to ensure we reset this list when the gate Begins the best event to hook this off is the setup event so in the enemy Sprite when I receive setup delete all the squished list but now we need a way to identify each enemy clone from one another looking under the when I receive change scene in the enemy Sprite we do specify the type of enemy but we don't give each one a unique ID a name that will identify them from one another so right click and edit the spawn custom block we'll add in a new label ID with a new input also named ID that means we can now assign each enemy a unique ID to identify it but we do have to be careful because if you remember these top two enemies are actually the same enemy we just pick one depending on which direction we need to spawn it in from so we're going to name them both I don't know R1 or red one or Bob it doesn't really matter as long as it's their name and no others then just give each other one a completely unique name okay scroll down to the Define spawn script we need to make a record of the past in ID make a new variable named yeah ID yet again this time making it for this Sprite only it's their ID and no one else's and we set ID to the input variable ID cool so that should now mean each enemy knows who they are and that's great because if this squished list contains our ID well then we don't want them coming back to life anymore do we stop this script and drop it in before we have chance to create any new enemy clone awesome the only thing missing is actually recording which enemies have been squished well this shouldn't be hard I wonder if you already know how you might do this we find the Define touching player script these top scripts trigger when the player squishes this enemy so we simply need to add an item to the squished list and that item is this enemy's unique ID variable and it can go somewhere near the top like when we are playing the squish sound guys smash that green flag and let's see if this does the job jumping on my first enemy and you'll see that their unique ID R2 has been added to our list perfect I'll avoid the second one for now and then return to see if R2 has respawned and they haven't excellent news so let's squish R2 as well great and wow suddenly our world feels so much more empty than before ha well it's the price you pay if you want to have despawning enemies it's your call some games do and some don't anyhow we will be able to balance this out by adding other types of undefeatable enemies and perhaps enemy generators later on in a further bonus episode well surprisingly this is the end of this short episode I told you this wasn't going to be too complex you I just want to double confirm that when we lose all our lives and then restart the game that all the enemies do in fact return as planned but apart from that yeah well done this is looking epic but I think you're going to love the next episode even more it's super exciting because guys we'll be adding lying enemies how cool is that so that is it for today I hope you enjoyed this little bit of fun have a great week ahead and scratch on guys
