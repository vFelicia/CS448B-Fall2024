hello fellow scratchers back for more Geometry Dash fun well after adding the game over explosion effect in episode 4 we still left our players hanging around needing a green flag clip to restart our games therefore today we will be working on game continuity this will include automatically restarting the level after each failed attempt counter included but also we'll be creating a full title screen with these super authentic animated buttons which I think you'll find can be added incredibly easily into all your own scratch projects I know you're just going to love them so what are we waiting for open your projects from episode 4 and save them as a fresh new copy for this is episode 5. guys let's get scratching we'll Begin by triggering that level restart on game over that should be relatively straightforward so firstly in the player Sprite scroll down to our game over event receiver at this point the player has just died and explosion particles are still flying around so before we can meet at the level we must wait for 0.7 seconds that's just a short time for the explosion to settle and now we want to reset we must bring back the player since they were ghosted clear graphic effects that ensures they are visible again and then we broadcast a new message named reset level excellent so the level reset is going to be actioned in the level Sprite itself so click in there now the simplest way to reset our level would be to rerun these initial green flag scripts again so separate the script off at the top and attach them to a new when I receive hat block for the reset level message and then drop in a broadcast to reset Level under the now empty green flag script that should ensure that the game kicks off just as before shall we give it a try smash that green flag okay looks good except hold on are you seeing what I'm seeing the level Sprite is now doubled up and of course it is because when the level resets we now create two new clones without first deleting the existing ones so when the level resets we must first delete this clone but sadly we then can't reattach the other scripts below well actually we can but first we must surround the delete clone with an if block and then force it to always run by dropping a not block in that if there and now yes that looks much better no doubling up of the level costumes and we can sit back and enjoy trying to beat our levels without the distraction of having to click the green flag of course what we are now missing is a simple counter to keep track of just how many times we've had to restart so click into the player Sprite and create a new variable naming it attempt leaving it for all Sprites when green flag clicked we can set attempt to zero to initialize it and each time we receive the game on we change attempt by one wow I wish everything was that easy attempt one attempt two attempt three and clicking the green flag starts us off all over again that's beautiful so the nice thing about no longer relying on the green flag for restarts is that it frees up the green flag to be used to display the main Geometry Dash game menu and about time I hear you say guys let's create a new Sprite for this naming it menu and just for clarity I'll move it to the top of the Sprite panel as it is the first thing we'll be seeing in game now first off we need a geometry dash light logo we could just use scratch's internal text tool the pixel font is closest and if we then duplicate it a few more times adding bigger and bigger outline widths of various colors then stacking them on top of each other gives us quite a cool effect however if you prefer something a bit more wizzy then you can Google Geometry Dash text and that leads us to GD codons Geometry Dash font generator I've added a link under this video then we just enter the text here scratch dash for example choose your font and then under extra settings reduce the width to 960 pixels that's great for scratch but having changed the width now our text has been wrapped over two lines and if you don't want that to happen then I discovered we can replace the spaces with tilled characters and that works a treat the same blank symbol can be found under the symbols menu under more here then for extra padding I added a tilled before and after the text like so looking good so we can click the download button and save the finished text to our computers as a transparent PNG naming it logo then back in scratch we can then upload the save file as a new costume and doesn't that look excellent thank you GD colon we won't be needing that other costume any longer click that green flag and yeah we need to stop the actual game from starting so click into the level Sprite and delete the when flag clicked script we added just a few moments ago sorry about that but now as well as stopping the game from starting we've also lost the Geometry Dash floor which I was really quite keen on keeping visible for use on the title menu oh well for now we'll fake it go into the level costumes and select the entire floor and then click copy then back into the menu Sprite what we're going to do first is switch the logo into Vector mode this will allow us to more easily move things around so while holding shift drag the title higher up the canvas now hit that paste button and the floor should pop in down at the bottom like so it's looking great in the costume editor but it needs a tension on the stage let's code when green flag clicked go to the front obviously the menu is in front of everything else then make sure it's shown and that we switch to the correct logo costume lastly reposition it with a go to XY block at 0 0. there looking good hold on we don't want that attempt variable showing up on the game menu we can hide it using a hide variable attempts first thing at the top here cool so next up we need a good oldfashioned Geometry Dash begin button right smack in the middle of the screen now I'm pretty sure you can find a good graphic on scratch or the web for use here but right now I'm going to draw my own so make a new costume and name it play that will be important later on so don't forget to name it that this is what I'm trying to copy so using mostly rectangles here goes nothing [Laughter] tada it's practically identical what a masterpiece just make sure that it's snapped to the center of the canvas as I've shown you many times before that's important so that it can grow and Shrink right back into the code we have another costume to display so we're gonna need to use clones duplicate these two blocks the first pair is going to be for the Clone so switch to the play button costume and then drop in a create clone of myself before we switch to the logo costume now if you hit the green flag now then both components of the main menu will now be visible great I think we should just move that play button up a touch though don't you I'll try a y position of 15. yeah that's better so now for the fun bit if we look at the real Geometry Dash menu check out how these sweet buttons animate with the mouse over oh wow that is awesome it's not the standard grow and Shrink effect it's got some punch this is called a bounce transition and is practically coded just like we code a bouncing ball in scratch only with size instead of the Y position anyway we'll build this up a little at a time firstly we need to detect when the mouse is over the button when I start as clone go to the front and then we'll begin a forever Loop now there are two possibilities using IF else block either this button is touching the mouse pointer and if so then we can set size to 125 percent to make it grow bigger otherwise the button is not touching the mouse pointer so set the size back to 100 just like it began right then this is like the most basic representation of the animation it's crude it works but we can do a lot better I suggest we create a new custom block to help us with the next step name it bounce to size and we need a numeric input of Target size that's how big we want the button to grow to and then a text label Force followed by another numeric input also named Force now this is the direction of growth bigger or smaller and for starters we'll only replace the top set size with our new block that's the growing step the size we want to reach is again 125 and this time we apply a growing force of 2. to keep track of how fast this button is growing we're going to need a new variable name it speed ensuring it's created or this Sprite only got that now this pattern is one we use a lot for animating gravity so set speed to and firstly we multiply the current value of speed by 0.9 this is simulating air resistance it stops the object from accelerating out of control then to this we add the new Force remember this is two when the button is growing and pop that all into the set speed block cool finally we change the button's actual size change size by and drop in that speed variable like so oh I feel tingly run the project and hover over that button whoa whoa whoa that's crazy and we are growing out of control we need to put a limit on this if greater than so if the size of the Sprite becomes greater than the supplied Target size that's 125 then we simply set the size back to yeah Target size that will stop it in its tracks click the green flag and hover yes that's it I just have to point out though that as it is now it only works the first time after clicking the green flag as we are not resetting the speed variable but don't worry that will come because now I want to add in that awesome bounce effect when we hit the target size set the variable speed to a multiply block of negative 0.8 multiplied by speed that will send it bouncing back in the direction it came only with a little less power than before did you see that that is so cool it really looks like it's popping out and bumping into something haha yeah I could keep doing this all day oh but no we must continue and add the Reverse Falling animation when the button is released uh back up here then and duplicate the bounce block into the else branch the target size is going to be 100. and the force that will be negative two so that the button reduces in size but ah man obviously there's a little bit more to do here my button is shrinking teeny weeny small I can only just get my mouse over it and then pow up they pop well the problem is located in this if condition when growing that is when force is greater than zero we know we have exceeded the target size when size is greater than Target size but when shrinking the opposite is now true we have exceeded the target size when size is less than the small Target size or written another way when size is greater than Target size is false equals false well that is a simple comparison is it not compare the true false result of sizes greater than Target size with the true false result of force being greater than zero this is now true when the left and right sides are both true or both false I'm not sure I'm explaining that very well but do take some time to think about it here we go let's see if it worked and wow yes it did that looks so good almost exactly like the real thing I'm very pleased and yet if I had to be pedantic I might say that the bounce can go on a little too long we could just round that off to be sure if less than use the absolute value if the ABS of speed is less than four then we set speed back to zero to remove any micro bounces and we can test again and gosh at least with my screen recorder running I can't really tell if it's better or not but anyhow it's certainly not worse so we are almost there we just need to make this button clickable when this Sprite clicked now careful we could have clicked any Sprite let's make sure it was the play button not the logo if the costume name equals if the costume name equals play then great this is the right button for safety's sake we wait until the mouse button is released that's not Mouse down and then we broadcast reset level testing that and oops the game starts but we forgot to hide the menu well that's easy when I receive reset level the menu Sprite and its clones will all receive this so stop other scripts in this Sprite we don't want any other menu Sprites to keep on running their Scripts then hide all the menu Sprites and end by deleting all the button clones that should do the trick ing the play button and yes it does fabulous we're almost done for this episode only before we go why don't we add a nice bit of music to our start menu and yes if we search in scratch for Geometry Dash menu music then you'll find someone will have uploaded it yeah here we go this project by Circle illusion funky nice one but it's the music that we're after so find the track and it's this second track menu music so I'm going to backpack that thank you very much and returning to our menu Sprite in our project go into the sound tab and drag that track in from your backpack and all we need to do for this to play is from the code tab drop in a new when flag click tap lock and then in a forever Loop we want to play the sound until done selecting that menu theme cool let's take that for a spin yeah nice to hear that familiar tune yeah the button animation is still Flawless loving it so let's click and the menu music stops and the game begins now that is really cool and to get back to our menu we just click on the green flag and there we go beautiful with the music and I'm loving it oh hold on we lost our attempt counter oh we can fix that just pop into the player Sprite and in the game on script drop in the show variable block for our attempt counter simple and with that we have come to
