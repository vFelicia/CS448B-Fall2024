hi today I'm starting a new scratch tutorial on scrolling platformers I'm gonna be trying to create this little game here which I thought we a good way of going about a tutorial we've got a solid scrolling platformer we've got larva as we live lava we've got collectibles we've got the starting animation we've got jumping we've got a portal at the end here which we go into and it takes us on to the next level we've got a timer we've got yeah collision detection everything we need to start of a really good platformer so this is what we're going to be building today but of course this was the first part and it's going to be just the simple part of to creating the scrolling and and adding a little bit of movement in okay let's start a new project okay hello scrunchy so what do we need first of all sprites so it started with sprite I'm gonna write this point not sprite one it was a sprite one that confuses me straight away anyhow doesn't matter let's rename this one so click on the little arrow there and let's type in player this is gonna be us there we go player much better now we don't want to scratch cat for this example we want a nice simple little graphic I'm gonna quickly just drag one in from my backpack because I it's very simple zoom in for you just a little bit map square people on scratch love square so space that's fine we let's just do that tell you those there we go and I'm gonna call him they go as well there we go player great and now he's available so go back to the scripts has had in some spare balls in the data tab make variable now I'm going to create for all sprites and I'm going to use these in capitals so that we can remember they are for all sprites you have one four level which is the level we're on that's great I'm gonna make another one again in all caps called scroll X that's how far across the level we've scrolled another one called scroll why okay so there we go three variables like that and therefore every sprite now we can hide those for now now make another variable this time lowercase and we'll do it just for this sprite it's gonna be X so I'll just create that and another one y again for this sprite only that's great when we're using scrolling games often we have to hold a position you know another variable rather than just using the normal go to position of push and x position Y I'll show that later why that's the case okay that's a little player created now let's create the background platform so let's duplicate yeah by rightclicking on player create another sprite and we're gonna name it as like that okay go to costumes and we need to draw a quick level let's just create a new costume get rid of the player costume don't need that and we'll call it level space one space one so this is level one and the first part of level one okay there we go and we're gonna do it in the vector editor simplicity draw a line and we're just going to draw and make it slightly thicker line I'm gonna draw a cross and if you click like this and then hold down shift it constrains us to drawing straight lines see that before I let go so I'll go over here and I'll let go there we go so a nice straight line for us to walk around on top so I notice it's not actually visible on the screen which is not very useful is that any particular reason it's showing it must be offscreen let's go to motion and click on go to it is right off the bottom let's put that back on what should we do let's get the player moving so click on player and we'll add in when green flag clicked like so and what we're gonna do is broadcast and wait now I'm gonna do this like this just as a set up so that it's going to make it really easy for later on so I'm gonna broadcast my own little thing called green flag this is I have more control over all these scripts like when the green flag is clicked so I'll only ever have one actual green flag and I'll thought cast my own group like it's now on and and then I'm gonna broadcast it gained and this time another new message I'm gonna broadcast play game great so that's the first script so let's do a receiver for that first green flag okay so it's gonna go in here and then go to me blank and in here we're gonna hide this is like setting up the game so we're gonna hide the character and we're gonna go to front then we're gonna have another receiver for the player game okay so when we play the game let's just give it to this so what we're gonna do when we start playing a game is set level to one like that that's to a forever loop here okay and so we're gonna stop playing a game I'm gonna go into a loop and the first thing we need to do is broadcast again I like podcasters you can tell and the first thing we get a broadcast is going to be reset now Dadda this is it's resets the game every time you go round so if you die or if you win a level you're gonna reset the game for this level and after you reset the game you set it up so a new message setup you now need a custom block these are super useful and we will use them a lot but right now I'm gonna create one called game on all you need in that it's like okay okay put that there now move your game on block just there have to set up now this game on what we wanted to do is simply set the position that we want a guy to appear in so we'll have set X and set Y to 0 that sets in way wants just show and we put a show in there so he'll appear on the screen now that's not the same as set position X this is it available X&Y because we're scrolling games so I'm afraid we have to use our local variables for this R despite only variables now after the game on insert a repeat until loop this is going to be the tight loop of the game it's going to go round around in this little loop here so what we're gonna do inside this is another custom block make up block I'm gonna call this tick now this is after the tick tock of a clock because it's a regular tick tick tick tick it's actually going to be taking 30 times a second but for now that's fine I'll just keep that like that and no changes so click OK I'll put the tip in the repeat loop now I'm not putting anything in until yet because I just wanted to keep going forever for now what we can do in tick well what we're gonna do is check for key presses so we got to make a move left and right so add in an if condition and we'll check sensing and key press left left arrow key okay so if left arrow key is pressed what are we gonna do well we're gonna change X by and I'm going to choose minus 8 for a good number and another condition of if right arrow and we're going to change X by 8 so we're moving to the right motion go to X Y I'm just thinking where to put this whether it should be done here or over there let's put it down here for now so what we're gonna do in here I'm gonna need a inhale both sides I'm gonna position in that X scroll x and y scroll why okay and after that one more thing we're gonna add is a broadcasting wait the bottom of this little loop and what we're gonna say in there the new message and it's gonna be tick that okay so right now if we run this project we should find if we press left and right we can be laughing right excellent that's a start of a project so now what we need is the background to scroll so let's change to the platforms script and we'll add in here when I receive green flag not the when I when green flag clicked but my own broadcast so I need a bit more control this and what I want to do in there is for now I want to show my background which I've already got but I'll show you anyway just in case and then we need another event and this time it's tick no more you just broadcast that every time we go around the main loop and in here we need a position so go to X Y again and we're going to position the same as in the other script so I can put in my minuses and I'm gonna position it map X this is the x position of the platform now rather than the little guy like this is for this quite only see scroll x + y scroll Y like that now that is that so if I went that now seems exactly the same however if you go in the show with this scroll X here like that now rightclick it and say slider you'll see the scroll X is now a slider now if I drag that I see the program is still running look at that I can scroll the screen both the player and the background and I could still move this with the cats keys and I can still scroll the screen okay so what I can do now is link the scrolling the screen to the player so in your main player sprite get your set and just before you position the player so prefer you entry into tick and the go to change the set white just said scroll likes it's all subjects of all X and put the player as x position in there now you see that on the screen when it's running I first left and right now my play standstill the background moves so that is this start that soil I hope you enjoyed that and I shall make the next part very soon
