hi Grif patch here and I want to show you today how to create a simple scrolling game in scratch it's gonna be really basic because there's lots to do with scrolling games when things get complicated but I want to really try keep this as easy as possible so this is the little project I've put together here you can see I've got scratch cat I've got some things moving I can move around and if I move to the right the level Scrolls and all is good so let's start off with a completely blank project create new project so what I'll try and do is go through quite quickly creating the project and then maybe I'll explain more detail afterwards let's see how that goes so new project starts there scratch cats give it a name scrolling project okay and I'm gonna name my scratch cat as player so we know who he is this is dar player and I make him so he moves left and right only points in the direction left my early okay so backgrounds let's add a background from the library we can choose blue sky now what me is that can't scroll it's a background backgrounds don't scroll and you can't get away from that before age me the stage so let's create a new sprite and we're going to call this background okay and this is not gonna rotate at all good and we're gonna take a nice background at me out there and I'm gonna drag it into my sprite okay and now I'm going to change my actual stage background to white so we could see there's this white area behind and now we can move our background and like before so that's the basis let's get rid of this empty costume so it just got a nice costume of blue sky okay I got add some scripts in here first off let's go into the player supply because this is the way this is where everything happens this is where things kick off so I'll have a green flag inside there I am going to add a variable called scroll X you'll see that a lot in scrolling projects we could call it camera X but we like scroll and it's going to be for all spy so they all can see that and we're going to set that to zero at the very beginning so that's where we start scrolling from will keep that ever now now we want to have some broadcasts in my projects I very rarely have more than one green flag clicked I like to keep things in control of my own control so I don't like them running in all different sprites you never know quite how projects start up so let's keep it simple by having one and then broadcasting from there so we are in control so in a broadcast setup so everything that were wants to happen can be set up in that broadcast and it won't continue running until that's finished because I've got broadcasting wait and then we're gonna do some more sitting up not more setting up so I start getting some loops running so let's start a broadcast without this this is not a wait broadcast this is a normal broadcast and I'm gonna call this player okay and a receiver for that in this place right there it is that's ready and I'm gonna have another broadcast in here called loop this all come clear later and another one called background loop and finally one more I'm going to call other loops okay this is my foundation for starting loops of code off in the right order this is the order I want them to run in so the moment there's nothing receiving these broadcasts but that's fine we got to do that later so in the background let's have a receiver for the background loop well that's convenient that's what I want so the background loop no it's not what I want I'm like sorry and I wanted was a setup okay so at the very beginning we're gonna set up where our background is so for that for now I'm going to stick it as I go to zero zero okay sis click that yeah nicely positioned right to where it should be I also want to make sure that the cat is in front of the background let's click on the cat and we'll stick where's the go to front let's hit they go to actually no you ever do that do you yes you do okay go to front there he is good I was missing mr. cat right what next so let's get the cat so that he falls down on to the floor so where this had some stuff into the player scripts now let's have a forever loop within our player loop receiver and in we will have a motion and we'll change our Y position by minus eight that will just make him loop straight down towards the floor if I run that in fact so much so he falls to it which is fine let's put let's put two go to zero zero above there so we can press it again of an it okay there he goes falling down no gradual gravitation stuff in this project no nice smooth moving I'm just gonna make him fall down at the constant speed just for simplicity right so we won't stop him on the ground so let's but if after reason being moved down we will check to see whether he's touching the ground or not in this case I'm using color sensing so if he's touching brown then I will move him back up again simple as that so now he should just stop on the ground yeah beautiful okay and now we need a little bit of movement to move left and right otherwise we're not gonna be able to scroll very much are we that's but an if in here if sensing if the key is pressed and it's the right arrow then we want to change our position and again I'm gonna choose eight that's enough I press the right arrow let's run the project first my dome there we go he moves however he just moved off the screen and that's not quite what we got achieving at the end so what we need to do next so the secret of scrolling is you don't want the cat to look like he's moving along the level you want the level to look like it's moving behind the cat so what we need to do here is get when the cat moves to the right you want the like the camera to move to the right so the whole it looks like the whole thing is moving to the left so what we need to do is change that scroll X so if we go into the background we want this to be moving now when the cat moves so let's get our new event to receiver and this is the background loop like we had before which is great we have a forever loop okay now we've got a scroll X that's great so we're going to reposition this background set the x position of the background to be nice it might look a bit complicated it's not it's good it's easy it will get used to it 0 scroll X that means is the negative version of scroll X so scroll X changes by 10 our background will move to the left by 10 okay you can test that if I run the project I should now be able to put a set scroll to a value like 10 click that and it should maybe I see that move back to the left to verify if we get change change by 10 maybe time I click that it'll scroll the background to the left beautiful okay so in my scratch cat now I'm gonna add another receiver this receiver is the camera loop so we're broadcasting that there so after this player loop has run through and we've moved our cat I'm now going to move the background so that both the cat and the background will move to meet where the cats moved to to try and keep the cat in the middle of the screen so what we were to do is look for the cat having moved to the right so if we go into motion and we look for expedition there we go say if the exposition of the cat is greater than zero so he's moved to the right we're going to do its change the scroll X by eight and this is important we need to move the cat to the left by eight so it's in line with the scrolling so it's closed the camera moves the light cat therefore moves to the left so if we run that now and move to the right nothing happens ah see my mistake there I'm very sorry look at this so I've got a camera loop and there's no loop in there they stick a forever loop around that let's try it again okay moved to the right there we go so now when I moved to the right level moved to the left and I stay stationary this is quite cool in fact if you play around with this you'll see it's actually quite flexible so if I change the scroll to and and run that again if I move to the right level slowly Scrolls to meet me so you can do some quite cunning effects here but for now let's keep them in the middle let's move in the same amount eight and that keeps him nice and in line with the scrolling and now you see the next problem if you scroll the level across you end up with a big gap you need more level so let's add some more level in okay for this I am going to change my background so what I need is a new variable called level X and this has to be for this right only it's very important because each each screen of the level has to have its own position so let's add that in there get rid of the on the screen and start my setting level X to zero this is in a set up a stage not the running stage setup so what we do is use some clones here so we're going to set the level to zero we're going to load in ourselves create clone of myself then I'm gonna change X by 480 that's a full screen width right and now down here where we've got the receiver rather than being positioned zero we're going to put our level X into there and I run that and now you see this we have two screens we own that again first green second screen that was easy wasn't it and of course what you can do in here then is create some different parts of the level so I'll duplicate the costume and I'll add a little bit of something else slightly different to this one are adding a bit of it's in the first sprite let's add in a bit of platform here like this and in the second one I'll add in that I'll add in a fluffy cloud okay like that okay good now if you go in here so when you were cloning our background what I need to do is change the costumes so if I set the costume to begin with to be our first costume blue sky and then I just put a next costume after the clone so now we run that now I'm stuck in the middle let's change the opposition of our little count here so rather than being zero zero let's put him up a bit higher a hundred higher there we go so he's on this fall's down that's awfully loud excellent so what if I want even more screens well of course that's really easy now you can see in here all we need to do it's duplicate up from the clone like that and that will keep going through to the next costume each time so cloud and then we'll go back to this first one again okay you could loop that around and create lots and lots of those okay so maybe what that'd be worthwhile is putting in another movement so we can move left as well so let's just duplicate up the move right and change it so this is now a left and that moves him by minus eight on that thing so I can move left I can move right move left and it doesn't scroll back now this is a common feature in lots of games like Super Mario and things you you can keep progressing but you can't move Mac and that's a design decision you can choose whether your game wants to be like that or not it actually is very easy to do both both types of scrolling if we wanted it to scroll back and forward we can change this scrolling here to allow for different directions for example so I could put what's the best way of doing this let me have a quick think no let's not do that so what we can do if you want it to scroll exactly the same so let's stop the program let's change scroll X by position X and set exposition to zero now that if I run that well now keep it in line but I can get back as well yeah that's pretty well so depending what you want so this now if he can't moves to the right it changes the scroll though by how much is moved by or again to the left it changed it by how far he's moved to the left and then it puts me back in the middle so that's the alternative way of doing it but I'll take that out because I was trying to write her a game that scrolled with my cat to the right but not to the left okay now next thing to notice is how sprites don't move off the screen very nicely if I add a new sprite here now I'm going to call this Apple and I'm gonna add a costume from the library let's try and find an Apple I think it's there we go good old Apple there we go there we go okay now objects in games after scroll of course with the background so we need to with my cat gone why is he disappeared behind I need to bring him back to the front looks there he is Apple different there we go right so this Apple needs to move with the background just like the background moved with the scroll X so let's put in some scripts now I've already got the receivers ready so we've got in it I'm not in it so I setup I call it this time sometimes it's called the init to initialize but we're calling a setup this is where we need to position the Apple and again we gonna have to have a special Apple X for this sprite only okay set Apple x2 and the position I want them to be let's put him at let's put its life further off screen so we can scroll along to find him that's put it at 300 and to set his Y position to be zero it's fine right in the middle of the screen vertically and then we need to our event receiver for the other loops right good all other things other than the background and the player will go under other loop that's why I mean deciding anyhow so forever loop in there well when you do is position him for now so it's the same as the background so let me just copy that in into the Apple I'm instead of level X it needs to be a Plex I right click there to do that but this colics is the same say now if I run that there is the Apple in our level but look see how he stays on the side of the screen on the left or on the right and I haven't reached him yet that is the problem with scrolling games in scratch scratch does not allow objects sprites to go off the screen not completely they always stay on by between well it's 12 pixels off the screen I believe but because they have wide borders sometimes they can be this is the outline of the Apple they can actually stick out even more so I tend to add a border around each scrolling project of about 16 pixels to hide these things that are often meant to be off screen but aren't off screen so let's add in another sprite called border like so doesn't have to rotate and all we need to do to initialize it it is ad in the setup and position it at 0 0 and it has to be at the front go to front costume now we want to draw this nice and neat so if we zoom in and we want to in bitmap mode makes easier now scroll the screen to the bottom left now you see his little scrolling a bit more zoom in a bit more if I scroll to the bottom your notice that this checkerboard pattern is quite a useful thing if I click on block and black and filled so each one these blocks is four pixels so to be 16 pixels we need it to be four of them so we need to draw a block that is covering four of these okay like that so it's perfectly sized before hi so if we zoom out click on the select tool select that square a bit of it and then drag it out sideways that means we have a perfectly sized for pics or 16 pixel high now we can zoom in and do the same for the vertical so draw a cube that's 4 cross so zoom out select drag up like that zoom in to the top left draw if you can 4 pixels it actually looks like I could drag that out maybe if i zoom out now before I go yes this is easier I'll do that yes better zoom in scroll to the left let's go to the bottom draw your 4 like that zoom out I'm trying it up excellence there perfect if I would not now okay you can now see Apple is not visible it's behind that black like scroll across there he is and if I go across further to the left can't see him perfect there you go see and you can add movement scripts and things into Apple so I've got this other loops here running which is setting his position to the where he's scrolling to but you can actually add more loops in a like type of a say for example in here and this is the reason I'm using these loops in this way is I can put in a repeat say 20 and I can make him move change Y by 3 and then repeat 20 change Y by minus 3 for example and run that and if I come across there you go and now if you want him to move sideways you'll be careful because you do not want to use change X because the apples exposition is no longer defined by his scratches exposition you have to use your data variable Apple X so if I wanted him to move sideways let's do another loop that makes him move sideways so this time I'll make him do this very quickly here so maybe let's do it even more so for just loops of four I'm gonna change Apple X by eight and I'm the other one I'm gonna change it but I'm minus eight now run that that's going to find him yeah see I have to use the Apple X because as you scroll his position changes so it needs to be controlled by his Apple X which we set at the top there cool and that's pretty much it I hope that was useful I'm gonna expand on this and add lots more things to it do comment love the video and tell me what you think there's so much more to cover but that will do for now I think thanks for watching
