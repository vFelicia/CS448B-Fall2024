hello fellow scratchers have you ever wanted to stretch a Sprite in your scratch projects no I mean in game yeah I know I have what if I told you it's been possible all along holy mother of scratch cat I just can't believe it think of all the possibilities this opens up so how exactly is it done well grab the fisheye effect and perform a little costume magic and wow oh no no not that magic there we go and then off we go and there's no stopping us now I love it so stay tuned and I'll show you exactly how to recreate this fun little project in scratch and we'll have a good laugh as we do it guys let's get scratching we'll Begin by creating a brand new project in scratch and Scratchy will be pleased to know that they are the star of the show so let's size them up wo too big uh perhaps 300% good and straight to it from the looks category pull out a set effects block switching it to the much undervalued fishey effect set its value to 100 and click the block to run it oh scratchy what have I done to you I am so sorry and at 200 it's like they've got some tuner in their teeth and are checking it out in the bathroom mirror so sure this fisheye is good for a laugh but how does it give us that stretch and squish effect that we are after bear with me just for a moment more and you'll see first let's animate this effect set it back to zero and drag in a repeat block repeating for 50 frames then rather than setting the effect we'll use a change block instead change fisheye by a value of 10 click the code to run it and watch old scratchy inflate like a balloon now to bring things back to normal duplicate the repeat script and this time change the fishee by1 minus 10 this makes the animation play forwards and then backwards again therefore this would look great looped over and over again when green flag clicked we reset the fisheye effect to zero and then Loop forever doing our fisheye animations click the green flag to run the project I think scratchy is feeling a bit tired and watching this too long and you'll be yawning too so with the animation still playing click with me into the costume editor because now we get to have some serious fun you see although we can't modify the fishey effect much through code we can change it by modifying the Sprite costume watch this oh man surrounding the costume with a large box has caused the Sprite to stretch out far too big let's drop it back to a size of 100 that's better now see how the central Cat is being pulled out in all directions towards the edges of this bounding box then if I move the box so that the midpoint is directly over scratches nose yes yes haven't I seen this chap on the pages a cute animal calendar oh no no this is just too funny and interesting too this one almost looks 3D don't you think no shall we try a wider bounding box oh wow that too is quite unique no no whoa scratchy have you been working out man so quickly let me show you what what this fishey effect is really doing to our Sprites here it is applied to a nice grid and the middle expands hugely and all other content is pushed outwards towards the edges but look at this area down here do you see how it is being squashed vertically and the closer we go to the bottom the less warping we see are you thinking what I'm thinking so starting again drag out a rectangle from the very bottom left corner of the outer drawing canvas holding shift to ensure we get a perfect square not a rectangle and then draw it out to almost fill the entire width then using the selection tool grab our Square by The Edge and move it upwards until the bottom line touches the feet of our scratch cat and there do you see what is happening scratch cat is shrinking vertically down towards their feet with very minimal warping to be seen let's just set the outline color of the bounding box to transparent and wow we have it guys an awesome stretch effect all ready to drop into our own games amazing but rather than stop our tutorial here what I propose is we put this to use and create a bouncing scratch Cat Project does that sound good to you but whatever you decide to make remember there's a link to a scratch Studio under the video where you can share your finished projects the wackier the better so yeah bouncing cats we'll start by speeding up this animation reduce the number of frames down to just six and we'll change the fishe to be faster by a value of 40 and mirror those values in the repeat below 6 and 40 now we're rocking Yeah scratch cat's got some serious moves on but this isn't supposed to be looping so drag those inner repeats out into some free space this is the animation we want to see when the cat bounces down onto the floor and it's going to look dead cool drag the cat up ready to be dropped and we'll set the size to 100 oh whoops would you look at that scratch is not letting us set our size above 77% it's that same ageold problem our costume with the added bounding rectangle is actually really very large so scratch is preventing us sizing it up too big to get around that make a new costume keeping it blank is fine and we'll name it small now switch to that small costume and only then can we set size to 100 and that's okay for this small costume before cunningly switching back to our larger costume one that's our cat excellent pop that at the top of the scripts and click the green flag to see the size finally restored to that 100% nice finally we can drop in a goto XY to ensure scratchy is reset to the position when the project begins and I'll just round these figures to Zer and 100 for neatness great so now for the fun bit we'll add some simple gravity in the forever Loop change y by ne10 so that they get pulled downwards at a constant rate right off the bottom of the screen okay that's too far to bring them to a stop we need an if less than if the Y position is less than zero then we can set y position back to zero that will stop them ever getting below the middle of the screen once you've given that a run through scratchy will be sitting on an invisible floor all very nice but I would like to see that floor for real so click into the stage backdrop Sprite and enter the backdrop editor now pick your favorite color and then using the rectangle tool drag out a new rectangle to cover the bottom third of the canvas oh man that was so close to being the exact size we needed hauh you see we want it to be as close to their feet as possible so just drag the top handle of the rectangle up and down until you get it just right on the stage there we go perfect and they will fall back to the same spot every time now this simple form of gravity isn't enough to create a good bounce effect for that we need the cat to accelerate towards the ground and for that we need a variable but not this one delete okay make a new variable naming it speed Y and we'll make it for this Sprite only this will keep track of how fast this cat is falling set it to zero before our forever Loop begins and then to model the pull of gravity downwards we change speed y just before the change Y block by negative 1 a downward force and now we can replace this 10 with the value of our speed y variable cool stuff smash that green flag and the funny thing is we are so used to seeing gravity that it's hard to even notice that this is working any different but compare it to what we had before and you will really see the difference better still let's have them bounce back up again when they hit the floor after the set y to zero we also then set speed y to 15 that should send them shooting back upwards again after they've hit the floor and it certainly does isn't that great what a sprightly cat but yeah it is a little unnatural looking and and why is that because it makes scratch cat look like he's completely rigid you see soft bodies tend to compress squeeze and bend on impact with the floor haha well done we just have the new effect for that return of the bounce scripts these will do nicely drop them in before setting speed Y and we should be able to check this out immediately oh man what a transformation this is just such a cool effect in fact it's rather mesmerizing actually 1 hour later yeah so the amount of Bounce is matching the squish effect perfectly here but what if we change the Bounce by setting speed wide to say five you see now this would probably look better with a smaller squish to match the smaller bounce no problem pull out everything under the set y to zero and we're creating a new custom block for this animation naming it the squish what else and I'm going to add a numeric input named Force this is to record just how large a squish to animate and since we are animating within the custom block we leave the run without screen refresh unchecked great so push that over into some free space and we'll make use of that squish block right away after our set y to zero now the amount of Squish force is given by our speed y Y and the amount of force required to bounce the player right back up the way they came is therefore speed y multiplied by 2 2 * the force in the opposite direction so the length of our bounce will remain constant with a repeat for 14 frames and each frame we change the fishey effect as before but the amount we change will be dictated by the current speed of the player multiply speed y by and I find 4 to be a good value but you can play with that next up we change speed y again inside the repeat Loop and pop in a divide because we want to change the speed by our Force input but divide it equally between the 14 frames of our animation finally in short the fisheye effect is fully reset after the loop by setting fisheye back to zero excellent let's give that a test smash that green flag oh man I do love that it gives an even more pronounced Squish and jump now and once more I find myself no no no I don't because we have yet to test this with a reduced jump height so set the initial starting wide position to 50 and we'll see what effect this has yeah okay this is more like it the squish is reduced and you'll note we automatically bounce back up by the same height we dropped from each time and that's cool at 20 and it's spot on whatever we choose this is going to play along so set things back to 100 and we can finish off this project a scrolling background never gets old so hide that Speedway variable reporter and we'll make a new Sprite for the scrolling floor I'm going to name mine Flor yes it does what it says on the tin we need a new Sprite because poor old backdrops can't be scrolled but click back into the backdrop now because we can drag the backdrop costume into our new Sprite to save us having to draw it all over again and then making sure we are still in the backdrop Sprite delete the costume to avoid any confusion later on so with that done you'll find the floor is easy enough to move around on the stage but to keep it centered set it now back to an XY of0 0 now I'm going to add some texture to this floor costume because without it you cannot tell when it's scrolling or stationary and that would defeat the point of all our hard work okay all done now using the selection tool we need to drag a marquee around the whole costume and with all the shapes selected click the group button to group them all together next begin to drag the group left but hold down the shift key to snap it to a horizontal Movement we want to line it up just a few pixel short of the center of the canvas But Here Comes the tricky part hold down the ALT key and drag the first group to duplicate it but don't let go yet instead hold down the shift key again to snap it to the horizontal movements and we want to position it nicely just overlapping the first group with its left Edge just shy of the center once more okay let us script when green flag clicked go to x of 0 y of Z and then we Loop forever now we could change X by 4 click the script to test it and sure enough the floor Scrolls left but the scrolling speed needs to be controlled by our player so make a new variable camera speed X leaving it for all Sprites and we'll set this to4 also click that block to ensure the value gets set there we go and then change X by the camera speed X instead perfect except the scrolling background ends too quickly not a problem there's a reason our floor is made of two identical halves as that can create a perfect cycle if less than if the the X position is less than 240 that's half a screen width then change X by positive 480 that's a full screen width and that is looking mighty fine if you find the floor doesn't perfectly Loop then you will just need to tweak your costume to get the two groups position just right exactly 480 pixels apart from each other if you need to know so the only problem now is that when the cat touches the floor they skim over it instead of coming to a stop click back into the scratch cat Sprite and we'll fix that now we need to ensure this Sprite is in front of the level using a goto front layer this not only looks good but it's important so that the cat scripts will run first before the level spite scripts and we can reset the camera speed X to Z zero at the start of our program that results in the floor standing still like so no movement so next let's move the cat Sprite to the right by four pixels change X by four at the top of this forever Loop now the cat happily bounces off to the right but while on the floor in the squish animation they stay put that looks good all that is left then is to bring back the scrolling when green flag clicked forever and we set camera speed X to a multiply block we want the camera to gradually follow the player so we'll use the exposition of the player multiplied by 0.1 and it's negative because well I should have really flipped the direction in the floor Sprite sorry about that but never mind lastly we must scroll our players too so change X by and drop in the same camera speed X excellent run the project and that that is so cool I love how the scrolling slows down as the cap bounces and it all just hangs together so well you may notice that it feels like scratchy is always hanging around a bit more to the right of the screen than he maybe should and you'd be right and that's because of how our scrolling is always trying to keep up with them as they move away but we can fix it by summing the cat's Exposition with an offset say 100 and that brings the cat 100 pixels left of center like so a pretty good compromise but not the only option so feel free to play around with that number until you find one that suits your game best so there you have it that's all our coding today and you can try plugging in different values for example speed up the cat's jumps by increasing the change X here eight is very good and 18 wo this would look very fine with a frog Sprite don't you think you know I really hope you will take this project and do something amazing with it as always there is a scratch Studio linked under the video for you to submit your squishy projects and this time it can be anything that makes use of this effect not just a bouncing
