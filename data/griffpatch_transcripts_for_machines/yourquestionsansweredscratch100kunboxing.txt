hello fellow scratchers we did it we made it to 300,000 subscribers and to celebrate this epic Milestone I'm finally going to unbox this my YouTube play button award and as promised I'll be answering your top questions in this special celebratory Q&A video and man did you guys have a lot of questions such as what was the first game I ever made even before scratch existed and does pineapple belong on pizza now that is a good one but before I unravel those tantalizing Mysteries I recently posed you guys a question why do you think I left it so long to open this exciting Black Box well with a strong majority 59% of you thought it was due to my fear of sticky tape seriously you think I have a fear of well yes I do who told you I really do hate sticky things in name labels sticking to my clothes get them away from me but as weird as that may be there isn't actually much tape on this packaging so that was a red herring surprisingly it was option two yes all along I had been planning to attempt to unbox this using nothing more than a spatula or spatulas spatula why hey too many questions what do you think this is a Q&A talking of which at the top of the list with a stoning 77 likes is this three parter by clld 21 Studios asking will you ever make tutorials for other engines or just scratch you know I am quite sure that I will yes having taught scratch for a number of years on YouTube I'm very aware that the majority of my subscribers will naturally move on from scratch seeking out more advanced platforms and yes I would love to continue the journey with you so let me reflect this back to you outside of scratch what would you be most excited to see me create tutorials 4 python go dot Unity drop me a comment under the video and let me know but gosh these spatular hey did I mention I play the drums do you have any older games pres scratch that you haven't revealed to your channel oh man as I grew up I created a whole bunch of cool games that I'd love to have shared with you guys but sadly they are all lost to time not making the transition from game console to PC floppy discs to CD to DVDs to hard drives so sad but on a happier note many of my old games have directly inspired my scratch games scratch napped tanks snail MMO platform and even orbital velocity to name just a few even then there are still a few games from old that I have yet to remake in scratch so maybe one of these days and perhaps by then I'll have finally opened this silly box spatulas whose crazy idea was that which scratch project of yours is your most favorite to play slither.io hands down if I had to limit myself to only playing one of my games this would be it because somehow it just never gets old I just love it playing online with other fellow scratchers is like amazing fun and it has this special gameplay balance where new players are not left overpowered by the larger snakes and you could choose to play it safe or head directly into the action and risk it all and man those frequent feeding frenzies are a real blast however uh technically my favorite project that I am most proud of would be um apple one of my most polished games and yeah getting over it technically very hard to recreate in scratch and I put it aside a number of times after each each failed attempt but persistence paid off and I'm dead proud of the final result gosh I even got a retweet of my post by the original author Bennett himself how cool is that right stuff that a close relative of the common spatula scissors now we are in business so with 63 likes here's a question from podcasts 379 why did you decide to start making scratch tutorials and what keeps you motivated well I began helping out scratchers on my profile very soon after joining scratch I got a lot of satisfaction from that but my follow account just kept growing and it became hard to keep up with the requests so instead of focusing on onetoone help I decided to put my efforts into making tutorials that I could then share with everyone firstly through my Griff patch tutor account on Scratch and then after I got up enough courage I moved over to YouTube and that was a huge move for me because I'm actually a huge introvert and have real trouble at living as is very obvious if you listen to my first video so let's just get uh scratchy to do something interesting um I'm just going to set him up uh to point to the right like he currently is well we all have to start somewhere right happily I worked on things and I pressed into my strengths and although it takes me a considerable amount of time to make a video I think they come over pretty well as for what keeps me motivated well this is just what I love to do and as long as you guys keep participating leaving me likes comments and Subs then that will keep this channel alive so I really have all of you to thank for that even the scissors are struggling with this bit of tape hold on there we go that's got it now this is exciting let's see what I've got inside another question with 59 likes art the gamer asks will you ever make a full 3d engine including a y level so we can jump and climb objects now you have seen my 3D laser tag gain I'm sure I shared it back in 2014 in the early days of scratch 2 and although it's not texture mapped it does support height we have stairs platforms and doorways but to achieve this level of performance I had to store the level data in Grid lists we can see this layout by opening the builtin level editor the design takes cues from Doom with each grid Square being assigned a different floor and ceiling height so yes I would love to continue to teach this in a more advanced raycasting tutorial and I just need to find the right time to do it now this is looking promising under the foam is an official letter and wow it's so thick like card that's so cool yay thank you YouTube O what's this it looks like another question this time from watermelon Dev yb7 YB what tutorial series do you have planned next are there any old ones you would like to continue oh I have so many planned off the top of my head a cookie clicker style tutorial a flappy bird that would be excellent for beginners and I really really would love to reboot my scrolling platformer series that was my first series I ever made and it's showing its age Good Old Scratch too right oh and I should also mention I want to make some kind of cloud shooter game too as for continuing old series there aren't any I wouldn't consider revisiting the only reason they pet her out is that I have yet to find a way to keep enough people engaged with the later episodes of those long running series that's a problem because this channel is funded by ads on videos and that is driven by the number of views therefore I have to make the videos that bring in the views it's a conundrum ah let me lift this out oh wait how do I even ah got it ooh now this looks so cool so a fun question from Freshies how did you find scratch and how long did it take to master it so I first encountered scratch 11 years ago when my kids joined a school scratch Club being the Curious thought I installed scratch on my PC yep it wasn't web based back then and I registered a new account for me and the family to use under the name Griff patch a patch for us to code in only instead I got hooked and the name stuck as for how long it took me to master it ha well anybody who's coded before will get off to a very fast start with scratch but scratch does have a few quirks that can throw even a season programmer it wasn't until I got to look at the scratch source code that things finally clicked and yeah I leared a few things then that changed forever how I went about coding my scratch games which feeds perfectly into our next question By Gast dude 589 asking would you be able to do some sort of video that handles General case use of scripts showing how to minimize lag yes absolutely I will and it's been on my mind for quite some time in some ways it's not that complicated but it does need to be set out just right to explain it well you know in the best Griff patch way but I know it's going to be a really cool video so make sure you have subscribed to this channel check the Bell icon and keep an eye out for that and here it comes the last layer and doesn't this look splendid presented to Griff patch for passing 100,000 subscribers wow so shiny I'm just so honored by you guys thank you to everyone of my well 300,000 fellow scratchers that supported me thus far I wonder do you think we'll make it to a million and if so how long do you think it might take us ant NOS asks just curious have you ever discovered a random scratch project that looked better than yours man are you kidding all the time sure I've got some great projects but I get my enjoyment from making really fun projects in a cunning clever way and I'll often share them way way before they are finished I just love the journey you see so my projects are hardly ever polished or the best they could be no it takes a lot of dedication and time to finish and polish a full game and there are bucket loads of scratchers better at that than me by then I've often moved on to something new venomous snack asks are you going to continue the RPG series and if so will you add features such as shops NPCs mobs combat and even an optional hunger system I really love that RPG series too and I've got oodles left to share yes all those things you mentioned and more however whether I can do them all in the current YouTube format remains to be seen just because later episodes Don't attract new views an alternative might be to try crowd funding the series or perhaps release them through a dedicated membership site just floating ideas that could be awesome otherwise you'll just have to be patient and I'll work on it in between other things next up Cano weeny asks what got you into coding and what was your first game like if you want to know more about that then you should check out my scratch Story Remix linked under this video I lay it all out there from my Beginnings encoding at the age of eight on an acorn electron check it out and then why not tell me your scratch story just Moses 12 asks how long does it usually take you to make a scratch project gosh well it can be anything from a day to a few weeks but I always get too excited and generally release a first draft after a couple of days no matter what paper Minecraft was shared and then kept getting updates for a whole year syonic has two questions what keeps you motivated into not leaving coding and to keep teaching and what other things do you do in your free time other than scratch stop coding I can't even imagine that day coding is just such a joy for me as for teaching I almost love that as much I'll keep on doing that as long as there's fun topics to be covered outside of scratch I enjoy playing the guitar and piano not at the same time but I do love to sing along and then movies we love watching movies in our home all sorts too from old classics to action Adventures romcoms scifi dramas comedies animations manga and various series there's not much we don't enjoy it's super fun snail team Studios asks what is your favorite coding block SL feature in scratch now it has to be the custom block with its run without screen refresh feature that was introduced in Scratch 2 and that opened the doors to making some seriously good games and I'll give a special mention to the mod and abs blocks where would I be without them oh gosh I didn't think of cloud variables now that was a fantastic addition when it came in too on the flips side Alexander theion 1234 asked if there was one block you wanted to be added in scratch what would it be actually there's quite a few but perhaps a substring block having a really fast way of splitting up strings would be so useful but also have you seen the experimental text extension it's something I Champion many years back and I think it would be a game changer scratch team when do we get that I'm ready when you are Commander AKA asked what was your first project on scratch PacMan fochi wondered whether pineapple belongs on Pizza yes absolutely it does tfam gaming asked will you ever continue the ik spider legs devlog I really liked it I really hope so I love that one too only it turns out devlogs actually take more time than tutorials uh because they require such a lot of creative coding plus you need to make a video on top of that so yes it will return I'm sure but I just need to find inner peace first blob dude 19 asks Have You released any games apart from scratch like on Steam maybe now I have released a private beta on a Google app store it was a work in progress unity game and happens to be one of those games I may one day bring to scratch if you like puzzle games games then you will love it fite FR asked a great question how did you overcome disappointments the truth is we all have ups and we all have Downs life is like that some tasks just require perseverance so focus on what you're going to do next and keep at it also always try and enjoy the journey that way should things not turn out in the end you can still benefit from the experience you gained or even help out someone else who is going through the same problems you learn as serious lot from your mistakes I can tell you so don't get disheartened I am Sparta 7436 says have you ever been recognized in public funnily enough no I have not but then I guess that's to be expected running a mostly faceless YouTube channel the closest I tend to get is when friends and acquaintances approach me saying you're famous after they got into conversations with their kids or their students somehow the connection to Griff patch is made that's always a laugh but no never face to face not yet anyhow and finally Jamie burru asks are you going to do a video where you play our scratch games now that is an interesting one because I would love to do that only if you've seen me try to talk while playing a game it's bad I don't have the gift however that's not to say I won't give it a go so that brings us to the end of this video thank you everyone who submitted a question I hope you learned something new perhaps you'll consider having pineapple on your next Pizza either way if you enjoyed this episode
