hi guys this is Griff patch welcome back to another edition of our scrolling platformer or tutorial in scratch now that we have previously covered the core game engine I'm going to be recording smaller add in episodes covering the more requested features that we have yet to include today we are looking at player momentum that is how the player changes speed as you press the left and right arrows if you watch here you'll see the player instantly Springs left and right without any speeding up or slowing down so this is what we're going to try and address returning to the end of part eight of our series I'm is clean up this script okay so what we need to introduce is momentum so at the moment we have down here in the tick custom block we have a change player X by and at the moment we're changing it by minus eight for left and eight for right and there's no difference it's always minus a or plus eight so what we need to do introduce a new variable so make available and it's for this sprite only and we'll call it s X speed X okay now in the game on we want to set this s X to be zero at the very beginning same place that we set speed Y now in the key press section here we want to change s X by to the left and we're gonna change it pi/2 for right now take out the change player X buy or keep one so now when we're pressing the left and right arrow keys we're changing their speed not the actual position now this will allow us to get faster and faster the longer we hold on a key but we must stop them from getting too fast and also want to slow down again when they let go so set speed X to be speed x times by 0.8 so that will slowly eat away at the speed until they come back to zero again okay but we also need to actually change their position now we could just put change X in here but it's better if we wrap that up in an if like this have greater than an absolute value of that means not negative always a positive version of a number so if their speed is greater than zero point nine so that means they're moving a bit then we change that position by not just their speed but round of speed that keeps us from using fractional numbers and makes the code a bit cleaner and we want to detect costume collisions okay when theory that should be it so let's give it a go so to begin with speed X is zero if I press some keys you'll see the speed changes and then goes back to zero again and we speed up and we slow down when we let go and that actually feels really quite nice quite a difference already feels a lot more professional excellent so that's that for this little tiny tutorial I hope you enjoyed that and next time we are going to look at wall jumping I hope you'll join me subscribe to the channel like video and I'll see you next time
