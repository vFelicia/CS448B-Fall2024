hello fellow scratchers and boom what is Geometry Dash without an epic end of game explosion I'm Griff batch and in this fourth episode of our series we'll be recreating this effect just as you see it here and guys it looks awesome doesn't it sit tight and I'll show you exactly how it's made now these videos do take me a lot of time to put together so I'm trying something a little different in an effort to get new videos out weekly I'm going to try to keep my episodes short and on topic if you like this idea then please take a moment to drop me a like and I'll also watch out for your comments under the video so without further Ado we'll get right to it open your projects from episode 3 and as always we're going to save them as a fresh due copy for this is episode four guys let's get scratching and I can hardly believe this but the first thing to note about modern Geometry Dash is that when the player dies the level instantly grinds to a halt what and to think that we spent all that effort to bring it to a nice gradual stop oh well it was a fun lesson learned but let's take it out in the player Sprite now scroll down to the when I receive game over script then right before the repeat Loop simply set scroll speed to zero yes a complete stop and then pull out that change scroll speed from the loop so that it no longer applies now is that all we need to change let's take a look ah so dying to spikes ah that looked a little odd the player appears to jump to the right and I did expect that because scrolling up to the game on scripts we have this little change X block here or when we touch a spike now this needs to go so carefully remove it but keep those other two broadcast and stop blocks below here we go smash that green flag and now we have a much tidier instance stop I'm testing on a wall Collision here it comes yep that too is working fine Splendid then we can move on to creating the first part of the explosion effect the expanding Circle we'll Begin by creating a new Sprite naming it explode the color of this circle is going to be the same cyan blue we used in the particle Sprite and we get the color using the selection tool and simply selecting the particle shape there we go now moving back into our new Sprite The Fill color is retained so we'll draw a circle don't forget to hold down the shift key to keep it perfectly circular and we're aiming for a size of 100 by 100 pixels a little adjusting and there we go lastly snap the shape to the center of the canvas and we are good to get coding when green flag clicked we'll do some setup initially we'll hide the explosion gone the next time it shows is when we receive the game over message so bring that in and immediately show the Sprite again now obviously this should be positioned over the player go to player nice but a bit too large for starters so set size two twenty percent that's the setup now for the animation repeat and ten times and we're going to change size by to make it grow and leaving it at 10 for now then we'll click the game over script to test it okay nice I'm liking this but let's make it grow for longer up the repeat to 15 frames cool but as the circle expands we want it to fade away too we do that with a change ghost effect and for full Fade Out that's 100 over 15 frames that should be 100 divided by 15 roughly seven each time smash that game over script and that looked good let's see it again oh purple scratch cats did we break it no no we just forgot to reset the ghost effect to make it visible again the second time around drop in a simple clear graphic effects and yes we are back in business now this short is cool but I have one more enhancement to make the circle currently expands at a constant linear rate but it would look even better if instead its expansion slowed down over time this is called easing out so rather than changing size by 10 each frame we calculate the easing figure using a subtract block starting with a hundred and seventy percent that's the maximum size we are aiming to expand our Circle to from this we subtract the current size of the explosion Sprite that gives us the amount left we need to increase by that's nothing if we've already reached our Target size and now we divide dividing the amount left to increase by by nine now the larger this number is the longer it will take for the shape to reach its final size right exciting hit that game over script oh yeah that's what I'm talking about the new easing out gives it that professional touch right now just before we move on I think it best to drop in a hide block at the end I just feel better knowing that the Sprite is not hanging around on screen even if it is ghosted to nothing great time to see this fully in game smash that green flag perfect that's just as I hoped it's looking better and better except my OCD simply cannot take this anymore does anyone else notice that oh so tiny but highly annoying step down in the level as the player moves from Level costume number one to costume two ah man I hate it and it does seem strange because the ground is an exact duplicate between costumes one and two they should line up perfectly well not to worry if you want to fix it you can just drop in another rectangle at the top of our levels again out of sight and that alone is enough to fix my first screen crazy and you may need to add them to more than one just see how you go phew now I can move on the next stage of our explosion is to add in those particles the particle burst now this is what really brings the whole animation together particles begin at the center of the player and then spread outwards in a circle now we already added the particle Sprite and that was used to create the trail behind the player however we won't try to reuse it instead right click or long press on mobile and duplicate the particles Sprite this time we'll name it explode particles or perhaps particle burst if you prefer okay the costume can stay exactly the same click into the coding tab so unlike the particle Trail a particle burst must generate many clones all at once the trigger is once again from a game over event when I receive game over we want to create say 40 clones therefore repeat for 40. and create clone of myself the problem is this repeat Loop doesn't run instantly but will stagger the animation over 40 game frames to make it instant we need to make a new custom block boom and tick the run without screen refresh checkbox this will do the trick now all 40 clones will be created without waiting around excellent just drop the boom block under the game over receiver okay next up we want to code the particle's motion when I start as a clone now although the original particle scripts follow a similar pattern we'd be better to move them off and cherry pick the blocks we need the go to player that stays the same but we don't want to offset the position with the change X or Y blocks set size yeah we need that but up the picked sizes between 75 and 150 this time ah speed X and speed y so okay I'm going to switch to use a direction and speed this time around so drop in a point in Direction block and we'll pick a direction between negative 180 and 180. that's a full circle around the player and will help to form a circle of projectiles and now to set the speed so this should just read set speed not set speed X we can rename the variable speed X to Simply speed and then the speed y that can be deleted great bring that particle Sprite to the front go to front and reattach the remaining scripts the show repeat and delete blocks but we're going to pull out the movement scripts from the repeat these still assume a change X and Y approach to the movement instead our costume is already facing in the direction they want to move so all we need to do is move forwards by this particle's speed and then yeah we're going to fade them out using the change ghost block just a few more changes we'll up the repeat to 20 so that the particle burst lasts for a longer time and reduce the ghost effect down to four wow that was a lot of fiddling around I hope we will be suitably rewarded when we run these scripts to do so we're going to click on the when I receive game over hap lock just here and that is quite a cute little explosion but I can see a few issues firstly it's not half as big as I wanted and secondly the particle cubes are all rotated in the direction of travel we don't want this they should stay upright at all times and we can quickly fix that by clicking into the direction input and hitting the don't rotate option that's the third one across good that solves that one now for the power the speed we need to up the particle's initial speed let's try form three all the way up to 12. they should be quite fast click oh yes now that's more like it this particle burst is looking so much better for those small tweaks I've got to see this in game smash that green bunting oh marvelous it looks even better combined with the central circle too this is partly because of how the particles outpace the circle as the circle slows down with that easing we added now you might think we are done there and it's very close but I just have a couple of finishing touches to make firstly I'd like some particles to disappear faster than others so before the repeat Loop change ghost by a pick random between 0 and 30. that gives some particles a head start in fading away and then also we can make the particles shrink in size as they fade change size by negative three and now let's see this in action yeah it's coming along but the biggie is this in real Geometry Dash when particles overlap they change their color to become more white I love that and it's not so easy to replicate in scratch Faithfully but we can emulate it just a tat by setting the brightness effect before the repeat Loop to 100 that's as bright as we can make it so now our particles appear white instead of blue and then we quickly fade back to Blue using a change brightness effect by negative 20. drop that into our repeat Loop except there is a problem with that the brightness quickly goes too far the other way and makes our particles black oh great no problem though we'll handle the brightness in our own script when I start as clone again repeat but only this time for five frames and in there we change the brightness by negative 20. and run the project great that fixed it getting too dark but the white effect is so quick I can hardly see it how about we hold it at White for a few extra frames we can do that with a weight before the repeat for three frames that's calculated as three thirtieths of a second that's 0.1 seconds and that's it our particle explosion is complete and I'm really very happy with that all we need to do is Fade Out the player for the final effect so in the player Sprite scroll down to the game overscript and no surprises here change ghost effect by and we want this to be very quick so enter a value of 20. here goes nothing and wow all our hard work has paid off I don't think it could get a lot better looking than this what do you think did we miss anything let me know in the comments let's try a wall Collision oh boy that's really good and it sets us up nicely for the next episode where we're gonna ditch having to click that green flag to start the game so noob finally having the option to restart the level in game I'm looking forward to that and hey if you have a request for what we cover next then drop it in the comments under the video do remember to submit your projects to the official scratch Studio you'll find that linked under the video too and oh while you're still here please smash the like button and so is not to miss my next exciting video ensure you
