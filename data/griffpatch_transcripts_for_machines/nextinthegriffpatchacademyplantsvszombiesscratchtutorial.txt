hello fellow scratchers I'm super excited to introduce you to my next scratch coding tutorial based on the hugely popular Plant versus Zombies the series begins this week in the Griff patch Academy and the doors close in just a few days to learn more follow the link under this video guys welcome to Backyard battle if you've played Plants versus Zombies then this will be instantly recognizable I've tried to reproduce all the best mechanics first check out this drag and drop functionality you can easily snatch up a bot and place it anywhere on the grid notice how everything snaps perfectly into place thanks to our precise grid alignment once your Bots are in position they'll automatically detect and engage the Alien Invaders Sprite to Sprite Collision detection between clones ensures each encounter is accurately tracked and handled managing resources is key to building a strong defense we need to collect sun power which is used as a currency to build new robots solar Bots generate more sun power helping you gather resources quicker different Bots have unique abilities to help you fend off the aliens Gunner Bots fire projectiles and this again involves detecting twoway collisions bomb Bots have a satisfying timed fuse and can take out a whole load of aliens all at once Shield Bots have far more health and are great for blocking the path of oncoming aliens lastly we have Lane guard Bots that sit at the left edge of the lawn acting as a last line of defense literally very cool in the first level you only have to defend a single Lane of lawn and you only have a simple Gunner bot at your disposal but as you progress through the levels you'll add more bot types to Your Arsenal but equally you'll have to guard more Lanes as the game advances waves of enemies will become more challenging we'll create an alien scheduler to encode these waves increasing the difficulty over the course of the game to keep it exciting and engaging so there you have it this is just a sneak peek at what we'll be building together in this series from Sprite Collision detection to Resource Management from a variety of bots to encoded enemy waves we've got a lot of exciting content ahead so I cannot wait to see you in the next lesson where we'll begin this journey together creating backyard Battle Bots versus aliens
