hello fellow scratchers I'm Griff patch and welcome to the results of yet another crazy awesome griffpatch Academy game Jam this month's theme was backwards and although that was perhaps quite a tricky theme we again got over 100 submissions and yes we played them all from the backward Shooters to code cracking from hero villain reversal to interactive stories from detective sleuthing to controlling a zombie horde they were all simply amazing but there can only be one winner well okay uh eight winners or something like that shall we see them now okay our first winner is the legend of the time Cavern by prabs a superbly polished scrolling platformer sluzzle game where the player can control the reversal of time literally taking you and your surroundings back in time undoing any of your mistakes so you can take another stab at the things however it doesn't stop there quite soon you discover the blue items in the game do not get affected by the reversal of time and then things get interesting so use your time power to solve each level collect the energy pieces and enter the end portal this project wins the award for best time control project great job prolabs excellent coding especially getting all that time reversal to look so smooth and work flawlessly that must have been quite f a challenge this next one is a simple word puzzle game but it has excellent visuals and appeal it's epit or type backwards by Cod and all we need to do is read the next word and type it in a letter at a time backwards seems simple but only if you can reverse years of muscle memory that tries to get you to type words forwards just three little mistakes and it's game over this isn't excellently presented game with a lot of replay value since at each play you do get a little better I really want to get the high score great job koder best backwards word puzzle award to you now this is fun 7 parat 7 has created a fun platformer mechanic in their game Shadow realm that allows you the player to flip on to the opposite side of the platform that you are standing on entering the shadow realm see how the whole SC changes style are you getting the stranger thing Vibes too very cool only to make things even more backwards you'll find that your left and right controls are also flipped in this state it's actually a little more confusing and leads to a lot of accidental death in my opinion but maybe that was a step two backwards however I think this is an excellent game and you get the best reversible platformer award congratulations 7even par 7 and wow out of all the attempts to create a fully reversed shooter game entropy down by gamer me really went the full hog and even reversed the direction of the player projectiles making them appear at the edge of the screen and fly towards the player very clever and amazingly it all hangs together perfectly all this along with a believable backstory what can I say the most authentic backward shooter award goes to you game M well played oh what's this then Mango's Jango in this Splendid scrolling platformer had the idea to create a game where the player mustn't come face to face with the Enemy ghosts so instead you must always turn to face away backwards but gosh that's actually really hard to do I wish there was an option to walk backwards anyhow this is a game of skill so with a bit of practice I bet you'll be dashing through these levels mango Jango wasn't the only one to have this idea but they pulled it off with great style so best facing backwards award goes to you and Now for Something Completely Different backwards presented by Athena 24 and what a unique concept it's a kind of time defying detective game that begins with you witnessing a suspicious event all selfrecorded by The Talented Athena 24 four I assume and it's creepy but fully scratch appropriate I'm glad to report they're only sleeping now to begin with I had no clue what I was supposed to do you can control the playback of the video and look for Clues by clicking and yeah it turns out the ball is a clock that lets you change time nice I shall not reveal more but just for the sheer uniqueness and overwhelming quantity of imported costumes I award you the most unique backwards project award congratulations Athena 24 and what is this hello Griff patch it's too late for you I've already destroyed the town some dude has blown up all the buildings in town and all we've got is oh time Ray awesome wait a minute you fixed it in a very wholesome turn of events pillow static lets us turn back time in Calamity fixer and let us put the world to rights combined that with a bit of Fun Arcade action and the odd forgivable bug I'm sure you'll get to the bottom of those this really is a clever and unique idea and I can't help but award you the most wholesome game Award with a special mention for fixing those unfortunate flowers I wish I had one of those ray guns myself so many good uses well done pillow static and keep up the good work and that brings us to our last winner for this Jam we have flower defense by Strider 2013 a tower defense game with the rolls reversed and a very entertaining back story these cheeky flowers so it's our job to spawn flowers and attack the main base only watch out for those turrets the only way to overpower them is with sheer numbers and this game includes a clever clicker element to collect money that then buys us more plant seeds then we can strategically grow more plants and use our temporary turret disabler very handy at just the right moment to allow the great horde to really get their petals dirty Splendid and very entertaining the best reverse Tower Defense award goes to Strider 2013 so well done to you and thank you everybody who entered a project I wish I could mention you all just as we close though can I give a special mention to these few projects p abne 0000 for their great backward shooter shape shooter for a great shooter game with nicely done reverse level progression also wter 4 was back again with another awesome game Blobby the janitor I really loved this one and you are in the top list for sure I think the concept had such great Merit going back to clean up after the main game has finished I just wish it could have been pushed a little further into that backwards theme then there's recoil by not a school account another winner from last month's game Jam is showing their skills once more I really loved playing this and the backwards recoil is really smart perhaps the level is just a little too cramped but ha maybe that works for the better and then the last special mention goes to Bomberman 04 hwb with Backwoods clever name there a wonderful looking game based on our raycaster series I suspect I just love catching these chickens only once in hand it's very tricky to find your way back to the chicken coop with this chicken stuffed in your face man I really do love the idea though and it looks great and that really is all we've got time for I hope you enjoyed watching these awesome game entries and that they perhaps will give you some inspiration for projects you might try to create yourself in scratch but until next time do have a great week ahead and scratch on guys
