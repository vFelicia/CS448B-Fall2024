hello there fellow scratches have you been wondering how people have been getting sub 1 minute speedruns on my mo platformer game I'm Griff patch and I'm here to let you in on the best secrets to getting those crazy fast times if you want to give a shot yourself then there's a link to the game under the video but do you hang around because after the initial speedrun I'm going to slow it all down and talk you through how to squeeze the best times from each section of the level as it currently stands if you've been following me on scratch some time then you may recognize this project as being a combination of two of my earlier test projects the first released in 2016 was called playing with ideas as scrolling platform or bass the second cloud Firefly test shared back in April 2000 19 however this project smashed the 40 player record and has reached an astonishing 116 players at one time and the platforming scripts have been cleverly devised rather than battle the lag problems it actually works with a lack to stream players gameplay in time with each other to create a seamless massively multiplayer experience no obviously it's not perfect as you might see players hanging around in the air now and then but seriously it's amazing we've got this to work at all right and there we have it a sub war minute time of fifty six point six seconds very respectable and yet still no world record gosh so I'm going to play through the video again but we'll slow right down so I can talk you through how it's done which I'm the first jump to land on the first stamping barricade and we quickly hop onto the next one allowing us to perform a long jump to reach the yellow step to the right but hold on there how do you do that long jump thing well okay for that you'll need a little practice you need to hold down the right key to begin running and then quickly tap the down key and then the up key immediately after each other did you get that run crouch jump and it sends you cartwheeling through the air sideways now jump onto the rotating lift I stand around the middle to give room for a running jump onto the blue platform this will give us enough time to catch the rising lift and try and get on to the top run this is crucial to our time otherwise we'll be on sync with the later obstacles and we'll be slowed down now take a leap of faith and long jump off the lift and we should land beautifully just before the long blue appeal then immediately do another long jump while we are still too the flat ground as it's easy to pull it off here and then jump jump jump up the slope to keep your high speed at the top make another long jump to take us across the void and then just run down this slope we don't need a jump here as that full speed we should just drop onto each platform as we reach them and then we reach the gray columns this part takes a little swift coordination to pull off at speed as we want to keep running but as we jump over the gaps in the floor we need to immediately release the right key just for a split moment to reduce our speed enough not to hit our heads on the following gray columns really tricky to get right but power mount to then getting us to the third column masher at just the right time to run right underneath without having to wait and now all the beautiful move this was devised by the awesome dab man 20k the current world record holder on this level and oh it's so good jump up to the flag and then immediately long jump onto the third rung of the rising and falling lift jump before you reach the purple floor to save just a moment of time and then jump back again up towards the purple step and here you will grip the wall long enough to wall jump off to the right and again spring back to the left to reach the second step and launch yourself up onto the lift before it passes you by and takes you right to the very top man I can't get enough of that what a move and now run run run down the hill to reach the furthest most flag now when you reach the flag turn around and do a long jump just to save a bit of time on the turn now get jumping up the hill we run at full speed across the lift rung and do a standard jump off the end keeping our left key held down at all times this should land us perfectly at the foot of the grave masher hopefully if all our timing was done right just as it's gone up and we've managed to dash through phew that is all the hardest part done now jump the gaps remembering again to try and release the run key just for a moment to prevent us losing too much time from bashing our heads and jump onto the first blue platform jump jump and then long jump once to get our jump timing right for once we make it to the top of the incline and then at the void we long jump across run down the slope and long jump the gap we spring off the last blue platform onto the lift across two wall jump and skip another rung do you think we might better pull off another wall jump here to get to the rung above feels like I'm waiting for ages and now it's the home run we leap off the lift as quickly as possible and then just run trusting our feet we'll find things to land on and finally long jump off the last of the yellow steps across to the barricades make the final jump to land at full speed on the end of run flag and celebrate woohoo what a time to be alive we did it what a score what a time ha so can you beat my time I bet you can I'd love to see your videos if you are able to record them then do post the links the videos in the comments below if you enjoy the video do you hit the like button and I look forward to seeing you in the game practicing your moves also if you have any ideas how this game should develop going forward then drop a comment and we'll get the discussion going thanks for watching and I'll see you later guys bye
