hi and welcome to part 5 of my tutorial how to create a scrolling platformer in scratch today we are going to look at how to add in collectables into this level so before we do that what we need to is my few little tweaks to the platform's sprite because we're gonna make use of this sprite to do the collectables as well so let's have a look what we need to do is make this a little bit more generic that means is we usable really four other things so in the moment we've got this bit of code in here where we repeatedly creating clones for each part of the game so we're going to change that so that we can do it using a custom block instead which will make the code a lot neater so create a new custom block and call it clone at X and then add in using the options and number input call it X and then a text element and say Y codon and add in a favorable number input Y without screen refresh okay now in here we're going to do what we do down here so we can take we can create a clone let me just duplicate that create a clone of myself change X by then now put the X in from there and we want another change or not change underneath change Y by and drag in the Y from there and we've still got the next costume underneath so now we can reuse this rather than writing clone and change next costume we can use this in here so I'll move the clone at two down there another one afterwards and we'll plug in the values that we had in here so we've got 360 for the first Y of 0 and change X by 360 for the second and Y of 0 now replaces all of that there without a little bit there which is much neater slash button that make sure it works yep so the level is still positioned just as it was which is what we wanted that makes it really easy now to add another one underneath for another parts level without having to rewrite this part every time we can just create the next bit of level one up to the other in there while we're here let's also make it a few more changes at the moment when the green flag is clicked we show the platform but that's not what we want now we're going to make it so we hide it at the beginning to make it not flash onto the screen like that okay what we're going to do is we've got this level variable here we're not using this this is supposed to be so which level we're on we're going to be able to show a different level so what we can introduce is a new ifelse condition here we're going to pop it just here around the switch black costume and clone and we're going to check that level equals one for this first bit here level equals one so we only create four level one if level bearable equals one so that men freed us up to start doing new things with new levels what we also want to do is add another hide again at the top of here when as soon as we get it set up so that any existing it's a level that visible when we start setting up the level a hidden okay that looks good to me so I think that's what I wanted to do let me just check that works yeah if we died yeah all is good right then so now we can move on to looking at how to add collectibles on collectibles and work very much like platforms for all types of purposes so what we can do is duplicate this platforms right and we go into it click the little I rename it as collectibles so okay now we need a new costume however for this now you could go to my scratch project on my grief attitude to toe account or you can draw your own so we're going to just draw a quick one here in vector mode let's draw a field cool to begin with hold down shift while doing let's do min so we can see what we're doing cuz we can make it quite small hold down shift while you're drawing this let's see how it works make a perfect circle like so and the color of this we go in to click on this little color space thing we want it to be a dark yellow so we click on yellow and then bring down the brightness to say Midway now click on the little white to have the other color and this one wants to be transparent now you select that by clicking back onto the color pallet cooking on this line okay like that now click on the fill tool and the circle tool to fill into a circle this click roughly in the middle so we've got a dark yellow outside and a transparent middle nice now we really want this positioned in the middle of the sprite the moment you see the offset is in the slate offset there so click on the set costviewer Center and find the middle and then release the mouse that it's nicely centered okay now we want a middle circle again so change the circle tool we can change the color to yellow and we're going to draw another circle in the middle of this circle you know reposition it to be in the middle like this and then feel again and this time we're going to go from yellow click on that one to revert to white and you want the same thing so yellow on the outside won't wave out so click here to change around white on the outside yellow in the middle okay that's my collectible so let's call it dot in a costume name back to the scripts so how do we make this work for these new little collectibles it's a little bit more tricky but we it's pretty much the same as the positioning of the level so what we can do is change like this clone at first we need to change what we're going to do is position the little collectible dots all over the level but they need to be exact positions so we're not going to do a change X we're going to do a set X so change this to change X and change wise to be sets and we want set X to be X set Y to be Y and we don't need the next costume either I'll get rid of that so that's our new cone at for this collectible sprite not for the platform one three collectibles and then the positions so from now let's just get rid of the first one let's put in 50 and zero in there just to see if we can get one to appear where it says switch costume to change that to dot mat and anything else we need to do in there I'm not sure let's run it and see what happens all right let's see this is interesting so obviously that is far too big but also there's two of them now why is that well I can tell you that straight away because the way this code is working we're going into setup we're hiding one and then we're setting the position of it then we're calling clone and creating another one so we've got two so what actually happens is the one that we want is the clone but we don't want the original one before the clone we want to hide that in the during the game to fix that what we're going to do is we're going to move this X x and y above the clone so that when we create this clone we're going to be positioning it to where we want it to be and then create the clone so that clones is at that position and then we're going to add in a set X at the very bottom and I didn't nein nein nein nein nein to be far off the screen so we've created one clone and that is what we wanted and the one that's that the original supply that we positioned is then moved off screen off level or not let's see again so if you run it now there we go you know one sprite at fifty by zero and the other ones hidden so if we clone second one at 100 by 50 were not again there we go there we've got two so that's great we can now create collectibles anywhere on ever we want the biggest problem is actually knowing where to put them because it can be hard to position them nicely on this level just my guesswork so what we can do is make the job a little bit easier just before we do that let me just shrink down this costume because it's too big so I'll just slipped all of that and shrink it down reposition it back in the middle just try that again that's much better okay so what we're going to do is there a little bit of scripting just to be able to show we're on the level that we want to position things so move to the stage and we're going to add in a new global variable for all sprites so all uppercase so we can tell it's a global sprite and we're going to call this Mouse like that click okay okay malleable and now add in an event when key pressed and we'll have em for Mouse that and we're going to set Mouse when M is pressed to B now this is a little bit complicated but it's a join from the operators block that joins two words together and we're going to join together more joints so we need another join into the second half like that and in the middle join we're gonna put comma and a space then we need a plus in the left hand side of the join and we're going to put mouse x + scroll X and in the right hand side where the world is written we're going to right mouse why Plus scroll I like that so when the M button key is pressed in the keyboard in a set its Mouse variable to the current position of the mouse offset by the scroll with a comma and a space and then the mouse Y and the scroll way so have a look what that does I run the project so I put the mouse over that first collectible of this M see how the mouse is now fifty by zero that's exactly where we put this collectable isn't it fifty by zero if we look at the collectables there we are I look at where the second one is press M 151 151 one off but that's because I moved them out slightly offset but now if I put the mouse and press M this will tell me where I need to put the X and the y to make it a collectible there so if I was to move across over here I wanted a collectible over here I just put my mouse there press M it says 363 by 63 so let's duplicate one of these typing those numbers 363 by 63 and run it again and see there we go I collect all this know exactly where I told it to be and I can do that all over the place so I could have one just here over the top of the water so if I press M here hello my new one and type in seven to one by 71 but net there it is and I want one right above that one say as well so say there same again duplicate my clone seven I'll do the same X but the value of hundred and thirty in my why not again well you are so that's a really useful little feature to be able to find positions where you want to place your collectibles so the next thing you hide that Mouse is my own and showing the mouse there like that next thing you could do you might find useful if you're going to the stage and just set mouse is to add in a show variable just there show variable Mouse that way when you've hidden it you press end the next time up it pops even even if it wasn't visible because you hit it right that's great so anything left for this tutorial is to be able to collect these little circles which will be fun so let's stop this go into the collectables sprite and now this is going to be in the tick script this one here so we've got a tick here where we're positioning the collectible we may want to have a check to see whether we've touched the collectible in here so put in an if condition in there that and put in a if touching player like that then what we want to do is control delete this clone okay let's run that see if this works there we go now we are able to collect these clones these collectibles that was easy wasn't it so what if you want to have a little number on the screen showing you how many that you've collected right for that let's add in a new variable for all sprites so it's going to be uppercase call it collect it like that and click OK there for now and set collected in the setup set it to zero because we've not let any at the start of the level and then every time we have a touching player we want to change collected by one before we delete it now if you run that again every time we collect one collected goes up by one and if we die clicked it goes back to zero and they collect order the glam again hey well okay and that's it for this tutorial next tutorial we shall look at adding endoflevel so I hope you enjoyed that and come back next time bye
