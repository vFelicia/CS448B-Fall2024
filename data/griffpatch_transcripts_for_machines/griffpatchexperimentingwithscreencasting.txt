hi this is Griff patch I'm really excited that you're listening to this um not really sure what I'm doing at the moment but I just wanted to be able to maybe put together some YouTube videos I've often been asked and I don't really have much of a presence on YouTube so uh this is a start not that I'm set up for this I'm at present uh sitting in my kitchen with a with a microphone shoved into a boot to hold it somewhere near my face so it's not the most comfortable of situ ation to be in but I thought I'd give it a go um not really sure what I'm even going to show you but I thought it'd be a good a good way of experimenting and seeing uh whether it actually works uh this screen capture and that so I'm going to create a new project and uh and off we go um I expect in future people might want to ask me uh some questions and maybe I can show show off some things to uh try and answer those questions uh but for now in the lack of any anything more deep I'm just going to have a bit of a play around really um so let's just get uh scratchy to do something interesting um I'm just going to set him up uh to point to the right like he currently is just because I'm pretty sure we going to make him move around it's good to set him back to where he is now I'll stick him on the far left of the screen which is 240 but I'll move it 230 that's about right there we go and I'll make him a lot bigger to begin with set size to 200 should do the trick just see that yeah that's great now what I want to do first is have him move in to roughly the middle but I don't want to just have him move straight but uh let's just see um if I do a repeat Loop here I'll just do a forever Loop for now just so we can see them working let's just move him forward um like so let's just see okay so there we go he moves he doesn't stop in the middle and he moves at a pretty straight uh speed very constant when don't want that either so we want him to slow down as he moves so what I'm going to do is introduce a new variable called speed and I'm going to do it for this Sprite only now it's important because I don't want any other clones or Sprites to have access to this varable this is this cat speed only okay I'm going to click off the tick to stop it appearing on the screen I don't want it to be taking up any of the speed a uh the screen space so let's set his speed just here and I'll set it to 10 for now and now I will make him move by speed so that will do the same at the moment no difference he's moving by speed so I'm going to Al Al to the speed as he moves so I'm going to set his speed to what his current speed is multiplied by now slightly less than one so that every time it goes around this Loop speed will get smaller and smaller so if I run that now there we go simple as that he now moves forward and speed gets smaller and small in fact we put speed back on again you'll see speed slowly gets down to zero point very very small doesn't move at all so that's good excellent now what I was thinking of doing in this demo uh is doing maybe a bit of cloning so that I could click on that cat and little versions of him would spin off different directions so let's give that a go so let's let's have uh when this Sprite is clicked now what we're going to do in here is create three cats from the one cat so that means I'm to create two clones and leave the one that we already have so to do that we'll need a repeat block now remember that's two clones so we'll have repeat two and we will create a clone of ourselves that's great what else do I want to do um I want to turn and we'll turn uh after we clone and we'll turn by 120 since we're doing three cats so 320s is 360 which is a full circle fact if we just click him now we go three cats so that's great that's done what we wanted and that'll happen every time the last one still moves on great so now you can see why I put in the point Direction 90Â° at the beginning when we click the flag so otherwise we'd be pointing in this space strange Direction so we always start from the same beginning that's great so we've got three cats in three directions what I wanted them to do was to move off in the different directions just like the first cat moved so for this we currently have one forever loop on the one cat that starts out but not on these new clones so what we can do is we can create a custom block called move cat caps locks there that's better okay and we'll take this bit here setting the speed and the loop from the main green flag into my move cat and replace it there with move cat and that will now do the same as it always did so now that click flag is doing this move cat but what I want to do is have each of these clones also call the move cat so I can move this down to a new block hold on what I should have done is put a when there we go when I start as a clone so each of the Clones will also call in to move cat so let's just run that again if I click him there now the two clones that were created zoomed off the one that I already had didn't now why was that what did I need to do that I did not do ah yes I what I did so what I really should be doing for getting this set speed in here let's get rid of that let's set the speed one in here like that so the very first one moves but I'm just going to duplicate that get of that move cap I want to set the speed over here where where do I want it here so when here this the first cat is clicked I'm going to set the speed of the new cat sorry the cat that's clicked to start him going off again and also the ones that are cloned will move at the same speed as well that is right I have got that right good right so let's just try 10 for now that's fine let's do that there we go and I click him again and I click him again and again and again and again and again and they just keep splitting that's crazy but of course when things split they should get smaller shouldn't they obviously so let's make him go smaller when he splits so in looks set size here we go so I should do it again in here so I set the speed and I want to set the size now his size I want him to be half the size he originally was so I'm going to divide his size if we go into looks again we can have the size block so set size to the current size divided by two that's half the size try that again then so click there we go nice only problem is he doesn't half move fast when he's little you'd expect his speed to be like relative to his size really wouldn't you so let's make it so that his speed is relative to his size so when we're setting speed to 10 here let's change that what we shall do instead set his speed to be now we can choose set it to I'll just duplicate size there set his speed to the size divided by something and uh Let's do let's try 15 in there so click click click this is better apart from they moved a bit too far out tell you what I'll do rather than setting the speed and then setting the size I'll set the size so it gets smaller first because then his speed is relative to the size he's now become rather than the size he was try that again ah this is good look at that see what this is doing this is quite interesting if I keep clicking them is actually creating this quite interesting pattern and what this is interesting is because it's actually um it's actually very similar to a fractal pattern well it's a pattern that just keeps going on forever and ever so if you could zoom in you could keep doing this and you'd make a pattern that just you could zoom in and in and in because we keep splitting them and splitting them and splitting them of course scratch will weat it's clone limit before we could do that but it's quite an interesting thing and perhaps it's something we could actually play with um so rather than me having to click these how about we get them to automatically split when they slow down so when I click here and I start off he slows down how about we get him to to pop that point and turn into three cats and we'll see where that goes so that would mean having to get rid of this Sprite clicked and have that occur automatically um when the speed gets slow now the cap is getting slower in this move cap Sprite um sorry custom block so we'll have to put a if in there let's put it in underneath the move and we'll say if the speed is less than um let's say 0.1 so this is getting really slow so less than a pixel so that's quantity gets very slow then ah now we can't do this yet because what we need is this bit of script down here when it's clicked to be again in its own little custom block so we'll get rid of the Sprite clicked we'll create a new block called split okay so this code for splitting the cat into three is is now called split and we can pop the split into this speed over here so when it gets slow it'll call that let's just give that to go if I missed anything oh there we go pop and then they will go and then they will go and there we'll go again and I should think we will oh now it's g a bit crazy because we have run out of clones so now it's kind of dancing actually I quite like it it's quite funky let's see that in uh full screen because then you might be to see the little cats okay at this point that's there that's the bit where it goes wrong so now the Clones are not being created what's happening is it's the one single cat is continuing running and the other clones never get started because scratch is a 301 clone limit often the bane of many programers lives but it's uh there to stop the your computer from overheating from getting too slow right cool you know what might be quite fun is to add a pen Trail to that to be able to see where the cat moves as he splits let's try that should we um so let's start up so we'll clear the screen to begin with so was a good idea and quite often also got idea to stick a pen up at the beginning before we do everything just in case the pen is left down and that would mean that you'd have an extra line drawn from wher the uh scratch cat last was we don't want that so let's do that let's set a nice color maybe a green uh there's a nice green there's a nice green um and then we just have to have a pen down before we start drawing let's just give that go straight away there we go so now we can see each cat drawing its own little line I like that huh this um this fractal triangle it's I think it's called shapin triangle um but I don't think that one dances like this uh that's a bit uh bit more curious but I do like the idea I do love fractals um we could even um May this you could start drawing like it's kind of like like almost like trees don't they these fractals we could make the line a bit thicker on the main branch to begin with and thin out as it goes shouldn't be too difficult um so pen size so let's set the pen size where should I set it I'll put it in here because all the no I won't no I won't where should I put it I'll put an initial pen size in here uh what I'm going to do set it relative to the size of the Sprite so looks size divided by let's go with 50 and I'll do the same in here after I've resized it when I split let's give that a go not sure I did that really thick enough let's try a bit thicker let's try dividing it by 30 instead I think we should stop it from doing this dancing to be honest let's get it to be a proper triangle um so to do that we'd have to tell it not to split so if I put an if around here then if size is bigger than let's say it's bigger than 10 so if it size bigger than 10 then it goes ahead and shrinks and splits otherwise it's just going to stop moving because it's going to continue in this little mouse mouse scratch C moving bit when it's got really slow so if I just run that let's see if we have a stable ending condition and I think one more split it shouldn't stop hey there we go lots and lots of little cats that was quite fun I should think uh you could probably have a lot of fun with this just uh playing around with it maybe it needs a much darker background let's try black oh I like that quite as much as I thought I was going to maybe uh bit of a gradient there let's just see that's nice like he's drawing a nice Leaf but it's c isn't it there you are simple little cloning sample and we've ended up with Shin's Triangle Well I think that's probably enough for this sorry about my waffling let me know what you think and maybe I'll uh create some some bit more in depth tutorials and hopefully a little bit less waffly but apologies for my waffling
