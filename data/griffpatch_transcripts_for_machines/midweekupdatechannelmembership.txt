hello fellow scratchers i'm griff patch and this is a quick update video thanks so much to everyone who commented and voted on what they wanted to look at next in our tile scrolling series there has been massive interest in the auto arranging tiles i knew that would be popular that's because it's hard so here's a sneak peek of what i've been up to i have to say it's looking really cool now you may have seen me mention that i will be enabling channel membership on the griff batch channel shortly channel membership is all about giving you the chance to support this channel these videos and tutorials take a lot of time and effort to plan and put together now don't worry the videos are staying free to watch but channel members will get different perks that are added extras like membership badges channel emoji and depending on the level early access videos and more i'm really excited at this opportunity to make even more awesome and educational content for both beginners and veteran scratchers alike and man do i have a long list of requests already building up so if you have the opportunity then join me now and let's make this happen thanks for watching and scratch on guys
