hello fellow scratchers i'm griff batch and today we're going to get excited about the project that i'm working on right now um it's been three months in the making and still going strong but um you might have seen on my profile did someone say apple um some of you know who apple is some don't apple was invented by a guy called legobauer9 apple is a bit of a legend in many circles and you may have noticed that he featured in my getting over it game at the very top of the level and some people thought that was a sign that maybe i was going to use him in another game and well they were right so let's have a look where we're at so switching to my project in the making you'll see we have this guy apple okay let's jump straight in so this is apple and he's on a tile based system here so i can rush along it's very very very straight level so the aim of this is to make it all really nice and smooth and a lot of fun to play the platforming scripts are very similar to the ones i've released on youtube um except for these are working on a tilebased system now i haven't done a tutorial on that yet but i surely will at some point but it's like the minecraft strategy so we have a grid of tiles and the benefit of this is that you can have the editor kind of ingame so i can actually go ahead and start building levels on the fly in the game and then have a play on it and see what it's like and it also means of course then other scratchers can join in the fun too of designing levels so this is apple he can jump and do little jumps he also has the ability to use his hat as a wall slide so his hat is a bit sticky um which is quite interesting because it also means if i was to overhang like this and jump up i can stick to the ceiling but just be careful because i can't actually walk on the ceiling so his hat is sticky but only temporarily he can slide a little bit but he can't walk okay so his jump height is not enough to get me up here i can also crouch which is really cute but we have this problem that tile sizes are really quite tall so what is the point of being on a crouch if tiles are this big well because our tiles are not all full squares i toggle to a second tile look at this i have half height tiles and i can rotate it and i can pop it in there like this and now crouching suddenly becomes useful so that's great what else have we got so let's have a look different types of tiles crunched tiles and this one i love this one let's put two of them here okay now for this to work i need to restart the game aha look at that it's like the level is watching you i really like that and this is a high feature of the game is that the level itself is kind of against you okay so let's just delete this what other things can you have in the game so we've got like obstacles to jump over what about some pits to jump over so we could have a spike pit let me just delete these blocks here switch to spikes again i can rotate these different angles pop them in like that okay now those eyeballs are still there because they are spawned separately let me run the game again and it'll disappear there we go and here's our spikes which i can jump over and i've gone for the geometry dash style ending like that there'll be lots of particle effects and a nice big bang and shake screen i like that right what else have we got let's have a look through the sprites shall we say we've got blocks eyeballs half size blocks little blocks corner blocks crack blocks uh let's look at this one so this is a special block because it goes with an enemy let's put it in here like this let's look for our enemies right so we have this the first type of enemy i'll just show you those two before we do any more um yeah okay i'll show you these here they are and these guys walk around turn around and they run towards me and i see them i can jump on their heads and now the next type of enemy i'll show you is this guy this is a masher so i'll just put a block above it and you'll see how it works first let me start okay so this thing crunches down there's a few particle effects which is nice and cool i'll try and squash you and it stops on that block above but you can see how it's working because you can see it going through so it's important when this is designed that you cover it up with these like that generally it would be like part of the ceiling so it looked like this and it's also a platform so it takes you up that wouldn't be a very good thing to do if you wouldn't want to die that is of course i could take out one side and then the theory i can stick to it oh yeah i want to do that to you so to go along with these other baddies i've got lifts and platforms so this is a lift it'll go up and down let's try adding one in here and i shall stop it from moving now we've got a special block where is it gonna find it oh that was it that cross now this is invisible to the player but it helps to stop things from moving so if i put it there level with the top of the building there and then run this game now this little lift will go up to the top of the building and then come down again like that now i can also stick to it of course i'm not walking so i can still stick when it's going up and down oh i'd like me um and so we have those sort of blocks we also have trampolines so we have a look at all those in action i'll just pop it down there there we go um yeah so as you can see there's an awful lot of stuff all coming together in this game let me uh what should we do what else have we got should we have a look at some other enemies the blade saw so if i point this at the ground uh let's do it over here i'll do it on this wall here so if i point it towards the wall like that and then i have to put in some of those special these ones here to stop it from going past the edges like that run that there you go so now we have a blade saw that went up and down the edge so this level edge is all designed so that you can quickly create enemies and trains it all hangs together nice and stably so that you can enjoy the game um it's anything we haven't covered i wonder there's a few other things oh let me show you one of the big one of the big bosses so well this one actually isn't a boss this is just ah there he is i just like him because he's so big so this is more just of a part of the part of what the characters that you'll meet he rolls towards you he mustn't be squashed but because he's so nice and big you can walk on him and use him as a platform so he's both an obstacle and a can be a help you might need to use him to get to places okay and just to finish off here is the level i've been constructing as i test my game to test that all the different mechanics are working together it's nice just to make sure that things are working as intended um and so this was testing all the different aspects of the game that i had i'll just do a quick runthrough checks that i can bounce on the heads i can make gaps i can fit down holes all the different enemy types working wall jumping check squishing checkpoints so this game is all coming together quite nicely um as you expect there's still a little bit of work to be done but i'm really excited to be sharing this with you as soon as i can if you've enjoyed this little update then please like the video and subscribe let me know in the comments what you think of the game so far and whether you can see anything that i could improve or anything you like let me know it'd be really good i hope to catch you again soon on scratch and scratch on you
