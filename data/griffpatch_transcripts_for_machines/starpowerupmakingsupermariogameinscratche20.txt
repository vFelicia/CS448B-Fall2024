hello fellow scratchers i'm griff patch and can you believe it this is my 100th official youtube video wow it's amazing what's more it's been almost four months since i last posted an update on our tile scrolling akka mario tutorial that just won't do so for the many of you who are desperately thirsting for another episode prepare to be quenched can i just take a moment to plug my channel's inner circle membership because with that level you actually get full access to the finished projects it is also an awesome way to catch up before starting the next episode what we are going to be adding today are mario's star power powerups yeah this is a really fun one because for a limited time mario transforms into a colorful killing machine no goomba koopa or piranha can stand in our path and as well as this most excellent edition we'll also be adding a whole raft of other niggling bugs wait what no we'll also be addressing a whole raft of other niggling bugs and missing features that we never really got around to sorting until now but before we begin if you remix the starter asset project before this episode came out then you'll need to find the asset project now it's linked under this video and in the sound sprite take a look at the sounds tab if you scroll down to the bottom you'll find two new sounds star power oh yeah we need that so make sure your backpack is open and drag that sound in and the other new sound is the course clear jingle and we need that too drag it into your backpack okay guys here we go open up your tile scrolling project from episode 19 and we'll begin as we always do by saving this as a new copy for this is episode 20. wow are you ready okay then let's get scratching so first let's add a missing feature it's been often pointed out to me that these mushroom powerups should not be standing still no after they sprout they have a life of their own and should shoot off across the level well we have enemy movement scripts already in place so this shouldn't be hard click into the enemy sprite and find the define tick goomba script so these scripts here from the change speed y to the move sprite x are all handling enemy movements this is all very generic movement across all walking enemy types so let's wrap it up in a custom block to make it easy to use again make a new block named general move with an input accelerate x i'm going to abbreviate that to ack x for short a label maxx followed by another input max now run without screen refresh and we are done so the movement scripts can be stuffed on the end of this new define block and we'll make use of the new block from where we took these scripts a moment ago okay so let's match up the block input values the acceleration is given by the change speed x by 0.1 there so plug that value 0.1 into the general move block here next drag the input x accelerate x over the 0.1 in the define script great now this less than one is the maximum speed of the enemy plug that value into the max x of the move block and again pop the max input variable over the less than one okay that's almost done but we need to account for the other half of the script where the same numbers are negative just get two subtract blocks ready and drop the akkx input and the max input under the right hand sides of each and then carefully to plug in the right ones the negative x in the change block and the negative max in the speed x greater than check yay if we didn't make any mistakes then that should now work just the same as before no problems there excellent so now we can try to make use of this movement code in our mushroom life powerup code too find the define tick life script this is responsible for all the collectible powerups the top part is to do with animating the sprouting of the powerup so scroll down until you find the if touching mario here it is so just before we do this check put in our new general move block the touching check can go right back in below it this little mushroom wants to move really quickly so set an acceleration of 3 and a max x of one i want them just to zoom off right away here we go hit the block and it sprouts and off it goes brilliant yes that's how it should work okay oh but there's a problem yes only the mushrooms are supposed to be pushing off not these other powerups right no problem we just need to surround the general move block with an if check and we'll check the costume root variable and make sure it's only equal to life that should do it don't you think firepower stays put great and the mushroom off it goes fantastic okay though hold on now we have movement i can see another mistake did you know that the mushroom power up should always rush off in the opposite direction to mario mine is rushing off in the same direction that mario is pointing find the define move enemy script and scroll down down until you see the if bump index is equal to spawn index this is where we bump a mystery block and here is where we set our enemy's direction we just want to flip this round so set it to zero subtract the direction of mario instead so if we face left before we bump this block off goes the mushroom to the right so cool and now for something more exciting let's add the new star power power up click into the tile sprite and look at the costumes you'll find the star costume is at costume of 46. there it is now we don't need to change the tile keymap list as we already added a 9 in there earlier for item 46 but we do need to copy the costume into the enemy sprite like so click into the enemy sprite right to spawn the star power up find the define spawn type block now a tile type of 30 was our life power up we'll duplicate that if check just below only switch it to look for costume 46 that's our star costume and then this costume name life switch that for star great plug it all back together and run the project we are going to need to enter the level editor and cycle through the enemy types with the nine key here's the star i'll drop it in the free gap between these other two powerups and gosh while i'm at it i'll remove these other tiles as they are always getting in my way goodbye cooper testing a game and there it is yeah that's exciting to see now we just need to think what should happen when we collect it we'll need to find the tick life script again scroll down and here is where we handle the collection of each powerup if touching mario check the type of the powerup and we do something the first if is for the fire mario so in the lside we'll add another if else check and compare the root costume with star okay then so this broadcast wants to be in the else as this is for when it's a mushroom type powerup but if it is a star then we will still broadcast a new message and name it collect star powerup nice okay so how about we trigger something off this perhaps the star power music for this we need to click into the sound sprite and the main game music loop is going off in here but we will want to stop that and start up a new loop when the power is collected but first click into the sounds tab open your backpack and drag in the two backpack sounds did you think i'd forgotten right back into the code tab when i receive collect star power start by stopping the other scripts in this sprite this will cut the music short nice now before we begin the new music track let's do something to let the game know star power is enabled make a new variable naming it star power and keep it for all sprites then we set star power to hmm a thousand but it doesn't really matter at present any number larger than zero will do and then we'll play sound until done that's important and choose the star power theme oh yeah this is gonna be cool now when the track finishes i want a little warning jingle to let us know that the time is coming to an end i don't think i have the right one but if we play the level select sound until done again i think that sounds pretty fit for purpose so pop that in right afterwards now once the music stops we can end the star power by setting star power back to the empty value and finish off by starting the main music again using our music block great are you ready for this now that is time to start dashing around the level dealing out some sweet goomba payback but let's just hear it end and watch that our star power variable reporter gets reset and there we go so next up we need to get mario's flashing rainbow colors to show he's in his special mode we'll need to click into the mario sprite and find the define reset player script we should make sure to reset the new star power variable to zero when the game begins don't forget that and then find the define paint sprite script this is where we change mario's costume now we want to trigger color changes too bring in an ifelse block and we'll begin by looking for when star power is greater than zero and the best way to cycle rainbow colors is with a change color effect by and a value of 10 seems to work well for me in the else this is when the star power is over so use a set color effect to block and set it to zero that's pretty straightforward shall we just give that a test oh yes psychedelic nice right but at present this is really just shiny wrapping paper what about the actual present making mario invulnerable oh yeah no problemo click into the enemy sprite once more and we'll search out the defined tick goomba script look for where we are checking for touching mario now when we have star power all enemies just flip out of our path like they do when they get hit by a fireball in which case if star power is greater than zero we simply use the flip block then make sure to stop this script as this is the last thing we do this frame before we drop this in i'm going to make a copy of the script as we'll need to gain in a moment then drop it right in at the top under the touching mario check so that covers goomba and koopas but we also need to handle the piranha plant so find the defined tick piranha and again right after the touching mario check paste in the same star power check flip and stop this script blocks there we go so when you add new enemies we need to ensure we add the code to handle star power too most enemies will be beaten by this but enough talk we should give this a test right i'll pop up the power ups and then we can see how the star power feels now take this goomba yes it works perfectly the pavana oh yes no problem i wonder how long this will last scooting around the level now to take out as many goombas as i can oh no no i ran out just as i touched this last goomba and that cost me my super mario status too but no worries this is a super mechanic and it's working so well i just know you're gonna love getting this into your games right in the last part of this video let's fix up a few more little niggles that exist in the game firstly the end of level lack of music there's supposed to be a little end of level jingle here and we never got around to adding it that's of course in the sound sprite we already have an event we can trigger off to when i receive mario level complete so again we stop other scripts in this sprite before playing sound until done and choose the course clear jingle that's all we needed don't believe me give it a test oh man so much better now next up i have an interesting one for you did you know that when mario stands right next to a piranha infested pipe the piranha is not supposed to come out any longer the same is true for when you stand on top of it okay then so we'll need some kind of proximity check click into the enemy sprite and look for the define tick piranha script this is where we look for the piranha popping up yes as they reach stage four of their temp variable so what we'll do is insert a new if check for when the floor of temp is less than four that is they haven't yet popped up now we should check how close mario is to the pipe if less than and we'll want to be closer than say 45 pixels that's a bit more than a tile so we can be up against the pipe and it will trigger to calculate the horizontal distance we'll use an abs that's the absolute with a subtract and we want the distance between this piranha's x variable and not the x position but the x variable of the player sprite so if the distance is less than 45 then we set frame back to one this holds the piranha in the pipe until we are no longer too close by let's test that again so firstly you'll notice the enemy can be out of the pipe when we get close aha you'll note a distinct lack of parana if i move a little away i hope yes there they are super last check is to jump on top and just wait a moment looking great so what else remains unfixed i hear you ask how about this little gem you must have seen this one if i obtain the fireball powerup did you know that you can blast away the other powerups yes look this one is just too funny and that's not the best of them you can also blast away the endoflevel box yeah that really is messed up oh so funny look hilarious yes but we should really fix this one too this isn't quite so simple though well it is and it isn't find the when i receive player after enemy this is where all enemies get flipped by killer enemies like cooper shells or fireballs but you'll note enemies that are already flipped are excluded from being flipped well we can extend this list of unaffected types the fastest way is to use a contains block with the type on the right and then on the left write flip as before but to add more just add a space and then life and also a space and end box that's inbox as one word so long term this may not be the best way to do it as the list of types will get longer and longer but i don't think it'll be a problem right now let's see how that holds up grab the fire flower and try blasting the level end oh man it's fixed what a shame right next up shooting another power nope these are invulnerable too but this does show up the single flaw to this approach and that is that these powerups are blocking the passageway of the fireballs this is a bit of a shame as it would be nice if they just passed on through but the way we have things set up that's getting a little too tricky to sort out without a lot more work so i think we'll just have to be happy with what we've got here it's not so bad right hey hold on a second did you see that that mushroom powerup just went and slid behind a jump through platform oh gosh that is only happening since we allowed them to move fix one thing break another right i think this should have an easy fix though if we find the define tick life script in the enemy sprite so here when the frame is less than 48 the powerup is sprouting upwards at which point it is behind the other sprites so that it appears from behind them so last thing as it sprouts we need to bring it to the front um if frame equals 47 that's one before 48 pop in a goto front block and this can go in here last thing when frame is still less than 48 i think that will sort this out hold on here we go there perfect the mushroom is nicely in front of the background blocks now phew well here we are the end of another episode the next step for this tutorial would be to add more enemy types but more important working warp pipes i would so love to have these but the problem we face is that this tutorial series didn't start out intending to be a mario clone so the level grid system we used was not designed to easily fit this purpose hmm what are we going to do about that then anyhow that's all i have for you today i hope you enjoyed this video if you want more mario then you must smash the like button and comment under the video to give it your support do subscribe to this channel so as not to miss the next exciting video i expect it will be either the next episode of our raycaster or something completely different who knows i don't yet well that's it thanks for watching have a great week ahead and scratch on guys you
