hi I'm Griff patch I'm going to take you through part 2 of my tutorial on making a scrolling platformer in scratch we left this off with as little red dude being able to move along and the background scrolling but that's not particularly exciting and we really need to bring him back down to earth so today we're looking at gravity so let me just minimize the play area with this little button here so we have a bit more scripting area and let's get started that's what we really need to do is create a new custom block called change layer Y by and now we need to go into options here and add a number input we're going to call it s why click OK ok so let's take that down here and what this is going to do is change it but let's change variable and put in Y in drag yes Y parameter into the change part so we're changing Y by whatever s Y is and then we need to reposition the character now that is done already by this go to that we're using over here so what we can do is pop that goto into a new custom block and then we use it again so it's create a new custom block called position and then put that goto into that make sure that tick goes back into the claim code at the end of that loop and then put the new position block where it was saying go to before so that's man should be doing exactly the same thing as it was but we're using this custom block instead that means we can now reuse position over here so we're going to change Y and then reposition so grab this new change Y position and stick that in the tick custom block for now let's change Y by minus 8 so downwards by minus 8 okay let's watch that there we go every time you run the project he moves down constantly at a speed of 8 pixels per tick so the Nick step is let's try and stop him from going to be that platform okay for that what we have to do is as he comes down if he's touching the platform we need to move him up out of the platform so let's add in a control repeat until and we're going to repeat until we're not touching the platform any longer so repeat until touching they're not mouse pointer we want platforms now that's the platform sprite here so any of these platforms that we have cicely me repeat until we're not touching it and what we're gonna repeat is what's inside here what's inside here is gonna be change Y by one so I move up by one and then use again your position custom block so we actually do the repositioning okay just save that run it and see what happens there we go let me make that bigger now you see what's happening here what's happening is he's falling down by eight going through it and then rising up one pixel at a time like just like we said repeat until he's not touching it but it's that thing is then you can see him fall through again and come back up again so what we really need to do is do this so quick that we don't see it happen so that he'll fall down and look like he's sitting on top luckily that's very achievable in scratch all we need to do is change our tick custom block here this tick is supposed to be really quick that's why we called it tick like a tick of a clock so right click on it say edit go into options and say run without screen refresh so the problem is at the moment when we're moving him about the thing out of the platform scratch is telling it to update the screen as show it happening we do not want that so run without screen refresh and now let's run it again there we go he falls down and he stops on the block now the next thing we want to do is stop him from falling down at a constant speed because that's not very realistic we usually when we're walking along and falling we get faster the longer we fall for so let's make a few changes for that if we go into data we can add a new variable called s Y speed Y and we'll make it for this sprite only so we need to set speed Y to zero at the beginning in your game on custom block so that we're not falling to start with and then where we've got change player Y by minus 8 add in a change speed Y before it by minus 1 no one is to actually it better change speed Y by minus 2 and then where it says change layer Y by minus 8 drag in your speed Y so now the speed y the speed he's falling at it's gonna get bigger each time and we're gonna call this change player Y by a bigger negative number so straight away that should start to happen there we go however when he hits the platform we don't slow him down and in the end he gets so fast that he falls to it which is not what we want and that could be easily fixed so in here this little loop down here with a change Blair why get a set and set the speed Y to 0 inside that repeat so when he is touching a platform it'll set off speed Y to 0 and now play it then he stops and if we walk off the end you'll see he starts falling again until he hits the bottom and then that stops it that's fine and they're normal circumstances will happen to die there so that's great we've got some gravity going off and I think about that is we can easily add in a jumping mechanism now that will go in the tick block as I just move that to change player Y down a bit let's put another if statement in and we'll put it just before the speed Y change and we need a key press of up and in there we're gonna set speed y2 16 okay now if we run out and press up instantly we can do some jumping now this is actually more like flying if I hold it down I can just keep going hovering around like this which is quite good for like a flappy bird game or something but not what we want for a platformer so what I need to do now is make him so he's only now to jump if he's been touching the platforms for this another variable is needed and we're gonna call this in air and again this sprite only so set in air to zero when the game on is hit and what we gonna do is when a change in air inside the change player why we're gonna change it by one now this means it's gonna keep saying he's one in the air for longer the more he's in the air and when we touch a platform we're gonna set you know back to zero so it'll be zero for as long as he's touching something and that in air will be bigger than zero when he's in the air the long is in the air the bigger that number becomes and that means that we can use that in the jumping code so if we put an if statement around the set speed y2 16 then we can put a less than and we can put in air so if in air is less than four we'll choose now for the number i've chosen which is a little number so if he's in the air for the tiniest bit after he's left the edge of a platform you can still do a jump now this is quite important for some platformers to make it easy enough to jump because sometimes if you're going down slopes or things you're kind of skipping along down the slope and he's four tiny bits of it but that would mean you wouldn't be able to jump while you're skipping down a slope and that can be really frustrating for players so it's always a nice give a little bit of leeway so if I run that now get out make it big so I can jump but look if I hold down the UP button he only jumps when he gets back to the ground which is what we wanted I can't jump double jump in the air there we go it's not jumping mechanism and so that's the end of this tutorial in the next tutorial you'll hopefully cover things like collision detection in the sideways direction so we can get bump into objects in that direction and also ceiling detection both of those things if you try this current example out you'll find will do very strange things and they're very necessary in any platforming going to make them really stable so I hope you'll join me next time and I enjoyed that today this is Griff patch and I thank you for watching bye
