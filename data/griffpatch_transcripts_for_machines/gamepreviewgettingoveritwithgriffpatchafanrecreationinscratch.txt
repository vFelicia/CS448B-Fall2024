hey guys this is Griff patch I'm just bursting to share with you this teaser video for my upcoming game scratch edition of getting over it with Bennett fadi although I started playing with the idea of this game a few months back I only really got down to working since Leon it over the last couple of weeks anyhow it's almost complete and so I thought I'd give his little teaser of where we're at in development so first off have you played the original game if you have then after you've watched the video leave me some comments and I'd love to hear what you think he was excited as me so you'll notice that the game is completely scratch themed it starts out appropriately I think on a heap of green flag hat blocks but once you reach the foot of the mountain you'll find that I've gone to town to recreate the original games mountain climb using only sprites sourced from the scratch costume library in getting over it you're climbing a mountain assembled from the assets from other games I've had a lot of fun working on this project so I'm stoked to get this shared on scratch I've only got a few more areas to work on mainly the game monologue and tidying up the ending I'll need to add in a game time or two for those who managed to get good enough to begin recording speedruns okay enough of me talking enjoy the rest of the video and if you like what you've seen then like the video and I'll enjoy reading your comments views and questions under the video what you you you what you don't want to miss out on any tutorials or updates then do subscribe to my channel thanks for watching and catch you later bye
