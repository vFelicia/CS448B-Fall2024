00:00 - Welcome All in This video I will be
00:02 - teaching you how to create a rock paper
00:04 - scissor cave in Python
00:06 - this is the game we are going to build
00:08 - on running
00:10 - it will give us an option for selecting
00:12 - game points
00:14 - then say five then it asks sir for a
00:17 - choice
00:19 - sir
00:20 - I am choosing paper
00:23 - after hitting enter it shows me which
00:25 - computer is true so here computer choose
00:28 - season
00:29 - and as Caesar bits paper computer got a
00:32 - point and clear about zero point now
00:35 - it's again asking for a choice let's say
00:37 - go
00:38 - now it's in computer also choose row so
00:41 - it's in time
00:43 - no points to anyone
00:46 - now let's choose another option
00:49 - I chose this and come to the choose
00:51 - paper so either bit paper
00:53 - I got one point
00:55 - So currently score is one one and when
00:58 - the score of any of player reach 5 then
01:01 - Game Stop final winner will be clear so
01:04 - this is the game we have to build today
01:10 - let's start creating it
01:12 - foreign
01:29 - keeping it in mind we will be creating
01:31 - our game first of all
01:33 - create a list of choices
01:41 - enter the name of your choice here we
01:44 - have rock paper and scissor
01:48 - these are the choices
01:51 - which users can choose during a
01:54 - and
01:56 - after that we are also keeping note on
02:00 - points of player user so initially
02:04 - make them zero first of all let's play
02:07 - clear words as people
02:10 - will give it value 0 similarly for
02:12 - computer points let's say three points
02:15 - and give it also available
02:17 - these are the points from
02:22 - and these are for clear now we will ask
02:25 - user to enter the game point so so that
02:27 - we can create a variable name point
02:33 - and as the game points will be of
02:35 - integer type so use 8
02:38 - then we have to use input for taking
02:40 - inputs and here we can write down
02:43 - message let's say enter the game points
02:48 - after that we know that game is going to
02:51 - run until any one of player hits the
02:54 - game point so let's play a game our game
02:57 - points are five flow
03:04 - earlier than player
03:07 - then also Game Stops there so for
03:11 - this condition we can write
03:14 - trial P points are less than
03:17 - points which are the total game part
03:21 - and
03:22 - C points are also less than points
03:28 - so let's
03:30 - I'm creating a variable name layer for
03:33 - storing user
03:36 - choice and
03:38 - for taking a string input
03:40 - just use input directly and give you a
03:44 - message here
03:45 - I'm saying you want choice
03:49 - now user will have to choose one out of
03:52 - these rock paper and figure and the
03:55 - value which user enter will get stored
03:57 - in this player variable after that we
04:00 - have to get a choice from computer also
04:03 - let's create a variable computer for
04:05 - getting computer choice and now it's
04:08 - completely is going to play it has to
04:10 - randomly choose from
04:13 - these three choices for choosing a
04:16 - random
04:19 - number via random class in Python so we
04:22 - can import
04:25 - use it by writing this import random
04:29 - and
04:32 - now simply write random Dot
04:37 - end of class
04:39 - okay inside this you
04:42 - Choice parameters you can write the
04:46 - list name for which our choice to be
04:49 - made so here we are going to make a
04:52 - choice from
04:54 - this Choice list so I'm writing it's
04:58 - here let me just
05:00 - quickly show you how this random feature
05:03 - and this choice is working import random
05:07 - create a list and ask something you need
05:10 - like two four five six
05:14 - and I am printing a random choice
05:20 - list of choices
05:23 - this level contain two four five six and
05:26 - I run this code then
05:28 - my output will be one of these two four
05:31 - five six
05:33 - here it's giving me five when I again
05:36 - run it it's all so giving five
05:39 - then two two four I hope this random
05:43 - draw if the third is clear to you
05:46 - now let's get back to our code
05:48 - first of all let's check if there is a
05:51 - tie condition or not you when a time
05:54 - will occur a time will occur if computer
05:56 - and player both have selected the same
05:59 - choice
06:00 - so for checking it we can use if player
06:03 - is equal to
06:05 - computer
06:10 - then we simply print it's a type
06:19 - or else if what we are going to check is
06:25 - player
06:27 - in Choice means user first discount
06:33 - this list only
06:36 - and if that condition meets then we will
06:39 - have to check but our
06:41 - some future choose so our computer have
06:45 - three choices to select
06:47 - if computer call it was broke
06:51 - will continue to choose a rock
06:54 - another condition can be
06:58 - if computer choose season
07:03 - and other will be
07:06 - a computer Choice paper
07:10 - if computer chose Rock then we have to
07:13 - check what
07:14 - player choose so
07:17 - player is equal to is equal to figure
07:24 - or other condition can be
07:27 - this layer is equal to
07:30 - paper
07:32 - and the third condition we don't have to
07:34 - check for 0 because if player also
07:38 - chooses Rock and computer is also
07:40 - choosing lock then this condition will
07:42 - be got here only our code this part of
07:45 - code is not be executed so
07:48 - only these two conditions are can occur
07:52 - if computers to read the Rope
07:58 - here computer is choosing Rock and
08:00 - player is choosing so in our game rules
08:05 - rock is beating these are
08:08 - Prince computer is beating players so
08:12 - who will get
08:13 - a increasing Point computers three point
08:17 - will be increased by 0.31 plus is equal
08:21 - to one this will increase the moment so
08:24 - computer and otherwise
08:28 - player wants me the increase now coming
08:30 - to
08:32 - the Caesar part let me just paste
08:39 - the code here and if computer choose a
08:43 - Caesar then
08:46 - player must have chosen from
08:49 - broke
08:51 - or paper here
08:54 - because Caesar condition will be again
08:56 - caught here and check for rock and
09:00 - scissor
09:01 - so rock bit season
09:04 - creates player is beating computer so
09:07 - player point will be increased and
09:11 - for paper and figure Caesar is beating
09:14 - paper
09:16 - so Caesar is beating paper computers
09:18 - beating here so 0.4 computer will
09:21 - increase
09:23 - now similarly for this condition
09:28 - we have Caesar and broke Choice board
09:32 - player and for paper and scissor again
09:34 - Caesar bits people means player is
09:38 - beating the computer so player will get
09:40 - a point and for broken paper
09:43 - paper will beat broke so computer will
09:46 - get a point after that we can just check
09:48 - who on so for final result when this
09:53 - file after a while condition means one
09:55 - of the player reached the game points
09:57 - you can just check
10:01 - if People's Player points are greater
10:04 - than C points means computer points then
10:08 - just print
10:10 - you want is playable here otherwise else
10:19 - print
10:22 - computer one
10:25 - can do some
10:27 - other changes like every time
10:30 - we can print what computer chose
10:37 - to choice is and then pass the
10:40 - computer's Choice here
10:46 - we have still every choice is made we
10:49 - can print current score of player
10:52 - simply print
10:54 - player and after comma write the
10:58 - variable name for Clear points just
11:02 - and again
11:04 - give a comma and inside this inverted
11:07 - commas right momentum
11:10 - then after comma write the
11:15 - computer codes
11:21 - enter the game points let's say three
11:26 - first of all make a choice I'm choosing
11:29 - block
11:31 - their computer choose paper and as Paper
11:33 - Bits row so computer point now I am
11:36 - selecting paper computer choose Rock I
11:39 - got a point
11:42 - it's a Time
11:45 - I got point
11:49 - and finally
11:51 - when I reach three points
11:53 - which are game points then it shows me
11:56 - who won if computer reached three points
11:58 - earlier then it shows and one more thing
12:01 - I missed was that if players choice
12:05 - is on is not from this Choice list then
12:10 - we have to
12:15 - give a message that
12:20 - leave
12:22 - now
12:24 - Choice phone
12:32 - paper
12:44 - when user write something else other
12:47 - than
12:49 - choices then it will display a message
12:56 - so that's it for this video
12:59 - you can do other modifications also on
13:02 - your own like every time a point is
13:05 - incremented then display that computer
13:08 - got a point or player got a point

Welcome All in This video I will be teaching you how to create a rock paper scissor cave in Python this is the game we are going to build on running it will give us an option for selecting game points then say five then it asks sir for a choice sir I am choosing paper after hitting enter it shows me which computer is true so here computer choose season and as Caesar bits paper computer got a point and clear about zero point now it's again asking for a choice let's say go now it's in computer also choose row so it's in time no points to anyone now let's choose another option I chose this and come to the choose paper so either bit paper I got one point So currently score is one one and when the score of any of player reach 5 then Game Stop final winner will be clear so this is the game we have to build today let's start creating it foreign keeping it in mind we will be creating our game first of all create a list of choices enter the name of your choice here we have rock paper and scissor these are the choices which users can choose during a and after that we are also keeping note on points of player user so initially make them zero first of all let's play clear words as people will give it value 0 similarly for computer points let's say three points and give it also available these are the points from and these are for clear now we will ask user to enter the game point so so that we can create a variable name point and as the game points will be of integer type so use 8 then we have to use input for taking inputs and here we can write down message let's say enter the game points after that we know that game is going to run until any one of player hits the game point so let's play a game our game points are five flow earlier than player then also Game Stops there so for this condition we can write trial P points are less than points which are the total game part and C points are also less than points so let's I'm creating a variable name layer for storing user choice and for taking a string input just use input directly and give you a message here I'm saying you want choice now user will have to choose one out of these rock paper and figure and the value which user enter will get stored in this player variable after that we have to get a choice from computer also let's create a variable computer for getting computer choice and now it's completely is going to play it has to randomly choose from these three choices for choosing a random number via random class in Python so we can import use it by writing this import random and now simply write random Dot end of class okay inside this you Choice parameters you can write the list name for which our choice to be made so here we are going to make a choice from this Choice list so I'm writing it's here let me just quickly show you how this random feature and this choice is working import random create a list and ask something you need like two four five six and I am printing a random choice list of choices this level contain two four five six and I run this code then my output will be one of these two four five six here it's giving me five when I again run it it's all so giving five then two two four I hope this random draw if the third is clear to you now let's get back to our code first of all let's check if there is a tie condition or not you when a time will occur a time will occur if computer and player both have selected the same choice so for checking it we can use if player is equal to computer then we simply print it's a type or else if what we are going to check is player in Choice means user first discount this list only and if that condition meets then we will have to check but our some future choose so our computer have three choices to select if computer call it was broke will continue to choose a rock another condition can be if computer choose season and other will be a computer Choice paper if computer chose Rock then we have to check what player choose so player is equal to is equal to figure or other condition can be this layer is equal to paper and the third condition we don't have to check for 0 because if player also chooses Rock and computer is also choosing lock then this condition will be got here only our code this part of code is not be executed so only these two conditions are can occur if computers to read the Rope here computer is choosing Rock and player is choosing so in our game rules rock is beating these are Prince computer is beating players so who will get a increasing Point computers three point will be increased by 0.31 plus is equal to one this will increase the moment so computer and otherwise player wants me the increase now coming to the Caesar part let me just paste the code here and if computer choose a Caesar then player must have chosen from broke or paper here because Caesar condition will be again caught here and check for rock and scissor so rock bit season creates player is beating computer so player point will be increased and for paper and figure Caesar is beating paper so Caesar is beating paper computers beating here so 0.4 computer will increase now similarly for this condition we have Caesar and broke Choice board player and for paper and scissor again Caesar bits people means player is beating the computer so player will get a point and for broken paper paper will beat broke so computer will get a point after that we can just check who on so for final result when this file after a while condition means one of the player reached the game points you can just check if People's Player points are greater than C points means computer points then just print you want is playable here otherwise else print computer one can do some other changes like every time we can print what computer chose to choice is and then pass the computer's Choice here we have still every choice is made we can print current score of player simply print player and after comma write the variable name for Clear points just and again give a comma and inside this inverted commas right momentum then after comma write the computer codes enter the game points let's say three first of all make a choice I'm choosing block their computer choose paper and as Paper Bits row so computer point now I am selecting paper computer choose Rock I got a point it's a Time I got point and finally when I reach three points which are game points then it shows me who won if computer reached three points earlier then it shows and one more thing I missed was that if players choice is on is not from this Choice list then we have to give a message that leave now Choice phone paper when user write something else other than choices then it will display a message so that's it for this video you can do other modifications also on your own like every time a point is incremented then display that computer got a point or player got a point
