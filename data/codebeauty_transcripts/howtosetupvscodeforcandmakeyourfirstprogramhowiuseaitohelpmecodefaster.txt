00:00 - hi everyone and welcome to my channel in
00:02 - this video i'm going to show you how you
00:04 - can set up and use vs code to make c
00:07 - plus programs some of you asked if that
00:10 - is possible and the answer is absolutely
00:12 - yes so today i will show you a simple
00:15 - and easy way to do that now as some of
00:18 - you already know i personally use visual
00:20 - studio and there are a few reasons for
00:23 - this
00:24 - um first of all i have a free license
00:27 - for visual studio i have a lifelong
00:29 - license from my university
00:31 - but they made a mistake there they
00:33 - probably thought she's going to live for
00:35 - 50 or 60 years so let's give her a
00:37 - lifelong license
00:39 - what a mistake
00:41 - as some of you already know i'm a
00:43 - vegetarian and i lead a very healthy
00:45 - lifestyle so if my calculations are
00:48 - correct i'm going to live for 120 years
00:51 - and i plan to use this free license for
00:54 - my entire life because i paid for my
00:57 - university a lot
01:00 - i'm just kidding
01:02 - i mean i do have a free license but this
01:05 - is not the reason why i use visual
01:07 - studio
01:09 - because of the nature of my work i have
01:11 - to do a lot of code analyzing a lot of
01:13 - performance testing i have to use a lot
01:16 - of advanced development tools that vs
01:18 - code does not have so basically i need
01:20 - an entire ide for my work but for
01:23 - tutorials for learning purposes uh vs
01:26 - code is going to be more than enough so
01:28 - you can use that and today i want to
01:30 - show you how you can set it up and use
01:32 - it to make c plus programs and then i
01:34 - also want to share some tips on how i
01:37 - use artificial intelligence to help me
01:39 - code faster i know that a lot of people
01:42 - think that ai is very complicated but
01:45 - the tool that i want to show you is
01:46 - actually very simple and it is called
01:49 - tab nine it is an ai completion tool
01:52 - which means that it basically completes
01:54 - your code for you and then it uses
01:56 - machine learning in order to learn about
01:58 - you and your coding style so the more
02:00 - you use it the more helpful it becomes
02:03 - and i personally use it for c plus and
02:05 - then also for c sharp and javascript
02:08 - because you can use it for all modern
02:10 - programming languages and the best thing
02:12 - is that if you're a student if you use
02:14 - this to learn and save some time while
02:17 - coding your girl has you covered
02:19 - you can use this for free and then if
02:22 - you want to get some additional features
02:24 - customization and things like that you
02:26 - can get a pro plan and i will leave a
02:29 - link in the description so that you can
02:30 - check out all the details for yourself
02:33 - and then later i'm going to show you how
02:34 - you can install and use this tool to
02:36 - help you to code faster so that is what
02:39 - we will do in this video and now i'm
02:42 - going to show you how to set up vs code
02:44 - for c plus i'm going to explain every
02:46 - single step of this process so that you
02:49 - know what is happening it's not going to
02:51 - be hard it's very easy but you will have
02:53 - to be careful
02:55 - so that you don't make a mistake because
02:57 - then it is not going to work
02:59 - so
03:00 - as you can see here i have opened visual
03:02 - studio code and the first thing that we
03:04 - need to do is we need to install an
03:06 - extension for c and c plus plus
03:09 - so go to view
03:11 - and then extensions
03:14 - okay
03:15 - and here i'm going to search for c plus
03:20 - and you need to install this one so the
03:23 - one from microsoft it's c and c plus
03:26 - plus from microsoft i'm going to click
03:29 - install here
03:30 - okay and it is downloading and
03:32 - installing
03:34 - okay perfect so now after i have
03:37 - installed the extension for c plus plus
03:39 - the next step is to install a compiler
03:42 - and this is because c plus plus is
03:45 - compiled language which means that the
03:47 - code that you write and that is
03:48 - understandable to you is not
03:50 - understandable to your computer it first
03:52 - needs to be translated or compiled into
03:56 - a language that your computer can
03:57 - understand and for this we use a
04:00 - compiler you can find many different
04:02 - compilers that you can use online the
04:04 - one that i will use is called mingw and
04:08 - i will put the link that you can use to
04:10 - download it in the description it is
04:13 - free so you can use that
04:16 - so let's download our compiler
04:19 - and the download will start shortly
04:21 - after you open the link
04:24 - okay
04:25 - and after this installer is downloaded
04:28 - you are going to click it
04:30 - so you should get a window like this one
04:33 - click next
04:35 - and then here for architecture select
04:37 - the architecture of your computer for me
04:40 - that is 64.
04:43 - and then click next again and then this
04:46 - destination folder i'm going to copy
04:48 - this text so i'm going to select all of
04:50 - this text so ctrl a and then ctrl
04:53 - c because we will need it later and i
04:55 - will just paste it in a basic notepad
04:58 - file
04:59 - okay
05:01 - and then click
05:02 - next
05:03 - and here it starts the downloading and
05:05 - installation process of your compiler so
05:08 - i will be back once this is finished
05:11 - so once the installation is finished
05:13 - click next and then finish
05:16 - and then third step is
05:18 - this path here that i told you we will
05:21 - need later so now i'm going to copy this
05:23 - and what we need to do with this pad
05:26 - is we need to put it inside our
05:28 - environment variables so how you do that
05:31 - well search on your windows for
05:35 - edit environment variables for your
05:37 - account and then open this
05:40 - okay
05:41 - now here you will select this path and
05:45 - then click edit and then here we will
05:48 - need to add the path that we just copied
05:51 - so click new and then here i am going to
05:54 - paste this pad and then here we will
05:57 - need to append something else i will put
05:59 - it on the screen and that is
06:03 - this text here okay so
06:06 - once you have pasted everything it
06:09 - should look something like this
06:11 - and then click ok and then okay here as
06:15 - well and that should be it if you have
06:18 - done everything correctly everything
06:20 - should work perfectly but if you want to
06:22 - make sure that you have installed your
06:24 - compiler successfully what you can do is
06:26 - you can use your command prompt which i
06:29 - will open now
06:32 - and here you are going to type two
06:34 - commands that i will put on the screen
06:36 - as well that is g plus plus
06:40 - version
06:42 - okay
06:43 - and then
06:44 - g d b
06:47 - version
06:48 - like this
06:50 - okay so if you don't don't get any error
06:53 - here that means that everything is
06:55 - installed as it should be but if you get
06:57 - an error here make sure to go back to
06:59 - the previous step and go again through
07:01 - the installation process of your
07:03 - compiler and then make sure that the
07:06 - patch that we copied inside our
07:08 - environment variables is correct
07:11 - okay
07:12 - so let's minimize this and as i said
07:15 - that is everything that you need in
07:17 - order to set up vs code to write c plus
07:19 - plus programs but one more thing that i
07:22 - promised is i want to show you how you
07:24 - can install and use tab 9 to help you to
07:27 - write faster
07:29 - so for that let's open their site
07:32 - okay i'm going to put the link that you
07:34 - can use in the description so click get
07:37 - tab nine it's free and then here you are
07:40 - going to select your ide
07:42 - i'm going to select vs code
07:46 - okay
07:47 - and here i'm going to click install now
07:50 - and here it should ask you
07:52 - if you want to open this with visual
07:54 - studio code so make sure to select that
07:56 - so i will say open visual studio code
08:00 - and as you can see here we have
08:02 - the extension that we need to install so
08:04 - i will click install
08:06 - and it should start installing it now
08:08 - now one very important thing that i want
08:10 - to mention while this is installing is
08:13 - that
08:14 - if you are installing anything anything
08:16 - in visual studio code make sure to
08:18 - restart your visual studio code after
08:20 - that because sometimes it just gets
08:22 - stuck and it doesn't even realize that
08:24 - something has been installed so
08:27 - after we have installed this i am going
08:30 - to close my visual studio code
08:33 - okay and then uh let's also close this
08:37 - now one thing that i want to do is
08:39 - instead of opening visual studio code
08:41 - manually is i will use this command
08:44 - prompt in order to make a directory
08:46 - where we will put all the files that we
08:48 - create for our program so that
08:50 - everything is organized as it should be
08:53 - so here i'm going to create a folder a
08:56 - directory so i will use
08:58 - um mk
08:59 - there so make directory command in
09:02 - windows and i will create a directory
09:06 - that is called
09:07 - first
09:09 - program
09:10 - like this
09:11 - okay
09:13 - and then after you have created this
09:16 - folder this directory what i want to do
09:18 - is i want to enter inside that directory
09:20 - so i'm going to use cd command and i
09:22 - will say
09:23 - first program so create a first program
09:27 - folder and then enter inside that folder
09:30 - and as you can see this path of my
09:33 - command prompt has changed now we are
09:35 - one folder deeper so inside this first
09:37 - program folder and what i want to do
09:40 - here is i won't say please open my vs
09:42 - code here like this so that is the
09:45 - command that you use and now it should
09:47 - open vs code inside this folder
09:51 - okay perfect
09:53 - now what i want to do is i want to
09:55 - create a new file and i want to do that
09:58 - inside this first program folder so i
10:01 - will click
10:02 - new file here and then i'm going to name
10:05 - that file for example hello
10:08 - world
10:10 - and then one very important thing is
10:11 - that you will need to use extension dot
10:14 - cpp because you will write source code
10:16 - so you will write inside a file that has
10:19 - extension dot cpp
10:21 - okay so hello world dot cpp and here is
10:24 - our editor and here we are going to
10:26 - write our c plus code
10:29 - so let's create a simple hello world
10:31 - program i will say
10:33 - include
10:35 - iostream
10:37 - okay and then using
10:40 - and as you can see immediately tab 9 is
10:43 - offering the completion for this line so
10:45 - using namespace std and you can press
10:47 - stop in order to complete that command
10:51 - and then int
10:52 - main
10:54 - and here i want to say return
10:57 - zero okay and if you see that code
10:59 - appears like magic on this on the screen
11:02 - that is because i'm just using tab in
11:03 - order to complete the lines that are
11:06 - offered by tab nine
11:08 - and here i just want to say c out and
11:11 - then let's say
11:12 - hello okay it is offering already hello
11:15 - world so i'm going to uh select that
11:19 - so after we have written this very
11:21 - simple hello world program i want to
11:23 - show you how you can compile it and run
11:25 - it using vs code so in order to compile
11:28 - this program you will click on terminal
11:31 - and then here
11:32 - run build task
11:34 - and it should offer something like this
11:36 - and here you are going to select your
11:38 - compiler so make sure to select g plus
11:41 - plus so this one
11:44 - okay and then here it says that build
11:47 - finished successfully and then if you
11:50 - noticed here it created an additional
11:52 - file which is
11:54 - helloworld.exe so this is your
11:57 - executable file this is your application
11:59 - so in order to run this file i'm going
12:01 - to open my terminal again and we are
12:04 - positioned inside this first program
12:07 - folder so this is one folder beneath
12:10 - this
12:11 - helloworld.exe so now in order to run
12:14 - this helloworld.exe what you need to do
12:16 - is just type
12:18 - hello
12:21 - world.exe so not cpp this is
12:25 - one way and then you can also say
12:28 - um
12:29 - dot and then you can use this backslash
12:32 - so dot backslash helloworld.exe
12:36 - and if i press enter as you can see it
12:38 - says hello world
12:41 - okay so that is how you compile and run
12:43 - your program using vs code
12:46 - now let me show you how tab 9 uses
12:48 - artificial intelligence in order to help
12:50 - you to code faster so let's create a
12:53 - variable of type string and let's call
12:56 - it
12:57 - fruit for example and here i want to
13:00 - assign a value of let's say letter a and
13:03 - then letter p
13:05 - and as you can see it is offering me a
13:07 - fruit called apple and that is probably
13:10 - because it reads that the name of the
13:12 - variable is fruit and then it knows to
13:14 - offer a fruit that starts with letter a
13:17 - and then letter p that i typed so an
13:19 - apple
13:20 - okay now let's create another
13:24 - variable let's make it an array called
13:27 - fruits and it will be array of five
13:30 - strings for example and here i want to
13:32 - assign different values so uh it already
13:35 - offers apple as a first value for my
13:38 - array and then let's say here for
13:40 - example
13:41 - orange
13:43 - and then
13:44 - um let's say p
13:46 - e okay it's offering pier
13:49 - and then uh for example strawberry
13:54 - okay
13:54 - str and then it is offering strawberry
13:58 - and let's say for example
14:00 - banana okay perfect and now let's write
14:04 - out all of these um elements of my array
14:07 - so i will say four
14:10 - and then int i is equal to zero and then
14:13 - i is less than five i plus plus again if
14:16 - you see code appearing very fast that is
14:19 - because i'm using tab in order to
14:20 - complete what tab 9 is offering so i
14:23 - will say c out and then
14:26 - fruits of
14:27 - i
14:28 - and let's add endline
14:31 - okay and let me show you one more time
14:34 - how you can compile this program so make
14:37 - sure to save everything and then go to
14:40 - terminal
14:41 - okay terminal and then run build task
14:44 - select g plus plus compiler
14:48 - and
14:49 - when build finishes successfully what
14:51 - you can do is you can run this program
14:54 - in your terminal so you can say
14:57 - hello world dot
14:59 - e x e
15:01 - or you can use this approach here so
15:04 - when i press enter as you can see our
15:06 - program works as expected
15:10 - okay
15:11 - one very important thing that i want to
15:12 - mention related to tab 9 is i know that
15:15 - a lot of people will be concerned about
15:17 - privacy and security of their code and
15:20 - this is very important for me personally
15:22 - because i work with very sensitive data
15:25 - and basically when i started working for
15:27 - my company i had to sign a contract that
15:30 - states that i cannot work for another
15:33 - company from the same industry for two
15:35 - years after i stopped working for my
15:37 - current company and that is because all
15:40 - the algorithms all the code and data
15:42 - needs to be very very private so they
15:45 - are probably giving me two years in
15:47 - order to forget it or for them to change
15:49 - it i don't know
15:51 - but basically i had to do a very good
15:53 - research about tab 9 and i wouldn't say
15:55 - that all the code that you write stays
15:58 - private and secure so you don't have to
16:00 - worry about that again i will put a link
16:02 - in the description that you can use in
16:04 - order to read more details yourself
16:07 - so that is what i wanted to teach you in
16:09 - this video how you can set up and use vs
16:11 - code in order to write c plus programs
16:14 - and all the details that you will need
16:16 - will be in the description so if you
16:18 - enjoyed this video please give it a
16:20 - thumbs up for the youtube algorithm that
16:22 - helps me a lot to reach more people and
16:24 - teach them programming and then if you
16:26 - have any questions or if you have
16:27 - suggestions for my future videos you can
16:30 - put those in the comments section i made
16:32 - this video because some of you asked me
16:34 - to show you how you can use vs code to
16:37 - make c plus programs and then also let
16:40 - me know in the comments which one will
16:42 - you use from now vs code or visual
16:44 - studio so thank you very much for
16:47 - watching and i'm going to see you in
16:48 - some other video bye
