00:00 - hi guys and welcome to my channel this
00:02 - video is going to be a little bit
00:04 - different go away in this video we are
00:06 - going to talk about artificial
00:08 - intelligence remember all the scary
00:10 - movies predicting AI rising to the power
00:12 - and being way smarter than us well maybe
00:16 - that time has already come that's
00:19 - exactly what we will find out in this
00:20 - video because a few days ago I went to
00:22 - my LinkedIn profile and everyone was
00:24 - talking about this AI tool called chat
00:27 - GPT so I decided to try it out and see
00:30 - what's all the buzz about and I was
00:33 - shocked so let me show you what I'm
00:35 - talking about please keep in mind that
00:38 - this AI has wide use but in this video
00:41 - we are going to focus mainly on how it
00:43 - can affect and help us as developers so
00:47 - here it is it has a very simple
00:48 - interface but let's see what it can
00:50 - actually do
00:51 - so let's say for example reverse a
00:54 - string in C plus plus let's see
00:58 - okay here is the explanation
01:02 - and then it gives you the code
01:04 - fantastic let's run the program
01:07 - and here is our hello world reversed how
01:11 - awesome is this but it's pretty simple
01:12 - example so let's see what else it can do
01:14 - so let's test its oop knowledge let's
01:17 - say
01:18 - create a user that has name age username
01:22 - and password in C plus plus let's see
01:26 - okay so here you get the explanation
01:29 - okay
01:34 - so it gave us the entire code and it
01:38 - created the class and then it also
01:41 - created the example of how to use this
01:44 - class and it's even writing the comments
01:46 - in code I mean how cool is this so let's
01:49 - copy this and paste it to my visual
01:52 - studio
01:53 - okay all the code is here and if I try
01:56 - to run this app let's see the result so
01:59 - here is our user amazing so since many
02:03 - of you very often ask me about data
02:05 - structures and algorithms let's see what
02:07 - it can do in that area so let's ask it
02:10 - to make a program that measures
02:11 - inserting time and compares the speed of
02:15 - a linked list and an array in C plus
02:17 - plus so let's see
02:19 - so it even continues giving additional
02:22 - explanations about this code but what
02:24 - I'm interested in is to see how this
02:27 - code will work so let's paste it to
02:29 - visual studio
02:30 - okay and let's run it
02:35 - okay and time to insert what is this is
02:38 - this one million elements into a linked
02:41 - list is 0.9 seconds and time to insert 1
02:44 - million elements into an array is
02:47 - 0.001 seconds okay let's close this
02:50 - let's see why
02:54 - so it is because it has generated a
02:57 - static array not Dynamic array so that
02:59 - is the reason why inserting elements
03:01 - into an array is faster than into a
03:04 - linked list otherwise if it had been a
03:06 - dynamic array then linked list would be
03:09 - faster you can try and ask chat gbt to
03:11 - create a comparison between a linked
03:13 - list and dynamic array when it comes to
03:16 - inserting elements and see what you are
03:18 - going to get in that situation let's do
03:20 - something with algorithms let's say
03:22 - write AC plus algorithm to sort 10
03:25 - random numbers in ascending order
03:27 - numbers should be bigger than 10 and
03:30 - smaller than one thousand
03:32 - okay so let's see how it's going to
03:34 - handle this
03:35 - okay
03:38 - so here's our finished result let's copy
03:41 - the code
03:42 - okay go to visual studio and let's see
03:46 - how this program behaves okay so here
03:49 - are our random numbers sorted in
03:52 - ascending order and all of them are
03:55 - between 10 and 1000 amazing so here is
03:59 - your homework solved in literally five
04:01 - seconds
04:02 - now let's try something different
04:04 - because chalk GPT is not only about
04:07 - programming but it has wide use so let's
04:10 - give it a different test let's say for
04:12 - example write a short but interesting
04:14 - and controversial post that would get me
04:16 - a lot of thumbs up let's see I'm
04:20 - becoming a drama Channel you know
04:24 - okay
04:29 - okay so I read this and it's very
04:31 - interesting but also very controversial
04:33 - topic because I believe that it hits
04:35 - different on the employer side and on
04:38 - the employee side so let me know what do
04:40 - you think in the comment section would
04:42 - you like for a four day work week to be
04:45 - introduced let's see if it will be able
04:48 - to reply to this request let's say can
04:51 - you write me a short story about a man
04:53 - who sold his dog because he didn't have
04:55 - money let's see
04:57 - I'm really interested in this one
05:00 - okay so once upon a time a man named
05:03 - John had a dog named Max John and Max
05:06 - were the best of friends and did
05:08 - everything together they went on long
05:10 - walks played fetch in the park and
05:11 - snuggled on the couch at night but one
05:14 - day John's financial situation took a
05:16 - turn for the worse he lost his job and
05:19 - found himself struggling to make ends
05:21 - meet he couldn't afford to buy Max food
05:24 - or pay for his vet bills and he knew he
05:28 - had to make a difficult decision okay
05:30 - now I am not going to read this anymore
05:33 - because I'm going to start crying so
05:34 - let's return to C plus plus topics okay
05:36 - let's see if it can create an entire
05:39 - application let's say for example make
05:41 - me a calculator app in C plus okay
05:49 - okay so here is the code for our app and
05:52 - I don't even need to test it because I
05:53 - can already see that is it of course
05:55 - there are different ways to make this
05:57 - application but one thing that I do want
05:59 - to test and one thing that I do want to
06:01 - try is this let's say translate it to C
06:05 - sharp let's see if it will be able to do
06:07 - this
06:11 - so I don't know if you see the same
06:13 - potential as I do but this is actually
06:16 - amazing this is just beta version and
06:18 - it's already able to translate an
06:21 - application into a different programming
06:23 - language so imagine what it will be able
06:25 - to do in a year or two years and even
06:28 - now I believe that it shouldn't have any
06:30 - problems to translate much bigger
06:32 - applications but there are too many
06:34 - users and servers are crashing it's just
06:36 - in it's better phase so I believe that
06:40 - currently it's just not able to return
06:41 - me translation for a million lines of
06:44 - code so this is actually amazing and
06:47 - another thing that I want you to notice
06:49 - is the similarities between C plus and C
06:52 - sharp so if you take a look for all of
06:55 - my viewers who are learning C plus plus
06:56 - I want you to take a look
06:58 - at this C plus application and then at
07:02 - this c-sharp application you can notice
07:05 - how similar they are like if else
07:06 - structure and then here you have console
07:09 - right line and console read line which
07:11 - are in c plus c in or console input and
07:15 - then C out or console output so very
07:18 - very similar and I always mentioned that
07:20 - once you have a good understanding of
07:21 - one programming language especially if
07:23 - that programming language is something
07:24 - like C plus plus then it's just a matter
07:27 - of syntax which you can practice in a
07:30 - couple of days do a couple of exercises
07:31 - before you are able to switch to another
07:34 - programming language so while we are
07:36 - talking about different programming
07:37 - languages let's try something different
07:39 - let's say create a pink now VAR with a
07:43 - list of top five best football players
07:45 - with HTML and CSS links should point to
07:49 - their Instagram profiles so let's see
07:54 - okay so here is the code I'm going to
07:57 - copy it paste it in my vs code
08:00 - and then save and I will run this
08:05 - okay so this is our nav bar it looks
08:08 - kind of ugly but let's see if it is
08:11 - functional let's see Cristiano Ronaldo
08:14 - so it takes us to his Instagram page
08:17 - actually and then Leo Messi
08:21 - okay and then Neymar Jr Robert
08:24 - Lewandowski and then
08:28 - foreign
08:39 - so as you can see the code is okay I
08:42 - don't know if the data is okay though
08:43 - for my male viewers who understand about
08:45 - football let me know in the comments so
08:48 - what is the conclusion is AI going to
08:50 - overtake our jobs
08:51 - I do believe that some Industries are
08:54 - going to be overtaken by AI in the near
08:56 - future Industries like construction
08:58 - warehousing Transportation so all the
09:02 - repetitive routine tasks that humans are
09:04 - performing especially physical tasks
09:06 - those are gone in the future and then AI
09:09 - is also writing music and creating art
09:12 - so should musicians and artists be
09:14 - concerned I don't know I also showed you
09:18 - what you can do in code and this is just
09:20 - better version I am personally very
09:23 - enthusiastic when it comes to all the
09:25 - improvements that AI is going to bring
09:27 - to our life especially to the medicine
09:29 - and space research genetics Health Plan
09:32 - and Longevity and life quality in
09:35 - general but I also have some concerns AI
09:37 - systems are designed to make decisions
09:39 - and take actions based on the data but
09:41 - they are not perfect and they can make
09:43 - mistakes and those mistakes can have
09:46 - very very negative consequences they can
09:48 - create Financial losses legal issues or
09:51 - even be very harmful to us humans or to
09:54 - our environment AI systems are very
09:57 - complex and they are extremely hard to
09:59 - understand especially because they
10:00 - constantly evolve and change so I
10:03 - understand all the people who are
10:04 - worrying about security because of AI so
10:07 - Chuck GPT says that it finished its
10:10 - training in 2021 and that it is not
10:12 - aware of later events and it also says
10:15 - that it cannot browse the internet but
10:19 - I'm going to leave you a couple of
10:20 - examples of what people are doing with
10:22 - chat GPT and what kind of responses they
10:25 - are getting back so that you can decide
10:28 - for yourself if this is true or not some
10:32 - of these people might be trolling or
10:34 - maybe not again you can decide
10:42 - so what do you think about this let me
10:44 - know in the comments I saw that a lot of
10:46 - people are concerned about Ai and I
10:48 - didn't make this video to scare you I
10:50 - needed to share this information because
10:51 - this is a very useful tool that you can
10:54 - use in order to help you to learn
10:55 - programming and it's completely free at
10:58 - least for now so AI is here and it is
11:00 - here to stay you cannot change it you
11:02 - can either be unhappy and whine about it
11:05 - or you can embrace it and use it for
11:07 - personal growth it's your choice so what
11:10 - is the conclusion of this video the
11:12 - conclusion is that I think you don't
11:15 - need me anymore I give you someone who
11:17 - is going to reply to all your
11:18 - programming questions and it was great
11:21 - honor to be your programming teacher all
11:23 - of these years but now I leave you in
11:26 - good hands thank you very much for
11:28 - watching and we are still going to see
11:30 - each other on Instagram bye
