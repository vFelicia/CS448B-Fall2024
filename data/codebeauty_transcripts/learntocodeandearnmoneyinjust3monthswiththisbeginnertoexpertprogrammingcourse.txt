00:02 - hey want to buy some
00:03 - course okay I am proud to tell you that
00:06 - my practical programming course is
00:08 - finally out and in this short video I
00:11 - will tell you why you absolutely have to
00:13 - buy it but before that here is a short
00:16 - story of how it all came together I have
00:18 - always wanted to be a teacher always and
00:21 - I would even dare to say that I have a
00:23 - talent or a gift for teaching if you ask
00:26 - me the whole purpose of a human
00:27 - civilization is to acquire and on the
00:30 - knowledge and that is exactly what we
00:33 - have been doing since the very beginning
00:35 - and that is also a reason why I always
00:37 - wanted to be a teacher but you cannot
00:40 - live off of a dream so as many of you I
00:43 - also started programming because it
00:45 - seemed as a good way to earn some nice
00:48 - money and not just for the sake of money
00:51 - but for the sake of quality of life my
00:53 - own and those that are important to me
00:56 - so my cats when I was starting I didn't
00:59 - have any any prior experience with
01:01 - coding whatsoever and no one in my inner
01:04 - circle of people to guide me or to help
01:06 - me uh in high school I studied languages
01:10 - and I was playing accordion I'm not even
01:13 - joking so I did go to university and I
01:16 - studied software engineering but the
01:18 - knowledge that I was getting there
01:20 - wasn't enough so even though University
01:22 - was very expensive um somehow the
01:25 - knowledge that I was getting there was
01:27 - superficial it seemed like I was
01:30 - memorizing things rather than truly
01:33 - understanding them so very soon I turned
01:35 - to YouTube online courses different
01:38 - teachers but that also became very
01:42 - overwhelming and for two reasons mostly
01:45 - the first reason is that there was just
01:48 - so much to learn uh languages Frameworks
01:51 - tools backend front end mobile where do
01:54 - I start oh my God the second reason and
01:58 - this is a big one is that the the
01:59 - mentors that I've been learning from
02:01 - they seemed somehow more interested in
02:04 - showing how smart they are rather than
02:07 - simplifying things so that they are easy
02:09 - to understand for students because that
02:11 - has a point right so all in all it
02:14 - seemed as an endless struggle eventually
02:17 - I finished University and I got my first
02:19 - job for the great salary of drums please
02:25 - $400 but I'm from Balkans and in my
02:29 - country it it was considered to be
02:31 - decent money and honestly I was over the
02:33 - moon I finally got a chance to put my
02:35 - skills to test and to make profit from
02:39 - that which I did I worked my sweet ass
02:42 - off for the next two years I was solving
02:45 - problems on a daily basis I was
02:48 - completing all of my tasks on time I
02:50 - became crucial member of my team uh and
02:54 - I never stopped learning during that
02:55 - process so soon enough I started feeling
02:58 - like I'm not compens compensated enough
03:00 - for all the work that I do uh because I
03:03 - saw how much I'm contributing but I grew
03:05 - up in a very conservative environment
03:07 - and my parents my friends they would
03:09 - always tell me you have a nice secure
03:12 - job so don't leave it because if you
03:14 - lose it what if you can't find job later
03:18 - so I listened to them and I kept my job
03:22 - but I started looking for freelance
03:24 - opportunities on the side and I was so
03:27 - happy when I got my first freelance
03:30 - project for $20 per hour I used to work8
03:34 - hours for my company and after I get
03:37 - home four or five more hours and on the
03:40 - weekends as well most of the weekends uh
03:43 - so that lasted for two more years and
03:46 - during that time I burned out completely
03:50 - so I decided to leave my company because
03:52 - they were paying me peanuts and at that
03:54 - point I already had a proof that I can
03:56 - earn a lot more I sent three job
03:59 - applications three companies abroad uh
04:02 - and one did not reply at all one
04:04 - rejected me but one accepted so we got
04:08 - into interviews and all and I asked for
04:11 - 5,000 bucks per month um I was laughing
04:14 - so hard uh not in terms of knowledge
04:16 - because I really knew everything that
04:18 - they were asking for I just didn't know
04:20 - if anyone would be willing to pay me
04:21 - that much money because up to that point
04:24 - I was earning 2 and a half sometimes
04:27 - 3,000 uh but for two jobs I used to work
04:30 - 15 hours per day but they accepted and I
04:34 - remember the first month that I earned
04:36 - $5,000 for 7 hours of work and not 15
04:40 - like I used to at that point I was like
04:43 - I'm going to be rich baby and my parents
04:47 - they didn't believe that was my salary
04:49 - they thought I got into something
04:51 - illegal drugs crime selling booty I
04:55 - don't know but I was selling brains
04:58 - booty is not for sale for me that was a
05:00 - moment of breakthrough because I saw how
05:02 - much opportunity there is and I lost the
05:05 - fear of not having a job so I started
05:09 - switching jobs more often every few
05:11 - months and soon enough it got me to a
05:13 - salary of $20,000 per month now I want
05:17 - you to contemplate on that for a moment
05:20 - from $400 to $20,000 per month in less
05:25 - than 6 years during this time I have
05:28 - gained tons of knowledge and I have
05:30 - collected crazy experience I know how it
05:32 - is to work on big projects with a lot of
05:35 - great developers and I also know how it
05:38 - is to work completely alone with no one
05:40 - to help you I have worked remotely not
05:43 - being tied to a chair 9 to5 in some
05:46 - office while life is happening out there
05:49 - and I have also coded from my bed in
05:51 - pajamas and I have also coded from a
05:54 - beach in Maldives Italy France Dubai and
05:57 - much more I had the freedom to pick the
05:59 - projects that I really enjoyed uh and
06:03 - most importantly it allowed me to
06:04 - organize my time so that I can focus on
06:07 - what I truly enjoy and that is teaching
06:11 - so I have put all of my experience and
06:13 - knowledge into this practical course so
06:16 - all of the knowledge that I have
06:17 - collected over the past 10 years is
06:20 - carefully explained in simple words
06:23 - demonstrated on practical examples and
06:26 - most importantly understandable to
06:28 - Absolute beginner
06:30 - initial 100 lessons are already
06:31 - available and you can clck the clink you
06:34 - can click the link in the description
06:37 - and start learning immediately this is
06:41 - just one small part of all of the topics
06:43 - that you are going to learn in this
06:44 - course every week I will upload new
06:47 - video lessons new exercises tasks for
06:50 - you to practice until we cover
06:52 - everything that you need to know and you
06:54 - will not need any other courses after
06:56 - this one also you will get access to
06:59 - exclusive community of developers where
07:01 - you can ask questions share experiences
07:04 - and collaborate with other developers in
07:06 - this course we will be writing C but we
07:09 - will not focus just on learning C it
07:12 - will be a tool for me to shape your
07:14 - programmers mind because in this course
07:17 - I will not simply teach you to code I
07:19 - will also teach you to create to
07:22 - innovate and to solve problems so all
07:24 - the skills that you get in this course
07:26 - will be absolutely transferable to any
07:28 - other progamming language or any other
07:31 - application that you want to build in
07:33 - the future and the goal of this course
07:34 - is not for you to learn enough
07:36 - programming just to get a job the goal
07:38 - is for you to understand it so well so
07:40 - that you can pick the job that you enjoy
07:43 - the most and after you truly understand
07:46 - programming only the SKU the limit so
07:48 - everything that I did you can most
07:51 - definitely do as well and I want you to
07:53 - keep in mind on one very important thing
07:55 - and that is the fact that unlike some
07:57 - people on the internet who live pretty
07:59 - good Lifestyles thanks to the money that
08:01 - they make by selling courses everything
08:05 - that I have earned so far comes
08:07 - exclusively from my developer skill and
08:10 - not the course itself because I'm just
08:12 - releasing it I haven't made a single
08:14 - penny from it so that means that you
08:17 - also don't have to sell courses in order
08:19 - to make a good living you can code and
08:22 - work on projects that you truly enjoy
08:24 - and that you like the most the same way
08:26 - that I have come to a point in my life
08:29 - where I can also pick to do what I like
08:31 - most and that is teaching and passing my
08:34 - knowledge on to you I created this
08:37 - course for those of you who want to make
08:38 - some smart choices and move your life in
