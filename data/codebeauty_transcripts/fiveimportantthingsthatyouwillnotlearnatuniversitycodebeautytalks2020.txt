00:00 - hi everyone welcome to my channel my
00:02 - name is saldina for those of you that
00:04 - don't know and are new here i am a
00:07 - software engineer and i make i.t and
00:09 - programming related videos here on
00:11 - youtube so in today's video i want to
00:13 - talk about a topic that is highly
00:15 - requested in my comments and messages
00:18 - and
00:19 - as i said i wanted computer science
00:21 - university and i always was a good
00:24 - student i actually always try to be the
00:25 - best but looking back from this
00:28 - perspective
00:29 - after working for several years in this
00:31 - industry i now realize that there are a
00:33 - few things that i never learned at
00:35 - university and are very important for
00:38 - you to know if you want to pursue this
00:40 - career if you want to be successful at
00:42 - programming development if you want to
00:44 - be a successful software engineer so
00:47 - here are five things that i want to
00:49 - share with you that you will not learn
00:51 - at computer science schools but are very
00:53 - important for you to know
00:56 - [Music]
01:00 - the first thing university will not
01:01 - teach you is how much money you should
01:04 - and can earn so how much you are worth
01:06 - when it comes to money uh so let me ask
01:09 - you a question on your first job
01:11 - interview how much money would you ask
01:13 - for like
01:14 - when they ask you how much do you expect
01:16 - to earn here what would be your answer
01:19 - no one teaches you that at university
01:20 - and getting that first job they can tell
01:22 - you that you are worth twice as much as
01:24 - you think or three times less and you
01:27 - don't really know so only when you start
01:29 - working when you talk with people when
01:31 - you talk with people from your company
01:33 - and from other companies and then when
01:35 - you really see how much you are
01:36 - contributing only then you can get an
01:39 - idea of how much money you should earn
01:41 - so
01:42 - if you decide to go for another job
01:44 - after that then you will have much
01:46 - clearer idea of how much money you
01:48 - should ask for so you will not base that
01:51 - idea on a bluff you will not say let's
01:53 - ask for more money so that they think
01:56 - that i really know that much and that
01:58 - i'm really worth that much or you will
02:00 - not say let's ask for less so that i
02:02 - appear more modest and i have higher
02:05 - chances of getting that job but that
02:07 - idea will be based on real experience
02:10 - that you have so that is one very
02:12 - important thing that universities don't
02:14 - teach you and in my opinion it is very
02:16 - important for you to know how much you
02:18 - are worth and that you shouldn't really
02:20 - accept offers that are below that
02:23 - however you can accept those that are
02:25 - above if you want
02:32 - another important thing that they will
02:33 - not teach you at university is this real
02:37 - life experience that you get once you
02:39 - start working on real life projects and
02:42 - that is because many universities have
02:44 - the approach to teaching which is the
02:45 - following here are all of the things
02:48 - that you should know here are all of the
02:50 - questions and all the right answers and
02:53 - all the things that you should memorize
02:55 - and once you do that's it you get your
02:57 - computer science degree and everything
02:59 - is great so many people finish
03:01 - university and then carry with them this
03:03 - box of knowledge and what often happens
03:06 - is that they never look outside of that
03:08 - box they never look outside of those
03:10 - things that their professors their
03:12 - educators thought are important for them
03:14 - to know so they never see all of the
03:16 - other things that they should know and
03:18 - that are as well important so once you
03:21 - start working on real life project and
03:24 - once clients start using your
03:26 - application all of a sudden a million
03:28 - problems emerge like backdoors security
03:31 - issues bugs performance issues and you
03:34 - are like what do i do now we never
03:37 - talked about this during university so
03:39 - just this past week i have been working
03:42 - on a problem where a client said that
03:44 - the application is behaving unexpectedly
03:47 - and that it loses data so i was trying
03:50 - to reproduce that bug in my environment
03:52 - but without success in my environment
03:55 - everything worked perfectly fine
03:56 - everything was okay so after some time
03:59 - of researching i concluded that they
04:01 - have a huge problem with electrical
04:04 - installations so
04:05 - all of a sudden they get these power
04:08 - cuts all of a sudden power goes out and
04:10 - of course that application will lose
04:12 - data so the university approach to this
04:14 - problem would be okay we concluded that
04:17 - our application is not the problem
04:19 - here's your problem and once you fix
04:21 - that everything should work fine but do
04:24 - you do this in real life in most cases
04:26 - you don't so what i had to do is i had
04:28 - to make this whole backup plan of what
04:32 - happens if at any moment application
04:34 - loses power so once i try to do
04:37 - something i write in a log i say okay
04:39 - now i'm trying to do this so if i get
04:42 - that power cut once my application is up
04:45 - again i say okay i was trying to do this
04:48 - but i never got the confirmation that
04:50 - that was done so what do i do now do i
04:52 - try to do it again do i inform my user
04:55 - that there was a problem or do i do
04:57 - something else that would be the
04:58 - approach that you would have in real
05:00 - life in most cases i mean um if that
05:03 - client is not really that important i
05:05 - guess that you can tell them okay our
05:07 - application is not the problem here is
05:09 - your problem please fix that but if it
05:12 - is some important client
05:14 - if it is a vip client then you will have
05:16 - to find a solution and in many cases in
05:19 - most cases clients are important so
05:22 - i believe that those are things that
05:24 - university will never be able to teach
05:27 - you and those are things that you can
05:28 - learn only with real life experience and
05:32 - with working on real life projects and
05:34 - problems
05:37 - [Music]
05:39 - this is something that a lot of people
05:41 - don't know and it is even a little bit
05:43 - controversial to say it but many
05:45 - universities have some sort of a deal or
05:48 - agreement or partnership with different
05:50 - companies out there so companies like
05:53 - facebook or microsoft or amazon or
05:55 - google and then smaller companies as
05:58 - well and then once they have this deal
06:00 - once they have this partnership
06:02 - uh most universities will focus on
06:05 - teaching you those specific technologies
06:08 - that the company needs or uses or
06:11 - produces and they will present that as
06:14 - something that is important for you to
06:16 - know and not everyone after finishing
06:18 - university will work for that specific
06:21 - company and you will see this when you
06:24 - finish your university and you realize
06:26 - that you know 10 things that no company
06:29 - cares about and then you never heard
06:31 - about 10 other things that companies do
06:34 - actually need and then another thing is
06:36 - that knowledge that you get at
06:38 - university is limited to the knowledge
06:40 - that your educator has and if you work
06:43 - as an educator full-time so if you work
06:45 - as an educator all day every day how
06:48 - much time do you have left like
06:50 - realistically how much time do you have
06:51 - left to research and learn for yourself
06:54 - and to really get into these deep and
06:57 - complex problems that people have in
06:59 - development so that is one problem and
07:02 - then
07:03 - another problem is that many students
07:05 - will just get a small fraction of that
07:08 - knowledge that their educator has and in
07:10 - most cases that is not really enough so
07:13 - very often a skill set that you get at
07:15 - university does not really match a skill
07:18 - set that is needed by companies
07:22 - responsibility is something very
07:24 - important to mention and most people
07:26 - will not learn to be responsible at
07:28 - universities because
07:30 - most universities have exams every two
07:33 - months or every three months and that
07:35 - really allows people to learn for a few
07:38 - days every two months or every three
07:40 - months whereas if you work for a company
07:42 - you will have to learn
07:44 - and work almost every single day so
07:48 - there is a very big difference and then
07:50 - if you make errors for example at
07:52 - university those errors have much
07:54 - smaller consequences than the errors
07:56 - that you make at work so for example if
07:59 - you work with other people's money and
08:02 - if you make errors people get very very
08:04 - sensitive to that so you can lose other
08:07 - people's money or you can create some
08:10 - legal issues or you can leak some
08:12 - confidential data or you can lose money
08:13 - for your company if the deadlines are
08:15 - not met the best way to explain this is
08:18 - on an example of you learning to drive a
08:21 - car so while we are learning your
08:23 - instructor is there would you and if you
08:25 - forget a red light or you don't see a
08:27 - pedestrian the guy is there to hit the
08:29 - brakes if needed but once you get your
08:32 - driver's license you are on your own so
08:35 - all of this responsibility suddenly
08:37 - falls on your shoulders and i remember
08:40 - my first day driving alone i was like oh
08:43 - my god these people are crazy they are
08:44 - everywhere i'm going to kill someone so
08:47 - there is much bigger responsibility if
08:50 - you work for a company than on
08:52 - university for example and then there
08:54 - are other things as well that come with
08:56 - you earning your own money things like
08:58 - paying your rent or paying your mortgage
09:00 - paying the bills uh taxes and things
09:03 - like that
09:06 - [Music]
09:09 - a lot of people think that once you
09:11 - finish university and get computer
09:13 - science degree you are entitled to get a
09:16 - good job or a big salary but you are not
09:19 - really i wasn't all of my friends
09:21 - weren't unless you have very influential
09:24 - family and you know 100 percent that a
09:27 - very good job is waiting for you but
09:30 - that is not the case for most of the
09:31 - people so it's not like you finish
09:33 - university you get your computer science
09:35 - degree and all of a sudden all the
09:36 - companies want to give you a job so i
09:39 - don't know about your country but in my
09:41 - country universities are not free and
09:44 - they are not cheap and all this time
09:47 - when you go to school and then high
09:49 - school and then university mostly your
09:51 - parents and your relatives and then
09:53 - teachers and society tell you go to
09:55 - university and get that degree and that
09:58 - means that you will have a good job and
10:01 - you will have a good salary and you will
10:03 - have a secure future but
10:05 - that is not necessarily true and what
10:08 - they don't tell you what most of them
10:10 - don't ever tell you is that you can be
10:12 - just as successful even without that
10:14 - degree even without going to college and
10:17 - proof of that are people like mark
10:19 - zuckerberg bill gates steve jobs people
10:22 - that actually dropped out of college but
10:24 - made very successful careers in this
10:27 - industry you must agree so um don't get
10:29 - me wrong this is not me telling you
10:31 - don't go to university this is just me
10:34 - sharing my point of view as someone who
10:36 - went to university and finished it with
10:38 - the best grades but later i had years of
10:41 - experience in this industry seeing what
10:44 - is important and what is not really and
10:47 - having computer science degree does not
10:49 - mean anything unless you have the
10:52 - knowledge to back it up and to be honest
10:55 - in my particular situation my company
10:57 - never asked for my computer science
10:59 - degree so very important thing to keep
11:01 - in mind is
11:03 - don't just learn to get a degree but
11:05 - learn to get knowledge because that is
11:08 - the most important thing that you can
11:10 - have
11:11 - so those were some of my thoughts that i
11:13 - have related to this topic and those are
11:15 - some of the things that i've seen being
11:17 - in this industry for the past seven or
11:20 - eight years since 2013
11:23 - and considering that many of you have
11:25 - requested for me to make a video related
11:27 - on how to learn programming and get a
11:29 - job without computer science degree that
11:32 - is going to be my next video and i will
11:34 - link it here and then put it in the
11:36 - description down below as well once i
11:37 - publish it and in case that you don't
11:40 - want to miss out on that video please
11:42 - subscribe to my channel and click the
11:44 - bell icon
11:45 - and if you liked this one please give it
11:47 - a thumbs up so thank you very much for
11:50 - watching and i'm going to see you in my
11:52 - next video bye
