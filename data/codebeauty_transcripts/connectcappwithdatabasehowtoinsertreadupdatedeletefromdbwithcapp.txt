00:00 - hi guys and welcome to my channel in
00:02 - this video i'm going to teach you how
00:03 - you can create c plus plus user
00:05 - interface application and connect it to
00:08 - a database so that you can read and
00:10 - write data from that database for that
00:13 - we are going to use interbase db that is
00:15 - going to be our database and then for
00:17 - building user interface applications we
00:19 - are going to use c plus builder the
00:21 - links to download these two are going to
00:23 - be in the description so if you are not
00:25 - familiar with either one of these two
00:27 - make sure to watch these two videos so
00:30 - the first one is going to teach you how
00:31 - you can install and set up interface db
00:34 - as well as how you can write your first
00:36 - sql queries and then the second one is
00:38 - going to teach you how you can build
00:40 - user interface applications with c plus
00:43 - and after you watch these two videos you
00:45 - should be able to follow this tutorial
00:46 - without any problems so with that being
00:49 - said now i'm going to show you the
00:50 - application that we are going to build
00:52 - in this video so here is the application
00:54 - that we are going to build its
00:56 - university app that contains the list of
00:59 - all the students for now we have only
01:00 - two students that i have
01:04 - inserted into my database so this data
01:07 - is read from the database and we have
01:09 - salina nurak and elon musk so let's now
01:12 - see how we can add more records more
01:15 - students so just click on this plus
01:17 - symbol and here you need to specify the
01:20 - id of the student and then name let's
01:22 - say
01:23 - bill
01:24 - gates and then grade is going to be six
01:26 - because from what i've heard he wasn't
01:28 - such a great student
01:30 - okay and then age is 60 and confirm this
01:33 - transaction okay
01:35 - and then let's also change some data
01:37 - let's say elon musk
01:40 - like this and confirm that
01:42 - and i'm going to delete myself it hurts
01:46 - but i am going to do it okay so delete
01:48 - record yes
01:50 - so now if i stop this application
01:54 - and then run it again we should be able
01:56 - to see these changes and as you can see
01:58 - indeed these changes have been stored in
02:01 - the database so now that i started my
02:03 - application now they have been read
02:05 - again so now i have only two students
02:08 - and i am not a student anymore okay so
02:11 - how are we going to approach building
02:13 - this application well the first step is
02:15 - going to be to create a database for
02:18 - this app so here i have opened interbase
02:21 - console so make sure to open your ib
02:24 - console and if you don't have it if you
02:26 - don't know how to install or set up
02:28 - interbase make sure to watch this video
02:30 - it will be linked here and also in the
02:31 - description
02:33 - so
02:33 - let's create our database here i have my
02:36 - local server and then here should be the
02:38 - list of databases i don't have any at
02:41 - the moment so i'm going to right click
02:43 - on databases and then create database so
02:46 - here i'm going to specify the name for
02:48 - my database and here i will select the
02:50 - location for my database documents
02:53 - folder is okay so i will say university
02:57 - db
03:00 - like this and click
03:02 - save and that is all that we need to do
03:05 - for now so i'm going to click
03:06 - ok and here is asking for username and
03:10 - password let me check what is the
03:11 - default password for interface very
03:13 - quickly and i'm going to put it on the
03:15 - screen okay so on the screen you can see
03:17 - default username and password
03:19 - master
03:21 - key
03:22 - and click
03:23 - connect
03:25 - and
03:26 - oh
03:27 - it says
03:28 - unable to connect to requested host now
03:32 - the problem is that our server is not
03:35 - running so make sure to start your
03:38 - interbase manager here i have it and you
03:42 - need to start the server here
03:44 - okay
03:46 - and then i'm going to close this error
03:49 - and if i try to connect to my database
03:50 - again
03:51 - now you should see this little green
03:54 - check mark and that means that you
03:55 - successfully connected to your database
03:58 - so after we have done this let's create
04:00 - the table where we are going to store
04:02 - our students so
04:04 - let's write an sql query so you can
04:07 - click here on this little sql icon and
04:11 - it is going to open a window like this
04:13 - one where you can write sql queries
04:16 - okay so here we are going to write sql
04:18 - code in order to create students table
04:21 - so i'm going to paste the query and i'm
04:24 - also going to leave it in the
04:25 - description so that you can copy it and
04:27 - paste it in your program and then if you
04:29 - want a separate sql course let me know
04:32 - in the comments give this video a thumbs
04:34 - up so that i know and i'm going to
04:36 - create a separate entire course related
04:38 - to sql only so here is our sql code to
04:42 - create a student's table so you say
04:45 - create table and then you put the name
04:47 - for your table which is students and
04:50 - then inside these parentheses
04:53 - like this you put all of the attributes
04:55 - and at the end you need to put this
04:57 - semicolon sign
04:58 - so
04:59 - these are the attributes of students so
05:02 - here you can see that every student has
05:04 - id
05:05 - name grade age and then here is
05:07 - something called primary key so let's
05:10 - explain these very quickly so name is of
05:13 - type var chart 30. this means that name
05:16 - is a string that has 30 characters that
05:19 - is max limit
05:21 - and then you can put here 50 or 80 or
05:22 - 100 if you need more characters and then
05:25 - this name should not be null okay and
05:29 - then grade is of typed integer and it
05:32 - also must not be null ages of type in
05:35 - and also it should not be null and then
05:38 - this id here it is also of type int it
05:41 - will not be null and it is also
05:44 - specified as primary key now what this
05:47 - part here means is that id is going to
05:49 - be a unique way to identify every single
05:52 - student so there cannot be two students
05:55 - that have the same id and we are going
05:58 - to use that id
06:00 - as a primary key for every student okay
06:04 - so here is sqlcode in order to create
06:07 - students table and i will leave this
06:09 - code in the description of the video or
06:12 - i will pin it in the comments so that
06:14 - you can use it and please make sure that
06:17 - you type everything correctly because
06:19 - the code that you write here sql code
06:21 - the errors that you make are much harder
06:23 - to fix and find than the errors in c
06:26 - plus plus code or any other programming
06:28 - language
06:29 - especially if you are a beginner
06:32 - okay um another very important thing is
06:34 - that sql language is not case sensitive
06:37 - which means that you can also say here
06:40 - create with capital letters it is going
06:42 - to work the same but please make sure to
06:44 - pick either lowercase or uppercase and
06:47 - then be consistent with that so i'm
06:49 - going to use lowercase i will say
06:51 - create
06:53 - with lowercase letters like this so how
06:56 - can i execute this query well you select
06:58 - the query that you want to execute and
07:00 - then you click on this thunder icon
07:03 - which says execute query or you press f5
07:06 - on your keyboard and this query has been
07:09 - executed now we should see this table
07:12 - created here on these tables and views
07:14 - but it didn't appear i don't know why
07:16 - it's that
07:17 - but in order to refresh it i'm just
07:19 - going to close this very quickly and
07:21 - then i'm going to open it
07:23 - again
07:24 - and it is refreshed and here is our
07:26 - students table and all the fields that
07:28 - we created now there is probably more
07:31 - sophisticated way in order to fix this
07:33 - refreshing problem
07:35 - but if you're lazy like me just close it
07:37 - and open it again okay
07:40 - so the next step is to add a few records
07:43 - into our students table so let's do that
07:46 - let's say
07:47 - insert
07:48 - into
07:49 - students
07:52 - and then here i'm going to specify all
07:55 - the fields of students table so id
07:59 - name
08:00 - grade and age
08:02 - and then here i will specify the values
08:08 - okay so
08:09 - id is going to be one and then name i'm
08:12 - going to put it inside quotation marks
08:14 - single quotation marks because it is a
08:16 - string so let's say that the name will
08:19 - be
08:20 - salvina
08:22 - okay that's my name and then grade will
08:25 - be 9.5 that was my grade actually
08:29 - after finishing university and then age
08:30 - is 27.
08:32 - okay so in order to execute this query
08:35 - again i'm going to select it and i'll
08:36 - press f5 on my keyboard and here we get
08:40 - an error now a 10 attempt that updates
08:43 - during read-only transaction now if you
08:45 - get an error like this one let me show
08:46 - you how you can fix it so click here on
08:49 - transactions and then options and here
08:52 - you need to set right as access mode and
08:55 - click ok
08:57 - and
08:58 - okay here as well so if i try to execute
09:01 - this insert command again now we should
09:04 - get a message like this one okay and in
09:07 - order to commit this that transaction
09:09 - that we just made
09:10 - go to
09:12 - transactions and commit or press f9 on
09:15 - your keyboard okay great so with this we
09:18 - have successfully added one record into
09:21 - our students database so let's check
09:23 - that let's say
09:24 - select
09:26 - all from
09:28 - students
09:30 - okay and let's execute this
09:33 - command here and here we get every
09:36 - record from our students database and
09:38 - you can as you can see we have only one
09:41 - for now okay and here is the grade 10.
09:44 - now why is that the case let me know in
09:46 - the comments please before you listen to
09:48 - my answer so why do we have a grade of
09:50 - 10 here and here we have specified 9.5
09:54 - so the answer is because we said that
09:57 - grade is going to be of type in so it is
10:00 - rounding this float type 9.5 to an
10:04 - integer number which is 10 in this
10:05 - situation so that is the reason okay now
10:09 - let's add another student let's say here
10:11 - for example
10:13 - elon
10:14 - musk
10:16 - okay and i'm going to put
10:18 - eight and then he is i believe around 50
10:22 - years old okay
10:23 - so let's execute this press f5
10:27 - okay and now we get an error very
10:29 - important error which says violation of
10:31 - primary or unique key constraint on
10:34 - table students now this error here means
10:36 - that we are trying to add a record into
10:38 - our students table that has the same
10:41 - primary key that already exists inside
10:44 - our students table so that is because if
10:47 - i select everything from students you
10:49 - can see that this id of one already
10:52 - exists for student salvina norak so in
10:55 - this situation we need to change the id
10:57 - as well for the second student so
11:00 - i'm going to change it to two and now
11:02 - i'm going to execute the query again
11:04 - and now if i oh first i need to commit
11:07 - the transaction
11:09 - okay and then
11:11 - i need to select everything from
11:13 - students and as you can see here we have
11:15 - the second record so that is how you can
11:18 - insert data into the database and read
11:20 - from the database using the ib console
11:23 - and now we are going to create c plus
11:25 - application and connect to this database
11:28 - in order to read and write the data from
11:31 - our c plus app so here i have opened c
11:35 - plus builder so let's create a new
11:37 - multi-device application with c plus
11:39 - plus it's going to be blank application
11:42 - click ok
11:43 - and now it is creating our project
11:46 - let's wait a couple of seconds
11:50 - so here is our blank application now
11:52 - before we start building this uh c plus
11:55 - app and connecting it to database there
11:57 - are some prerequisites some basic
11:59 - knowledge that you need to have in order
12:01 - to be able to connect a c plus plus app
12:04 - with a database so let's look at these
12:07 - tabs here so projects data explorer and
12:09 - then multi-device preview i want to
12:12 - focus on this second data explorer at
12:14 - least for now so i'm going to open it
12:17 - and if you look inside you will notice
12:19 - that here we have fire deck and db
12:22 - express so what i want to talk about is
12:25 - this fire deck part so what is fire dac
12:29 - it is a data access helper so it
12:32 - contains many different tools that are
12:35 - going to help us to connect to our
12:36 - database and to read the data write the
12:39 - data execute queries and things like
12:41 - that so
12:42 - if i open this fire dac you will notice
12:45 - that here we have many different
12:47 - databases and the one that i'm going to
12:50 - use is called interbase it is here so if
12:54 - i open interbase here you get something
12:57 - called employee now before you do
12:59 - anything please don't delete this
13:02 - because we are going to need it so this
13:04 - employee here this is actually a
13:07 - connection to our database so we are
13:09 - going to use this in order to connect to
13:12 - our database so how can you connect to
13:15 - the database that we just created so
13:17 - right click on this employee and click
13:20 - on modify
13:22 - okay
13:22 - and here you need to select the database
13:26 - okay and i'm going to select this one
13:29 - university db that we just created a
13:32 - couple of minutes ago and click
13:34 - open okay here is your username password
13:37 - protocol is tcp ip i'm going to change
13:40 - it to local because that is the default
13:43 - one okay
13:44 - and everything else i'm going to leave
13:46 - it as already is so i'm going to click
13:49 - on ok
13:50 - and now you should be able to connect to
13:53 - your employee database but if you're
13:56 - experiencing a problem and if you're not
13:58 - able to see the tables from your
14:00 - database one thing that i'm going to
14:02 - give you as a tip is to right click on
14:05 - your employee again click on modify and
14:07 - then here for server you are going to
14:10 - put the text that i'm going to put on
14:12 - the screen here so put
14:14 - localhost backslash gds underscore db if
14:18 - it is not working without this please
14:20 - try this um quick fix i'm going to
14:23 - delete it because for me it is working
14:24 - without it
14:26 - and click ok
14:27 - and now you should be able to see your
14:30 - student table that you created for this
14:32 - database also please make sure that your
14:34 - interface server is running so open your
14:37 - interface manager and make sure that
14:39 - your server is not stopped that is an
14:42 - important part as well so with that we
14:44 - have successfully connected to our
14:46 - database and now we can start working
14:49 - with the data inside this students table
14:52 - that we created now this part is going
14:54 - to be very easy that is why i love c
14:57 - plus builder so much
14:59 - so
15:00 - just drag and drop your connection this
15:02 - employee connection to your application
15:06 - and then go on this object inspector so
15:08 - select your connection go on object
15:10 - inspector and click connected to true
15:13 - okay so you need to
15:15 - set your connected state to true that is
15:18 - going to be the first step and then the
15:20 - second step is you need to drag and drop
15:22 - the table that you want to work with we
15:24 - have only one table for now that is our
15:26 - students table so i'm going to drop it
15:28 - on my application here and i also need
15:32 - to change its
15:33 - active state to true
15:36 - and then let's see how we are going to
15:38 - show the data from this students table
15:40 - so i'm going to use a grid i will say
15:43 - the string grid okay and i will just
15:47 - drag and drop this control to my
15:49 - application
15:50 - and just make it a little bit bigger
15:53 - here
15:54 - okay so how can you connect this grid in
15:57 - order to show the data from your
15:59 - students table it's actually very easy
16:01 - so right click on this grid and click on
16:05 - this bind visually and here you should
16:08 - see this live bindings designer so here
16:10 - is your students table and here is your
16:13 - string grid and in order to bind these
16:16 - two you just need to do this okay it's
16:19 - actually very easy and immediately you
16:22 - get this live binding preview of the
16:24 - data from your student table as you can
16:27 - see here and if i run my application
16:31 - let's see
16:32 - i should be able to see the data from
16:35 - my table
16:37 - was it taking so long okay so here is
16:40 - the table and here is the data from that
16:43 - table salina elon musk okay
16:47 - now another thing that i promised to
16:48 - show you is how you can add new data
16:50 - delete existing data or edit it through
16:53 - your c plus application so in order to
16:56 - do that there is another command that is
16:59 - used for that it's called navigator so
17:01 - i'm going to look for it here
17:04 - okay it's t-bind navigator i am going to
17:08 - put it here and just make it a little
17:11 - bit bigger like this
17:14 - um
17:15 - okay
17:16 - and how am i going to connect this
17:18 - navigator so that it knows that it
17:20 - should work with this with this students
17:23 - table well again you need to right click
17:26 - on your navigator and click oh where is
17:28 - it so right click on it and click on
17:30 - bind visually and you will get a window
17:33 - like this one and again
17:35 - just drag and drop
17:37 - this here like this and all done so if i
17:41 - start the program now let's see what's
17:43 - going to
17:44 - happen why is it taking so long
17:47 - okay so here is my application and then
17:50 - if i want to add a new record click on
17:53 - this plus symbol and then put here
17:56 - three
17:57 - and then let's say
17:59 - bill
18:00 - gates and then great is going to be six
18:04 - i've heard that he wasn't such a great
18:05 - student at university so let's give him
18:08 - a six okay and then i think that he's
18:11 - around 60 years old and in order to
18:13 - confirm this transaction click on this
18:15 - check mark here and that is it
18:18 - so if i close this application and then
18:21 - open it again as you can see we have
18:24 - three students selena elon and bill
18:27 - gates so we have permanently saved our
18:30 - data to our database so it doesn't
18:31 - matter if you close your application
18:33 - turn off your pc this data is going to
18:35 - be saved into your database and then if
18:38 - you want to delete a record let's delete
18:40 - bill gates he was a college dropout
18:42 - after all so let's delete him delete
18:45 - record ok
18:46 - and then if i close the application
18:48 - start it again
18:50 - as you can see again we have only two
18:53 - students and then if you want to change
18:55 - something just
18:57 - click on the field that you want to
18:58 - change let's say elon musk
19:01 - okay and then commit this transaction
19:04 - like this and this should be stored in
19:07 - the database so let's check it through
19:09 - the database let's open our ib console
19:12 - and then if i say select all from
19:14 - students and press f5 as you can see now
19:17 - we have elon musk
19:20 - okay
19:21 - so i believe that is enough for this
19:23 - video i will leave all the links and the
19:25 - code from this video in the description
19:27 - or i will pin it in the comment make
19:29 - sure to check both and i will also link
19:32 - some additional resources like books and
19:34 - courses that i like in case that you
19:36 - want to learn more so if you enjoyed
19:38 - this video and if you want more videos
19:40 - like this one make sure to give this
19:41 - video a thumbs up so that i know uh or
19:44 - let me know in the comments if you want
19:46 - an sql dedicated course so an entire
19:49 - course dedicated only to sql so thank
19:52 - you very much for watching and i will
19:54 - see you in some other video bye
