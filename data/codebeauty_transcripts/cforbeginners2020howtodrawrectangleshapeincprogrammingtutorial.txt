00:01 - hi everyone what hi everyone welcome to
00:09 - my channel welcome tragic
00:12 - [Music]
00:18 - [Music]
00:31 - hi everyone welcome to my channel
00:34 - welcome to another video of C++ for
00:36 - beginners in this video I want to show
00:38 - you how you can draw shapes using C++ so
00:41 - before we start make sure to subscribe
00:43 - to my channel and also hit that Bell
00:45 - icon as well so that you are notified
00:47 - when I publish my next video and let me
00:51 - show you now what we are going to do in
00:53 - this video so here where is it
00:57 - here I have image of the task that we
01:00 - are going to do today and that is going
01:03 - to be really to draw this rectangle
01:05 - shape with the desired height and width
01:09 - and a symbol that our user enters okay
01:13 - so that is the task that we are going to
01:15 - do in this video and let's very quickly
01:18 - analyze this problem and see how we are
01:21 - going to solve it so the first thing
01:23 - that we need is for our user to enter
01:25 - height width and that symbol and after
01:30 - dot we will really need to figure out a
01:32 - way so figure out the algorithm on how
01:35 - we are going to draw this rectangle
01:38 - shape here so if you look at this
01:40 - rectangle shape you can really notice
01:42 - that it has the height that is going to
01:46 - be three of these symbols that our user
01:48 - has entered and that it has the width
01:51 - that is going to take four of these
01:53 - symbols that our user has entered for
01:55 - width okay so we are going to use nested
02:00 - for loop in order to solve this problem
02:02 - here and if you're not familiar with
02:04 - nested for loop I am going to link that
02:07 - video here because I have already made
02:08 - one video with nested for-loops so make
02:11 - sure to watch that video and in this
02:14 - video I am going to really use that
02:17 - nested for loop in order to control
02:19 - height and width of our rectangle shape
02:23 - so we are going to have outer for loop
02:26 - which is going to really control this
02:28 - height and then for each iteration of
02:32 - our outer for loop we are
02:34 - really going to control this wit with
02:38 - another loop and we are going to count
02:40 - from 1 up to 4 because 4 is the width
02:45 - that our user has entered and throw that
02:47 - shape in each iteration of our inner for
02:51 - loop ok so that is what we are going to
02:54 - do so let's now translate that into code
02:57 - I'm going to say here first thing that
03:00 - we need is going to be from our user to
03:02 - enter width and height so I'm going to
03:04 - declare two variables the first one is
03:07 - going to be height like this and then
03:11 - with okay so let's write out a message
03:17 - to our user so that he knows that he
03:19 - should enter height okay now let's
03:25 - accept that height value in our height
03:29 - variable and after that let's really
03:32 - copy this and do the same thing for our
03:34 - width like this and accept that value in
03:40 - our width variable so that is the first
03:43 - step the second step is going to be to
03:45 - declare another variable which is going
03:47 - to hold the symbol that our user wants
03:49 - to use for drawing that shape so I'm
03:52 - going to declare a variable of type char
03:54 - and I'm going to call it symbol like
03:58 - this and let's write out a message to
04:01 - the user so that he knows that he should
04:03 - enter that symbol like this and let's
04:08 - say C in symbol so after we have
04:15 - acquired all the necessary inputs from
04:17 - our user which are height width and
04:20 - symbol that we are going to use to draw
04:23 - our shape now we are left to write the
04:26 - algorithm that is going to draw that
04:28 - rectangle shape so as I already said for
04:31 - that we are going to use nested for loop
04:34 - so I am going to setup my outer loop the
04:38 - first loop and I'm going to say for and
04:41 - then I'm going to declare the counter
04:43 - which is going to count the iterations
04:45 - of my outer loop since
04:48 - that outer loop is going to control the
04:50 - height of our rectangle I'm going to say
04:52 - int age so I'm going to give the age
04:56 - name to our outer counter and I'm going
04:59 - to set its initial value to zero like
05:02 - this and then we are going to put the
05:04 - condition how long our outer loop is
05:07 - going to run it so while our age is less
05:11 - than height that our user has entered
05:14 - like this and then after each iteration
05:17 - of my outer loop we have to increment
05:20 - the value of our age counter so that
05:24 - would be the setup of our outer loop and
05:27 - let's now set up our inner loop so I'm
05:30 - going to write for and for this inner
05:34 - loop I'm going to declare another
05:35 - counter which I'm going to call W like
05:39 - this because this inner loop is going to
05:41 - control the width of rectangle shape so
05:44 - I'm going to set its initial value to
05:46 - zero as well and then I'm going to say
05:49 - that it is going to run while this w is
05:52 - less than what that our user has entered
05:57 - like this and also after each iteration
06:00 - we really need to increment the value of
06:03 - this W okay so what we are going to do
06:08 - in this loop so in this inner loop if
06:12 - you look at this image here where is it
06:14 - okay here you can really notice that in
06:19 - each iteration of our inner loop it just
06:22 - draws this symbol that our user has
06:24 - entered so I am going to very quickly
06:27 - just see out so right that symbol out
06:30 - I'm going say C out and then write out
06:33 - that symbol like this and there is
06:37 - really one more thing that we need to
06:38 - put and there is going to be after this
06:41 - for loop so this outer for loop finishes
06:44 - single iteration we really need to put
06:47 - something else at the end so here at the
06:50 - end of our outer for loop and let's look
06:53 - at our image so as you can see here
06:55 - after each iteration of our outer for
06:59 - loop because it is controlling high
07:01 - and it is really iterating through this
07:04 - inner for loop in each iteration of our
07:07 - outer for loop at the end of that
07:10 - iteration of outer for loop we really
07:12 - need to put empty space so here I need
07:16 - to put empty space and that corresponds
07:19 - to this line here so here I'm going to
07:23 - write out C out and line like this and
07:28 - now if I run my program we should really
07:32 - expect to see the shape that rectangle
07:36 - shape off dimensions that our user
07:38 - defines so let's say for height four and
07:41 - then for width let's say for example six
07:43 - and the symbol that we want to use to
07:46 - draw that shape let's say that that is
07:47 - going to be this plus symbol okay so as
07:52 - you can see our rectangle has the height
07:55 - of four and then it has the width of two
08:00 - four six so it has the width of six of
08:02 - these symbols that our user has entered
08:04 - okay so there is one more thing that I
08:07 - notice here and that is going to be
08:09 - really to format this shape to be a bit
08:14 - more pretty so for that we are going to
08:17 - use the library which is called IO manop
08:21 - so I am going to include that library
08:24 - here I have to say include IO map like
08:31 - this and this library here really
08:34 - contains a function that is that is
08:37 - called set W which means set width which
08:41 - is really going to set the width of the
08:43 - field that comes after it so I'm going
08:46 - to put here that function I'm going to
08:49 - say I'm going to put these redirection
08:52 - signs here and then in this space here
08:55 - I'm going to write out set V so set W
08:59 - actually and then here I want to put
09:02 - what is the width of the field that
09:05 - comes after this function so what is
09:07 - going to be the width of our symbol
09:09 - field and let's use three for a dot for
09:12 - example so if I run mine
09:15 - again but let me stop it first and if I
09:18 - run it again oh no I haven't stopped my
09:23 - program so I'm going to close it okay
09:26 - and now if I run my program you can see
09:29 - that it asks height and width I guess so
09:32 - previously we have entered four and six
09:34 - and then for the symbol let's enter plus
09:37 - again and now as you can see our shape
09:41 - looks much nicer because of this set
09:44 - width function because it has really
09:46 - assigned to each symbol to each
09:49 - character that our user has entered the
09:51 - width of three fields okay so let's run
09:56 - our program one more time and let's say
09:59 - that that height is going to be 5 and
10:02 - which is going to be 7 and let's enter
10:05 - another shape so let's say for example -
10:07 - and as you can see it has written out
10:10 - the shape so the rectangle shape of
10:13 - these dimensions that our user has
10:15 - entered and it has used this symbol that
10:18 - our user also has entered so I hope that
