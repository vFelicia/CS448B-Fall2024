00:00 - hi everyone welcome to my channel my
00:02 - name is saldina and i make i.t and
00:05 - programming related videos so if that is
00:08 - something that is of interest to you
00:10 - then consider subscribing to my channel
00:12 - and give this video a thumbs up as well
00:15 - and in this particular video i want to
00:17 - answer a question that i see very often
00:20 - in my messages and that is what kind of
00:22 - pc am i using for editing my videos and
00:25 - then for gaming as well because i like
00:27 - to play games sometimes when i have free
00:30 - time
00:30 - so this is going to be a budget pc which
00:33 - means that it is going to be under a
00:35 - thousand dollars and since i ordered it
00:39 - the prices of the components went down
00:41 - even more so
00:42 - you may as well get it at the better
00:44 - price than i did and it is a very good
00:47 - pc
00:48 - now i didn't want to buy a pre-built
00:50 - stuff because i knew exactly what i
00:53 - wanted and i made a custom configuration
00:56 - for myself and my needs were a pc that
00:59 - can edit and render in 4k and for
01:02 - everything to run very very smoothly and
01:04 - then i needed it for gaming and for
01:07 - development as well now i often have a
01:10 - lot of software running on my pc i have
01:13 - often a database server and then apis
01:16 - and then front-end application clients
01:18 - so um i really needed a good pc but my
01:21 - main requirements were for editing and
01:24 - then for gaming as well
01:26 - so if you are looking for a editing pc i
01:29 - would say that two most important things
01:32 - to invest your money are going to be cpu
01:35 - and then ram memory
01:37 - and when it comes to cpu it is better to
01:39 - look for something that has more cores
01:42 - rather than faster individual cores and
01:45 - the cpu that i got is a
01:47 - amd ryzen
01:49 - 5 3600 it is a 6 core 12 threaded
01:53 - processor with base speed of 3.6
01:56 - gigahertz and it is really a very good
02:00 - cpu now i know that there is this very
02:03 - often asked question of what is better
02:06 - what should you get intel or amd
02:09 - and i think that if you go with intel
02:13 - you will probably have to invest more
02:14 - money in your cpu and
02:17 - i honestly did not see the need to do
02:19 - that because the cpu here is really a
02:23 - beast it is really a good cpu so i would
02:25 - definitely recommend this
02:28 - next very important thing is your ram
02:30 - and i wouldn't go with less than 16
02:33 - gigabytes of ddr4 ram and if you plan to
02:36 - edit in 4k then you will probably
02:38 - benefit
02:40 - from even more ram than 16 gigabytes
02:42 - probably 32 gigabytes and i got for
02:45 - myself hyperx fury ddr4 3200 and i
02:50 - wouldn't recommend going with memory
02:52 - that is slower than 3200 because amd
02:54 - processors perform better with faster
02:57 - memory another important thing is going
02:59 - to be your ssd so i went with one
03:02 - terabyte of kingston a 2000 nvme
03:06 - and that should be enough and it is
03:08 - really important to invest in a ssd
03:11 - especially if you plan to edit in 4k
03:14 - if you are building editing pc
03:16 - exclusively then you do not need to
03:19 - invest a lot of money in your gpu
03:22 - because most of editing softwares
03:24 - actually rely on your cpu rather than on
03:26 - your gpu unless you are planning to use
03:29 - something like davinci resolve or you
03:32 - are building actually a gaming pc
03:35 - and in my particular situation i'm
03:38 - actually using a software that is very
03:40 - heavy on the cpu rather than on gpu it
03:43 - is called shortcut and it is a simple
03:47 - free editing software
03:49 - and when i'm editing actually my gpu is
03:52 - like
03:52 - used two percent it is actually sleeping
03:55 - 99 of the time so i wouldn't really need
03:58 - a good gpu for editing but since i want
04:01 - to use this pc for gaming as well i got
04:04 - myself a good gpu and it is this one
04:09 - here
04:09 - so
04:11 - it is a gigabyte geforce gtx 1660 ti and
04:16 - it is a very good graphical processing
04:19 - unit but again if you do not plan to use
04:23 - this pc for gaming and then you do not
04:25 - plan to use something like davinci
04:27 - resolve i would rather invest my money
04:29 - in a good processor and then ram memory
04:32 - and storage and things like that rather
04:34 - than wasting money on a gpu
04:37 - now one thing that you may or may not
04:39 - want to invest your money in is a liquid
04:42 - cooler and i really wanted to get that
04:44 - for myself because when i'm playing
04:46 - games when i'm editing i do not really
04:48 - want my cpu to overheat
04:51 - so i got this liquid cooler here
04:55 - it is a
04:56 - lca i hope that is how it is pronounced
04:59 - and it is a liquid cooler and one thing
05:01 - that was very important for me is that
05:04 - it is a low noise design
05:08 - and then it has a very nice rgb on it so
05:11 - my pc kind of looks like a disco ball um
05:15 - and i would like to film that with my
05:17 - phone's camera but it is not really that
05:19 - good but i have a couple of pictures of
05:21 - my pc that i have taken with a
05:23 - professional camera and i'm going to
05:26 - include those here so that you can see
05:28 - how nice it really looks and then the
05:30 - casing just make sure to get something
05:32 - that has enough space and helps with
05:34 - airflow and helps with cable management
05:37 - as well now depending on how much money
05:39 - you want to invest you can go with rgb
05:42 - lighting case tempered glass side panel
05:45 - or you can look for something more
05:46 - affordable it is going to be really up
05:49 - to you
05:50 - now you've probably seen some images of
05:52 - my pc here because as i said i cannot
05:55 - film that with my phone's camera because
05:58 - it is not that good but if there is a
06:00 - company that wants to sponsor me with a
06:02 - good camera you can send me an email or
06:05 - dm me on instagram on twitter i'm going
06:08 - to leave the links to my social media in
06:10 - the description of this video
06:12 - now once i've selected all of the
06:14 - components i looked for a motherboard
06:16 - that is compatible with them and i would
06:18 - recommend using
06:21 - pcpartpicker.com to check the
06:22 - compatibility of your components
06:25 - and for myself i got a amd motherboard
06:28 - it is this one here
06:30 - it is msi
06:33 - x 570 gaming edge and i needed it to be
06:38 - wi-fi but if you don't it is probably
06:40 - going to be cheaper that way
06:42 - so it is a very good motherboard uh let
06:46 - me put this somewhere
06:48 - and then the last but not the least is
06:51 - going to be your power supply unit
06:53 - now in the past i had problems where my
06:56 - pc would just shut down or actually it
06:58 - would restart while i was rendering so
07:01 - that was because it didn't have enough
07:03 - power i don't have those types of
07:05 - problems anymore and currently i'm using
07:08 - a power supply unit which is this one
07:11 - here it is 80 plus gold standard fully
07:15 - modular power supply unit and it is a
07:18 - 750 watt now i believe that for my
07:21 - configuration it should be enough
07:24 - to use a 650 watt but just to be sure
07:27 - because of the problems that i had i
07:29 - went with 750 watt psu
07:33 - so i hope that you enjoyed this video
07:35 - and that you have gotten some
07:36 - interesting information and that you
07:38 - have gotten an idea of what kind of pc
07:41 - to look for if you are building a gaming
07:44 - or editing pc and if you did make sure
07:46 - to give this video a like and then
07:48 - subscribe to my channel as well and
07:51 - thank you for watching i'm going to see
07:52 - you in my next video bye
