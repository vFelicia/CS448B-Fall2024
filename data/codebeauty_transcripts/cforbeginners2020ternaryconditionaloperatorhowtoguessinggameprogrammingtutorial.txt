00:00 - hi everyone welcome to my channel
00:01 - welcome to another video of C++ for
00:04 - beginners in this video I wanted to
00:06 - explain the concept of ternary operator
00:08 - also known as conditional operator and
00:11 - also some people call it shorter version
00:13 - of FL statement it is an important
00:16 - concept that you are definitely going to
00:19 - come across in your programming career
00:21 - and you should understand it and I'm
00:23 - going to explain this concept through
00:25 - building fun and simple program that is
00:27 - going to be a guessing game so let's
00:29 - explain the rules of this game we need
00:32 - to have two users and our first user
00:34 - which I'm going to call host user has to
00:38 - enter a number after that we have to
00:40 - delete that number from our console so
00:43 - that our second user cannot see it and
00:45 - then after that our second user which
00:48 - I'm going to call guest user has to
00:51 - enter his guests so that he can guess
00:54 - what number our first user has entered
00:57 - so this way we can really make a fun
01:00 - program and learn an important concept
01:02 - at the same time and at the end of this
01:04 - video I'm going to give you an idea or
01:06 - multiple ideas how you can really
01:08 - upgrade this program on your own so make
01:11 - sure to watch the entire video now that
01:14 - we have explained the rules of this game
01:16 - let's start building our program and the
01:18 - first thing that we need to do is create
01:20 - two variables since we said that our
01:22 - user is going to be guessing numbers
01:24 - those two variables are going to be
01:27 - definitely a number type and let's say
01:29 - that that type is going to be integer so
01:32 - integer numbers and we need two
01:35 - variables the first one is going told
01:37 - our first user number so our host user
01:40 - number and that our second variable is
01:43 - going to hold the number that our guest
01:45 - user enters so let's call those two cost
01:48 - user number like this and then the
01:53 - second one let's call guest user number
01:59 - like this okay and now after we have
02:04 - created these two variables the next
02:07 - thing that we need to do is let's write
02:08 - out a message to our host user so that
02:11 - he knows that he should
02:12 - a number so let's see see out and let's
02:15 - just say first like this so that our
02:20 - Haas user really knows that he should
02:22 - enter a number and I'm going to accept
02:26 - that number in my console using the C in
02:29 - command and I'm going to start at number
02:32 - inside our host user number variable so
02:36 - with this line here we have entered our
02:38 - host user number and what we have said
02:41 - at the beginning of this video is that
02:42 - after our host user enters the number we
02:45 - really need to delete that number from
02:47 - our console so that our second user is
02:49 - not able to see it and the command that
02:52 - I'm going to use for that is going to be
02:54 - this command here so I'm going to say
02:56 - system and then I'm going to say CLS
03:00 - which is which is really going to clear
03:03 - our console so clear our screen and now
03:06 - if I run my program let's see how far we
03:09 - have made made this program here we have
03:13 - this line this seventh line which says
03:16 - host user and it expects our host user
03:19 - to enter a number so I'm going to say
03:21 - for example 7 and then after I press
03:23 - ENTER this number here really is deleted
03:27 - so our console has been cleared and now
03:30 - after this we need to ask our guest user
03:33 - to guess the number that our host user
03:35 - has entered so I'm going to stop the
03:38 - program and next we need to write out a
03:42 - message to our guest user so I'm going
03:45 - to say guests like this and after that
03:51 - we need to accept what our guest user
03:54 - enters inside our guest user variable so
03:57 - I'm going to copy this line here like
03:59 - this and instead of accepting that value
04:03 - inside host user number I'm just going
04:05 - to change this to guest user number and
04:09 - after this part here we really have both
04:13 - accepted our host user number and our
04:15 - guest user number and now we need to
04:17 - compare these two and see whether our
04:19 - guest user has guessed correctly our
04:22 - host user's number
04:24 - so how we can do that if you are
04:27 - familiar with if-else statements and I'm
04:30 - going to link that video here and if you
04:33 - are familiar with them
04:34 - that is really one way to solve this
04:36 - problem so you can solve this problem
04:39 - with FL statement and I'm going to do
04:41 - that and then we are going to really
04:43 - convert that if our statement inside
04:45 - into a ternary operator so how we can
04:50 - solve this with if-else statements well
04:52 - it is quite simple solution so we have
04:54 - to say if and then inside these
04:56 - parentheses I'm going to really compare
04:58 - these two numbers so host user number
05:00 - and guest user number so I'm going to
05:03 - say cost user number is equal to guest
05:08 - user number like this and then if this
05:12 - here results is true so if these two is
05:15 - if these two numbers are the same we can
05:18 - write out a message to our user and that
05:21 - message is going to be let's say correct
05:26 - like this so our user has guessed
05:30 - correctly but in a situation where this
05:33 - here results as false we can use our
05:36 - else statement and in this else
05:39 - situation let's write out a different
05:41 - message to our user so let's say C out
05:44 - and then inside is these quotation marks
05:47 - let's say failed like this so that in
05:51 - the case where these two are the same
05:53 - number we can write out our user that he
05:56 - has guessed correctly and then in a
05:58 - situation where these two are not the
06:00 - same we can write out to our user that
06:02 - he has failed in guessing so if I run my
06:05 - program now you see that it expects our
06:09 - host user to enter a number and I'm
06:12 - going in this situation to take the role
06:14 - of both host and guest user so I'm going
06:17 - to enter 7 for example and then you see
06:21 - that that 7 number has been deleted from
06:23 - our console because of this command here
06:25 - and now our program expects our guest
06:28 - user to enter his number and I even
06:31 - forgot what number I entered so let's
06:34 - say that our
06:35 - Hoss user has entered for example 11 and
06:39 - you see that our program says you have
06:42 - failed so you haven't guessed correctly
06:44 - and one more time let's enter for our
06:48 - host user number 5 for example and then
06:51 - let's say that our guest user also says
06:54 - number 5 and our program says you have
06:57 - guessed correctly so this is one
07:01 - potential solution for this problem but
07:03 - I wanted to show you how you can solve
07:05 - this problem using ternary operator and
07:07 - now I'm going to comment this code here
07:11 - like this so this is a comment for
07:15 - multiple lines of code and let's really
07:19 - translate this part of code here into a
07:23 - ternary operator like this okay so how
07:29 - does the ternary operator work well it
07:31 - is the only operator that takes three
07:34 - operands or works on tree or prawns and
07:37 - the first operand is going to be a
07:39 - condition so I'm going to copy this
07:42 - condition here which is is our host user
07:45 - number equal to our guest user number so
07:48 - that is going to be the first operand
07:50 - and after that first operand we need to
07:52 - put this question mark and then after
07:56 - this question mark we have the following
07:58 - behavior if this expression here so if
08:02 - this condition here is true we are going
08:04 - to execute one line of code or actually
08:09 - one part of code and that is going to be
08:11 - this line here but in the situation
08:15 - where this here results as false we are
08:18 - going to execute whatever we put after
08:20 - this column sign so that is going to be
08:24 - our C out failed like this and this is
08:31 - really the syntax for our ternary
08:34 - operator and as you can see it really is
08:36 - a shorter form of if-else statement
08:40 - so this line of code really means please
08:43 - check this condition here
08:45 - and if this condition here results as
08:48 - true execute this part of code here but
08:52 - if this code here results as false
08:55 - please execute whatever I put after my
08:58 - column sign so that is going to be our C
09:01 - out failed and now if I run the program
09:06 - it asks again for our host user to enter
09:09 - the number let's enter number nine for
09:12 - example and then our guest user has to
09:15 - guess the number so let's enter for
09:18 - example number three and you can see our
09:20 - program says to our guest user that he
09:23 - has failed in guessing so there are a
09:26 - couple of ways in which you can really
09:28 - upgrade this program and I'm going to
09:30 - give you a few ideas and the first one
09:32 - is for example you don't have to use int
09:35 - type here so you can use different data
09:37 - type data type you can guess characters
09:40 - or you can guess even strings if you
09:42 - know how to and if some of you want to
09:44 - play with that and try that on their own
09:46 - and you get it right
09:47 - make sure to paste that code and it
09:49 - comments down below and I'm going to
09:50 - check it and if you get it right I'm
09:52 - going to pin that comment episode that
09:53 - everyone else can see it so that would
09:56 - be one way of upgrading this program
09:58 - another way to upgrade this program is
10:00 - to make it easier to your guest user and
10:03 - how do I mean easier well you can really
10:05 - limit your host user to enter a number
10:08 - that is going to be in a certain
10:10 - interval for example you can see to your
10:12 - host user that he can enter only a
10:15 - number that is going to be between let's
10:17 - say 1 and 15 or 50 it depends on how
10:21 - difficult you want to make it to your
10:23 - guest user and that would be one way
10:25 - also of upgrading this program and
10:27 - another and the best way of upgrading
10:29 - this program is going to be when we
10:31 - learn loops and when we do that I'm
10:33 - going to link the video here and how you
10:36 - can upgrade this program using loops
10:38 - well you can give your guest user
10:40 - multiple attempts so you can say for
10:43 - example let my guest user guess three
10:46 - times or five times before I say game
10:48 - over you have failed
10:50 - okay so I hope that you have liked this
10:53 - video and if you did make sure to
10:55 - subscribe to my channel share it with
10:57 - your friends
10:57 - and with other people that would like to
10:59 - learn programming and I'm going to see
11:01 - you in my next video
11:02 - bye
