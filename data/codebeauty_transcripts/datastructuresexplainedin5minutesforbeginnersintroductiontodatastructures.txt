00:00 - hi everyone welcome to my channel my
00:02 - name is saldina i am a software engineer
00:04 - and i make programming related videos
00:07 - and in this video i want to talk about
00:08 - data structures
00:10 - this is going to be an introduction
00:12 - video so it's not really important if
00:14 - you are not already familiar with data
00:15 - structures if you never even heard of
00:17 - data structures because i am going to
00:20 - explain everything step by step and then
00:22 - in my following videos of this playlist
00:24 - we will see and focus on each individual
00:27 - data structure on its own so the first
00:30 - question that i want to answer is what
00:32 - are data structures well a data
00:35 - structure is just a collection of data
00:37 - so it is a collection of integers or
00:40 - characters or floats doubles or it can
00:43 - be some user defined type so classes
00:46 - and if you're not familiar with classes
00:48 - make sure to watch my object oriented
00:49 - programming course which i will link
00:51 - here and then in the description down
00:53 - below as well
00:55 - and it is a collection but
00:58 - it is an organized collection and it is
01:01 - organized in such way that it makes the
01:04 - process of working with that data
01:06 - accessing that data modifying it
01:08 - changing it it makes that process very
01:10 - fast and easy
01:12 - why do we need data structures we need
01:15 - them because without data structures our
01:17 - code would be much slower and then the
01:19 - process of working with our data would
01:22 - be much much harder so we organize that
01:24 - data into data structures and for this i
01:27 - want to give you an example that i am
01:29 - pretty sure every single one of you is
01:31 - going to understand so imagine the
01:33 - following situation
01:35 - you wake up in the morning and you are
01:37 - running late for work or for school so
01:39 - you need to get ready and you need to
01:41 - get dressed but you need to do that very
01:43 - very quickly so you look outside to
01:46 - check the weather or you check it on
01:48 - your smartphone
01:50 - and you realize that it is sunny outside
01:52 - so you decide that you will wear a
01:54 - t-shirt pants and then socks and shoes
01:58 - and you will probably wear some
01:59 - accessories things like a wallet a watch
02:02 - sunglasses things like that but then you
02:05 - realize that your clothes is not
02:08 - organized so here is your clothes now my
02:11 - question for you is how are you going to
02:14 - find those things that you need in this
02:16 - pile of clothes and how long will it
02:18 - take
02:20 - so this is a rhetorical question and
02:22 - rather than answering this question i
02:23 - want to give you an alternative instead
02:26 - so imagine if your clothes were well
02:28 - structured and organized wouldn't it be
02:31 - much easier to access the clothes that
02:33 - you need in this situation so again as
02:37 - we said you need great t-shirt blue
02:40 - jeans great shoes
02:42 - socks and then sunglasses watch and
02:44 - wallet
02:45 - and a jacket in case that the weather
02:47 - gets worse and you are ready literally
02:50 - in five minutes and yes you first need
02:52 - to invest some time to think about the
02:54 - best way to organize your clothes and
02:57 - maybe you need to learn a few tips and
02:59 - tricks on how to do that
03:00 - but later the process of you getting
03:02 - ready and accessing that close is much
03:05 - faster and this example is not just
03:07 - applicable to organizing your clothes
03:09 - because
03:10 - you probably have some other way that
03:12 - you use to organize your books for
03:14 - school and then there are ways to
03:17 - organize and structure streets in your
03:19 - town and then there is some other way to
03:21 - organize your posts your messages and
03:24 - photos on instagram and facebook and
03:26 - twitter and things like that and by the
03:29 - way you can follow me on instagram and
03:31 - twitter at at true code beauty salvina
03:33 - please put it here when editing
03:35 - so as i said you have different ways to
03:38 - organize different things in your real
03:40 - life and the same way in programming you
03:43 - would use a different data structure to
03:45 - organize data in different situations
03:48 - and some of the examples of those data
03:50 - structures that we will see in my
03:52 - following videos are an array a list a
03:55 - stack a queue a graph a hash table and
03:59 - so on and in my following videos i will
04:01 - dedicate that specific video to each
04:04 - individual data structure so that you
04:06 - can learn advantages and disadvantages
04:08 - of that data structure and then you will
04:10 - learn some rules and tips and when to
04:13 - use a specific data structure
04:15 - so if you enjoyed this video please give
04:17 - it a thumbs up for the youtube algorithm
04:20 - by the way we will be talking about
04:21 - algorithms on this channel as well
04:23 - because those are closely related to
04:25 - data structures
04:27 - so if you don't want to miss any video
04:29 - that i publish uh you can subscribe to
04:31 - my channel and uh press the bell icon
04:34 - because then you will be notified when i
04:35 - publish my next video if you don't no
04:38 - problem uh thank you very much for
04:40 - watching and i am going to see you in my
