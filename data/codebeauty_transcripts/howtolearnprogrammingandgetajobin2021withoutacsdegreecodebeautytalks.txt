00:00 - hi everyone welcome to my channel my
00:02 - name is saldina for those of you that
00:04 - don't know i am a software engineer and
00:06 - i make i.t and programming related
00:08 - videos here on youtube and as you can
00:11 - already see from the title in this video
00:13 - i want to talk about learning
00:15 - programming and getting a job without
00:17 - computer science degree now i believe
00:20 - that it is already a well-known fact
00:23 - that you don't need a degree in order to
00:25 - get a job in this industry and in order
00:27 - to become a programmer however going to
00:30 - university is the most common way that
00:32 - people choose in order to learn
00:34 - programming and enter this industry and
00:38 - it is as well the path that i have taken
00:40 - so i went to university as well
00:43 - but as i already said it is not because
00:45 - it is necessarily the best way or the
00:47 - only way it is just that i didn't know
00:49 - any better at the time so let me tell
00:52 - you a little story a few months ago i
00:54 - was talking with a friend who is also a
00:57 - software engineer but he works for a
00:59 - different company and that conversation
01:02 - went something like this he said that
01:04 - his team and him had a lot of unfinished
01:06 - work and that the deadlines were
01:09 - approaching so they had to finish that
01:12 - before the deadlines or else they are
01:14 - going to lose the client so he asked me
01:17 - if i wanted to join his team so he
01:19 - basically gave me a pretty good offer to
01:22 - change the company but considering that
01:24 - i have a job which i like and then at
01:26 - this point i had a youtube channel which
01:29 - i was fully committed and i still am i
01:32 - politely declined that offer so
01:35 - i said that i don't want to switch my
01:37 - job but i still was interested in what
01:40 - kind of people do they need so i asked
01:42 - and he said that they wanted someone who
01:45 - is a senior developer someone who has
01:47 - five plus years of experience and then
01:49 - he gave me technologies which his team
01:51 - uses
01:52 - and i would say that that is pretty
01:54 - standard situation most of the companies
01:56 - want to employ people who already have a
01:58 - lot of experience but
02:01 - considering that i had a youtube channel
02:03 - and that i know that a lot of you guys
02:05 - don't have that much experience
02:06 - i was interested if they would employ
02:09 - someone who does not have experience so
02:11 - uh were they interested in junior
02:12 - developers so i asked and he said
02:15 - absolutely not
02:17 - he said that uh junior developer would
02:19 - have a hard time to understand that
02:21 - project that that person would create
02:24 - additional bugs and they just don't have
02:26 - the time to teach someone right now so
02:29 - um that was pretty much the end of that
02:32 - story for that day but then we talked
02:34 - about it again a few weeks ago and i'm
02:37 - going to tell you how this story ends at
02:39 - the end of this video but that
02:41 - conversation that happened a few weeks
02:42 - ago was a trigger for me to make this
02:45 - video because i always ask my colleagues
02:48 - my friends other developers that i'm
02:50 - surrounded with in order to have their
02:52 - opinion as well about the topics that
02:54 - i'm talking about on my channel because
02:56 - i believe that by having multiple
02:58 - opinions and the experience of multiple
03:00 - people that gives additional value to
03:03 - the story that i'm telling you so before
03:05 - i continue with this story i just wanted
03:07 - to ask you guys for your opinion do you
03:10 - prefer these types of videos when i
03:12 - overlaid them with a gameplay like i'm
03:14 - doing in this video or you just prefer
03:16 - when i sit and talk to you about
03:18 - different topics i figured that it could
03:20 - be pretty boring for some of you uh to
03:23 - watch my static background so i decided
03:25 - to make something like this but again
03:27 - i'm very interested to hear your opinion
03:29 - so make sure to write me in the comments
03:31 - down below which one do you prefer um
03:34 - and then as well please don't be harsh
03:36 - in the comments if i get killed a
03:37 - million times i'm not a professional
03:39 - gamer if you want to watch that type of
03:41 - content uh you can find other channels
03:44 - i'm just trying to make this learning
03:46 - process for you a little bit easier
03:48 - where you can watch something fun and
03:49 - then learn in that process as well and
03:51 - listen to something informative so let's
03:54 - return to our story as i already said
03:56 - you don't need to have degree in order
03:58 - to get a job but you do need to have the
04:01 - knowledge so what is the best place for
04:03 - you to get that knowledge what is the
04:05 - best place to start learning i believe
04:07 - that you can already guess the answer to
04:08 - this question and that will be youtube
04:11 - courses udemy courses pluralsight
04:14 - stack overflow for any questions that
04:16 - you have and so on and then one thing
04:19 - that i would recommend is before you
04:20 - dive into details of a specific topic i
04:23 - would first watch some sort of a crash
04:25 - course or some type of video where you
04:27 - will get a bigger picture of that topic
04:30 - of that subject that you are trying to
04:32 - learn and then i would dive into those
04:34 - specific little details for example i
04:37 - have on traversing media i have one and
04:40 - a half hour long c plus plus crash
04:42 - course and then on my channel i have
04:44 - made uh many hours of videos where i
04:47 - explain each little detail of c plus
04:50 - language so i would first focus on
04:52 - watching that c plus plus crash course
04:54 - so i would watch that once and then i
04:56 - would dive into those specific details
04:59 - of c plus which i have on my channel now
05:01 - a common question is is there a need for
05:04 - paid boot camps i would say that it
05:06 - depends some of those boot camps are
05:08 - going to be free as well so i would say
05:11 - definitely use the opportunity to get
05:13 - all the free knowledge that you can but
05:15 - some will be very very expensive or you
05:18 - can even make some type of agreement
05:19 - where you don't pay anything upfront but
05:21 - they take a percentage of your salary
05:24 - later once you get a job
05:26 - so again is there a need for very
05:28 - expensive bootcamps i would say no
05:30 - especially if you have the opportunity
05:33 - to get that knowledge for free on
05:34 - youtube or to get it for just a couple
05:37 - of dollars on udemy and sites like that
05:40 - and then one thing that you can use as
05:41 - well and as far as i've seen many
05:44 - companies have something like this and
05:46 - that is some sort of a school or course
05:48 - which that company organizes and on that
05:51 - course they will teach you technologies
05:53 - which that company needs and those
05:56 - courses are usually free and almost
05:58 - anyone can join and then once you go
06:00 - through that course at the end you will
06:02 - have an exam and the people which have
06:04 - the best results will get the
06:06 - opportunity to get a job in that company
06:08 - so i would say do your research and find
06:11 - out if the company that you are
06:13 - interested in has some sort of a similar
06:15 - program
06:16 - now another tip that can be very useful
06:18 - for you is the following the companies
06:20 - usually have a few different types of
06:22 - tasks that they send you once you apply
06:25 - for a job and the goal of those tasks is
06:28 - to eliminate people that don't have
06:30 - enough knowledge now depending on the
06:32 - position that you are applying for you
06:34 - can get different types of tasks tasks
06:37 - but what usually happens is that they
06:39 - are going to send you one task that has
06:41 - multiple levels so for example the first
06:44 - level can be for you to implement a
06:47 - basic crud application so create read
06:49 - update and delete and all the data can
06:52 - be hard-coded on front-end for example
06:54 - so that would be the first level and
06:56 - then second level would be for you to
06:58 - move that data to api and to make both
07:01 - back end and front-end and to get that
07:03 - data from api so that would be second
07:05 - level for example and then third level
07:07 - considering that the previous level was
07:09 - making a pretty basic application that
07:11 - doesn't have any logic or almost any
07:13 - logic a third level can be for example
07:15 - for you to add some business logic to
07:18 - that application to be to make it a
07:19 - little bit more complex and then
07:22 - fourth level can be for example to
07:24 - implement authorization and something
07:26 - like this again this depends very much
07:28 - on the position that you are applying
07:30 - for now another important thing that is
07:32 - that once they send you that task they
07:35 - are going to give you deadline of course
07:37 - and uh one thing that you can use to
07:39 - your advantage is following a person who
07:42 - works in that company a person who works
07:44 - on the position that you are applying
07:46 - for can be very very helpful for you so
07:50 - uh that person should have a pretty good
07:52 - idea on the type of task that you are
07:54 - going to get either because that person
07:56 - got very similar
07:58 - or the same task or just by working in
08:00 - that company and talking with people uh
08:03 - that information is shared you know it's
08:05 - not a top level top secret level
08:08 - information so if you can't get in
08:09 - contact with someone who already works
08:11 - in that company that person can be very
08:14 - helpful that person can help you a lot
08:16 - and guide you through that process of
08:18 - getting a job in that specific company
08:20 - and then they can tell you what you
08:21 - should learn the most and when you what
08:23 - you should prepare so that once you get
08:25 - your task you are able to solve that
08:28 - task much quicker so before that
08:30 - deadline and it's the same way when you
08:32 - were in school for example and then one
08:34 - group of the class has an exam today and
08:36 - then another group will have that same
08:38 - exam tomorrow so you always ask your
08:41 - friends you ask people from that other
08:42 - group what kind of questions did you get
08:45 - was it hard what should i learn and
08:46 - prepare you know so some people will
08:49 - help you some people won't and it's the
08:51 - same way here but i believe that if you
08:53 - can get in contact with someone who
08:55 - works for that company and if you
08:57 - approach that person politely and if you
09:00 - ask for an advice i believe that most
09:02 - people will help you and that advice can
09:04 - be very very helpful and useful now
09:07 - since we are talking about getting a job
09:09 - without computer science degree a common
09:12 - question is how long one should learn
09:14 - before even applying for a job so how
09:17 - long you should learn before thinking
09:19 - that you have some sort of a meaningful
09:22 - knowledge let's put it like that so we
09:24 - all know that if you go to university
09:26 - that usually means three or four years
09:29 - before getting a bachelor's degree and
09:31 - then one or two more years for master's
09:34 - degree and then seven or eight years to
09:36 - complete a phd and so on so there is a
09:39 - plan but how long you should learn on
09:41 - your own if you don't go to university
09:44 - and i hate to say it but it depends it
09:46 - really depends on the person
09:48 - but i can give you a rough estimate so i
09:52 - would say anywhere between a year and a
09:54 - year and a half of you learning every
09:57 - day for a couple of hours or almost
10:00 - every day and then don't get me wrong
10:02 - learning for a couple of hours does not
10:04 - mean learning for two or three hours
10:06 - it's more like five or six or even seven
10:10 - hours for you to learn to get some sort
10:12 - of meaningful knowledge before applying
10:14 - for a job but it is still a lot less
10:17 - than what you would spend on university
10:19 - but why is that so it is because most
10:22 - universities and educational system in
10:24 - general has one very big thing in which
10:27 - it is failing and that is that it
10:29 - assumes that everyone needs the same
10:32 - amount of time to learn something and
10:34 - that is definitely not the case and you
10:36 - can use this to your advantage so you
10:38 - can use this in order to spend more time
10:40 - on the things that you need to spend
10:42 - more time on in order to understand them
10:44 - and then if you need less time to
10:46 - understand something you don't need to
10:47 - have additional three days or four days
10:50 - uh looking at that like you would if you
10:52 - were in a classroom with 50 other people
10:54 - so you can plan that according to you
10:57 - you can spend a few hours on a certain
10:59 - topic and then once you understand it
11:00 - you can move to the next one but
11:03 - sometimes when you learn alone you can
11:04 - easily lose motivation and end up
11:06 - watching a million different youtube
11:08 - videos about food and cars and games and
11:12 - sports and then my favorite which is
11:14 - cats
11:18 - do i look happier to you it's because i
11:20 - just spend an hour watching cats videos
11:24 - so to return to our topic
11:26 - sometimes you can motivate yourself and
11:28 - you can learn on your own however what
11:31 - often happens is that you get stuck on
11:33 - something and you try to figure it out
11:35 - for days but you just can't so what can
11:38 - help in this situation is having one or
11:41 - two friends people that are on the same
11:43 - quest as you people that have the same
11:45 - goal of learning programming the same
11:47 - goal as you
11:48 - so just by having another perspective of
11:51 - that problem or just by having another
11:53 - pair of eyes to look at your code that
11:56 - can be very very helpful and then one
11:58 - thing as well is don't be afraid of that
12:01 - process where you are struggling and
12:02 - trying to figure out a solution for a
12:04 - problem because that is the process
12:06 - where you will learn the most uh believe
12:09 - me every time that i had to figure out a
12:12 - solution for a certain problem for days
12:14 - and i was really really struggling i
12:16 - still remember that solution even years
12:19 - after and then anytime that i had
12:21 - someone else be like oh yeah i know this
12:23 - problem and then that other person types
12:25 - out the code for me i'm like literally
12:28 - in two days we have the same problem and
12:30 - i'm like um what was that thing that we
12:32 - did like yesterday so don't be afraid of
12:36 - struggling and not understanding things
12:38 - right away because you probably fell
12:40 - many times before you learned to walk
12:43 - and to talk and to swim and ride a bike
12:46 - and the proof is that you are here you
12:48 - know you have to struggle at one point
12:50 - with learning english language and the
12:52 - result is that you are now here and you
12:55 - are able to understand my video now one
12:57 - thing that i must address and that is
12:59 - very big problem for anyone who is
13:01 - learning alone is not a lack of
13:03 - information but the fact that right now
13:05 - you have so much information available
13:07 - on the internet that it becomes
13:09 - extremely hard for any beginner to
13:12 - navigate through this ocean of
13:14 - information and to
13:15 - understand what he should learn what he
13:17 - shouldn't learn what is important what
13:19 - is not really important so if i was a
13:22 - beginner right now if i was just
13:23 - starting with zero experience to be
13:26 - honest i'm not sure that i would be able
13:28 - to find the most optimal path for myself
13:31 - to learn so with the experience that i
13:33 - have right now so after working for
13:35 - years in this industry that stops being
13:37 - a problem so now i am able to
13:39 - distinguish between things that are
13:41 - important and then things that are not
13:43 - but for any beginner it is very very big
13:45 - problem so the best advice that i can
13:47 - give you is to really think about what
13:50 - do you want to achieve so you want to
13:52 - get a job where what do you have to
13:54 - learn do your research and once you have
13:57 - that goal stick to that goal stick to
14:00 - those things that you have to learn and
14:01 - don't try to learn 100 different things
14:04 - all at once because there are so many
14:07 - things in this industry and trying to
14:09 - learn them all at once it's just going
14:11 - to be impossible and even impossible is
14:14 - an understatement so let's say that you
14:17 - did spend enough time learning and that
14:19 - now you want to get a job so how do you
14:21 - make yourself interesting for that
14:23 - company most people who went to the
14:25 - university have some sort of projects
14:27 - that they worked on so they can show
14:29 - that but what often happens is that most
14:32 - of those projects are very similar or
14:35 - even the same because those people had
14:37 - that same approach to learning and they
14:39 - had that same path so that is your
14:41 - opportunity to make something special
14:44 - something different make yourself stand
14:46 - out and make yourself more interesting
14:49 - for that company the things that
14:50 - companies appreciate the most are
14:52 - creativity and passion and dedication
14:55 - and persistence so imagine making some
14:58 - sort of an application where you can
15:00 - clearly show all that creativity that
15:02 - you have and all the passion and
15:04 - progress that you have made over time so
15:07 - uh making an application like a progress
15:09 - tracker or a diary for example where you
15:12 - can clearly show where you were at day
15:14 - one of learning and then day 30 and day
15:17 - 100 and day 300 so that can clearly
15:20 - demonstrate the progress that you have
15:22 - made over time and then you can add
15:24 - different styling and some interesting
15:26 - functionalities to that application so
15:28 - that you can show all the creativity
15:30 - that you have and this is just an idea a
15:32 - suggestion and i'm pretty sure that if
15:34 - you spend a day or two thinking about
15:36 - this you can come up with the great
15:38 - ideas yourself
15:40 - and then make sure to use git and some
15:42 - deployment services so that you can
15:44 - share your application with other people
15:46 - and that you can show your work to other
15:48 - people and if you're familiar with git
15:50 - you can even make a small team so a
15:52 - group of few friends that will work in
15:54 - that application together and that can
15:57 - be a very good proof that you are team
15:59 - player as well and that you know how to
16:01 - work in groups one very important thing
16:04 - is that once you send that job
16:06 - application don't get discouraged if
16:08 - they don't call you back because that is
16:11 - something that happens very often and it
16:13 - doesn't happen only to people who don't
16:15 - have experience but it happens to people
16:17 - who do have experience as well but
16:19 - juniors are the ones who get discouraged
16:22 - by this most often but what people with
16:24 - experience will do they will just send
16:26 - job application to another company a
16:28 - similar one or even a better one or what
16:31 - happens even more often is that they
16:33 - send a job application to multiple
16:35 - companies at the same time so even if
16:38 - just half of those companies call them
16:40 - back that is still a great situation you
16:42 - still have opportunity to choose but if
16:45 - you want to work for that specific
16:47 - company so if you want to work for that
16:49 - company only you can apply in a few
16:52 - months again and that is going to be a
16:54 - pretty strong thing to say once you come
16:57 - again so you can say i applied a few
16:59 - months ago and you rejected me you said
17:01 - that i needed to learn this so i did and
17:04 - here i am again so always ask for
17:08 - feedback if you can get it always ask
17:10 - what was the problem why didn't you get
17:12 - that job because those are your weak
17:14 - spots and that is something to focus on
17:17 - so to return to the story from the
17:19 - beginning of this video i said that i
17:21 - will tell you how that story ends at the
17:23 - end of the video so a few weeks ago i
17:26 - talked with my friend and he said that
17:28 - at the end they did get a senior
17:30 - developer they get someone who had more
17:32 - than 10 years of experience and they
17:35 - gave him a pretty generous salary and
17:36 - that project was finished so i missed on
17:39 - a position with a good salary however if
17:42 - i had accepted that i wouldn't have time
17:44 - to make videos for you guys and i
17:46 - wouldn't be able to share this story
17:48 - with you and that is something that
17:50 - truly makes me happy so the most
17:52 - important thing is that you do something
17:54 - that truly makes you happy so even
17:57 - though juniors are not going to be the
17:59 - first choice when a company or a team
18:01 - has some sort of a burning project which
18:03 - needs to be finished as soon as possible
18:06 - as a junior you still have very high
18:09 - chances to get a job because there are
18:11 - only so many seniors and then not every
18:14 - company is going to be able to afford a
18:16 - senior developer and then one very
18:18 - important thing that happens is that
18:20 - seniors get burned out and there is just
18:24 - not that spark that you see at people
18:26 - who want to prove themselves and at
18:28 - people who really love this job and the
18:31 - reason that i rejected that offer at the
18:33 - first place is because i just love doing
18:36 - youtube more you know and even though
18:38 - it's not generating me nearly as much
18:40 - money it just makes me happier and that
18:42 - is more important to me so when i asked
18:44 - my friend what kind of junior would they
18:46 - want to employ he said someone who
18:49 - really loves this job and you can't see
18:52 - that in a person you can see a person
18:54 - who is always trying to take things one
18:56 - step further someone who accepts a
18:59 - critique in a right way or a person who
19:02 - is always trying to find ways to make
19:04 - things better and to learn and to make
19:07 - progress so that is one very important
19:10 - thing be in this because you love it and
