00:00 - hi guys and welcome to my channel in
00:02 - this video you are going to learn about
00:04 - one of the most important Concepts that
00:06 - exists in all programming languages and
00:09 - that is if else expression we will start
00:12 - with some simple examples and then
00:14 - gradually we are going to cover more
00:16 - complex examples as well until you learn
00:19 - everything that you need to know about
00:21 - if else expressions and I will explain
00:24 - everything on real world examples so
00:26 - that you can easily understand and
00:29 - remember everything
00:30 - and if you want to learn more if you

02:08 - if you put in some time and effort and
02:10 - dedication for the next few months it
02:12 - can truly truly transform your life so
02:16 - with that being said let's continue with
02:18 - the topic of this video and let's learn
02:21 - about if else Expressions if else in C
02:24 - and in any other programming language is
02:26 - used to make decisions if something is
02:30 - true then do this else do that for
02:33 - example if it is sunny then go to the
02:35 - beach else sleep all day so now let's
02:40 - see the simplest example so let's write
02:43 - here let's say if 1 is equal to one what
02:49 - I want to do is I simply want to write
02:52 - some text in my console I want to write
02:55 - for example one is equal to one like
03:00 - this so this is how you write an if
03:04 - expression if and then inside
03:07 - parentheses you put condition and when
03:10 - this condition is evaluated it is going
03:12 - to result in either true or false and if
03:16 - it results in true then this part of the
03:20 - code will be executed so now if I run
03:23 - the program let's see what will be the
03:25 - result okay so here we get this output
03:29 - one is equal to one because this
03:32 - condition here is true but if I change
03:36 - this for example and I say please check
03:39 - if 1 is equal to two and I run my
03:42 - program again as you can see we don't
03:44 - have this output anymore we just have
03:47 - this last line of code which will be
03:50 - executed in any case because this line
03:52 - of code is not under any if condition
03:56 - okay so let's stop our program and let's
03:58 - go once more through this codee so we
04:01 - say if and then inside parentheses you
04:05 - put condition and then inside these
04:09 - curly brackets you put the code that
04:11 - will be executed if this condition here
04:15 - is true okay inside these curly brackets
04:18 - you can have as much code as you need so
04:21 - that can be just one line of code like
04:24 - we have here or it can be 100 lines of
04:26 - code depending on what your program
04:28 - needs to do now something interesting is
04:31 - that if you have only one command inside
04:34 - these curly brackets you can completely
04:37 - delete them and your program is going to
04:39 - behave absolutely the same so if I start
04:42 - my program again as you can see we get
04:44 - the same behavior but what I prefer to
04:47 - do is I prefer to have these curly
04:50 - brackets because it makes the code more
04:52 - organized and what is important to
04:55 - remember is that if you have more than
04:57 - one command inside these curly bra ETS
05:00 - then you must have them you cannot
05:02 - delete them otherwise you will have
05:04 - logical errors in your program now let's
05:07 - write another example let's delete this
05:10 - if and let's say
05:13 - Bull have cat is equal to
05:18 - True okay and what I want to do is I
05:21 - want to check if have cat is equal to
05:26 - true then what I want to do is I want
05:29 - want to print some text what text well
05:33 - let's say feed your cat like this okay
05:39 - so if I start the program as you can see
05:42 - we get this output because have cat is
05:45 - equal to true now something interesting
05:48 - that you can do here is you can make
05:50 - this even shorter so you can just write
05:53 - if have cat without this part here and
05:58 - the program will behave absolutely
05:59 - absolutely the same so if I delete this
06:02 - and run my program again as you can see
06:04 - we get the same behavior now if I change
06:08 - this to be false and I run the program
06:12 - again as you can see this line of code
06:15 - will not be executed because remember
06:18 - what we said in order for this code here
06:21 - to be executed this condition needs to
06:24 - be true and because it is false this
06:28 - block of code will not be
06:30 - executed okay so this is the most simple
06:33 - example of how you can use if
06:35 - expressions in order to make decisions
06:38 - in your program so if something is true
06:42 - then do this part of the code now I'm
06:45 - going to show you how you can use if
06:47 - else expression so here after this
06:51 - closed curly bracket I will write else
06:55 - and then inside another pair of curly
06:58 - brackets we will write the code that
07:00 - will be executed if this here is not
07:04 - true so let me copy this line of code
07:09 - okay and here I will say get a
07:14 - cat cats are
07:18 - awesome okay so what this code here does
07:22 - is the following it checks if you have a
07:26 - cat and if you do then it will write
07:28 - this line of code
07:30 - else meaning if you don't then it will
07:33 - write this line of code so let's start
07:37 - our program okay and here it says get a
07:40 - cat cats are awesome because this
07:43 - variable is false but if we change it to
07:47 - true and we start our program again as
07:50 - you can see now this line of code is
07:53 - executed now a few things to remember
07:56 - and a few common mistakes that beginners
07:58 - make are are following please don't put
08:01 - semicolon here or here or something like
08:06 - that because if you do you will have
08:08 - errors in your program so if I try to
08:10 - run my program as you can see we have
08:12 - buil errors so please make sure that you
08:16 - follow the correct syntax if and then
08:20 - inside these parentheses you put the
08:23 - condition and then inside these curly
08:24 - brackets you put what will be executed
08:27 - if this here is true and then you say
08:30 - else and inside another pair of curly
08:33 - brackets you put what will be executed
08:35 - if this here is false so that is first
08:38 - important thing to remember and then
08:40 - second important thing to remember as
08:43 - you could already see if expression can
08:46 - exist without else expression but not
08:50 - vice versa so you cannot have else
08:53 - expression without if so this here will
08:57 - give you a logical error if I start this
09:00 - program as you can see we have built
09:02 - errors but once more like this it is
09:06 - okay and also if without else can exist
09:10 - but else condition without if condition
09:13 - does not make sense okay now let's go to
09:17 - some more complex examples because what
09:19 - we can do is we can chain these we can
09:21 - have multiple if else Expressions so let
09:25 - me delete this code and here I will
09:28 - write Double Cat
09:32 - weight is equal to let's say 5 kg okay
09:38 - so what I want to do is I want to check
09:41 - if cat weight is less than let's say
09:46 - four kilog what I want to do is I want
09:51 - to print that is a small small cat so
09:54 - here I will write this is a small cat
10:03 - okay and then what I want to do in case
10:06 - that cat's weight is not less than 4
10:09 - kilg I want to check something else I
10:11 - want to say else if so if this here
10:16 - results as false then please check the
10:19 - condition inside these parentheses so
10:21 - what will be the condition here well
10:23 - here I will say cat weight is greater
10:26 - than or equal to 4 kg okay and at the
10:31 - same time cat weight is less than 6 kilg
10:35 - for example okay so in that case I want
10:39 - to print another line of code so here I
10:42 - will say this is an average size
10:50 - cat Okay and then at the end I want to
10:55 - put final else block and inside it I
10:58 - will say this is a big cat what sound is
11:04 - that so let's start this program okay
11:07 - and as you can see it says this is an
11:10 - average sized cat because cat's weight
11:12 - is five so what we do is we first check
11:16 - if cat weights is less than four it is
11:18 - not so we proceed and we check this
11:21 - condition here so we check if cat's
11:23 - weight is greater than or equal to four
11:26 - and at the same time less than six is is
11:30 - and for that reason this line of code
11:32 - here will be printed and then this else
11:35 - block here will not be executed now if I
11:39 - change this cat weight to be two for
11:42 - example and I start the program again
11:45 - now we get a different output we get
11:48 - this is a small cat so again we first
11:52 - check this condition here and if it
11:54 - results as true we will execute this
11:57 - block of code and nothing else will be
12:00 - executed otherwise if this here results
12:03 - as false then we proceed and we check
12:06 - this second condition and if the second
12:08 - condition results as true we will
12:10 - execute this line of code and then
12:12 - nothing else will be executed but if
12:15 - this here results as false then we will
12:18 - execute this final else block and it
12:21 - does not have any conditions so in case
12:23 - that this is false and this is also
12:26 - false then else block will be executed
12:29 - Ed now your question might be okay
12:31 - Salina how many of these if El's can I
12:35 - chain and the answer is that you can
12:36 - chain as many as you want as many as you
12:39 - need but after some point it can become
12:42 - very hard to understand if you have more
12:44 - than let's say four or five if El's that
12:48 - are chained and depending on what you
12:50 - need to do and what you want to achieve
12:52 - there are better ways to do that for
12:54 - example one way is to use switch case
12:57 - and you can learn more about switch case
12:59 - in this video here it will also be
13:01 - linked in the description so you can
13:03 - watch it after this video but as I said
13:06 - you can change as many as you want but
13:08 - if you make it too many then your code
13:11 - is going to be hard to understand and
13:13 - hard to maintain but what you can do is
13:16 - you can say here for example else if and
13:19 - then you can add another condition here
13:22 - for example let's say if cat weight is
13:26 - greater than or equal to six and then
13:28 - less than then eight this is a big cat
13:32 - and then again at the end you can put a
13:35 - final else block and inside that you can
13:37 - write let's say this is a really really
13:44 - big cat Okay and one interesting thing
13:47 - that I mentioned before is that you
13:49 - don't need to have this final else block
13:52 - if you don't want to and if you don't
13:54 - need it in your program so else if can
13:57 - exist without any problems without the
13:59 - final else but what this final else does
14:04 - is it serves as a default situation so
14:07 - if all of these fail if all of these
14:10 - result as false then at the end this
14:13 - here will be some sort of backup default
14:16 - option that will be executed so in this
14:19 - case you are checking the size of the
14:21 - cat you are checking if the cat is small
14:23 - cat or average sized cat or big cat or
14:27 - if none of these are true then it is
14:29 - really really really big cat but as I
14:33 - already said creating a really long
14:35 - chain of these if else if else if and so
14:39 - on it is going to make your code hard to
14:42 - understand and hard to maintain and
14:44 - already with just one two three four of
14:48 - these we have a code that looks a little
14:50 - bit bulky and much harder to understand
14:53 - than it was previously so once more try
14:56 - to avoid as much as possible to chain a
15:00 - lot of if El's another interesting and
15:03 - important thing that you can do with if
15:05 - El's besides chaining them is you can
15:08 - also Nest them so what does that mean
15:11 - that means that for example inside this
15:14 - if block you can have another if else or
15:18 - another chain of if eles so let me think
15:22 - of an example and then I will show you
15:24 - for example let's add another variable
15:27 - let's say double
15:29 - cat age and let's say that cat will be 3
15:33 - years old so what I want to do is inside
15:36 - this if condition here I want to also
15:39 - check what is cat's age so I will say if
15:44 - cat age is let's say greater than two
15:48 - well in that case if Kat is older than
15:51 - two but it has less than 4 kilograms
15:54 - that means that it is underweight so I
15:57 - will print that message I will say
16:01 - cat is
16:04 - underweight please feed it
16:09 - more
16:11 - okay
16:13 - else which means that if cat is not
16:16 - older than 2 years old in that case it
16:19 - is of normal weight so I will say cat is
16:24 - of normal
16:27 - weight okay okay so what this code here
16:31 - does is it checks if cat's weight is
16:34 - less than four if it is it will print
16:37 - that that is a small cat so still a baby
16:40 - and then it will check if cat is older
16:42 - than 2 years old because if it is older
16:45 - than two but it has less than 4 kilg
16:48 - then it is going to print that cat is
16:51 - underweight you need to feed it more
16:53 - else which means that if cat is not
16:55 - older than two in that case the cat is
16:59 - of normal weight and then if the cat is
17:01 - not less than 4 kg it will simply
17:05 - continue and check all of these other
17:07 - things so if I run this program let's
17:10 - see what is going to be the result okay
17:13 - here it says this is a small cat and cat
17:16 - is underweight please feed it more the
17:18 - reason is because cat's weight is two
17:21 - that is less than four and then the age
17:24 - of cat is three which means that it is
17:26 - older than two so it should defin itely
17:29 - weigh more than 4 kilg but if I change
17:33 - the age of this cat so for example I say
17:35 - that cat is 1 years old so it is still a
17:38 - kitten and I run the program now it says
17:41 - that cat is of normal weight so it is a
17:44 - small cat and it is of normal weight so
17:47 - what you can do now is you can add some
17:50 - additional checks inside these L's if
17:53 - blocks and you can check for these cats
17:57 - if they are underweight over overweight
17:59 - or of normal weight and an interesting
18:02 - thing that we learned in the previous
18:03 - video is how you can handle input and
18:06 - output so now what you can do is you can
18:08 - ask your user to enter cat weight and
18:12 - cat age and depending on what he enters
18:15 - you can print one of these messages and
18:18 - analyze his cat so I would like to
18:21 - invite you to watch that video it's
18:23 - going to be linked here and also in the
18:25 - description and then try to solve that
18:27 - problem on your own so what I want you
18:29 - to do is I want you to ask the user to
18:32 - input weight and age for the cat and
18:35 - then you can execute this code here with
18:37 - the values that the user has provided so
18:41 - please pause the video here try to solve
18:42 - it on your own and then you can watch my
18:45 - solution and if you need help the video
18:48 - about input and output is going to be in
18:50 - the description so here is my solution
18:52 - we first ask the user to enter weight of
18:55 - the cat and then we read whatever he
18:57 - enters and we store it inside this
19:00 - variable and then we ask about cat's age
19:04 - again we read what the user enters and
19:06 - we store that inside this variable here
19:09 - and then this remaining part of the code
19:11 - stayed absolutely the same so now let's
19:14 - run our program and see how this
19:17 - behaves okay so let's say that the cat
19:20 - is 5 kilg and it has 2 years and we get
19:25 - this message so this is an average sized
19:28 - cat and the reason for that is because
19:30 - cat is 5 kilogram so this condition here
19:32 - resulted as true and we got this message
19:36 - here now let's start again and let's
19:39 - change the value let's say that cat's
19:41 - weight will be 3 kg and the age of the
19:44 - cat will be 5 years so now we get this
19:48 - is a small cat and cat is underweight
19:51 - please feed it more because cat is 3 Kg
19:55 - so this condition here is true and then
19:57 - the age of the cat is greater than two
20:00 - so that means that cat is underweight
20:02 - and you need to feed it more and one
20:05 - interesting thing that I want you to
20:06 - notice is that I did not use curly
20:08 - brackets here nor here you can add them
20:11 - if you want but as I said if you have
20:14 - only one command under if you don't have
20:17 - to use curly brackets and also the same
20:20 - applies for else but if you wanted to
20:22 - add more than one command here or here
20:26 - then you would have to add curly
20:28 - brackets so I hope that you enjoyed this
20:31 - video and that this example helped you
20:33 - to understand if else expressions and if
20:36 - you want to learn more if you want to
20:37 - learn how to build real applications and
