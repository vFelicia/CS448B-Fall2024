00:00 - hi everyone welcome to my channel my
00:02 - name is saldina and i make
00:05 - i.t and programming related videos so if
00:07 - that is something that is of interest to
00:09 - you
00:09 - consider subscribing to my channel and
00:12 - give this video a thumbs up as well
00:14 - now in this particular video i want to
00:16 - talk about object-oriented
00:18 - programming so what is object-oriented
00:21 - programming well
00:22 - oop or object-oriented programming
00:24 - allows you to represent
00:27 - real-life objects in programming and
00:30 - those real-life objects are going to be
00:32 - represented together with their
00:33 - attributes and then their behaviors
00:36 - as well one of the most important
00:38 - concepts
00:39 - of oop are classes and
00:42 - objects so let me explain the difference
00:44 - what is a class and then what is
00:46 - an object a class is going to represent
00:49 - a template meaning a blueprint and then
00:52 - an
00:52 - object really represents an example of
00:55 - that class
00:56 - an instance of that class for example
00:59 - a class can be a fruit and then an
01:02 - object of that fruit class can be an
01:05 - apple
01:06 - a banana a peach or another example a
01:09 - class can be
01:10 - a car and then an object of that class
01:14 - can be
01:14 - a volvo a ford bmw and so on
01:19 - and that car class for example has some
01:23 - attributes and then it has some
01:24 - behaviors as well now what are
01:26 - attributes of car class well a car has a
01:29 - name for example that's an example of
01:31 - one attribute and then it has a price
01:34 - and max speed and color and so on
01:38 - and then behaviors of a car can be drive
01:42 - for example and then break as well and
01:44 - then
01:45 - change color and so on so
01:48 - here we are going to create an example
01:52 - of a class and then we are going to
01:53 - create an object of that class
01:56 - so the class that i want to create is
01:58 - going to be called
01:59 - youtube channel so in order to create a
02:02 - class
02:03 - you write class and then you give a name
02:06 - to your class so here i'm going to say
02:08 - youtube channel
02:12 - like this and then you put these curly
02:14 - brackets and at the end you will have to
02:16 - put a semi column
02:18 - and now here you will put the members of
02:21 - this class
02:22 - now one thing that i haven't mentioned
02:24 - is that class
02:25 - is user defined data type we have
02:29 - already talked about
02:30 - data types in this course or in c plus
02:33 - plus for beginners course so if you
02:35 - haven't watched
02:36 - that make sure to do so i'm going to
02:37 - link it in the description
02:39 - and then here as well so we have talked
02:43 - about
02:44 - basic data types such as integer
02:46 - floating point number
02:47 - and then boolean character double string
02:51 - you know but a class is going to be a
02:54 - user-defined
02:55 - data type which is going to allow you to
02:57 - represent a real-life
02:58 - object in programming and in this
03:01 - particular situation i want to represent
03:03 - a youtube channel
03:04 - so let's think of attributes of a
03:06 - youtube channel what is something that
03:08 - describes a youtube channel
03:10 - let's say for example that each youtube
03:12 - channel has a name so
03:14 - that is going to be a string variable
03:16 - let's say string
03:18 - name like this so these attributes are
03:21 - going to be represented
03:23 - with variables so one of the attributes
03:26 - is going to be
03:27 - name and then let's say another is going
03:30 - to be
03:30 - string owner owner name
03:35 - like this and then let's think of
03:38 - another attribute let's say that each
03:40 - youtube channel
03:41 - has a subscribers count so end
03:45 - subscribers
03:48 - count like this and then
03:52 - let's as well create a list of published
03:55 - videos so i'm going to say
03:56 - list and let's call it published video
04:00 - titles
04:02 - so that is going to be type string and
04:05 - it is going to be called
04:06 - published
04:11 - like this now here it says that this
04:14 - list cannot be used because we haven't
04:16 - included
04:17 - um it here so here i'm going to say
04:20 - include
04:21 - list and now this should be accessible
04:24 - okay now we
04:25 - don't have that error anymore and what i
04:28 - want to do here is i want to represent a
04:30 - youtube channel that has
04:32 - four attributes it has a name then owner
04:35 - name
04:35 - you can use email here or whatever and
04:38 - then it has subscribers
04:40 - count and published video titles now
04:43 - here you can use
04:44 - another class here you can say for
04:45 - example list
04:47 - of videos you can create another class
04:49 - that is called video
04:51 - and then in that video class you can put
04:54 - all the attributes that describe a video
04:56 - so that can be for example a title and
04:58 - then a description
05:00 - number of likes number of comments
05:02 - number of views
05:04 - um the duration of that video the video
05:06 - itself you know
05:07 - but for the simplicity of this
05:08 - particular exam example i'm going to use
05:11 - just the title of those videos so now
05:15 - after i have created
05:16 - this youtube channel class what i can do
05:19 - is i can create an
05:20 - object of that class so let's say here
05:24 - that i'm going to create an object so
05:26 - how you do that you say
05:28 - the type so you put the name of your
05:31 - class which is youtube channel
05:33 - and then you give a name to that
05:35 - variable let's call it
05:37 - youtube channel like this
05:40 - okay now what i want to do is i want to
05:44 - assign values to these properties of my
05:46 - youtube channel and how do i do that
05:49 - well
05:49 - you say youtube channel and then you put
05:52 - dot
05:53 - and here is nothing available but it
05:56 - should be
05:57 - these properties should be available
05:59 - when you say youtube channel dot
06:01 - now why these are not available it is
06:03 - because all the members
06:05 - of your class are by default private
06:09 - and that means that these members
06:11 - because they are
06:12 - private they are going to be accessible
06:14 - only within this class here
06:16 - and in order to make them public in
06:18 - order to make them accessible outside of
06:21 - this
06:21 - class you put public access modifiers so
06:24 - you say here
06:26 - public okay like this now
06:30 - this public is an access modifier and it
06:33 - is going
06:34 - to make all of these members of your
06:37 - class
06:37 - accessible outside of your class which
06:40 - means that now
06:41 - if i press dot here as you can see
06:44 - name owner name published video titles
06:46 - and then subscribers count
06:48 - is available for me now so i'm going to
06:51 - say
06:52 - that the name of my youtube channel is
06:54 - going to be for example
06:56 - code beauty like this
06:59 - and then owner name let's copy this a
07:02 - couple more times
07:04 - so owner name is going to be
07:07 - my name so saldena
07:10 - like this and then subscribers count
07:14 - well let's say this is an integer
07:17 - variable so we don't need
07:18 - the quotation marks let's say a hundred
07:21 - and a thousand
07:22 - and eight hundred uh people
07:26 - and then these published video titles so
07:28 - let's add
07:29 - value to my published video titles list
07:32 - so here i want to say
07:34 - that i have published for example
07:37 - um c plus plus for beginners
07:42 - oh let's say
07:45 - video one okay
07:48 - and then let's say html and
07:52 - css video one
07:56 - okay and let's add as well this video so
07:59 - let's say
08:00 - c plus plus oop
08:03 - video one okay now after i have assigned
08:07 - value to these
08:08 - properties what i can do is i can write
08:11 - out
08:12 - these properties so i can say here for
08:14 - example c out
08:16 - and then let's say name
08:20 - and let's write out the name of my
08:22 - youtube channel
08:24 - like this and i'm going to add an end
08:26 - line and i'm going to copy this
08:28 - couple more times like this so
08:31 - here i want to write out owner name so
08:34 - let's put youtube channel dot
08:36 - owner name and then here i want to write
08:39 - out the subscribers count so youtube
08:41 - channel dot
08:42 - subscribers count and then published
08:45 - video titles
08:46 - now this property here published video
08:49 - titles
08:50 - is not a simple property meaning this
08:52 - property here is a list and in order to
08:54 - write out a list we are going to use
08:57 - a loop so i'm going to delete this and
09:00 - then here i want to create a loop and
09:02 - let's say that we will be using for each
09:04 - loop
09:05 - so i'm going to say 4 like this
09:08 - and then here i'm going to write out the
09:11 - type
09:12 - of the value that i'm going to use in my
09:14 - list so i'm going to say string
09:17 - because this published video title is of
09:21 - type
09:21 - string and then here i want to give it a
09:24 - name so i'm going to say
09:26 - video title like this
09:29 - and then i'm going to specify the list
09:32 - that i want to iterate and that list is
09:34 - going to be this one here
09:36 - so it is going to be a list of published
09:39 - videos
09:40 - in my youtube channel object okay
09:44 - and now in these curly brackets i am
09:47 - going to specify the block of code that
09:49 - is going to be
09:50 - executed in each iteration so what i
09:53 - want to do with this video title
09:54 - is i want to write it out so i'm going
09:56 - to say see
09:58 - out and then let's write out video
10:01 - title and i'm going to add an end line
10:04 - at the end as well
10:05 - and one more thing that i want to write
10:07 - out before this list
10:08 - is going to be just see out videos
10:13 - like this okay and let's add
10:17 - end line at the end so that it is for
10:19 - method
10:20 - nicely so now if i run this program
10:24 - as you can see it has written out
10:26 - information about this object that we
10:28 - have created here
10:29 - it says that the name of youtube channel
10:31 - is code beauty
10:33 - and then owner name is saldena
10:35 - subscribers count is equal to
10:37 - 1800 and then the this channel has
10:40 - published three videos so c
10:42 - plus for beginners and then html and css
10:45 - video one and then
10:46 - c plus plus object oriented programming
10:48 - video one
10:50 - okay so uh
10:53 - i have created a class that is called
10:55 - youtube channel
10:57 - i have created four attributes so four
11:00 - properties
11:01 - and made them public which means that
11:03 - these four properties are going to be
11:05 - accessible
11:06 - outside of this class and we have
11:09 - accessed
11:10 - those properties here so we have said
11:13 - uh that we want to assign the value to
11:15 - our name property and then
11:16 - own our name subscribe subscribers count
11:19 - and then we have
11:20 - as well um assigned value to this
11:22 - published video titles
11:24 - list okay and then here we have written
11:27 - out
11:28 - information that is stored inside these
11:30 - properties
11:31 - so that was an example of how you can
11:34 - create a class and then how you can
11:36 - create an
11:36 - object of that class as well and in my
11:40 - next video we are going to be talking
11:41 - about
11:42 - constructors and class methods because
11:45 - there is a more simple way to do this
11:48 - that we have done
11:49 - here so make sure to check that video
11:51 - out as well
11:52 - so i hope that you enjoyed this video if
11:54 - you did give it a thumbs up and also
