00:00 - hi everyone welcome to my channel
00:01 - welcome to another video of C++ for
00:04 - beginners and in this video I wanted to
00:07 - deepen your knowledge of switch-case so
00:09 - if you're not familiar with switch-case
00:11 - at all if you haven't watched my
00:12 - previous video you definitely have to do
00:14 - that the link is going to be here and in
00:17 - this video I wanted to give you some
00:19 - more examples that you can practice on
00:21 - and introduce some things that I haven't
00:23 - mentioned in my previous video as well
00:25 - so in this video we are going to build a
00:27 - program that is going to require from
00:29 - our user to enter a year and a month as
00:32 - well and then our program has to write
00:34 - out how many days there is in that month
00:37 - so how we are going to do that let's see
00:40 - but first you have to subscribe to my
00:42 - channel and like this video and also
00:44 - share it with your friends as I
00:46 - explained there are two things that we
00:48 - need from our user to enter and those
00:51 - are going to be month and year so let's
00:53 - create two variables let's say year and
00:56 - month like this and now I'm going to
01:01 - write out the message to my user so that
01:03 - he knows that he should enter those two
01:06 - values so here and after that please
01:09 - enter month like this and let's store
01:13 - now the values that our user enters so
01:16 - the first one is going to be stored
01:17 - inside our year variable and then the
01:19 - second one is going to be stored inside
01:22 - our month variable and now we have
01:25 - really covered everything that we need
01:26 - from our user now our program has to
01:29 - check these two variables and then
01:31 - decide how many days there is in that
01:33 - month of that year and we are going to
01:37 - do that using switch case statement but
01:40 - there is one thing that I want to
01:42 - mention before before we start right our
01:44 - switch case and that is you have to take
01:47 - in consideration that there are years
01:50 - that are leap years and that have one
01:52 - day more than the year that is not a
01:55 - leap year and there is a rule for that
01:58 - so I'm going to copy the rule that that
02:01 - is going to help us to determine whether
02:03 - a year is a leap year or not and that is
02:07 - this rule here so any year that when
02:10 - modulated by four gives a result of zero
02:13 - and at this
02:14 - same time that year modulated by hundred
02:17 - is not equal to zero or a year so that
02:23 - same here one modulated by 400 is going
02:26 - to give the result of zero and this here
02:29 - is going to be a definition for our leap
02:32 - year which means a year that has 366
02:36 - days or a February inside this year has
02:39 - 29 days that's why we need this rule
02:43 - here so now let's write out our switch
02:47 - case statement and if you haven't
02:48 - watched my video on switch case
02:50 - statement I am going to link it here one
02:53 - more time because you really need to
02:54 - understand the switch case and then you
02:57 - can come back to this video and deepen
02:59 - your knowledge on switch case so switch
03:03 - this is going to be the syntax of our
03:05 - switch case but I'm going to delete this
03:08 - default syntax we want to write it
03:11 - ourselves so inside these parentheses
03:14 - here I'm going to put the variable that
03:17 - we are going to switch through and that
03:19 - is going to be our month variable like
03:22 - this so whichever value our user has
03:26 - entered for our month we are going to
03:28 - cover all the potential values that our
03:30 - month can hold in our cases so the first
03:35 - case that I want to cover is going to be
03:37 - the most specific one and that is going
03:39 - to be our February which means second
03:41 - month so I'm going to say in the case
03:44 - that this month variable is equal to two
03:48 - which means that our user is requesting
03:50 - from us to determine how many days our
03:52 - February month has we're really in this
03:56 - case need to check whether that year is
03:58 - a leap year or not and then if that year
04:02 - is leap year that means that our
04:04 - February has 29 days and if not which
04:08 - means if this condition here is not true
04:10 - that means that our second month has 28
04:14 - days so I'm going to copy this
04:16 - expression here this condition and also
04:20 - if you are not familiar with ternary
04:23 - operator you have to watch that video
04:25 - because in this video we are going to
04:27 - use that ternary operator you can do it
04:30 - as well with if-else statement but I
04:31 - want you to practice also this because
04:34 - you will you are going to actually come
04:38 - across it in your programming career so
04:41 - here I'm putting this condition for a
04:44 - leap here and I'm going to say this
04:47 - question mark and then I would say if
04:52 - this here is true you have to write out
04:55 - this line of code so you have to write
04:58 - out C out and if this condition here is
05:01 - true that means that our year is a leap
05:04 - year which means that our fury our
05:06 - second month has 29 days so let's say 29
05:10 - days like this okay and so that is in
05:19 - the situation where this here is true
05:21 - and in the situation where this
05:23 - expression here results as false I'm
05:26 - going to put here a column sign and then
05:29 - I'm going to write out a different
05:31 - message and that is going to be that
05:34 - this second month in the case where a
05:38 - year is not a leap here has actually 28
05:42 - days so after we have written this
05:48 - expression here so this ternary operator
05:51 - we have really write out how many
05:53 - written out how many days there is in
05:56 - our february month and after each case i
05:58 - have to put break so in this case as
06:01 - well i'm going to put our break command
06:04 - after it and with this example with this
06:08 - case here we have really covered our
06:11 - second month which was the most specific
06:13 - one now we are left to cover the
06:16 - remaining months which means once that
06:18 - have 31 days and also once that have 30
06:22 - days and here i'm going to show you
06:24 - something that I haven't shown you
06:25 - before let me scroll this code like this
06:29 - maybe okay and then there are some
06:33 - months that contain 30 days and some
06:36 - that contain 30 31 days and the ones
06:39 - that contain
06:40 - thirty days are following so I'm going
06:43 - to write out case like this and then the
06:47 - first one that could contains 30 days is
06:49 - going to be April so forth month and
06:51 - then also our sixth month contains 30
06:56 - days and then also let's see 4th 6th 9th
07:02 - and then November as well like this and
07:09 - here we have written out really all the
07:12 - months that contain 30 days ok and now
07:18 - I'm going to at the end so at this case
07:21 - here write out a message let me copy
07:24 - this and I'm going to paste it and I'm
07:28 - going to say 30 days month like this ok
07:33 - and I'm going to put break command here
07:36 - as well so let me explain this part of
07:39 - code here because we haven't seen this
07:41 - part of code here before this break
07:44 - statement what it does is when your
07:47 - program so when your program execution
07:49 - actually comes to this case here it says
07:52 - ok my month is equal to 2 so I'm going
07:54 - to execute this part of code here and
07:57 - then it comes to this break command and
07:59 - this break command really breaks the
08:01 - execution of your switch which means
08:03 - that when your program comes to the
08:06 - first break man it is going to stop the
08:09 - execution of your switch there which
08:11 - means that it is not going to check any
08:13 - more cases and because of that you can
08:17 - really here so you can put more than one
08:21 - month you can put all the months that
08:22 - have 30 days like this and then you can
08:26 - write out the same message and put one
08:29 - break command at the end and how that is
08:33 - going to really behave inside your
08:35 - program in the case where a user enters
08:37 - for example month six your program is
08:41 - going to check whether that month is
08:42 - good is equal to two and it's not going
08:45 - to be then it's going to check whether
08:46 - your month is equal to four not as well
08:49 - and then it's going to come here and say
08:52 - ok this is
08:53 - sixth month this that our user has
08:55 - entered so please execute whatever code
08:58 - you find until you come to the first
09:00 - break and there is going to be this here
09:03 - which is empty so nothing and then this
09:05 - here which is as well empty so nothing
09:08 - and then it comes to this code here and
09:12 - that lie so this code here contains this
09:17 - see out message 30 days month so it is
09:20 - going to write out this and then it
09:23 - really comes to this first break command
09:27 - and it breaks your switch which means
09:29 - that it is not going to check any other
09:31 - cases that come after this break okay so
09:35 - in any case whether your user enters
09:38 - month 4 or 6 or 9 or 11 your program is
09:42 - going to execute this line here and then
09:44 - break your switch so with this part of
09:47 - code here we have really covered all
09:49 - months that have 30 days and now we are
09:53 - left to cover the ones that have 31 days
09:56 - and those are months let's see that is
10:01 - our January and then our third month and
10:07 - our fifth and our seventh went like this
10:14 - let me scroll it a little bit more okay
10:19 - and then we have as well case 8 and case
10:29 - as well our December has 31 days so
10:35 - there are seven months that have 31 days
10:39 - five months that have 30 days and one
10:42 - month that has 28 or 29 days and in this
10:45 - line here we are going to write out a
10:48 - message that is going to say 31 days
10:52 - month and as well here we have to put
10:55 - our break command like this okay so I am
11:00 - going to run my program now and show you
11:02 - how this program behaves
11:06 - so our program is asking us to enter a
11:09 - year and a month let's say a year is
11:12 - going to be 2020 which is current here
11:15 - and then a month is going to be let's
11:18 - see it's April so forth and it says that
11:22 - it is a 30-day month which is April
11:26 - April has 30 days and let's run our
11:30 - program one more time now let's say 2020
11:34 - again and let's say that we want check
11:35 - our second month and it says that
11:39 - February of 2020 has 29 days which is
11:42 - correct as well and there is really one
11:45 - more situation that I want to cover and
11:47 - that is going to be a situation where
11:49 - our user enters a number that is not a
11:52 - valid month number and that's the
11:54 - tradition I'm going to cover with my
11:56 - default statement so I'm going to write
11:57 - out default and in this default case as
12:02 - well I want to write out a message to my
12:04 - user like this and inside here I'm going
12:08 - to say not valid which means that our
12:12 - user has not entered a valid month
12:14 - number so let's run our program and if I
12:17 - enter year 2020 and for a month let's
12:21 - say - five for example you see that our
12:26 - program has written out not valid ok so
12:31 - I hope that you have liked this video
12:33 - and if you did make sure to subscribe to
12:35 - my channel and share it with anyone who
12:37 - would like to learn programming as well
12:39 - and today is May the 2nd that's when I
12:43 - filming this video I don't know what I'm
12:44 - going to publish it probably in a couple
12:46 - of days and currently we are a little
12:49 - bit over 900 people so let's see how
12:52 - fast this channel can grow thanks for
12:55 - watching and I'm going to see you in my
12:57 - next video bye
