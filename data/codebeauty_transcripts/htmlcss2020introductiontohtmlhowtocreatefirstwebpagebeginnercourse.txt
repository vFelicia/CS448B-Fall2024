00:00 - and then you can double-click on this
00:03 - visual code installer file and here you
00:06 - are going to be presented with this
00:07 - license agreement so you can click I
00:09 - accept the agreement and you can read
00:12 - these terms and conditions if you want

00:56 - to be in the description of this video
00:59 - and the first thing that I want to show
01:01 - you in this video is going to be the
01:03 - tool that we are going to be using in
01:05 - order to write our HTML and CSS code so
01:09 - that tool can really be as simple as
01:11 - notepad so any text editor really so you
01:14 - can use notepad or notepad plus plus
01:19 - okay but the one that we are going to be
01:22 - using is called Visual Studio code so I
01:25 - am going to show you how you can
01:26 - download that so you type Visual Studio
01:31 - code and then this code dot Visual
01:35 - Studio com is going to be your link so
01:37 - you click here okay and now you really
01:41 - want to click on this download button
01:43 - and here you are going to be presented
01:46 - with the different versions of your
01:48 - Visual Studio code depending on the
01:50 - operating system that you use for me it
01:52 - is going to be windows so you click on
01:55 - this windows downloader and soon your
01:58 - download should start depending on your
02:02 - internet connection for me it is a bit
02:05 - slower ok and as you can see my download
02:10 - has started but I am going to really
02:12 - cancel it since I have
02:14 - downloaded this Visual Studio code
02:16 - version for Windows and I have it here
02:20 - on my desktop okay and it is really a
02:24 - simple next next finish installation so
02:26 - when you double-click on that you are
02:29 - going to be presented with this license
02:31 - agreement so terms and conditions so you
02:34 - can click on this I accept the agreement
02:36 - and then you can click Next and here you
02:40 - are going to be presented with this
02:42 - where should Visual Studio could be
02:44 - installed I usually leave this as it is
02:46 - already so by default I'm going to click
02:48 - Next as well ok and that it is asking
02:52 - for the program strike that I also click
02:54 - Next there so you can really leave these
02:57 - as they already are so defaults and then
03:01 - you can click install and this can take
03:06 - a couple of seconds for me at least ok
03:11 - and now this installation has been
03:13 - finished and it says that it wants to
03:15 - launch Visual Studio coach I'm going to
03:17 - click finish and as you can see this
03:19 - Visual Studio code has been really
03:22 - launched by default and the first thing
03:25 - that I want to do is going to be to
03:26 - change this dark theme into a light one
03:29 - you can skip this step but if you want
03:32 - to change the theme you can use this
03:33 - file and the Preferences and here you
03:37 - can select color theme and the one that
03:40 - I like is going to be this light Visual
03:42 - Studio Team so when you click on that we
03:46 - are presented with this beautiful light
03:48 - team ok so here I'm going to select new
03:52 - file since we want to create a new web
03:55 - page you can click on this new file and
03:58 - as you can see we are presented with
04:01 - this untitled empty file and I want to
04:05 - really zoom this in so that it is a bit
04:07 - more readable to you like this ok and
04:11 - now I'm going to save this file and then
04:14 - we are going to try to run it in our web
04:17 - browser just to see how this is really
04:20 - presented in our web browser so how you
04:23 - can save this file you can click on file
04:25 - and then here you have options to
04:27 - save and save as or you can use ctrl s
04:31 - or ctrl shift s so you can say ctrl s
04:35 - and I'm going to save this document on
04:38 - my desktop and I'm going to name it
04:41 - let's say my first web page and the
04:48 - extension that we need to use in order
04:50 - to say that this is HTML document so in
04:53 - order to tell to our computer that this
04:56 - should be opened by a web browser that
04:59 - extension is going to be dot HTML or
05:03 - just dot HTM whichever one you prefer
05:06 - I'm going to use this dot HTML extension
05:10 - like this ok and now I'm going to click
05:14 - Save and as you can see this file here
05:18 - is this location so this is the path to
05:21 - our my first web page dot HTML file so
05:24 - it is on disk C users folder than my
05:27 - user and then on desktop and then my
05:30 - first web page is the name of our file
05:32 - and that file is the what this one here
05:36 - so in my case it has been recognized by
05:40 - default to be opened by Google Chrome if
05:43 - that is not your case you can right
05:45 - click on it and then you can click open
05:47 - with and here you can select your
05:49 - preferred browser for me it is Google
05:52 - Chrome not sponsored so here I have
05:59 - opened this file in Google Chrome and as
06:02 - you can see this is the path to our file
06:04 - and then here is my first web page dot
06:07 - HTML which is really the name of our
06:09 - file and this file is empty so this web
06:13 - page is empty for now but we are going
06:16 - to add elements to our HTML document and
06:20 - then we are going to check how that is
06:21 - going to be shown in our browser the
06:25 - first thing that I want to explain is
06:26 - what is HTML HTML stands for hypertext
06:30 - markup language meaning that it is a
06:33 - standard language to create HTML
06:35 - documents or web pages and hTML is
06:39 - really used
06:40 - in order to create the structure of a
06:42 - web page which means that it is used to
06:45 - describe what elements are going to show
06:48 - up on your page and the example of those
06:50 - elements are a paragraph of text heading
06:54 - an image a link etc and we are going to
06:57 - see a lot more elements later in this
07:00 - course and in this video as well we're
07:02 - going to see some and then that HTML
07:05 - document is taken by your web browser
07:07 - and those tags are interpreted and then
07:11 - what browsers are really based on those
07:13 - tags decides which elements it needs to
07:16 - show to your user ok so here I want to
07:20 - show you the basic structure of an HTML
07:22 - document so I'm going to copy that
07:26 - okay this here is the basic structure of
07:30 - an HTML document and this line of code
07:33 - here so this doctype HTML really tells
07:36 - your computer that this is an html5
07:39 - document and then here you have a root
07:44 - tag so I'm going to collapse it and here
07:47 - you have this HTML tag and this tab
07:51 - consists of this start tag and then this
07:54 - end tag and whatever content this tag
07:57 - has you are going to put that content
07:59 - between these two so between this start
08:02 - tag and this end tag and this is the
08:06 - root tag of your HTML page the content
08:09 - of this tag are two sections so two
08:12 - other tags and that is hash tag and then
08:16 - body tag so what is this head section
08:19 - what is this body section well here in
08:22 - this head tag you put data about your
08:25 - page meaning metadata and the examples
08:29 - of this are going to be for example
08:30 - title of your page some data about your
08:33 - author and then later when we learn more
08:35 - about CSS we are going to see how you
08:38 - can really style your body section so
08:41 - how you can style your HTML page by
08:44 - linking your CSS inside this head
08:47 - section but for now we are going to keep
08:49 - it simple ok so that is this
08:52 - tag you can collapse it as well and then
08:56 - inside this body section you put all the
08:58 - elements that you want to show to your
09:00 - user so the elements that I previously
09:02 - mentioned such as paragraph of text a
09:05 - link to to to another site an image
09:09 - heading except et cetera okay so these
09:13 - two are two tabs that you put inside
09:16 - your HTML tag and this HTML tag is root
09:20 - tag of your HTML page okay so I'm going
09:25 - to save this here now and if I try to
09:29 - run it in my web browser so I have
09:33 - already this web browser opened you can
09:36 - just refresh it if you have previously
09:38 - saved your HTML HTML document which we
09:42 - did so if I make some change you can see
09:45 - that this this black dot appears and
09:49 - then you can click ctrl as in order to
09:52 - save it and then you can come back to
09:54 - this document here and you can really
09:55 - refresh it and as you can see nothing
09:58 - has changed so we have put only this
10:00 - basic structure where is it so we have
10:03 - put only this basic structure of our
10:06 - HTML document and now we want to put
10:08 - elements so we want to put other tags in
10:11 - order to be interpreted by our web
10:14 - browser and then shown to our user ok
10:17 - the first element the first tag that I
10:19 - want to show you is going to be very
10:21 - simple one and let's say that for
10:24 - example that is going to be title tag so
10:28 - I'm going to write here in this head
10:29 - section so since that is something that
10:32 - we put in this head section that title
10:35 - tag I'm going to write here title ok and
10:39 - then I'm going to close that tag and the
10:42 - visual studio code does that for me if
10:45 - you use for example note that it
10:47 - wouldn't do that for you so it wouldn't
10:50 - write this close tag itself so you
10:53 - should probably either use you use
10:57 - something like visual studio code or you
10:59 - are going to have to really write these
11:02 - close tags on your own so this here is
11:05 - going
11:05 - the title of our webpage and I'm going
11:09 - to show you what is that title so how is
11:11 - it show let me just write this title so
11:15 - let's say that it is going to be my
11:17 - first web page like this and I'm going
11:22 - to save it and now if I come to this
11:27 - browser window so where we really test
11:30 - our code that's our web page and i
11:33 - refresh it make sure to watch this part
11:36 - here so I'm going to refresh it and as
11:39 - you can see my first web page has
11:41 - appeared here okay so that is what our
11:44 - title tag has done so this tab now is
11:47 - named my first web page okay so that
11:52 - really is this title tag and that goes
11:56 - inside this head section and then inside
11:59 - this body section we are going to put
12:02 - some other element and let's say for
12:05 - example that I want to add heading to my
12:09 - web page I'm going to minimize this and
12:12 - I'm going to put it here like this okay
12:16 - and let's say that we want to add
12:19 - heading to my web page so I'm going to
12:23 - use a tag that is usually used for that
12:27 - and that is going to be h1 tag meaning
12:30 - heading 1 and here I'm going to write
12:33 - let's see this is first heading like
12:40 - this Oh first okay and these H tags
12:46 - there is really six of these if I save
12:50 - this and then i refresh my page you can
12:54 - see that this is first heading has
12:56 - appeared on my page and as I already
12:58 - said there is six of these so you can
13:01 - use really H 1 H 2 H 3 4 5 & 6 in order
13:06 - to put different levels of heading to
13:09 - your web page so you can copy this and
13:13 - paste it multiple times like this and
13:17 - then we are going to change
13:18 - this to be h2 and then h3 h4 h5 and then
13:24 - h6 just see how that is going to be
13:27 - shown in our webpage and I have to
13:28 - change these and tags as well so this is
13:31 - opened as h2 and it has to be closed as
13:34 - h2 as well
13:35 - so h3 h4 h5 and then h6
13:41 - okay and then if I save this and now I
13:47 - try to refresh it let me let me just try
13:50 - to position both of these in a single
13:54 - window and then I made position this
13:58 - okay here and now we are going to be
14:01 - able to really look at both of these at
14:04 - the same time so now if i refresh this
14:07 - window here you can see that we have six
14:10 - different levels of this heading and
14:13 - this is the biggest one and the most
14:15 - important one and then this is this is
14:19 - less important than this one and then
14:21 - this one is the least important okay so
14:24 - for now I'm going to leave only this h1
14:27 - heading but I just wanted to show you
14:28 - that there are also more options okay so
14:33 - I'm going to delete that and then save
14:35 - it and here I'm going to refresh this
14:38 - page of ours and as you can see we are
14:40 - left but this is first heading and let's
14:44 - say that now we want to add a paragraph
14:46 - of text okay and for that I'm going to
14:50 - use something called lorem ipsum so it
14:55 - is this page here okay and here you
15:00 - really have some dummy text that you can
15:02 - use for these purpose purposes so I'm
15:04 - going to copy this I'm going to copy
15:08 - this paragraph of text here okay and
15:12 - let's say that I want to paste that text
15:15 - here inside my own paragraph and the tag
15:19 - that we use in order to put a paragraph
15:21 - of text in our HTML document so in our
15:24 - web page is going to be P tag like this
15:29 - and as well we have this
15:31 - open so this start tag and then this end
15:34 - tag and in between these two we put the
15:38 - content of this element so here I'm
15:41 - going to paste this text and as you can
15:44 - see it has been pasted all in a single
15:47 - line we are going to correct that but
15:49 - first I want to save it and see how my
15:51 - web browser is going to really show this
15:53 - here since in our editor it is all in a
15:57 - single line okay and now if i refresh
16:02 - this here as you can see it is not in a
16:05 - single line but it has been really shown
16:09 - in four lines so what if I try to add
16:15 - empty spaces here or new lines
16:18 - so let's find appropriate great places
16:19 - to add new lines let's say that it is
16:23 - going to be here okay and then let's say
16:27 - that we can put new line here as well
16:32 - and then also here okay
16:36 - so now if I say this these new lines
16:41 - should start with these words so with
16:44 - these sentences if our browser is to
16:47 - show it this way that we have written it
16:50 - here okay so I'm going to refresh it and
16:52 - as you can see it has not really changed
16:55 - in our web browser but why has that
16:58 - happened it has happened because it
17:00 - really does not matter how many empty
17:02 - spaces or new lines you put here so in
17:05 - this document here your browser is still
17:08 - going to really run their desk the same
17:12 - and if you need to put a new line you
17:15 - are going to use tag for that and the
17:18 - tag that is used in order to break line
17:20 - in order to put a new line is going to
17:22 - be the art tag so here I'm going to put
17:25 - BR like this okay and then this tag is
17:30 - used in order to put a new line to your
17:34 - web page so if I save this document now
17:38 - I'm going to save it and then I'm going
17:40 - to try to refresh it as you can see now
17:43 - my first line in my web
17:45 - browser is only this text here so it
17:48 - really contains only this sentence until
17:51 - it comes to this to this br tag okay
17:57 - and as you can notice this br tag really
18:00 - is different than these other tags so it
18:03 - is different than this P tag in the body
18:05 - and had a title as well because this tag
18:09 - really does not contain a start tag and
18:11 - an end tag but it is just br tag okay
18:16 - and that is because this tag does not
18:18 - contain any content so it is just used
18:21 - in order to break line in order to put a
18:23 - new line so whatever you put after this
18:26 - br tag is going to be placed in a new
18:29 - line and that is this sentence here so
18:31 - let's add another br tag here okay so
18:37 - I'm going to paste another be right back
18:38 - here and then here as well and if I save
18:43 - it now and I try to refresh it you can
18:46 - see that my text now has really been
18:50 - broken in a couple of sentences so here
18:52 - we have put one br tag and then here we
18:55 - have put another and here the third one
18:58 - and then this rest of the text has been
19:00 - really responsive li shown meaning that
19:05 - it is really going to adapt to the size
19:08 - of your web browser window okay but at
19:11 - the end we have these three be ours that
19:15 - we have put in our HTML document okay so
19:19 - I'm going to put it again here okay and
19:25 - that is going to be the example of a P
19:27 - tag and I'm going to finish this video
19:30 - here and then in my next video I'm going
19:32 - to show you really how you can style
19:35 - this web page or any other web page I'm
19:38 - going to talk more about CSS so that we
19:41 - are really learning about HTML and CSS
19:45 - together because they are usually used
19:48 - together so not not independently but
19:51 - CSS and HTML are used combined in order
19:54 - to really have a complete web page that
19:57 - has all the
19:58 - that you want to have on it and that
20:00 - looks nice as well
20:01 - so for now I hope that you have
20:04 - understood what is HTML how is it used
20:07 - and also this basic structure of your
20:09 - HTML document so this head and body
20:13 - sections and then we have learned how we
20:16 - can put a title and then how we can put
20:18 - this paragraph of text to our web page
20:21 - and in my next video we are going to
20:24 - talk more about CSS so make sure to
20:27 - watch that video and also subscribe to
20:29 - my channel so that you are notified when
20:31 - I publish that video and thanks for
20:35 - watching I'm going to see you in my next
20:37 - video bye
