00:00 - hi guys water to my channel welcome to
00:02 - another video of C++ for beginners I
00:04 - just got an idea of a simple and fun
00:07 - program that I can show you how you can
00:09 - build and since I'm a bit of a fitness
00:12 - enthusiast myself if you haven't noticed
00:15 - I wanted to show you how you can build
00:17 - your own body mass index calculator so
00:20 - stay tuned make sure to subscribe and
00:22 - let's build our own BMI calculator okay
00:26 - so here is the text of my task and what
00:28 - we are going to build is BMI calculator
00:31 - so first I want to explain what is BMI
00:33 - calculator it is body mass index
00:36 - calculator that is going to tell you
00:38 - whether you are underweight or a normal
00:40 - weight or you are overweight depending
00:43 - on your weight and your height and here
00:46 - I'm going to use weight in kilograms and
00:48 - then height in meters so if someone else
00:51 - wants to adjust this program so that he
00:52 - can work with pounds feet and inches you
00:56 - can write out that code in the comments
00:58 - down below and the first one that gets
00:59 - it right I'm going to pin that comment
01:01 - so that everyone else can use it and see
01:03 - it okay so we are going to use this
01:06 - formula here which is used calculating
01:09 - your BMI in metric system so another
01:12 - thing that I want to mention is does
01:14 - these three categories here there are
01:16 - also some more categories that you can
01:19 - really calculate whether you are
01:20 - extremely underweight or you are
01:22 - extremely overweight but these three
01:24 - should be enough for us to do now and
01:27 - these three I'm going to cover in this
01:29 - code another disclaimer that I want to
01:31 - make is that this BMI calculator
01:33 - probably should not be used by people
01:34 - that have huge amounts of muscles so
01:37 - professional bodybuilders because even
01:40 - though they have my soul that muscle is
01:42 - still weight so even though they are not
01:44 - overweight they will fall in a category
01:46 - of overweight because their BMI is going
01:48 - to be higher but for most of us that
01:50 - don't have a lot a lot a lot of muscle
01:52 - or are living normal lives trained
01:55 - couple of times a week maybe this is
01:57 - going to be completely okay so let's
01:59 - build our program now so here is our
02:02 - tool that we are going to use to draw
02:04 - this diagram so lucid chart and let's
02:09 - really develop the algorithm for solving
02:11 - this problem and
02:13 - we are going to translate that diagram
02:15 - that algorithm in C++ code so as you may
02:18 - already know first thing that I'm going
02:20 - to put here is this shape here that is
02:23 - going to indicate the start position of
02:25 - my program this circle shape here and
02:27 - after that we really need two things
02:30 - from our user so two things that he
02:32 - should enter and those are his height
02:34 - and his weight so let's use this funnel
02:38 - shape here that is going to indicate
02:40 - something entering in your program so
02:42 - visual representation that's why I'm
02:45 - using that panel shape and inside here
02:49 - I'm going to put two things that my user
02:51 - needs to enter and those two things are
02:54 - these two tanks here so he's weighed and
02:58 - he should enter his weight in kilograms
03:01 - and also he's height and let's say that
03:05 - he should enter his height in meters so
03:08 - I'm going to use metric system for this
03:10 - problem
03:11 - okay now let's indicate the flow of our
03:14 - program it should flow like this and
03:17 - after our user has entered his weight
03:20 - and his height there is a simple
03:22 - calculation that our program needs to
03:24 - perform and that calculation is going to
03:26 - be a process for our program so the
03:29 - shape that I'm going to use for that is
03:31 - this shape here so this shape that says
03:34 - process on it and what our program
03:37 - should process what our program should
03:39 - calculate is it should total eight BMI
03:42 - so I'm going to put here BMI is equal to
03:46 - and then I'm going to put this formula
03:49 - here that is used calculate BMI okay so
03:53 - it's weight represented eight kilograms
03:55 - divided by height to the power of two so
03:59 - I'm going to multiply my height with
04:01 - height okay and this is really the
04:06 - calculation of our BMI and now after our
04:09 - program has calculated this BMI what we
04:11 - are left to do is we should depending on
04:15 - this BMI really right out so our user
04:17 - whether he's underweight or overweight
04:19 - or of a normal weight so we should make
04:23 - a decision depending on this BMI and
04:26 - for that decision we are using this
04:28 - decision shape so this diamond shape and
04:31 - inside this diamond shape I'm going to
04:34 - put I'm going to put a condition and
04:38 - that condition is going to be let's
04:40 - first check whether my BMI is lower than
04:44 - eighteen point five like this and in
04:49 - this situation where our users BMI is
04:51 - lower than eighteen point five so when
04:53 - this condition here results as yes I am
04:56 - going to write out something to my user
04:58 - and lets me find a shape
05:01 - okay let's rotate the shape and delete
05:05 - is text okay and what I want to write
05:10 - out my user oh I can make this smaller
05:13 - what I want to write out to my user in
05:16 - the situation where his BMI is lower
05:19 - than eighteen point five is I want to
05:21 - write out that he is really underweight
05:24 - so let's put text inside here now let's
05:28 - write out that he is underweight so that
05:31 - is going to happen in this situation oh
05:33 - my god there's kind happen in this
05:36 - situation here let me just okay it's
05:41 - okay so in this situation where is BMI
05:44 - is lower than eighteen point five we are
05:46 - going to write out the t's underweight
05:48 - but in the situation where his BMI is
05:51 - not lower than eighteen point five we
05:54 - have to check something else and let's
05:57 - check so let's add another of these
06:00 - diamond shapes where is it here okay and
06:05 - let's now check whether his BMI is
06:09 - higher than 25 so I'm going to write out
06:13 - BMI greater than 25 okay and that is
06:19 - going to happen in the case that this
06:21 - here results as no and in the situation
06:25 - where users BMI is higher than 25 that
06:28 - really means that our user is overweight
06:30 - so we are going to write out Oh
06:34 - okay so we are really going to write out
06:36 - a message to our user so let's copy
06:40 - trip here which we are using to write
06:44 - out a message for a user so this
06:46 - reversed funnel shape that to represent
06:48 - something living your program something
06:50 - being outputted from your program so in
06:53 - the case where this calculation here
06:56 - results as true we are going to write
06:59 - out our user that he is overweight like
07:04 - this okay and let's really adjust this
07:10 - no it's that looks a bit more
07:13 - presentable okay so first we have
07:16 - checked whether his BMI is lower than
07:18 - eighteen point five it's yeah if yes we
07:20 - have written out underweight if no we
07:23 - have to check whether his BMI is greater
07:25 - than 25 and if it is it means that he's
07:28 - overweight but in the situation where
07:31 - this here results as a no that means
07:34 - that our users BMI is not lower than
07:38 - eighteen point five nor it is greater
07:40 - than 25 so that means that his BMI is
07:43 - really somewhere in between so between
07:45 - eighteen point five and twenty five and
07:47 - that is a normal BMI so that is our last
07:51 - possible situation where we are going to
07:53 - break out to a user that he has a normal
07:57 - weight so what's right out normal normal
08:02 - weight okay so after we have covered
08:06 - these three case it's cases let's just
08:10 - join our flows into one so I'm looking
08:14 - for this shape here and I'm going to
08:16 - make it smaller
08:17 - delete this text from it and I'm really
08:21 - just going to join these flows inside
08:25 - this shape here let's just try to move
08:28 - this here I'm going to delete it and
08:32 - let's say that I'm going to
08:56 - [Music]
09:01 - okay guys I had huge problems trying to
09:04 - adjust some arrows so I had to rewrite
09:06 - this whole diagram and I believe that I
09:09 - made it a bit prettier so here we were
09:13 - explaining that in the case that our
09:15 - user has BMI lower than eighteen point
09:18 - five we are going to write out this
09:19 - message to him in the case that his BMI
09:22 - is not lower than eighteen point five we
09:24 - are going to check whether it is greater
09:26 - than 25 and if yes we are going to write
09:29 - out that he's overweight if no we are
09:32 - going to write out that he's of normal
09:34 - weight and in each of these three cases
09:37 - we are coming here to this diamond shape
09:39 - here which is just got just going to
09:42 - join these three potential situations
09:45 - and after this diamond shape here we are
09:48 - going to write out our user what his BMI
09:51 - really is because I really want my user
09:52 - to know if he is for example in this
09:55 - situation here or in this situation here
09:57 - I want him to know whether his BMI is
09:59 - let's say eighteen point four so he is
10:03 - not that extremely underweight but he's
10:05 - just a little bit underweight or in this
10:07 - situation here I want him to know
10:09 - whether he's BMI is twenty five point
10:11 - five so he's just a little bit
10:13 - overweight or his BMI is really
10:15 - thirty-five let's see that's why I I
10:18 - want to write out my BMI to my user his
10:22 - BMI to my user okay so and then we just
10:25 - really stop our program so now I'm going
10:28 - to copy this diagram and put it next to
10:31 - my visual studios to it we can really
10:32 - translate this this diagram here into
10:35 - our code so here I have put this diagram
10:39 - and then also my visual studio and let's
10:42 - now translate this diagram let's
10:44 - translate this algorithm into code
10:46 - because this here really is an algorithm
10:49 - explanation on how to solve a certain
10:51 - problem so the first thing that needs to
10:54 - happen is our user should enter he's
10:56 - weight and he's height and for ducked
10:59 - happen I first need
11:00 - to declare variables for weight and
11:02 - height and for that I'm going to use
11:04 - type float because his weight and height
11:07 - can be decimal point number so I'm going
11:10 - to say float and then I'm going to say
11:12 - weight and height okay like this and
11:17 - after that let's put a message out to
11:20 - our user so that he knows that he should
11:22 - enter his weight and height so I'm going
11:25 - to say C out weight and let's put that
11:29 - he should enter his weight in kilograms
11:31 - and that also height but he should enter
11:36 - his height in meters like this so that
11:40 - he knows which which system he should
11:41 - use okay after we have written out this
11:45 - message here what I need to do is I need
11:47 - to use my C in command so that I can
11:50 - allow my user to enter weight and height
11:53 - and I'm going to say first thing that my
11:56 - user enters that's going to be stored
11:57 - inside my weight variable and then after
12:01 - that the second value that my user
12:02 - actress is going to be my height so
12:05 - store that in a height variable like
12:08 - this okay and after we have entered
12:11 - weight and height next thing that needs
12:14 - to happen is we need to do this formula
12:16 - here and really calculate our BMI and in
12:19 - order to store this result the result of
12:22 - this expression in RB and why we need a
12:24 - variable for debt and that variable is
12:25 - obviously going to be called BMI so
12:28 - what's that here in this line here let's
12:30 - add BMI so I'm going to declare another
12:34 - variable and that variable I'm going to
12:37 - use now and I'm going to say that my BMI
12:41 - is going to be used as follows so I'm
12:44 - going to use this formula here which is
12:47 - our weight divided by our height to the
12:53 - power of 2 for now I'm going to use use
12:57 - it like this okay and this one here we
13:00 - have really calculated our BMI so this
13:03 - code here and now after we have
13:05 - calculated our BMI what we should do is
13:08 - we should really check what is the value
13:11 - of that be
13:11 - my and for that we are using the shape
13:14 - here which really translates into if
13:17 - if-else case so first I'm going to say
13:20 - if and then the first thing that I want
13:23 - to check is if my users BMI is lower
13:28 - than eighteen point five like this and
13:31 - in this situation where his BMI is lower
13:34 - than eighteen point five I'm going to
13:37 - execute one line of code so that's why I
13:39 - don't need to put these brackets so I'm
13:43 - going to delete them because I just want
13:45 - to execute one line of code and that
13:46 - line of code is going to be indented
13:48 - here so that it's easier to read and
13:50 - that line of code is really to be going
13:53 - to be a message that I want to write out
13:55 - my user and that message is going to be
13:58 - that my user is underweight
14:01 - unfortunately okay now let's add one end
14:06 - line like this okay this is in the
14:10 - situation where his BMI is lower than
14:12 - eighteen point five in a situation where
14:14 - his BMI is not Lord in eighteen point
14:17 - five we're going to execute something
14:19 - else so that's something else we
14:21 - represent would else statement and I'm
14:24 - going to put that else statement and
14:26 - what is happening in that else case it
14:28 - is happening another if-else so here we
14:32 - have a situation where we need to check
14:33 - something else so here I'm going to put
14:36 - else if so if this here results as no
14:41 - please then check something else and for
14:43 - that we use this else if statement so
14:46 - I'm going to say else if please check if
14:51 - my BMI is greater than 25 then so in
14:56 - that situation we also want to execute
14:58 - one line of code and that line of code
15:01 - is going to be to write out to my user
15:03 - that his BMI is greater than 25 which
15:06 - means that he is overweight so let me
15:09 - copy this message here and we are just
15:12 - going to adjust that so I'm just going
15:15 - to say you are overweight like this okay
15:20 - so if his BMI is less than eighteen
15:23 - point five I'm going to write out that
15:24 - he
15:25 - under weight else if his BMI is not
15:28 - lower than eighteen point five I'm going
15:31 - to check whether his BMI is greater than
15:33 - 25
15:34 - if yes I'm going to write out that he's
15:36 - overweight if no we are also going to
15:40 - execute something else and that that is
15:42 - the situation here so in this case he
15:46 - has a normal weight so let me again copy
15:49 - this message here and let's really put
15:52 - here a normal weight like this okay so
15:58 - in this situation where his BMI is not
16:01 - great not lower than eighteen point five
16:03 - nor it's greater than 25 we are going to
16:06 - write out or user that he has a normal
16:08 - weight and with this here with this code
16:12 - here we have really covered this part of
16:15 - diagram here okay and then after this
16:20 - code here executes we really want to
16:22 - write out he our BMI to him to the user
16:26 - so we have to translate this shape here
16:30 - which really translates into our our see
16:32 - out command and we want to write out
16:36 - your BMI is and now let's write out BMI
16:42 - like this okay and this line of code as
16:46 - you may already see from our diagram is
16:48 - going to execute in either this case or
16:51 - this case or this case because after we
16:54 - have finished with this decision part we
16:59 - have executed only this part of code or
17:01 - this part of code or this part of code
17:03 - here so whichever of these three has
17:06 - been executed after this code here we
17:09 - are going to execute this line here in
17:12 - either this situation or the situation
17:15 - or this situation and that is going to
17:17 - be writing out to my user what his BMI
17:19 - really is and that is the last thing
17:22 - that we need to put so the last part of
17:25 - our code and now if I run my program
17:30 - okay
17:31 - it asks me to enter my weight and my
17:34 - height and my weight is I believe
17:41 - 67-66 kilograms I think and then my
17:46 - height is 1.75 let's press Enter oh no
17:55 - I'm overweight
17:57 - how might be my 66 okay guys for a
18:03 - moment I thought that I am overweight
18:05 - but I am not definitely this 66 BMI
18:09 - overweight so that means that we have a
18:11 - bug so where are you sneaking a little
18:14 - buggy back well if you can see where our
18:19 - bug is then write that in comments down
18:21 - below and I already see where
18:23 - potentially our bug could be so this
18:25 - formula here it should really go like
18:29 - this so we should divide our weight with
18:31 - our height to the power of 2 which means
18:34 - that we should put parentheses here like
18:37 - this because and that is this
18:41 - calculation here so in this situation
18:43 - our weight is going to be divided with
18:45 - our height and after that that number is
18:47 - going to be multiplied with our height
18:50 - so we are going to get larger BMI that
18:52 - we should really so we should put this
18:55 - code here in parentheses so that was the
19:00 - first bug that really happened in these
19:03 - tutorials ok I'm going to leave this
19:05 - alright
19:06 - I'm not going to edit it out out okay
19:10 - and now if I enter my weight let's see
19:15 - 66 and then my height 1.75 okay so I am
19:25 - 21.5 that is my BMI and I am off a
19:28 - normal weight so we have really built
19:31 - our BMI calculator and this is the
19:33 - formula that you should use for a metric
19:35 - system and if someone else wants to
19:38 - rewrite this program for pounds and
19:40 - inches and feet you can write that in
19:44 - the comments down boy and as I said I'm
19:45 - going to pin that comment up so that
19:47 - everyone can see it if you of course get
19:50 - it right
19:51 - I hope you liked this video if you did
19:53 - make sure to write it in a comments down
19:54 - below and I'm going to put more videos
19:56 - like this and also subscribe to my
19:58 - channel and click the bell icon so that
20:00 - you are first to be notified when I
20:01 - publish a new video share this video
20:04 - with anyone who would like to learn
20:05 - programming or also with fitness people
20:07 - that would just like to use this program
20:09 - and if you don't know how you can run
20:12 - this program without using that using
20:13 - Visual Studio I'm going to link my first
20:16 - video here and at the end of that video
20:18 - I'm explaining how you can run the
20:20 - program from windows and that should
20:22 - give you an idea on how you can really
20:24 - share your applications with other
20:26 - people so make sure to subscribe like
20:29 - leave a comment share whatever you want
20:31 - and I'm going to see you in my next
20:33 - video bye
