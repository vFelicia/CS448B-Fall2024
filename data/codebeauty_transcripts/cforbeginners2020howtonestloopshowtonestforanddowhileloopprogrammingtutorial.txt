00:00 - so this here is the initialization step
00:03 - of our installation initialization
00:09 - [Music]
00:20 - initialization initialization so it is
00:29 - the in this in hi everyone welcome to my
00:36 - channel welcome to another video of C++
00:39 - for beginners in this video I want to
00:41 - talk about nesting loops in my previous
00:44 - videos we have talked about while we do
00:47 - while loop and for loop and now I want
00:50 - to show you the example on how you can
00:51 - really combine and nest those loops so
00:55 - if you haven't watched my previous
00:57 - videos or you are not familiar with
00:59 - loops at all I recommend you to watch
01:00 - those I'm going to link those in the
01:02 - description of this video and also
01:05 - before we start make sure to subscribe
01:06 - to my channel and click that Bell icon
01:09 - as well so what are we going to do in
01:12 - this video I want to really show you how
01:15 - you can nest for loop and do-while loop
01:19 - and the example that I'm going to use to
01:21 - explain that is going to be following so
01:24 - I want my user which is going to be a
01:26 - student let's say to enter three grades
01:30 - or more if you want we are going to use
01:32 - three for this example and I want to do
01:35 - is grades I want those grades to be
01:37 - between one and five and that I want to
01:41 - write out the average grade so the
01:44 - average grade between those three that
01:45 - he has entered so let's start building
01:49 - our program the first thing that I need
01:51 - to explain is since we are going to
01:53 - enter 3 grades that means that we are
01:56 - going to repeat that entering process 3
01:59 - times and for that I'm going to use for
02:01 - a loop so I'm going to write 4 and then
02:05 - in these parentheses here I'm going to
02:07 - put my initial setup of for loop which
02:11 - is going to be the first thing is going
02:13 - to be initial value of our counter so
02:16 - I'm going to declare a counter which is
02:18 - going to be called I and initially I'm
02:21 - going to give it a value of 0 that is
02:23 - the first thing the second thing that I
02:25 - need to put in these parentheses here is
02:27 - going to be the condition that our loop
02:29 - checks each time that it wants to run a
02:31 - block of code which is going to be this
02:34 - block of code that we put inside these
02:37 - parentheses so that condition we put
02:39 - here and that condition is going to be
02:42 - while our I is less than 3 so we want to
02:47 - make three iterations in first iteration
02:50 - RI has the value of 0 and the second
02:52 - iteration is going to have the value of
02:53 - 1 and then in our third iteration is
02:56 - going to have the value of 2 so we have
02:59 - made three iterations after that it gets
03:01 - the value of 3 but this condition here
03:04 - is not going to be true anymore so that
03:06 - our for loop is not going to be executed
03:09 - any more so that is the second thing and
03:13 - then the third thing which we need is
03:15 - going to be really increasing that value
03:17 - of our counter in each iteration so
03:19 - after each iteration and I'm going to
03:22 - put here this increment on our I
03:25 - variable okay so in this block of code
03:30 - here we are going to repeat 3 times
03:32 - something so what is that something that
03:35 - is going to be really the process of our
03:38 - user entering the value for his grade
03:41 - and since we said that that grade needs
03:45 - to be between 1 and 5 I am going to use
03:49 - do-while loop for that how well I'm
03:53 - going to write out to do ok
03:56 - and then here I'm going to put while
03:59 - which is going to be the condition so
04:01 - here we prompt our user to enter the
04:04 - grade and then we say here you are going
04:08 - to have to enter that grade while that
04:11 - grade is less than 1 or greater than 5
04:16 - so since we don't have any variable that
04:18 - we are going to use to enter that grade
04:20 - I will have to declare it here so I'm
04:23 - going to say here int
04:25 - rade like this okay and then let's
04:30 - prompt our user in this block here to
04:34 - enter his grade so I'm going to write
04:36 - out C out and let's say enter breed and
04:45 - I am going to use the current value of
04:48 - my counter so that I can really say
04:51 - which grade my user is entering so enter
04:55 - first grade second grade and third grade
04:58 - so I'm going to say I plus one like this
05:02 - y plus one well because our counter
05:05 - starts at zero and it wouldn't make much
05:08 - sense to say to our user please enter
05:10 - grade zero so that is why I'm increasing
05:14 - this value of my I when I want to write
05:18 - out a message to my user okay like this
05:23 - so here I'm going to write out please
05:26 - enter a grade and after that I need to
05:29 - accept that great that my user enters in
05:32 - my grade variable so I'm going to say C
05:34 - in grade like this and we are going to
05:40 - repeat this process here for a single
05:44 - read well our user enters a grade that
05:50 - is less than 1 or grade is greater than
05:56 - 5 okay so our program is really going to
06:00 - prompt our user please enter grade 1 and
06:02 - then he enters 6 for example and then
06:05 - our program checks this condition here
06:07 - and says ok you have missed this part
06:11 - here so go back and then please enter
06:14 - grade 1 so first grade again okay so if
06:18 - I run my program now let's just prove
06:21 - that very quickly so our program our
06:24 - program says now enter first grade so
06:27 - enter grade 1 and then let's say that I
06:29 - entered 9 for example it prompts me
06:32 - again to enter first grade because I
06:35 - have not obeyed this rule here
06:38 - sparked here so I'm going to say this
06:40 - time for example five and then it says
06:44 - okay you have successfully entered first
06:47 - grade let's now enter second grade so
06:50 - for that second grade let's enter for
06:52 - example 0 and then it prompts me again
06:56 - you have not entered correct value for
06:58 - grade - please enter it again and let's
07:02 - say that this time I'm going to enter Y
07:04 - and then it asks for a third grade and
07:08 - let's say that this time third grade is
07:10 - going to be three so our program now has
07:13 - successfully accepted disturbed grade
07:15 - and now our program is going to really
07:17 - finish its execution because we haven't
07:20 - written anything else after this part
07:23 - here so there is something else that we
07:26 - need to write and since we want to
07:29 - calculate the average grade of our user
07:31 - what we are going to need is going to be
07:34 - really to sum all of these grades that
07:36 - our user enters so I am going to declare
07:40 - a variable which is going to really hold
07:42 - that some of our users grade so I am
07:46 - going to put it here I'm going to call
07:49 - it sum and initially I'm going to assign
07:53 - it a value of zero and later I'm going
07:56 - to explain why so I have declared a
07:59 - variable that is going to be of type int
08:02 - and I have called it sum and assigned a
08:04 - value of zero so this sum here is going
08:09 - to each time that our user enters a
08:11 - grade and we really we really check that
08:14 - that grade is valid grade after that we
08:17 - want our son to hold whatever it was
08:21 - previously holding plus the value of our
08:25 - grade like this okay so why I have
08:31 - assigned a value of zero to my son
08:33 - because zero is a neutral value when it
08:36 - comes to adding numbers you add 0 to
08:39 - whichever number and then you get that
08:41 - same number and in a situation where we
08:43 - didn't assign any value to our sum we
08:47 - would get really an error so if I try to
08:50 - run my program now
08:51 - you see that it prompts me with an error
08:54 - and it says an initialized local
08:56 - variable some use because it does not
08:59 - have any value assigned to this variable
09:02 - here it is going to say really that it
09:05 - does not know how to add the value so
09:08 - the value of our grade to our sum so
09:10 - that is why we need to assign some value
09:13 - to our some variable okay so and that
09:16 - value is going to be zero because zero
09:18 - is neutral when it comes to adding
09:21 - numbers okay so now I can really run my
09:26 - program and as you can see that error
09:30 - has disappeared so I'm going to stop my
09:32 - program and let's very quickly write out
09:36 - this sum that we have calculated here so
09:40 - I'm going to say C out and I reach write
09:45 - out some like this sum is equal to and
09:49 - then let's write out the value of our
09:52 - song and let's add my like this so I am
09:56 - going to run my program once more it
10:00 - prompts me to enter first grade I'm
10:02 - going to say that my first grade is
10:03 - going to be for example five and then my
10:06 - second grade is going to be for example
10:08 - six that's an error so please enter your
10:12 - second grade again so I'm going to enter
10:15 - this time to let's say and then for my
10:19 - third gear third grade let's enter one
10:21 - for example and it says that the sum of
10:24 - my great grades is equal to eight which
10:27 - is correct so one plus two plus five
10:30 - that is going to equal to eight
10:33 - so what we are left to do now we should
10:36 - only really divide our sum by the count
10:39 - of our grades which is three because we
10:43 - have hard-coded this value here the tree
10:45 - so our user can enter only three grades
10:48 - you can really use a variable for this
10:51 - or you can part code it to any other
10:53 - value that you want and need so here
10:57 - after this line of code here what I need
10:59 - to do is following so I'm going to say C
11:02 - out
11:04 - and then let's say average is equal to
11:09 - let's say average grade is equal to and
11:14 - let's write out the results so that is
11:17 - going to be sum divided by three okay is
11:24 - it though so I need to run my program
11:26 - and let's enter for example value 2 and
11:31 - then again value 2 and then let's enter
11:34 - for example value 4 and then it says
11:37 - that average grade is equal to 2 which
11:40 - is not correct but why has this happened
11:44 - so as you can see here we have used two
11:47 - integer variables so our sum is integer
11:51 - value and then 3 is integer value as
11:54 - well so when you divide two integer
11:56 - values the result is also going to be
11:58 - integer value so in order to get a
12:01 - floating point a decimal point number
12:03 - you really need to convert one of these
12:05 - two into a float type so you can say
12:08 - either here you can say float so please
12:12 - convert my some variable into float and
12:15 - then divide or you can put here this
12:19 - point 0 or you can leave both of these
12:21 - whichever you prefer so I'm going to
12:24 - leave both of these like this so if I
12:27 - run my program once more it prompts me
12:31 - again to enter first grade so I'm going
12:34 - to say that my first grade is equal to 5
12:37 - and then my second grade is also 5 and
12:40 - then let's say that third grade of our
12:42 - user is going to be 9 so our program
12:45 - prompts us again to enter the third
12:47 - grade because it needs to be in this
12:49 - interval here so I'm going to say now
12:52 - that the value of my third grade is
12:55 - going to be 3 which is correct value and
12:57 - after that as you can see it writes out
12:59 - that the sum of these 3 grades is 13 and
13:04 - then average grade is 4 point 3 3 3 3 3
13:09 - so that was an example on how you can
13:12 - really combine and nest loops in order
13:15 - to solve complex problems
13:17 - I am going to paste the text of this
13:19 - program here in the description of this
13:22 - video so if you need it you can find it
13:24 - there and thanks for watching make sure
13:27 - to subscribe to my channel if like the
13:29 - Bell I can also share it with anyone who
13:32 - would like to learn programming and I'm
13:35 - going to see you in my next video bye
