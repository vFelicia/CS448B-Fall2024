00:00 - hi everyone welcome to my channel
00:02 - welcome to another video of c plus plus
00:04 - for beginners
00:05 - if you are already a subscriber welcome
00:08 - back and if you're a new viewer
00:10 - make sure to subscribe hit that bell
00:12 - icon as well and
00:13 - welcome to my channel so in this video i
00:16 - want to talk about
00:17 - the while loop and in my previous videos
00:20 - we have already talked about
00:22 - while loop and iteration in general so
00:24 - if you are not familiar with those make
00:26 - sure to watch that video i'm going to
00:28 - link it here but in this video i want to
00:31 - explain to you
00:32 - how and when is used do while loop
00:35 - and i'm going to give you an example of
00:37 - a program that is usually used
00:40 - and for example applications such as
00:42 - when you try to unlock your
00:44 - phone and then you are given three
00:46 - attempts to guess your pin
00:48 - and if you guess it correctly then you
00:50 - can proceed
00:51 - loading your phone's applications
00:53 - further or for example if you want to
00:56 - unlock your
00:57 - credit card so you put your credit card
00:59 - in atm and then it gives you three
01:00 - attempts to unlock your
01:02 - credit card if you guess your pin
01:03 - correctly you can proceed
01:05 - further but if you fail so if you don't
01:08 - guess your pin correctly in those three
01:10 - attempts
01:11 - your account gets blocked so that is the
01:13 - application that we are going to make
01:15 - today
01:15 - and for that we are going to use do
01:17 - while loop
01:19 - so there are three things that we need
01:22 - actually three variables
01:24 - so i'm going to declare those three here
01:26 - the first one is going to be
01:27 - our let's say the pin of our user so
01:30 - let's call it
01:32 - user's pin like this
01:35 - which is going to be really the correct
01:38 - pin the one that you want to guess
01:40 - so i'm going to put here let's say one
01:42 - two three
01:43 - four that is going to be our user spin
01:46 - after that we need another variable
01:48 - which is going to be really
01:50 - the pin that our user enters so let's
01:53 - call that variable
01:54 - just pin okay like this
01:58 - and then the third variable that we need
02:00 - is going to be really
02:02 - counter of our error so the counter of
02:04 - the attempts
02:05 - and errors that our user has made so i'm
02:08 - going to call that variable
02:10 - error counter
02:13 - like this and let's set that value
02:16 - initially to
02:17 - zero okay and the next thing that we
02:22 - need to do
02:22 - is we really need to give our user three
02:26 - attempts in order to guess this pin here
02:29 - and if he guesses it correctly in those
02:32 - three attempts we are going to write out
02:34 - that the application can be loaded
02:36 - further so we are going to write out
02:37 - applications loading or something like
02:39 - that but in the case
02:41 - that our user does not guess this pin
02:44 - here
02:45 - so this been here correctly we are going
02:47 - to really write out
02:48 - that the application or credit card
02:51 - whatever has been
02:52 - blocked and how we are going to do that
02:55 - so we are going to use do while loop so
02:58 - i'm going to write out
02:59 - do like this and then here i'm going to
03:03 - put
03:04 - wild because that is the syntax of our
03:07 - do
03:07 - while loop okay and
03:11 - here you need semicolon because if you
03:14 - don't put it you are going to get
03:16 - a syntax error now here we put
03:19 - the block of code that we want to
03:20 - execute in each iteration
03:22 - and here we put the condition that we
03:24 - want to check each time that this code
03:26 - here is executed
03:28 - we come here and then we check that
03:29 - condition and if this condition here
03:31 - that we
03:32 - put is correct we are going to go again
03:35 - here and do one more iteration and then
03:38 - again
03:38 - check and then do more one more
03:40 - iteration and
03:42 - we are going to repeat that until this
03:44 - condition that we put here
03:45 - is no longer true when it when this
03:48 - condition here when it becomes false we
03:50 - are going to leave our do
03:51 - while loop okay so what
03:54 - do we want to enter so what do we want
03:57 - actually to do in this block of code
03:59 - here
04:00 - we really want to write out a message to
04:01 - our user so that he knows that he should
04:03 - enter
04:04 - a pin and then we want to really accept
04:06 - that pin that our user enters in this
04:08 - variable
04:09 - variable here so let's do that first i'm
04:12 - going to write out
04:13 - c out like this and then
04:17 - let's just write out pin like this
04:21 - and let's accept the value that our user
04:24 - has entered in our pin variable like
04:27 - this
04:28 - okay and then after we have done this
04:31 - what we need to do is we really need to
04:33 - check whether this pin here so this pin
04:35 - that our user has entered
04:37 - corresponds to this pin here so whether
04:40 - this value is equal to this
04:42 - value here and if they are not that
04:44 - means that our user has
04:46 - failed so in that case we are going to
04:48 - increase our
04:49 - errors counter so i'm going to put here
04:53 - if pin
04:56 - is not equal to user's
05:00 - pin like this what we want to do is we
05:03 - want to really
05:04 - increase our errors counter variable
05:07 - like this okay
05:11 - and this code here so we want to give
05:15 - the the attempt to our user so that he
05:18 - can enter
05:18 - a pin and then we want to check whether
05:20 - that pin is correct
05:22 - three times or until this pin here and
05:25 - this pin here
05:26 - are the same so until they are equal or
05:29 - until
05:29 - until our user has used all of these
05:33 - three
05:33 - attempts that we have given to him okay
05:37 - so here i'm going to really put that
05:39 - condition so here inside
05:41 - these parentheses i'm going to write out
05:44 - please
05:45 - do this block of code here while
05:49 - our e let's say while
05:52 - our errors counter
05:56 - is less than three
06:00 - like this and then also at the same time
06:03 - while our pin is not equal to
06:08 - user's pin like this which means that
06:11 - this block of code here is going to be
06:14 - executed while our user has not used all
06:17 - of
06:17 - these three attempts that we have given
06:19 - to him and
06:21 - while this pin here so this one here and
06:23 - this pin here
06:24 - are not equal in a situation where this
06:28 - here
06:28 - results as false we are going to come
06:31 - here
06:32 - and after that when we come here we
06:34 - really want to check
06:35 - whether we have left this do a while
06:37 - loop here
06:39 - because our errors counter has reached
06:41 - three
06:42 - or because these two were the same
06:45 - in a situation where our errors counter
06:47 - has reached three that means that our
06:49 - user
06:50 - has used three attempts and that he has
06:53 - not
06:53 - guessed his pin correctly
06:57 - so i'm going to put here if
07:00 - our errors counter is less than
07:04 - three like this and this condition here
07:08 - really means that this do while loop has
07:11 - been left
07:12 - in a situation where our user has not
07:14 - used
07:15 - all of these three attempts that we have
07:17 - given to him
07:19 - that means that this while condition
07:22 - has really failed on this part here so
07:25 - that means that our user has entered one
07:28 - two three four as
07:29 - pin and in that situation 1 2 3 4 is not
07:32 - equal to 1 2 3 4 that results as
07:34 - false so this whole expression here this
07:37 - whole condition results in false as
07:39 - false
07:40 - and then we leave our do while loop and
07:43 - in that situation if our user has not
07:46 - used all of these three attempts that
07:48 - really means that he has guessed his pen
07:50 - correctly so here in this if situation
07:53 - we can write
07:54 - out to our user see out you have guessed
07:58 - or
07:58 - you can proceed with loading of this
08:00 - application so i'm going to write out
08:02 - just
08:03 - loading like this
08:08 - but in a situation where our while loop
08:10 - has been left because
08:12 - this error's counter is greater than
08:14 - three actually it is going to be equal
08:16 - to
08:16 - three that means that our user has
08:18 - failed in guessing his pin
08:21 - three times and that means probably that
08:23 - he is not trying to
08:24 - unlock his phone or his credit card so
08:27 - in that situation we are really going to
08:29 - block that account so we can say else
08:34 - see out blocked
08:38 - like this okay and i'm going to put one
08:42 - more
08:42 - here like this so
08:46 - this is going to be a program that we
08:48 - really use to allow our user to enter
08:51 - three attempts of his pin and in a
08:54 - situation where he
08:55 - guesses that pin correctly in those
08:57 - three attempts we are going to write out
08:59 - to our user that he has
09:01 - successfully unlocked his phone for
09:04 - example and we can proceed with loading
09:05 - of
09:06 - applications but in a situation where he
09:08 - really uses all of those three attempts
09:11 - and fails to guess his pin
09:13 - we can write out that the application is
09:16 - blocked oh
09:21 - blocked now now it's now it's okay
09:25 - so let me run this program
09:28 - and let's try to use three
09:32 - attempts so i'm going to say that my
09:35 - first
09:35 - attempt is going to be for example one
09:37 - one one
09:38 - one like this
09:42 - so it says you have not
09:45 - guessed correctly please enter your pin
09:47 - again this is what it means
09:49 - after that i'm going to try for example
09:51 - two two two two
09:53 - it tries to prompt me to enter my pin
09:56 - again because i have failed
09:58 - previously and let's say that my third
10:01 - third attempt is going to be
10:02 - three three three like this and then it
10:05 - has
10:06 - said it has written out a message that
10:08 - my account has been
10:10 - blocked because i have missed three
10:12 - times
10:13 - okay so that is one scenario
10:16 - and the other scenario is going to be
10:18 - really where we guess
10:19 - the one where we guess our pin correctly
10:21 - so let's say that our first attempt is
10:23 - going to be
10:24 - um one one one one again and after that
10:27 - we really remember
10:29 - what is the correct pin and we enter one
10:32 - two three
10:33 - four like this and then if i press enter
10:36 - it says really
10:37 - you are loading you can you can load
10:39 - your application now or
10:41 - the further loading of your application
10:43 - is going to begin
10:44 - now because we have guessed the correct
10:47 - pin so let me very quickly explain one
10:50 - more time
10:51 - how has this happened so this
10:54 - code here when we come to this do while
10:57 - loop the first thing that is executed
10:59 - is this line here so it says please
11:01 - enter your pin
11:02 - and then after your user enters the pin
11:05 - your program really
11:06 - checks whether that pin is equal to
11:09 - user's pin so the previous pin the one
11:11 - that he needs to guess
11:13 - and if those two are not equal that
11:15 - means that your user has not guessed
11:17 - correctly and then you want to increase
11:19 - your errors counter so the number of
11:22 - attempts that your user has
11:24 - used and failed actually in using so we
11:28 - increase in our first iteration that
11:30 - errors counter
11:31 - to one so from zero to one and then we
11:34 - come here
11:36 - and then our loop really checks whether
11:38 - that errors counter is less than three
11:40 - so one is less than three that is true
11:42 - and also it checks whether
11:44 - that pin here is not equal to
11:48 - the pin that we need to guess and in
11:50 - this situation
11:51 - it is not equal so it also
11:54 - this whole expression results is true
11:56 - and it now can go
11:58 - here again so it prompts you again to
12:01 - enter the pin
12:02 - so you can enter the pin now and in this
12:04 - situation we entered two two two
12:06 - two for example and then it guesses it
12:09 - it checks again
12:10 - so it checks whether pin that you have
12:12 - entered so two two two two
12:14 - is not equal to one two three four those
12:17 - two are not equal so it increases the
12:19 - errors counter
12:20 - once more and it becomes two now
12:24 - then you go here and then it says okay
12:26 - please check whether my user has used
12:28 - all of these three attempts it's
12:30 - it's it says that your errors counter is
12:32 - still
12:33 - less than three so you have used only
12:36 - two
12:36 - attempts so far and then this condition
12:39 - here
12:39 - result is true because you have entered
12:41 - two two two two and that is not
12:43 - equal to your pin so one two three four
12:46 - and then it goes back here
12:48 - tries to prompt you one more time to
12:49 - enter your pin
12:51 - and then if you fail this time it
12:53 - increases your errors counter
12:55 - to three like this and then it goes here
12:59 - and it checks whether your errors
13:01 - counter is less than three
13:02 - your errors counter in this situation is
13:05 - has become three so this condition here
13:09 - results as false and your while the
13:11 - while loop actually
13:12 - is now broken so you are not going to
13:15 - continue the execution of your do while
13:17 - loop but you come here
13:19 - and then it checks whether errors
13:21 - counter is less than 3 because this here
13:23 - fails because this here results as false
13:26 - you are presented with this message here
13:28 - so
13:29 - blocked your phone your account has been
13:32 - blocked
13:33 - okay and in a situation where your user
13:35 - guesses correctly that errors counter is
13:38 - going to be less than three
13:39 - and you are going to be presented with a
13:41 - message of loading
13:43 - and there is one important thing that i
13:45 - want to mention and that is really the
13:46 - difference between while loop
13:48 - and do while loop in do while loop you
13:51 - first
13:52 - do so you first execute this block of
13:55 - code here
13:56 - and then you check the condition and
13:59 - then if that condition results as
14:01 - true you go back and you again do
14:04 - this block of code here and then you
14:06 - check
14:07 - and then you do but in a situation of
14:10 - while loop you first
14:11 - check the condition and then if that
14:13 - condition results as true
14:15 - then you can really proceed with
14:16 - executing your block of code that comes
14:19 - after your while but in this situation
14:21 - here so in the situation of
14:23 - do while loop you first do this block of
14:26 - code here
14:26 - so irrelevant whether this condition
14:29 - here is
14:30 - true or not you are going to do this
14:32 - block of code here at least
14:34 - once i hope that you liked this video if
14:37 - you did make sure to subscribe to my
14:39 - channel and click that bell icon as well
14:41 - and also if you want me to post more
14:43 - videos like this make sure to like this
14:45 - video
14:46 - because then i will know that you liked
14:49 - it
14:50 - and one more thing i'm going to put the
14:52 - code of
14:53 - this task here in the description
14:55 - section of this video so that you can
14:57 - really
14:57 - use it if you need it and well
15:00 - that's all i'm going to see you in my
15:02 - next video bye
