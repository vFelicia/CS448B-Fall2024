00:00 - hi everyone welcome to my channel
00:01 - welcome to another video of HTML and CSS
00:04 - for beginners in this video I want to
00:07 - talk about CSS in my previous video I
00:09 - have explained basics of HTML and in
00:12 - this one I want to cover the basics of
00:14 - CSS so we are going to talk about
00:16 - different types of CSS and we are going
00:18 - to talk about CSS in general so before
00:21 - we start make sure to subscribe to my
00:23 - channel and also click the bell icon so
00:25 - that you are notified when I publish my
00:27 - next video and also follow me on my
00:29 - other social media platforms the link
00:31 - for that is going to be in the
00:32 - description of the video so without
00:34 - further ado let's start with today's
00:37 - lesson the first thing that I want to
00:40 - explain is going to be what is CSS CSS
00:44 - stands for cascading style sheets and
00:47 - that really means that CSS is used in
00:50 - order to style your HTML document so in
00:53 - order to style your web page and for
00:56 - that we are going to use it and I really
00:58 - wanted to make this course both HTML and
01:00 - CSS because these two are used really
01:03 - together so not separately but you use
01:06 - HTML in order to define the structure of
01:08 - your web page so all the elements that
01:10 - are going to appear in your web page and
01:12 - then CSS is really going to be styling
01:15 - those elements so here I have this basic
01:19 - HTML structure I hope that you are
01:21 - familiar with this if you are not you
01:24 - can watch my previous video there I have
01:26 - explained this basic HTML structure so
01:29 - I'm going to start from there and we are
01:31 - going to add a couple of elements the
01:34 - first one that I want to add is going to
01:36 - be title so let's say title ok and here
01:43 - I'm going to use let's say my first page
01:49 - like this so I'm going to say that this
01:52 - is my first web page and I have saved it
01:55 - and now if I click reload here as you
01:58 - can see my first page has appeared as
02:00 - this top title so that has done this
02:04 - title tag now I want to add headings so
02:08 - for that we are using this
02:09 - h1 tag and I'm going to say this is
02:14 - heading like this and also I have saved
02:19 - that so control us in order to save all
02:22 - the changes when you get this black dot
02:25 - symbol so control s and the changes are
02:27 - saved and then you can refresh it in
02:30 - your browser and your tag is going to
02:33 - appear so this is heading has appeared
02:35 - in my web browser okay
02:38 - so let's add one more element and that
02:41 - is going to be a paragraph and inside it
02:44 - I want to add let's say I want to write
02:47 - this is paragraph okay and then let's
02:53 - add a couple more sentences so I'm going
02:55 - to say this is second line and add a
02:59 - break line as well and then let's add a
03:03 - third line so that it really looks like
03:05 - a real paragraph so this is second one
03:07 - and then this is third third line okay
03:12 - and I'm going to add the end of sentence
03:15 - so now if i refresh it you can see that
03:18 - our paragraph has appeared here as well
03:20 - so now what I want to do is I want to
03:23 - style these elements here and the first
03:26 - type of CSS that I'm going to show you
03:28 - is going to be inline CSS because there
03:31 - are multiple ways that you can write
03:33 - your CSS the first one is going to be in
03:35 - Y after that I'm going to show you
03:37 - internal CSS and then I'm going to show
03:39 - you external CSS which is used most
03:42 - often
03:42 - so my CSS is going to be really to write
03:46 - your style in the tag so in the in this
03:49 - element itself on it start that you put
03:53 - style attribute and then in these
03:56 - quotation marks you can put really the
03:59 - property that you want to style and then
04:01 - its value and as you can see here we are
04:03 - offered with multiple properties that
04:06 - properties that we can style for this h1
04:08 - tag and the one that I want to use is
04:11 - going to be for example color like this
04:14 - and then after I've specified the
04:18 - property name itself I'm going to really
04:20 - write the color that I want
04:23 - this text to be off so I'm going to use
04:25 - for example hot pink color okay
04:30 - and now if I save this and then refresh
04:34 - my web browser page here you can see
04:37 - that this heading has become of this hot
04:39 - pink color okay so that is one thing
04:42 - that I want to show you and then what
04:44 - style this paragraph text as well so
04:47 - this paragraph element I want to style
04:50 - differently so I want to say for example
04:53 - that for my paragraph tag I want to
04:55 - style background color so this property
04:58 - here and for that let's use green let's
05:03 - say this green yellow color and here you
05:06 - can really specify the name of your
05:08 - color or you can put this RGB value
05:11 - meaning red green and blue and you can
05:15 - as well put here hexadecimal code of
05:18 - your color and for now we are going to
05:20 - use only this green yellow name of a
05:24 - color so if I save that and then refresh
05:27 - my page you can see that this here has
05:30 - become of this greenish color that we
05:33 - have specified here okay so that would
05:36 - be really styling these elements in
05:39 - lines so this is called inline CSS
05:42 - because we specified that CSS in this
05:46 - element itself so in this start tag of
05:49 - an element and now I want to show you
05:52 - another way of writing CSS and that is
05:54 - going to be really writing internal CSS
05:57 - so what is internal CSS that means that
06:01 - you can put your CSS so your style in
06:04 - this head section in this style text so
06:08 - I'm going to write style and then here
06:13 - so between the start tag and instead I'm
06:16 - going to put the name of my element and
06:19 - that is going to be for example this P
06:22 - tag so I want to style my paragraph and
06:25 - then in these curly brackets we are
06:27 - going to specify the style for this P
06:29 - tag and this style is going to be
06:32 - applied on all paragraph tags that we
06:35 - have in this
06:36 - HTML document so here I'm going to say
06:40 - for example that I want to style the
06:42 - font size of this P element and I'm
06:47 - going to say that that font size should
06:49 - be for example 20 pixels okay and after
06:53 - I have saved it I can refresh it and as
06:56 - you can see this paragraph now has this
06:59 - size of 20 pixels and this here is going
07:04 - to be applied on all paragraph tags in
07:06 - my HTML document so in this body section
07:11 - and just to prove that I'm going to add
07:13 - another paragraph and I'm going to say P
07:16 - and let's say this is second paragraph
07:21 - like this okay also I have saved it and
07:26 - now if i refresh it you can see that my
07:28 - second paragraph has appeared and it has
07:31 - the same font size as this one here but
07:34 - it does not have this green yellow
07:36 - background color because we have
07:38 - specified this inline CSS only on this
07:41 - first paragraph and that's why only this
07:44 - first paragraph has this greenish
07:46 - background but this one does not have
07:48 - any background at all so for that I'm
07:52 - going to move this background color from
07:55 - this my CSS into this internal CSS so
08:00 - I'm going to copy that control C and
08:03 - then placed it here and now if I save it
08:07 - and reload my page once more you can see
08:11 - that this paragraph two has gotten this
08:13 - green yellow background color and that
08:16 - means that now we can really remove this
08:19 - inline CSS from our first paragraph and
08:23 - this should behave the same when I save
08:25 - it and reload it it has stayed the same
08:29 - okay and let's move this h1 element into
08:35 - this internal CSS as well so here I'm
08:38 - going to say h1 and then put these curly
08:40 - brackets which means in these curly
08:43 - brackets I'm going to specify the style
08:45 - for all h1 elements on my webpage
08:48 - so let's say for example that I want
08:51 - style background color as well and for
08:54 - this background color I'm going to
08:56 - choose well this lavender blush color
08:59 - let's say for example because that's
09:00 - apparently a color so if I save it and
09:03 - then reload it here you can see that our
09:08 - heading has gotten this pink not not
09:11 - pink
09:11 - but this lavender blush background color
09:14 - I'm sorry guys I should probably use
09:16 - normal colors okay so we have styled it
09:20 - with this lavender blush color and let's
09:25 - also add it another property so let's
09:28 - say that we want to style the color
09:29 - itself so for this color I'm going to
09:34 - use for example red okay and now if I
09:39 - save this document and try to reload it
09:42 - here what do you expect that is going to
09:44 - happen well I did in a comments down
09:45 - below so if I reload it you can see that
09:48 - nothing has changed and why has that
09:51 - happened why Notting has changed because
09:53 - as you can see here we have specified
09:55 - red color but here we have still this
09:58 - hot pink color as the color for this
10:01 - heading and this this my CSS really has
10:05 - priority over this internal CSS because
10:08 - any time that you specify inline CSS for
10:12 - your element that is going to be really
10:14 - of a higher priority than your internal
10:17 - CSS so the priorities of these types of
10:21 - CSS go in a following way so the biggest
10:24 - priority has this in my CSS after dad
10:29 - the priority has this internal CSS so
10:32 - whatever you put in these style tags and
10:35 - then though these priority has external
10:37 - CSS but that is the one that is most
10:40 - used most so if I delete this my CSS now
10:45 - I'm going to save my document and then
10:49 - I'm going to reload my page and then as
10:52 - you can see our heading has become of
10:54 - this red color that we have specified
10:56 - here so now we have really removed all
10:59 - the styling from this
11:01 - my CSS to this internal CSS and this
11:06 - internal CSS is one way to style your
11:09 - page as well but neither the inline CSS
11:12 - nor the internal CSS are used that often
11:16 - and the one that is used most is going
11:19 - to be external CSS but why what is your
11:22 - reason well if you remember when we had
11:25 - that style for our paragraph tag here so
11:28 - inline style for this paragraph if you
11:31 - can remember that that was not really
11:34 - applied on any other paragraph tag but
11:36 - this one here okay so we have changed
11:40 - that when we moved that paragraph style
11:42 - to our internal CSS so with this with
11:46 - this code here we have said please style
11:47 - all my paragraph tags in this page but
11:50 - when you build a website you usually
11:53 - have your website consisting of more
11:56 - than one page and usually I want to
11:58 - apply the same styling for all of those
12:00 - pages and that is why external CSS is
12:04 - used meaning that you create a different
12:06 - file for your style and then you apply
12:09 - that file on all the HTML pages so on
12:12 - all the web pages that your site
12:14 - consists of and now I'm going to show
12:17 - you how you can create external CSS so
12:21 - I'm going to say file and then new file
12:25 - and here I have been presented with this
12:28 - untitled empty document so I'm going to
12:31 - save it ctrl s and I'm going to save it
12:34 - on my desktop so the same location where
12:37 - my where this my first webpage HTML
12:41 - document is that is very important so
12:44 - I'm going to name it style and the
12:48 - extension that you use for CSS files is
12:51 - going to be dot C SS okay so when I say
12:56 - that you can see that now it really
12:59 - looks different than it did before so it
13:02 - has this dot CSS extension and then here
13:05 - you can really move all of this internal
13:08 - CSS so I'm going to copy it and then I'm
13:12 - going to paste it
13:14 - here and now I can delete this style tag
13:19 - from my head section so I'm going to
13:21 - delete that and I'm going to save my
13:23 - document and now if I try to refresh
13:26 - this page you can see that all of my
13:29 - styling has disappeared and why is that
13:32 - happened well as we deleted that Styles
13:36 - tag from this head tag so from this page
13:39 - we have really deleted all the Styles we
13:42 - have moved them to a different file
13:44 - which is this one here and I'm going to
13:47 - save that file and in order to have
13:49 - those styles so these Styles here
13:53 - applied to your HTML page you really
13:56 - have to link this file to this HTML page
13:59 - so you have to say please use styles
14:03 - from a separate file which is going to
14:04 - be this one here and in order to do that
14:08 - we use link tag which is this one here
14:13 - and we have to specify two attributes to
14:16 - our link tag the first one is going to
14:18 - be this relationship attribute so you
14:21 - say arielle and then if you hover over
14:24 - it it says this attribute names a
14:27 - relationship of the linked document to
14:29 - the current to the current document okay
14:32 - so this attribute here is going to
14:35 - specify the relationship of this style
14:38 - CSS file to my HTML page and that
14:42 - relationship is style sheet like this
14:49 - okay so this Styles dot CSS is a style
14:53 - sheet for this web page and then the
14:56 - second attribute that you have to
14:57 - specify is going to be the location so
15:00 - where is this house dot CSS file and
15:04 - that is going to be really using H ref
15:07 - attribute like this and since this file
15:12 - here and this file here both have the
15:14 - same location so both of these files are
15:17 - on C users celina desktop and this one
15:21 - as well so C user selina desktop you can
15:24 - really specify just the name of the
15:26 - Styles file so you can see style dot CSS
15:31 - okay
15:32 - and now if I see these changes and
15:36 - refresh my webpage as you can see all
15:38 - these Styles appeared again so now we
15:41 - have again these styles that we have
15:43 - specified externally so in the external
15:46 - file and we have linked that file using
15:50 - this linked link tag and now we have
15:53 - really styled our web page using
15:55 - external CSS and now if you had multiple
15:58 - plate pages you can really just link
16:01 - this file the styles that CSS file to
16:04 - multiple pages and all of them are going
16:06 - to have a similar theme similar style
16:09 - one more thing that I want to show you
16:11 - is what is going to happen if I move for
16:14 - example this style dot CSS file so here
16:17 - we have specified only the name of our
16:20 - style file and that is because both of
16:24 - these files so both this HTML document
16:27 - and this CSS document are on the same
16:29 - location so that is this one here so
16:32 - disk c users so Deena desktop and then
16:35 - this one here is as well on disk C users
16:39 - sadena and then desktop and because of
16:42 - that we could only specify the name of
16:44 - our Styles file which is style dot CSS
16:47 - but what is going to happen if I for
16:50 - example move this file so what is going
16:53 - to happen if I create a new folder which
16:56 - I'm going to call let's say Styles okay
17:00 - and then I take this style dot CSS file
17:04 - which is this one here so this one that
17:07 - we have written here and linked here I
17:10 - take it and move it in my Styles folder
17:13 - so let's try to open this page again so
17:18 - I'm going to just reload it and as you
17:21 - can see we have lost our Styles again
17:23 - and why has that happened well because
17:27 - this style dot CSS is not available
17:30 - anymore on this location and this is the
17:32 - location where your HTML page is going
17:36 - to try to look for this file but since
17:39 - the location destination folder of this
17:42 - style dot CSS file has changed we have
17:45 - to really specify a new path to this
17:47 - file and let's check that path so I'm
17:51 - going to open this folder which I have
17:52 - created and then I'm going to right
17:54 - click on my style dot CSS and then click
17:57 - properties and here I have the location
18:02 - to my style file and that is going to be
18:05 - C users salvina desktop and then this
18:09 - Styles folder as well okay and then as
18:14 - you can see here it is going to look for
18:16 - this style dot CSS on C user solving a
18:19 - desktop which means that we are missing
18:21 - this part of pad here so this Styles
18:24 - folder so in order to fix the problem
18:28 - that we have we have to really specify
18:31 - that part of a pet here so I'm going to
18:34 - write styles and then put this flash so
18:39 - please try to look for this style CSS on
18:43 - this path and then add this Styles
18:46 - folder as well and then this is the name
18:48 - of the file that you are going to
18:49 - include so after I have saved it if I
18:53 - try to reload my page again you can see
18:55 - that my Styles have reappeared okay so I
19:00 - hope that you understood what is CSS and
19:04 - that you understood different types of
19:05 - CSS so we have talked about inline CSS
19:08 - internal and external CSS and the
19:12 - external CSS is this one here and that
19:16 - is the one that is used most often even
19:18 - though it is not wrong to use inline or
19:22 - internal CSS and we probably will
19:25 - sometime use the my CSS sometimes use
19:28 - the internal and external CSS as well so
19:32 - it really depends on what you need so it
19:35 - depends on your needs whether you want
19:36 - style a single tag in that case you can
19:40 - use inline CSS if you want to style all
19:42 - the page so a single page you can use
19:45 - internal CSS and then if you have
19:47 - multiple pages that you want to style
19:48 - you can use this external CSS and that
19:52 - often the case in in real life so you
19:54 - often have a website that consists of
19:57 - multiple pages so I hope that you
