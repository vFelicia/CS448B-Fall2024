00:00 - hi everyone welcome to my channel
00:03 - my name is saldina and i make it and
00:05 - programming related videos
00:07 - so if that is something that is of
00:09 - interest to you consider subscribing to
00:11 - my channel
00:12 - and give this video a thumbs up as well
00:15 - now in this video i want to show you
00:17 - how you can build an atm application
00:20 - and the first thing that i want to do in
00:22 - order to build this application is going
00:24 - to be
00:24 - to plan the functionalities that this
00:27 - application is going to have
00:28 - so i'm going to put a comment here and
00:31 - then here we are going to write
00:33 - all the functionalities that our atm is
00:36 - going to have
00:37 - so the first one is going to be to check
00:39 - the balance so i'm going to write that
00:44 - so check balance and then another
00:47 - functionality is going to be
00:49 - to deposit money so let's say deposit
00:54 - like this okay and then
00:57 - what else well we should be able to
00:59 - withdraw money as well
01:01 - so let's write that
01:04 - okay and i definitely want to show the
01:07 - menu to my user so i'm going to write
01:10 - that as well so i'm going to say show
01:13 - menu like this okay
01:17 - now after we have written these
01:19 - functionalities that we want to
01:21 - implement
01:22 - the first one that i want to implement
01:24 - is going to be this show menu function
01:26 - so i'm going to put the code for this
01:28 - show menu functionality in a function
01:31 - and let's create that function here so
01:34 - i'm going to say
01:35 - void it is going to be of void return
01:38 - type
01:38 - let's call it show menu
01:41 - like this oh like this
01:45 - okay and then what i want to do
01:48 - here is i want to write out the menu to
01:50 - my user so i'm going to say see
01:52 - out and then let's add these star
01:55 - symbols
01:56 - four five six seven eight nine ten that
01:59 - is going to be enough
02:01 - like this and then i'm going to copy
02:03 - this on the other side
02:07 - so that it looks proportional okay
02:10 - and then the first option that i want to
02:12 - write out to my user
02:14 - is going to be uh let's add first
02:18 - and then check balance
02:22 - so that is going to be the first option
02:25 - that our user can choose and then let's
02:28 - add a couple more of these
02:30 - so the second option is going to be
02:33 - deposit so i'm going to write
02:35 - that like this
02:38 - and then the third option is going to be
02:41 - to withdraw so i'm going to copy this
02:43 - here
02:44 - and then paste it here
02:47 - okay and then let's add these star
02:50 - symbols at the end of our menu like this
02:55 - okay now after we have created this
02:59 - show menu function what i want to do is
03:01 - i want to invoke this function
03:04 - so here i'm going to say show
03:07 - menu like this okay
03:11 - and if i run my program
03:16 - as you can see we have this menu
03:19 - shown to our user now what should happen
03:22 - next
03:22 - is we should allow our user to choose
03:25 - one of these three
03:27 - options so the next thing that i will do
03:30 - is i will create a variable so let's
03:33 - create it here
03:34 - let's say and and that variable is going
03:37 - to store the option that our user
03:39 - chooses so i'm going to call it option
03:44 - like this and then here after i have
03:47 - written out
03:47 - this menu so this menu here to my user
03:50 - i'm going to say
03:52 - see out and then please choose an option
03:55 - or
03:56 - whatever message you want to show so
03:58 - option
04:01 - like this and then i want to
04:06 - accept the value that my user enters in
04:08 - this option
04:09 - variable so i'm going to say see in
04:12 - option
04:13 - like this okay now if
04:17 - i run this program again as you can see
04:19 - it asks for
04:20 - option and if i select any of these
04:23 - three
04:24 - options if i press three for example
04:27 - you can see that my program closes
04:29 - because we haven't written
04:30 - any code after this line here
04:34 - so what i want to do now is i want to
04:36 - handle
04:37 - these three options and i'm going to
04:40 - handle these three options
04:41 - using a switch case so i'm going to
04:43 - write
04:44 - switch okay and then
04:48 - here i want to put this option variable
04:51 - so
04:52 - that is going to be the value that i
04:54 - want to check
04:55 - so i'm going to say switch option and
04:58 - then
04:58 - in the case that our user has entered
05:01 - option
05:02 - 1 what i want to do is i want to write
05:06 - out
05:06 - the balance to my user and in order to
05:09 - do that
05:10 - i'm going to create a balance variable
05:12 - because we do not have a balanced
05:13 - variable yet
05:15 - so i'm going to give it a type double
05:18 - like this and call it balance
05:22 - okay and let's assign it initial value
05:24 - of uh for example
05:27 - 500 okay so that is going to be the
05:30 - initial value of our balance
05:32 - um variable so here i'm going to say c
05:35 - out and then let's see
05:38 - balance is
05:42 - okay and then let's write out
05:45 - this balance variable
05:48 - and i'm going to add this dollar symbol
05:51 - at the end and i'm going to add and line
05:53 - as well
05:54 - okay so that is going to happen in the
05:57 - case that our user enters
05:59 - value or option 1 and i'm going to add
06:03 - break at the end of each case so here as
06:07 - well
06:09 - okay now our second case is going to be
06:12 - when our user
06:13 - enters option two like this
06:17 - so in that second case we should allow
06:20 - our user to deposit
06:22 - money so here i'm going to say see out
06:26 - and then let's write out um deposit
06:30 - amount so we want to ask our user how
06:34 - how much money he wants to deposit
06:37 - so in order to accept the value that our
06:39 - user enters i'm going to create a
06:41 - variable which i'm going to call
06:43 - deposit amount so let's create that
06:46 - variable
06:48 - it's going to be of type double and it
06:50 - is going to be called deposit amount
06:55 - like this and then i'm going to accept
06:59 - the value that our user enters here
07:02 - in my deposit amount variable like this
07:06 - okay and now what i want to do with this
07:09 - deposit amount is
07:11 - i want to add it to my balance so i'm
07:13 - going to say
07:14 - balance is now going to be equal to
07:18 - whatever my balance was previously
07:20 - holding plus
07:21 - this deposit amount like this
07:25 - and then let's add break at the end as
07:28 - well
07:29 - okay and then our third option our third
07:32 - case is going to be when our user wants
07:34 - to withdraw
07:35 - money so i'm going to copy this case
07:38 - here
07:39 - and then paste it here and here i want
07:42 - to write out a different message to my
07:44 - user so i'm going to say
07:45 - withdraw amount let's copy this
07:50 - okay and then this variable i'm going to
07:52 - call it
07:54 - withdraw amount like this okay
07:58 - and then here i want to enter that
08:02 - withdraw amount and what i'm going to do
08:04 - with my balance in that situation
08:06 - is going to be i want to subtract that
08:09 - withdraw amount from my balance but
08:12 - i want to subtract that withdrawal
08:15 - amount
08:16 - only in a situation where this
08:18 - withdrawal amount
08:19 - is equal to or less than this balance so
08:23 - i'm going to say here
08:24 - if we draw where it is
08:27 - withdraw amount is less than
08:30 - or equal to balance like this
08:35 - then i want to give that money to my
08:37 - user
08:38 - else meaning if our user has requested
08:41 - more money than he has
08:44 - i'm going to write out a message so i'm
08:45 - going to say
08:47 - not enough money
08:51 - like this okay and
08:54 - that is going to happen so this code
08:57 - here is going to happen
08:58 - in the case that our user enters option
09:02 - three which is this one here okay
09:05 - so now if i run my program
09:09 - you can see that it asks option and
09:12 - let's see that we want
09:13 - this first option so this check balance
09:17 - and it says that
09:18 - balance is 500 and if i press anything
09:21 - else as you can see my program is going
09:23 - to close
09:24 - and that is because we haven't
09:26 - implemented any loop that is going to
09:28 - iterate
09:29 - this code here so let's add that
09:32 - loop now so here i'm going to say
09:36 - do so do while loop is the one that i
09:38 - want to use
09:40 - and then inside my do while loop i'm
09:42 - going to put
09:43 - all of this code here so let's add a
09:46 - curly bracket
09:48 - close curly bracket at the end like this
09:51 - and then i'm going to say please do this
09:54 - block of code here
09:56 - while and then
09:59 - i want to do this code here while
10:02 - the option that my user has end oh
10:05 - option
10:07 - that my user has entered is not equal to
10:10 - 4 and when my user enters option
10:14 - 4 we should stop the execution of our
10:16 - program
10:17 - so in order for our user to know that
10:20 - for means
10:21 - exit we are going to write that here in
10:24 - our show menu
10:25 - function so here i'm going to add this
10:28 - fourth
10:28 - option which is going to exit our
10:31 - program
10:32 - like this okay now if i run this code
10:37 - you can see that it says that it has
10:40 - this
10:41 - menu here and then it asks for option
10:45 - so i'm going to enter option one for
10:46 - example
10:48 - okay and this option one says that
10:51 - balance is 500 dollars
10:54 - now let's enter this second option let's
10:56 - enter this
10:57 - deposit option so i'm going to press 2
11:00 - and as you can see it says please enter
11:02 - a deposit amount so let's say that i
11:04 - want to
11:05 - deposit 700 for example
11:08 - okay now if i check my balance
11:11 - again so i have entered this option one
11:14 - and then i press
11:15 - enter as you can see it says that my
11:17 - balance is one thousand and two hundred
11:19 - dollars
11:20 - and there is one thing that i want to do
11:21 - with this program because i don't like
11:23 - the way that
11:24 - this looks it is not really readable so
11:27 - i'm going to add
11:28 - um clear screen so clear console
11:32 - command and i'm going to add that here
11:35 - so after my user chooses his
11:37 - option i want to clear the console so
11:40 - i'm going to say system
11:43 - and then let's add cls which is a
11:46 - command that is going to clear my
11:48 - console clear my
11:50 - window so if i run my program again
11:53 - as you can see again we have this menu
11:55 - and then it asks
11:57 - us for the option so let's say that i
11:59 - want to check my balance
12:01 - it says that my balance is 500 now let's
12:05 - try to withdraw money let's say that i
12:07 - want to withdraw money and i want to
12:08 - withdraw
12:09 - 600 dollars for example and then it says
12:13 - not enough money because we had 500
12:17 - um on our account so now what i want to
12:20 - do
12:21 - is let's say for example that i want to
12:23 - deposit
12:24 - 100 okay and then i want to withdraw
12:28 - 600 dollars okay and if i check my
12:32 - balance
12:33 - now as you can see balance is zero
12:36 - and in order to test this exit
12:38 - functionality
12:39 - let's press 4 and then if i press enter
12:43 - as you can see my application is going
12:45 - to close
12:46 - now another thing that i want to check
12:48 - is going to be what is going to happen
12:50 - if our user enters option that is not
12:53 - valid meaning an option that is not any
12:56 - of these
12:57 - four that we have covered here so if i
13:00 - run my program again
13:02 - as you can see it asks us to enter
13:05 - options so i'm going to enter option 5
13:07 - for example which is not valid
13:09 - and nothing has happened if i enter
13:12 - option 9
13:13 - nothing has happened again 99 okay
13:16 - now you get the point what is happening
13:18 - here is our
13:20 - program tries to find this adequate
13:23 - option so option five option nine
13:25 - whichever one we have selected
13:28 - and since that option does not exist in
13:30 - these cases here
13:32 - our program continues to this while
13:35 - check
13:35 - and then it checks that the option is
13:37 - not equal to 4 and because our option is
13:39 - 5 or 9 or 99
13:41 - which is not equal to 4 then our do
13:44 - while iterates again and then it writes
13:46 - this show menu
13:48 - again and then it asks us to enter this
13:51 - option
13:51 - again so these three options are the
13:54 - only
13:55 - valid options that you can select and
13:57 - then four means that you are going to
13:59 - exit your program now here
14:03 - we have created this show menu function
14:05 - that has
14:06 - a check balance deposit withdraw and
14:09 - then this
14:10 - exit option and what i want to suggest
14:13 - to you
14:14 - is how you can upgrade this program on
14:17 - your own
14:17 - so for example you can create two users
14:21 - two accounts and what you can do with
14:23 - those two users
14:24 - is you can implement transfer option
14:27 - meaning
14:27 - um transfer money from one account to
14:30 - the other account
14:32 - and i'm going to leave that up to you
14:34 - and if some of you decide to
14:36 - write that code make sure to paste it in
14:38 - the comments down below and i'm going to
14:39 - review that code and some other people
14:41 - may find it useful as well
14:43 - so i hope that you enjoyed this video if
14:46 - you did
