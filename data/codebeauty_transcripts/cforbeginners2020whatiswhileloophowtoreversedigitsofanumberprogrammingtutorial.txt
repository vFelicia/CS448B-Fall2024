00:00 - hi everyone welcome to my channel
00:02 - welcome to another video of C++ for
00:04 - beginners and first things first make
00:07 - sure to subscribe to my channel and hit
00:09 - that Bell icon as well and share this
00:11 - video with everyone it really helps me
00:13 - to reach a lot more people and in this
00:16 - video I want to show you how you can
00:17 - reverse a number so your user is going
00:20 - to enter a number and what we want to do
00:22 - is we want to write out that number in
00:25 - Reverse so reverse the order of the
00:27 - digits of that number and here I have
00:31 - opened my visual studio so let's copy
00:34 - the text of this task like this and the
00:39 - first thing that we need to do is we
00:41 - need to really create a variable so
00:43 - let's say int number like this so that
00:46 - our user can enter his value in this
00:49 - variable here so let's write out a
00:51 - message to our user so let's say C out
00:55 - number like this so that our user knows
00:58 - that he should enter a number and then
01:01 - let's accept that value in our number
01:04 - variable Oh like this now after our user
01:12 - has entered a number well let's really
01:14 - think about how we are going to solve
01:16 - this problem okay I get it
01:18 - so the first thing that I notice here is
01:22 - that we are missing a variable and that
01:24 - variable is going to be the one that is
01:26 - going to hold our reversed number so
01:28 - let's declare it here I'm going to add
01:31 - it here and I'm going to call it let's
01:34 - say reversed number like this and I'm
01:41 - initially going to assign it a value of
01:43 - zero okay and know the algorithm that we
01:48 - are going to use in order to solve this
01:50 - task in order to reverse our number so
01:53 - the algorithm that we are going to use
01:55 - is going to be the following
01:56 - so this reverse number here it is
02:00 - holding a value of zero initially and
02:02 - this number here is the one that our
02:04 - user enters so let's say for example
02:07 - that our user enters a value of 123 like
02:11 - this so 1 2 3
02:13 - so how we are going to reverse this
02:16 - number here the algorithm is going to be
02:19 - following so we are going to iterate
02:21 - through this number here so all the
02:24 - digits of this number here we are going
02:28 - to go through those and in each
02:30 - iteration we are going to do the
02:32 - following so the first thing is we are
02:34 - going to say please take this reverse
02:36 - number and multiply it by 10 so 0 times
02:41 - 10 is going to say to stay zero after
02:44 - that what we are going to do is we are
02:45 - going to take this last digit of our
02:48 - number that our user has entered and we
02:51 - are going to add that number to our
02:53 - reverse number so 0 plus 3 and that is
02:57 - going to be equal to 3 and after that we
03:00 - are going to really remove that last
03:03 - digit of our number so I'm going to
03:05 - delete that digit and then in our next
03:08 - iteration what we are going to do is the
03:10 - same thing so we are taking this reverse
03:13 - number we are going to multiply it by 10
03:15 - so I'm going to say 3 times 10 that is
03:18 - going to be equal to 30 and after that
03:23 - we are going to take this last digit of
03:25 - our number and we are going to add that
03:29 - digit to this number here so to this
03:31 - reverse number so 30 plus 2 that is
03:34 - going to be equal to 32 and then we can
03:38 - really remove this last digit here so
03:41 - I'm going to delete it after that we are
03:44 - going to the third iteration and we are
03:46 - doing the same thing so we're taking
03:48 - this reverse number multiplying it by
03:50 - time so 32 times 10 is going to be equal
03:53 - to 320 and then we are taking the last
03:57 - digit of our number this is this one
04:00 - here and we have to add that digit to
04:04 - our reversed number so 320 plus 1 is
04:07 - going to be equal to 321 and after that
04:12 - as we did before we can really delete
04:14 - remove this digit here and then in my
04:18 - next iteration we are going to come here
04:20 - again and our loop is really going to
04:23 - see that there is nothing else left to
04:25 - iterate through so there are
04:27 - more digits and that it is really going
04:29 - to leave that loop and at that moment we
04:32 - are really going to have our reversed
04:33 - number so three two one that is reverse
04:36 - number from the one that our user has
04:38 - initially entered
04:39 - so let's now translate this algorithm
04:42 - into our code so the loop that we are
04:45 - going to use in order to solve this
04:46 - problem here is going to be while loop
04:49 - so I'm going to write while and then in
04:53 - these parentheses here I'm going to
04:54 - really give it an expression that is
04:57 - going to check each time that it wants
04:59 - to run an iteration and what we are
05:02 - going to iterate through are the digits
05:04 - of this number here so the number that
05:06 - our user has entered so I'm going to say
05:08 - please iterate through this part here so
05:13 - execute this block of code here which is
05:16 - currently empty while our number so
05:21 - number where is it is different than
05:25 - zero like this okay and inside here we
05:30 - are going to write out the algorithm
05:32 - that I just explained and the first step
05:34 - of that algorithm was really multiplying
05:37 - our reverse number by ten so I'm going
05:40 - to say reverse number is equal to
05:44 - reverse number times ten like this okay
05:49 - and the shorter way to write this
05:52 - expression here is going to be like this
05:55 - so you can really take this part here
05:57 - delete it and say it like this it is
05:59 - going to do absolutely the same thing so
06:02 - it is going to really multiply our
06:05 - reverse number by ten and then whatever
06:08 - that results in it is going to assign
06:10 - that back to our reversed number so that
06:14 - was the first step the second step in
06:17 - order to reverse our number is going to
06:19 - be really to take the last digit of this
06:21 - number that our user has entered so how
06:25 - can we do that we can do that by
06:27 - modulating this number here by 10 so I'm
06:30 - going to declare a variable let's call
06:32 - it last digit like this and as we
06:38 - already said we can get that
06:40 - digit if we modulate this number here
06:44 - where is it so this number that our user
06:48 - has entered right then okay that is
06:53 - going to give us the last digit of this
06:55 - number here and then what we really want
06:57 - to do is we really want to add that last
07:00 - digit to our reversed number that was
07:03 - one part of this algorithm so the next
07:05 - step so I'm going to say reversed number
07:10 - plus equal to last digit like this or
07:16 - you can write it a longer way but this
07:19 - way I prefer to write it this way but
07:22 - you can as well say reverse number is
07:24 - equal to reverse number plus last digit
07:27 - and after we have added that last digit
07:31 - or reverse number there is one more step
07:33 - left to do and that is to really take
07:36 - that last digit from our number and how
07:39 - we can do that well we can really do
07:42 - that by dividing or a number by 10 so
07:47 - you can say number that is equal to
07:49 - number divided by 10 or number divided
07:52 - equal to 10 whichever way you prefer
07:56 - okay so this is really the algorithm
08:01 - that we explained and this step here you
08:04 - can really write out the shorter way if
08:07 - you want so you can say for example
08:10 - reverse number plus equal to number
08:14 - modulated by 10 like this so you can
08:18 - make your code a bit more readable if
08:22 - you prefer it this way or you can leave
08:24 - this part here and then really add your
08:26 - last digit to your reverse number so now
08:29 - that we have done this algorithm here
08:32 - let's write out our reverse number and
08:35 - see what we have done so I'm going to
08:37 - write out C out and I'm going to say
08:42 - reversed like this okay and I'm going to
08:47 - write out our reversed number
08:52 - okay let me delete these empty spaces
08:55 - and if I run my program now it asks us
09:01 - to enter a number so let's enter number
09:04 - one two three and now if I press enter
09:08 - you can see that our program has really
09:10 - reversed this number here so let's
09:12 - quickly one more time explain how this
09:15 - has happened so our one loop has really
09:17 - iterated through this number here so
09:20 - that in each iteration it is going to do
09:23 - the following so it is going to take our
09:25 - reverse number and initially the
09:28 - Traverse number is equal to zero so it
09:30 - is going to multiply that by ten so it
09:32 - stays zero and after that is going to
09:35 - take the Traverse number and add it the
09:38 - last digit of our number that our user
09:40 - has entered so that is going to be in a
09:42 - first iteration number three so a
09:44 - reverse number in that case becomes
09:46 - three so zero plus three is equal equal
09:50 - to three and after that we are going to
09:52 - really take that last digit from our
09:54 - number that our user has entered so it
09:56 - has taken this three part away and then
09:59 - in the second iteration is coming here
10:02 - it is going to check again whether our
10:04 - number is not equal to zero and our
10:07 - number is going to be 12 in that
10:09 - situation so that is not equal to 0 so
10:12 - it enters here again it execute this
10:15 - block of code here so it says again
10:18 - please multiply my reverse number by 10
10:22 - and assign that again to my reverse
10:23 - number so our reverse number was 3 and
10:26 - if you multiply by 10 if you multiply 3
10:29 - right then you are going to get 30 after
10:32 - that it is taking the last digit of the
10:34 - number that our user has entered which
10:37 - is 2 now because 3 we have taken away in
10:40 - our previous iteration so it is going to
10:43 - add that 2 to my reversed number so
10:45 - number reverse number is going to become
10:47 - 32 now and then it is really going to
10:50 - take that last digit from our number
10:54 - away it is going to divide it by 10 so
10:56 - now we are left with number 1 and our
10:59 - reverse number is equal to 32 and then
11:02 - it goes back to our third iteration
11:05 - it checks again where there are numbers
11:07 - so whether our remaining number is equal
11:09 - to zero and this one here is the value
11:13 - of our number so that is not equal to
11:15 - zero so this condition here is fulfilled
11:17 - it can enter the while loop so it does
11:21 - this algorithm here again so it says
11:23 - please multiply my reverse number by ten
11:26 - our reverse number at this point is 32
11:29 - so when you multiply that by 10 you get
11:32 - 320 and then after that it takes the
11:36 - last digit of our number which is going
11:38 - to be this one so this one here which is
11:42 - the last one remaining so it is going to
11:44 - take this one and add it to my reverse
11:47 - number as you can see here and then it
11:51 - is really going to take that last digit
11:53 - away so it is going to take all of these
11:55 - three digits away so it has taken them
11:57 - in the previous situations and now it
11:59 - has taken this one away as well so our
12:01 - number is equal to zero now and then it
12:05 - goes back to our fourth iteration it
12:08 - checks whether our number is not equal
12:10 - to zero but in this situation our number
12:12 - is equal to zero so it really leaves
12:15 - this loop here so it is not going to
12:18 - enter in this loop anymore and that it
12:20 - goes here and it really writes out the
12:23 - value of our reversed number which is
12:26 - this line of code here so that is how we
12:29 - have reversed our number so I hope that
