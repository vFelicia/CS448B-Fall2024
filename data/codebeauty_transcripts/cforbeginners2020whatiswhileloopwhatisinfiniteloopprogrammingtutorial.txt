00:00 - hi everyone welcome to my channel
00:02 - welcome to another video C++ for
00:04 - beginners and in this video I wanted to
00:07 - talk about loops more specifically about
00:09 - while loop so what are loops what are
00:13 - they used for how they're used while
00:16 - loops are used when you want to execute
00:18 - a block of your code multiple times
00:21 - while a certain condition is true which
00:23 - means you give a certain condition to
00:26 - your loop and you say you are going to
00:28 - execute this block of code while this
00:30 - condition here is true so however many
00:33 - times it is necessary and one thing that
00:37 - I want to mention before we start on our
00:40 - example is the following so selection
00:43 - sequencing and iteration those three are
00:48 - three main building blocks of
00:50 - programming languages and when you
00:53 - really learn and understand those three
00:55 - you should be able to solve any logical
00:58 - programming problem and in this video we
01:01 - are going to talk about iteration we
01:03 - have already talked about sequencing and
01:05 - selection in my previous videos so what
01:09 - is sequencing well that means that your
01:11 - code is executed sequentially which
01:14 - means well mine after the other and then
01:17 - selection that would be really when you
01:20 - want to select one part of the code
01:23 - rather than the another one which means
01:25 - you are going to talk to your program
01:27 - and the research in certain situation it
01:29 - really has to select which block of code
01:31 - it is going to execute the same would be
01:34 - when you for example come to a crossroad
01:36 - and then you have multiple ways in front
01:38 - of you but you really have to select
01:40 - which one you are going to take because
01:43 - you cannot take all of them and then
01:45 - iteration is going to be really
01:48 - iterating or executing multiple times a
01:51 - certain block of code certain part of
01:53 - code while a certain condition is true
01:56 - so while a certain condition is
01:58 - fulfilled you are going to execute the
01:59 - same block of code so let's see our
02:02 - example now so I'm going to paste the
02:05 - text of my program here and this is our
02:10 - task so it says that we have to write
02:12 - out all
02:13 - numbers between 100 and 500 that are
02:17 - divisible by 3 and by 5 and how we are
02:21 - going to do that first I want to explain
02:23 - you the algorithm so how we are going to
02:26 - solve this problem and then we are going
02:28 - to translate that algorithm into our
02:30 - code so this interval here so this 100
02:34 - to 500 interval we are really going to
02:37 - iterate through all of the numbers of
02:40 - this interval and we are going to do
02:43 - that using while loop and then for each
02:46 - of those numbers so for each value of
02:49 - our counter we are going to check
02:51 - whether that counter value can be
02:53 - divided by 3 and by 5 and if yes we will
02:59 - write out that value if now we are just
03:01 - going to continue to the next iteration
03:04 - so as I already said we are going to use
03:07 - while loop to solve this problem and we
03:11 - are going to start our vile loop with
03:14 - the counter value of 100 and in each
03:17 - iteration we are going to really
03:19 - increase the value of our counter so 101
03:22 - 102 and 3 and we are going to stop the
03:26 - execution of our while loop when this
03:29 - counter value comes from 100 to 500 and
03:33 - 1 which means 500 value of counter is
03:37 - going to be our last iteration through
03:39 - our loop so the first thing that I'm
03:43 - going to do is I'm going to really
03:45 - declare a variable that is going to hold
03:47 - our current counter value so I'm going
03:50 - to call it int counter like this and
03:54 - initially I'm going to set the value of
03:57 - my counter to 100 okay so this is our
04:02 - initial value of our counter and then
04:06 - let's see what is the syntax of I'll of
04:09 - our while loop so we write out while
04:12 - like this and then in these parenthesis
04:15 - we are going to put our condition so how
04:18 - long our loop is going to execute and
04:20 - then in these races here so in this
04:25 - curly brackets we are
04:27 - to put which block of code our while
04:29 - loop is going to execute while this
04:32 - condition here is fulfilled and let's
04:34 - now fill these parentheses here so as I
04:37 - said our counter has to go from 100 to
04:40 - 500 which means since it starts on 100
04:45 - here we have to say to our while loop
04:47 - that the execution of this block of code
04:49 - here really has to stop what our counter
04:52 - comes to 500 or 501 500 is still valid
04:57 - value so that we are going to say like
05:00 - this so we are going say counter like
05:04 - this and that we are going to say there
05:07 - are two ways to write this condition the
05:09 - first one is to say while our counter is
05:11 - less or equal to 500 or you could as
05:16 - well said while our counter is less than
05:21 - 501 so that is a valid situation while
05:26 - you're executing your loop so while your
05:29 - counter is less than 501 or while your
05:31 - counter is less or equal to 500 I prefer
05:37 - it this way but whichever way you put it
05:39 - is going to work so now that we have put
05:42 - this condition here we really can write
05:45 - out this code that comes in this while
05:49 - loop block so what we are going to
05:51 - execute while this condition here is
05:53 - true and that is going to be following
05:55 - inside this block of code here we really
05:58 - have to check whether our current value
06:00 - of our counter is divisible by 3 and by
06:05 - 5 and if it is we have to write out that
06:09 - number to our user if now we just need
06:12 - to continue to our next iteration of our
06:15 - loop and how we can check whether this
06:18 - counter value can be divided by 3 and by
06:21 - 5 well we use modulo operation for that
06:24 - if you haven't watched my video on
06:25 - operators I'm going to link it here make
06:28 - sure to watch it and here we really put
06:33 - the following so we can say if and also
06:36 - if you are not familiar with if
06:37 - statement going to link it here
06:40 - so if our countervalue so our current
06:45 - value of our counter after you modulate
06:50 - it with three if the result of that is
06:53 - zero that means that our number so our
06:57 - counter is divisible by three and we
07:01 - also have to check whether our counter
07:03 - is divisible by five as well we use this
07:10 - modulo operation here and we say whether
07:13 - our counter modulated by five is going
07:16 - to equal to zero and if this condition
07:18 - here is fulfilled we really have checked
07:20 - this part of our task and if this part
07:25 - here is true we have to write out that
07:28 - number so in this situation here I'm
07:31 - going to say C out like this and I'm
07:34 - going to put inside here let's see we
07:38 - are going to write out the value of our
07:40 - counter like this and we are going to
07:43 - write out is divisible like this and
07:48 - let's put one end line after this line
07:53 - of code here because we are definitely
07:55 - going to have multiple lines so we want
07:57 - our lines to be formatted nicely okay so
08:01 - this part of code here has really
08:04 - covered this divisible by three and five
08:07 - and write out that number if it is
08:09 - divisible by three and by five and there
08:12 - is really one very important thing that
08:14 - you have to keep in mind each time that
08:16 - you write loops and that is the
08:18 - following so you have to give your loop
08:21 - a way so that it can stop executing this
08:25 - block of code here so under a certain
08:27 - condition it really needs to leave this
08:30 - block of code here because if you don't
08:33 - do that you are going to end up with an
08:36 - infinite loop you are really going to
08:37 - lock your program in an infinite loop
08:40 - situation and this code here this loop
08:43 - here that we have written this is really
08:45 - an infinite loop so let me prove that
08:48 - I'm going to run my program and as you
08:51 - can see
08:52 - the console is empty so I enter any
08:55 - value enter whatever it is not really
08:59 - reacting and why has that happened well
09:02 - your counter value starts with 100 and
09:06 - then it comes to your while loop and
09:08 - your while loop checks this condition
09:10 - here so it checks whether your 100 is
09:12 - less or equal to 500 and the answer to
09:16 - that is yes which means that your
09:18 - program execution can enter this block
09:20 - of code here so it can start executing
09:22 - your loop and then it comes here and it
09:25 - says please check whether my counter
09:27 - which is 100 is divisible by 3 and the
09:30 - answer is no so this part of code here
09:34 - is not even going to be checked because
09:37 - of the nature of this end operator it
09:39 - really needs both of these operands to
09:42 - be true in order for this expression
09:44 - here to be true because this here is not
09:46 - true it's false a hundred is not
09:49 - divisible by 3 it is not even going to
09:52 - check this condition here and this line
09:54 - of code here is not ever going to be
09:57 - written so after that it comes here to
10:01 - this closed curly brace and then because
10:03 - of the nature of while loop when it
10:06 - comes here it really goes back here and
10:09 - then it checks again your value of your
10:12 - counter whether that is less or equal to
10:14 - 500 but nothing has changed your counter
10:17 - value is still 100 and then it is going
10:20 - to enter again here and then really
10:22 - repeat that process over and over again
10:25 - and your program because of that is
10:28 - going to be locked inside an infinite
10:30 - loop so let me prove that really because
10:33 - here we have an empty console and you
10:35 - cannot see what is happening in the
10:37 - background so I'm going to stop my
10:39 - program and I'm going to write out here
10:42 - let's write out see out like this and
10:47 - let's write out infinite loop and if I
10:51 - run my program now as you can see your
10:54 - program has really entered in an
10:56 - infinite loop and it is writing out this
10:59 - infinite loop text for infinite number
11:03 - of times so as you can see
11:05 - it says infinite loop okay and this
11:10 - execution here is not really going to
11:13 - stop until your programs memory is full
11:15 - and then it's going to crash so whatever
11:18 - code indicates that you had some code
11:21 - here it is not ever going to be executed
11:25 - so I'm going to stop this here and I'm
11:29 - going to delete this part of good here
11:31 - because we don't really need it what we
11:33 - need is we need to put here a certain
11:36 - code that is going to help our loop to
11:39 - really stop the execution at the certain
11:42 - point and the code that we need to put
11:44 - here is going to be really Foley it's
11:46 - going to be counter plus plus like this
11:51 - what this code of here this code here is
11:55 - going to do in each iteration it is
11:58 - going to check whether this condition
11:59 - here is true if yes it is going to write
12:02 - out this part of code here and then in
12:05 - each iteration it is going to really
12:06 - increase the value of your counter by
12:10 - one which means in your first iteration
12:12 - is going to be 100 after that it's going
12:14 - to be 101 102 103 and it is going to
12:19 - really go until it comes to 500 that is
12:23 - going to be the last iteration of your
12:25 - program and then when it comes to 501
12:28 - this condition here is not going to be
12:30 - true anymore and then your loop is going
12:34 - to check really whether 501 is less or
12:37 - equal to 500 and the answer to that is
12:40 - not going to be no so your program is
12:44 - going to really stop the execution of
12:47 - this loop and come here and then really
12:49 - stop your program so if I run the
12:53 - program now I'm going to prove that okay
12:56 - so this has been executed very fast and
12:59 - as you can see this is the result of
13:02 - your program it has really written out
13:05 - all the numbers that are divisible by 3
13:08 - and by 5 and you can check all of these
13:10 - numbers using your calculator if you
13:13 - want so
13:16 - with this expression here with this
13:19 - counter plus plus we have really both
13:21 - iterated through all the numbers between
13:23 - 100 and 500 because we check our counter
13:27 - value here and that also we have we have
13:32 - really given a way to our loop to stop
13:34 - the execution of this block of code here
13:37 - when this counter value comes to 501 and
13:42 - this is the result of our program okay
13:47 - so I hope that you have liked this video
