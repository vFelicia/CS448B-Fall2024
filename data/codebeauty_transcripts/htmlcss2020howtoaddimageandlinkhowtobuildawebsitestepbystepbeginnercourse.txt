00:00 - hi everyone welcome to my channel
00:02 - welcome to another HTML and CSS for
00:04 - beginners and this video is going to be
00:07 - the one where I show you how you can
00:08 - build your own website and why I decided
00:12 - to make this video this early in the
00:14 - course it is because I really want to
00:16 - show you how you can build something
00:18 - practical even if you have very very
00:21 - beginner knowledge of HTML and CSS so
00:24 - rather than me showing you a bunch of
00:26 - concepts that you are not going to know
00:28 - how to combine and how to put together
00:30 - in order to build something I wanted to
00:33 - show you myself how you can build
00:35 - something practical and useful even if
00:37 - you are on a very very beginner level of
00:40 - learning HTML and CSS and that is going
00:43 - to be a very basic website so the things
00:47 - that we learn in this course are really
00:49 - going to be the core the foundation and
00:51 - are going to be applicable throughout
00:53 - this course and the later in the videos
00:55 - of this course we are going to learn how
00:57 - we can really add more elements and how
00:59 - we can really style this website so that
01:02 - it looks much more presentable that it
01:04 - is going to look in this particular
01:06 - video so here I have this website that I
01:10 - want to show you how you can build and
01:12 - as you can see it consists of three
01:15 - sections so three pages it is this home
01:18 - page and then this courses and social
01:22 - media part as well so when I navigate
01:25 - myself on this home section here I want
01:28 - to show you how you can put an image to
01:30 - your website and I have also I have
01:33 - written some description about my
01:34 - channel and I have to put description
01:36 - about one of my previous courses that I
01:38 - have made so it is C++ course if you are
01:41 - interested you can check it out on my
01:43 - channel it is beginner course as well so
01:47 - that is about this home section and then
01:50 - on this course is part of my website you
01:52 - can find all of the courses that I have
01:54 - made so far and published on my channel
01:57 - and then here on this social media part
02:00 - of my website I have listed all of my
02:03 - social media platforms so for example if
02:06 - you click on this code Beauty YouTube
02:08 - channel as you can see you are going to
02:10 - be navigated to my code Beauty
02:12 - YouTube's profile so here you can find
02:16 - all of the videos that I have published
02:18 - so far and this one is not ready so it
02:21 - is private that's why it does not have
02:23 - thumbnails yet so I'm going to close
02:25 - this and then there is one thing that I
02:28 - want you to pay attention and there is
02:29 - going to be where is this link going to
02:32 - be open so for example if I click on my
02:34 - Instagram account so I click on this
02:37 - link here I want you to pay attention
02:39 - that it is going to be opened in a
02:41 - separate tab and that is because we
02:44 - really don't want to navigate the
02:46 - visitors of our website away from our
02:49 - website but we want to open this in a
02:51 - separate tab so when I click it as you
02:55 - can see it is opened as part of a
02:56 - separate tab oh I have notifications
02:59 - nice and the first thing that I want to
03:02 - do is going to be to create a folder on
03:04 - my desktop and we are going to use that
03:06 - folder in order to put all of the files
03:08 - that we create in this tutorial so I'm
03:11 - going to create a folder on my desktop
03:13 - and I'm going to call that folder
03:15 - website like this and then let's create
03:19 - three HTML documents inside this folder
03:23 - and those three are going to be our home
03:25 - page our courses and then our social
03:28 - media so I'm going to name those index
03:30 - dot HTML which is going to be our home
03:32 - page and then our course is going to be
03:35 - courses dot HTML and then social media
03:38 - dot HTML and for that I'm going to use
03:41 - my visual studio code okay and I'm going
03:46 - to say new file and now I'm going to
03:48 - create my index dot HTML so I'm going to
03:51 - save this file this empty file in this
03:55 - website folder and I'm going to name it
03:58 - index dot HTML like this so this is
04:02 - going to be our home page and then let's
04:05 - create two more so this one I'm going to
04:09 - save also inside this website folder and
04:12 - I'm going to name it courses dot HTML
04:17 - like this and then the third one is
04:21 - going to be saved also in this folder
04:24 - and
04:25 - is going to be social media HTML like
04:32 - this okay so we have created these three
04:36 - files and the next thing that I want to
04:38 - do is going to be really to put our
04:40 - basic HTML structure inside each of
04:43 - these three files so here I'm going to
04:45 - paste this basic structure and I'm going
04:48 - to save it and then here as well also
04:51 - save it and then in this third file as
04:54 - well I'm going to place my basic HTML
04:57 - structure and let's first create this
05:00 - index dot HTML page so here what I want
05:04 - to put in my body section is going to be
05:06 - an image and I want to put a paragraph
05:09 - of text where I'm going to describe
05:11 - really what this website is going to be
05:14 - about and let me show you something and
05:17 - that is going to be this images folder
05:19 - here so here I have prepared all of the
05:23 - images which we are going to be using in
05:25 - order to build this website so here I
05:27 - have six images so I'm going to put this
05:32 - images folder inside my website folder
05:34 - so that we have all of the files that we
05:37 - are going to be using in this website
05:39 - folder okay
05:41 - and if I open this website folder you
05:44 - can see that it consists of these three
05:46 - files these three HTML files which we
05:49 - have just created so index courses and
05:52 - social media and then this images folder
05:55 - as well okay so the first thing that I
05:58 - want to do now is going to be to put
06:00 - this banner image on my index dot HTML
06:03 - so I'm going to open my visual studio
06:06 - code and in order to put an image to
06:09 - your HTML file you have to use tag for
06:13 - that so I'm going to use image tag so
06:17 - you say IMG and then in order to specify
06:20 - which image you want you have to put
06:22 - source to that image so you have to
06:25 - really specify the location of that
06:27 - image so you say as RC and then here in
06:32 - these quotations you specify the path to
06:36 - that image
06:37 - and as you can see the pet of our index
06:39 - of HTML is this see users Selena desktop
06:44 - website and then our images are really
06:48 - as well in this website folder but in
06:51 - another folder so one folder deeper and
06:54 - that is images folder so we have to
06:57 - specify that here I'm going to say
06:59 - please look on this location here but
07:02 - only one folder deeper so that folder is
07:05 - images like this and then the name of
07:10 - our image is going to be banner okay I'm
07:14 - going to save that and I'm going to
07:16 - check one more time so the name is
07:18 - banner and then one very important thing
07:21 - is that you have to specify the
07:23 - extension of your image and how you can
07:26 - check out the extension of your image
07:28 - you can right click on your image
07:30 - properties and here you see that the
07:33 - extension of my image is dot PNG so I
07:37 - have to put that here as well so I'm
07:41 - going to say banner dot P and G like
07:45 - this okay
07:46 - and now I'm going to try to open this
07:50 - index dot HTML so I'm going to look for
07:53 - it in this folder where I have created
07:55 - it and here I'm going to say right click
07:57 - and then open with Google Chrome okay
08:01 - and this has opened I'm going to close
08:04 - other tabs and as you can see we have
08:07 - shown this banner image on our web page
08:10 - so that was the first thing and beneath
08:13 - this image I want to put a paragraph of
08:16 - text which is going to be this one here
08:19 - okay so it is just basic description so
08:24 - I make programming videos on YouTube
08:26 - code beauty YouTube channel and then
08:28 - here is a description of one of the
08:30 - other tutorials that I have made on my
08:32 - channel it is C++ for beginners if you
08:35 - want you can check it out I'm going to
08:37 - link it here and also in the description
08:39 - of this video and then another thing
08:42 - that I want to add is going to be
08:44 - heading so here I'm going to use h1 tag
08:48 - I'm going to say that the heading for my
08:51 - index dot HTML is going to be cold like
08:55 - this so now that I have saved it and if
08:59 - i refresh it you can see that our text
09:02 - and then our title so our heading
09:04 - actually has appeared here so we have
09:08 - finished this index dot HTML for now
09:10 - let's focus now on our courses dot HTML
09:15 - and this courses dot HTML I'm going to
09:19 - use in order to list all the courses
09:21 - that I have made on my channel and for
09:24 - that I'm going to use a tag which is
09:27 - called unordered list
09:29 - so here I'm going to say you ow
09:33 - meaning unordered list and then in order
09:37 - to put items inside my list I'm going to
09:41 - use another tag which is going to be
09:43 - list item like this so Li and then here
09:49 - as the first item I want to put for
09:52 - example C++ for beginners like this so
09:58 - this is going to be the first item of
10:00 - our list and then I'm going to copy this
10:03 - a couple more times
10:05 - ok and then let's say that my second
10:09 - course was C++ functions like this and
10:13 - then third course was C++ interview
10:18 - questions like this and then fourth
10:24 - course is this one which is HTML and CSS
10:29 - okay so this is an ordered list which
10:33 - has four items
10:35 - the first one is C++ for beginners text
10:38 - after that we have C++ functions C++
10:42 - interview questions and then HTML and
10:44 - CSS and let's also add heading for
10:47 - discourses dot dot HTML as well so I'm
10:51 - going to use h1 tag and I'm going to say
10:55 - that the heading for this is going to be
10:58 - courses like this
11:01 - so now I will have to open this courses
11:04 - dot HTML in order to see the changes
11:06 - that we have made so here I'm going to
11:10 - really copy this path and then I'm going
11:13 - to open a new browser okay like this and
11:18 - then here I'm going to just modify this
11:21 - index dot HTML into courses dot HTML
11:25 - like this so oh it is
11:28 - courses not vs. okay and as you can see
11:33 - our page has been open so this is also
11:36 - one way to navigate yourself to your web
11:39 - page so you can navigate yourself
11:41 - directly through this address bar or you
11:45 - can right click on your file and say
11:46 - open with and then choose your browser
11:49 - so here we have our courses dot HTML and
11:53 - it is ready as well for now and then the
11:57 - third one is going to be this one here
11:59 - so social media dot HTML and here I want
12:03 - to specify links to my social media
12:06 - profiles you are going to specify the
12:08 - links to yours but the first thing that
12:10 - we have to learn is going to be how you
12:12 - can really specify a link so for that we
12:17 - use anchor tag which is this tag here so
12:20 - you say eh
12:21 - and that here as content you put the
12:24 - text or an image or whatever you want to
12:27 - be shown to your user so you put that
12:30 - here and then here in this start tag you
12:35 - use href attribute in order to specify
12:38 - the link so here I'm going to say each
12:41 - raft and then the link that I want to
12:45 - navigate my user to is going to be this
12:48 - link here so I'm going to just paste
12:51 - this link here like this and then the
12:54 - text that I want to show to my user is
12:57 - going to be just this one here so I'm
13:00 - going to say if you want to navigate
13:02 - yourself to code Beauty you are going to
13:06 - be really navigated to this link here
13:09 - and you will have to click to this text
13:11 - here so now if I say
13:13 - if this and then I'm going to really
13:17 - navigate myself to my social media so
13:20 - you can do that either really modifying
13:23 - this address text or you can right-click
13:27 - on your file and say open with Google
13:31 - Chrome and here as you can see we have
13:34 - this code beauty link so now if I click
13:37 - on this you can see that we are going to
13:41 - be taken to my YouTube channel
13:44 - okay and the thing that I wanted to show
13:48 - you is going to be really how you can
13:50 - open this link in a separate tab and for
13:54 - that you use attribute which is called
13:59 - target like this and then the value for
14:04 - that active attribute is going to be
14:05 - blank like this okay so now that I have
14:10 - saved this and if i refresh my page and
14:13 - click on this link again you can see
14:16 - that my YouTube channel is going to be
14:18 - opened in a separate tab and my
14:22 - connection is a bit slow but as you can
14:24 - see it has been opened in a separate tab
14:27 - so now I'm going to close this and as
14:30 - you can see here is my link so now we
14:34 - are going to use this logic here in
14:36 - order to build a list of links okay and
14:41 - the one more thing that I want to show
14:44 - you before that it's going to be really
14:46 - as I already said you can specify text
14:50 - here or you can put an image or really
14:52 - any other element so here I want to put
14:55 - an image so as a content of my anchor
15:00 - tag I'm going to put image and text as
15:03 - well so we are going to use image tag
15:06 - and the source of our image is going to
15:10 - be specified by a source attribute and
15:14 - here we are going to put the location of
15:17 - our image and that location is going to
15:21 - be images /youtube so
15:26 - it is this location here so it is C user
15:30 - Selina desktop website which is really
15:33 - the location of our HTML document and
15:36 - then this folder here so images and then
15:39 - YouTube dot PNG okay so I'm going to
15:45 - specify that part of that here so I'm
15:47 - going to say images slash YouTube okay
15:52 - YouTube dot P and G like this so now my
15:58 - dot HTML document is going to look for
16:01 - this image on this here and then it is
16:05 - going to add this images folder and the
16:07 - name of my image is going to be YouTube
16:09 - dot PNG it is really important to
16:13 - specify this extension of your image so
16:16 - now that I see this and refresh my page
16:19 - you can see that this image has appeared
16:22 - but we really have the problem with the
16:25 - size of this image so I'm going to
16:27 - change the size of this image I'm going
16:30 - to say that this image is going to have
16:33 - the width of for example 30 pixels I
16:37 - think that is going to be enough so now
16:41 - that I have saved it and if i refresh it
16:44 - you can see that our image has been
16:46 - proportionally scaled so we have set the
16:49 - width of our image to 30 pixels and it's
16:51 - height has as well been scaled so we
16:55 - have specified one link here and let's
16:58 - format this so that it looks a bit more
17:01 - readable so we have anchor tag which is
17:05 - going to navigate as to this location so
17:08 - to this youtube / c / code beauty which
17:12 - is my channel and it is going to open
17:14 - that in a new tab so because we have
17:17 - specified this target attribute and what
17:21 - is going to be shown to our user is
17:22 - going to be this image so this YouTube
17:26 - dot PNG and that this code duty text as
17:29 - well okay so now I really want to
17:32 - specify other lengths so links of my
17:35 - other social media
17:37 - I'm going to use a list for debt so I'm
17:40 - going to use once more unordered list so
17:43 - I'm going to say ul and then as first
17:46 - list item I'm going to use this code
17:50 - here so this is going to be the first
17:52 - item off my list so I'm going to cut it
17:55 - from here and then paste it here okay
17:58 - and then the second list item is going
18:03 - to be linked to my for example Instagram
18:07 - so I'm going to copy this okay and then
18:11 - here I'm going to specify the link to my
18:13 - Instagram profile so I'm going to copy
18:16 - that
18:17 - it is this link here like this
18:23 - okay and then here I'm going to use my
18:27 - username on Instagram which is this one
18:30 - here like this and here I want to
18:33 - specify image of so Instagram icon
18:36 - Instagram image and the name of that
18:38 - image is Instagram oh okay and it is as
18:44 - well on this same pad so on this same
18:46 - location as my YouTube dot PNG and it
18:49 - also has the same format as my YouTube
18:52 - image but if you need you can check that
18:55 - here so you can really check the name of
18:58 - your image and the extension as well
19:01 - okay so now that I save this and I try
19:08 - to reload it you can see that we have
19:10 - built a list that consists of two items
19:13 - the first one is this code beauty
19:16 - so YouTube channel and then the second
19:18 - one is this true code beauty so
19:20 - Instagram profile and let's add one more
19:23 - oh I have closed this so let's add one
19:27 - more and it is going to be my Twitter
19:29 - account so I'm going to copy this list
19:33 - item once more and here I'm going to
19:35 - specify href so I'm going to specify the
19:38 - link to my Twitter profile so I'm going
19:41 - to copy that from here and I'm going to
19:46 - paste it so this is my Twitter
19:50 - and I'm going to use this Twitter name
19:52 - here and here I want to use Twitter
19:56 - image so I'm going to say Twitter and as
20:00 - well I know the name of this image and
20:03 - its extension you will have to check
20:04 - check that one out in your folder so
20:07 - here I have this Twitter image which has
20:11 - the extension dot PNG and I have
20:13 - specified it here so I'm going to close
20:16 - this and now that I have saved this I'm
20:19 - going to reload my page once more and as
20:23 - you can see my Twitter my Twitter item
20:26 - my Twitter profile has appeared here as
20:29 - well and if I want to test this I'm
20:31 - going to click for example on my
20:34 - Instagram anchor tag here and as you can
20:38 - see my Instagram profile has been opened
20:42 - in a separate tab so I'm going to close
20:44 - this and now we have really built all of
20:49 - these three pages so we have our index
20:52 - page we have our courses and then we
20:54 - have our social media as well
20:56 - so the next thing that I want to show
20:59 - you it's going to be really how you can
21:02 - link these three together so now we are
21:04 - going to build the menu so that we can
21:06 - navigate ourselves through these three
21:09 - pages and for that I'm going to use so
21:14 - let's start building that on our index
21:16 - dot HTML so here and for that I'm going
21:19 - to use another tag that I haven't shown
21:23 - you and that is going to be a div tag
21:26 - and this div tag is really used in order
21:29 - to group elements together so let's say
21:32 - that it is a kind of a container and for
21:35 - now I'm going to use that div tag in
21:37 - order to put my menu tags together and
21:41 - in order to create a menu I'm going to
21:43 - use anchor tags as well so let's say
21:48 - once more that I'm going to create
21:49 - anchor tag and here I put a text or an
21:55 - image content that is going to be shown
21:57 - to my user so here I want to write let's
22:00 - say
22:01 - and then here in my start tag I specify
22:07 - each raft attribute and here I specified
22:11 - the path that I want to navigate my user
22:13 - when he clicks on this text here and the
22:17 - path that I want my user to be navigated
22:19 - to when he clicks on this home is going
22:22 - to be index dot HTML so I'm going to say
22:25 - index dot HTM L like this so this is
22:31 - going to be linked to our index page and
22:34 - then I'm going to copy this three more
22:36 - times like this and then I want to put
22:41 - here my courses so I'm going to say
22:44 - courses like this and I want to navigate
22:49 - my user to course this dot HTML when he
22:55 - clicks on this courses text and then my
22:58 - third page is going to be social media
23:01 - so here I'm going to say social media
23:05 - like this and then when my user clicks
23:08 - on this social media text I want my user
23:11 - to be navigated to my social media dot
23:14 - HTML so here I'm going to put that
23:16 - perhaps I'm going to say social media
23:20 - like this so now we have really created
23:25 - this menu only on this index dot HTML
23:28 - page so I have saved it and now if i
23:32 - refresh my index you can see that this
23:34 - whole courses and social media has
23:37 - appeared ok and now I want to copy this
23:43 - menu on my other pages as well so on my
23:46 - courses and on my social media so I'm
23:49 - going to take this deafed which is going
23:52 - to be my menu and I'm going to paste it
23:55 - here so at the beginning of my courses
23:58 - dot HTML and then in the beginning of my
24:03 - social media dot HTML as well so here ok
24:07 - and now after I have saved all of these
24:10 - three pages if I come back to my index
24:14 - that
24:14 - EML I'm going to refresh it one more
24:16 - time and now I can really expect to
24:18 - navigate myself to these other pages so
24:21 - when I click on home I am at home when I
24:24 - click on courses I'm going to switch to
24:26 - courses and then when I click on social
24:29 - media my user is going to be switched to
24:31 - my social media page so now I can really
24:34 - close these two okay and let's add one
24:39 - more thing that we are missing which is
24:42 - going to be really a horizontal line
24:44 - which is going to separate our menu from
24:46 - this content and for that I'm going to
24:50 - use tag which is called H R like this so
24:55 - that's going to add a horizontal rule so
24:57 - it is going to add a horizontal line
24:59 - after my menu so I'm going to save it
25:03 - and I'm going to copy this HR tag to my
25:07 - courses here and then to my index dot
25:11 - HTML here as well okay
25:16 - and now if I try to refresh this you can
25:19 - see that this horizontal line has
25:21 - appeared and it is really on all of my
25:25 - pages and I have noticed one thing and
25:28 - that is that our social media page is
25:30 - missing heading so our courses has this
25:33 - courses and then home has home heading
25:37 - but our social media is missing a
25:38 - heading so I'm going to add that so here
25:41 - on my social media dot HTML I want to
25:45 - put head Inc
25:46 - so after this horizontal rule I'm going
25:49 - to say h1 and here I want to say my
25:54 - social media like this okay so I'm going
26:00 - to save this heading and now if i
26:04 - refresh my page you can see that my
26:05 - social media heading has appeared so now
26:09 - the thing that I want to show you is
26:10 - going to be really how we can style this
26:13 - so in my previous video I have talked
26:15 - about external CSS and now really I want
26:18 - to show you how you can apply that logic
26:21 - of external CSS to your web site so how
26:25 - you can use one file in order
26:27 - style your website so I'm going to close
26:31 - this and then inside this website folder
26:34 - I'm going to create a new folder which
26:37 - is going to be called styles like this
26:42 - okay and then here I want to create a
26:45 - new file which is going to be our style
26:48 - and for that as well I'm going to use my
26:51 - visual studio code so I'm going to say
26:53 - file new file so I'm going to save this
26:56 - file and place it in my Styles folder
27:00 - and I'm going to name it file dot CSS
27:03 - and save it okay and now what we have to
27:08 - do in order to have this style to be
27:11 - applied to our pages is really to link
27:15 - this style and for that as I already
27:18 - mentioned in my previous video we use a
27:21 - link tag which we've put in this head
27:24 - section okay so here I'm going to say
27:28 - link and then I'm going to say the
27:31 - relationship is going to be style sheet
27:35 - like this and then the path to my style
27:39 - file is going to be specified using H
27:42 - ref attribute and the pet is going to be
27:46 - Styles slash style dot CSS okay so there
27:53 - is one thing that I'm going to add to my
27:55 - Styles dot CSS so that we can really
27:57 - test whether this has been applied so
28:01 - whether this this link works so here in
28:04 - my spouse I'm going to add for example
28:09 - I'm going to say that I want to style my
28:11 - body tag and I'm going to say that I
28:13 - want to add a background for my body tag
28:17 - so I'm going to say that background
28:18 - color background color of my body is
28:24 - going to be lets say this beige color so
28:28 - I'm going to say that and now I'm going
28:31 - to refresh where is it
28:33 - I'm going to refresh this social media
28:35 - and as you can see this beige color has
28:38 - been applied to
28:40 - my social media page but if I navigate
28:43 - myself to my courses you can see that
28:46 - this page does not have any styles nor
28:49 - this homepage so I will have to link
28:52 - this Styles dot CSS on these two pages
28:57 - as well so I'm going to copy this and
29:00 - I'm going to paste it on my courses dot
29:02 - HTML and save it and paste it as well on
29:06 - my index dot HTML and see what so now if
29:11 - i refresh this and if i navigate myself
29:14 - to these other pages you can see that
29:17 - they they have this beige color of body
29:21 - so this page is beige and now you can
29:25 - decide for example that you want all of
29:27 - your headings to have a similar style so
29:30 - you come to this Styles dot CSS and you
29:34 - say please style all of my h1 tags with
29:39 - this background color off for example
29:42 - white green so when I save this and
29:47 - refresh my home page
29:48 - you can see that this heading has gotten
29:51 - this light green background and then on
29:54 - my courses my heading is as well this
29:57 - light green background and then on
29:59 - social media as well heading has this
30:01 - light green background so I hope that
30:05 - now you have really seen the practical
30:08 - use of this external CSS which we have
30:11 - mentioned in my previous video and I
30:14 - hope as well that you have understood
30:17 - how you can build a website I know that
30:20 - this is a very very simple one and not
30:22 - very presentable one but the core
30:24 - principles are there so you are going to
30:27 - have some navigation and then you are
30:29 - going to put the content on each of your
30:32 - pages and as we progress in this course
30:34 - we are going to learn about new elements
30:37 - and we are going to learn new CSS which
30:40 - we are going to use in order to put new
30:43 - elements to our web page and also in
30:45 - order to style them so that they look
30:47 - presentable and nice so if you enjoyed
