00:00 - if you're a senior developer someone
00:01 - who's experienced and you are not
00:03 - receiving job offers or you are applying
00:05 - for positions but they constantly reject
00:07 - you I'm sorry to break it to you but you
00:09 - are just not that good you've been too
00:11 - comfortable for too long closed in your
00:13 - little bubble which made you think that
00:14 - you are really great which you're not
00:16 - it's not AI it's not the government it's
00:19 - you how do I know this because I am
00:21 - still receiving job offers today I
00:23 - counted 86 of them since the beginning
00:25 - of the year and it's now July 13th when
00:28 - I'm filming this all of the developers
00:29 - are around me who I consider to be good
00:31 - developers are still receiving great job
00:34 - offers if you're a senior experienced
00:36 - developer then you are just not really
00:38 - that good things have changed and while
00:40 - you've been too comfortable and resting
00:42 - you didn't notice that some people have
00:43 - been very busy and working hard if
00:46 - you're a junior developer the situation
00:47 - is a little bit different because you
00:49 - either don't have a good reference or
00:51 - you don't know how to stand out among
00:53 - other people or even if you get a chance
00:55 - and get a job interview you screw it up
00:57 - because you don't know what to do
