00:00 - many of you may be wondering if devops
00:02 - carrier is for you if you have been
00:05 - following and watching my videos you
00:07 - probably already know that I love devops
00:09 - and have a lot of passion for it but is
00:12 - devops for everyone and what are some of
00:15 - the reasons why I personally like devops
00:18 - and chose it as a career and what are
00:20 - some of the advantages that speaks for
00:24 - choosing devops as a career in general I
00:26 - want to start with my own background and
00:29 - story of how I ended up in devops I
00:32 - started off as a software developer and
00:35 - in one of my software development
00:37 - projects I started taking over tasks of
00:39 - configuring servers configuring builds
00:42 - in Jenkins configuring application
00:44 - packaging Etc
00:46 - or configuring things around Docker and
00:48 - running containers making the builds
00:51 - faster making tests faster and so on and
00:54 - I noticed that tasks that were related
00:56 - to configuring stuff and optimizing
00:59 - processes were more enjoyable for me
01:01 - than programming now these are just a
01:04 - subset of tasks in devops I was
01:06 - basically doing some tasks around CI CD
01:08 - configuration but devops is much more
01:11 - than that it spends the whole software
01:13 - development life cycle essentially
01:15 - optimizing and configuring things for
01:18 - different parts of that software
01:20 - development life cycle now if you don't
01:23 - know exactly what devops involves and
01:25 - what that software development lifecycle
01:27 - includes I have a dedicated video on
01:29 - that that you can watch so basically
01:32 - when you're doing software development
01:34 - you are zoomed in into one specific part
01:37 - of that software development life cycle
01:40 - when you're doing it operations again
01:42 - you are focused on a specific area of
01:45 - that life cycle
01:46 - with the devops however you zoom out
01:49 - from those specific areas and parts and
01:52 - start seeing the big picture or a bird's
01:55 - eye view of the whole software
01:57 - development workflow and you start
02:00 - analyzing how each of those areas are
02:03 - connected like software development
02:04 - processes with Git workflows connect to
02:08 - cicd pipeline or CSD pipeline connected
02:11 - to infrastructure Etc and you start
02:14 - analyzing which areas need improvements
02:16 - which ones have bottlenecks like
02:18 - development workflow is super optimized
02:21 - so your team's generating new features
02:23 - fast but the pipeline is slow and
02:26 - blocking the release of those features
02:28 - to production now what I also observed
02:31 - is that a different type of thinking is
02:34 - required for devops you need high level
02:37 - thinking connecting dots on a high level
02:40 - width instead of depth like an architect
02:43 - making the plan of the whole building
02:45 - and planning how different parts are
02:48 - connected and implemented and then you
02:50 - have different specializations who
02:52 - actually carry out that plan so I
02:55 - personally like that role a lot
03:00 - and because devops covers the whole
03:03 - software development life cycle the set
03:05 - of tasks or the range of tasks is much
03:08 - more diverse and rich in variety like
03:12 - you could be looking at front-end code
03:13 - and optimizing application packaging
03:16 - process the next thing could be
03:18 - configuring deployment servers on cloud
03:20 - then scripting a program to automate
03:23 - some infrastructure configuration tasks
03:25 - and if you're like me this may be much
03:27 - more interesting and exciting for many
03:30 - people and again this is probably a
03:32 - personal preference some people love
03:34 - focusing on their area of expertise
03:37 - deepening their knowledge in it like I
03:40 - learned JavaScript and then I just
03:42 - learned JavaScript to the most advanced
03:44 - level different Frameworks different
03:46 - features Etc and there is enough to
03:49 - learn for ears in each language and
03:51 - Technology but for many this can be
03:53 - boring if you're like me you want to
03:56 - have more diverse set of tasks you want
03:59 - to go broader I like like architecting
04:01 - processes instead instead of
04:03 - specializing in just one tool or
04:05 - technology I like to understand whole
04:08 - software development life cycle process
04:10 - and how it all works and more
04:13 - importantly how I can optimize different
04:15 - parts of that life cycle identifying
04:18 - opportunities for improvements and
04:20 - optimizations like packaging the
04:22 - application takes too long setting up
04:24 - environment for tests is too slow
04:26 - security of the build image is not
04:29 - properly checked or maybe not enough
04:31 - bugs get discovered before deploying to
04:34 - the end environment or the build process
04:36 - is taking too long or we find out about
04:38 - issues in production too late maybe
04:41 - operation team has a lot of effort and
04:43 - needs long time to update and maintain
04:46 - kubernetes cluster it takes too long to
04:48 - approve and be confident about deploying
04:51 - new features into production as a devops
04:54 - engineer you can solve all these
04:56 - challenges and that in itself for me is
04:59 - a very fulfilling work improving things
05:02 - optimizing making things faster
05:04 - automating Etc and this leads to the
05:07 - next reason which is the impact as a
05:10 - devops engineer you can have a huge
05:13 - business impact in your company by
05:15 - having a good understanding of the whole
05:18 - software development life cycle and
05:20 - improving and optimizing it and this
05:23 - again can be super fulfilling to know
05:26 - that your work has such an impact and
05:28 - affects many people eventually you can
05:31 - build processes through automation that
05:33 - make the work of your fellow team
05:35 - members in the organization much easier
05:38 - smooth well architected processes means
05:41 - that Engineers can focus on their areas
05:44 - of expertise and generally enjoy their
05:46 - work much more instead of doing some
05:48 - boring manual things instead so you can
05:51 - make lives of developers operations
05:54 - testers project managers and so on
05:57 - easier but you also bring huge business
06:00 - value well implemented devops processes
06:03 - will lead to faster time to Market and
06:06 - constant Improvement of business quality
06:08 - Etc which means end users are happier
06:11 - and Company can innovate and deliver
06:13 - much better so you have an impact on the
06:16 - whole business and this brings me to the
06:19 - next point which is demand for devops
06:22 - and salary
06:24 - since this is a position that has such a
06:26 - huge impact it automatically means that
06:29 - you are super valuable for your team and
06:31 - your company because you literally have
06:34 - direct impact on time to Market how
06:37 - satisfied the engineers are with work
06:39 - etc and companies see that value that's
06:42 - why the demand for devops engineers has
06:44 - increased so dramatically over the past
06:46 - few years organizations that have
06:49 - implemented devops practices are in fact
06:51 - seeing the benefits of high performance
06:53 - much faster deployments compared to
06:56 - competitors and logically are willing to
06:58 - pay high salaries to find devops experts
07:00 - the demand is very clearly visible on
07:03 - job platforms as well indeed.com a major
07:07 - job platform for example had a 75
07:09 - increase in devops job listings and on
07:13 - LinkedIn there was a 50 increase in
07:16 - mentioning devops as a skill and combine
07:19 - these huge value you are bringing to the
07:22 - company and the high demand for devops
07:24 - skills with the fact that there are very
07:27 - few Engineers who actually have those
07:29 - skills and can fill the role this means
07:32 - if you are a devops engineer you are
07:34 - highly demanded and companies will pay
07:36 - premium for having you this means
07:39 - flexibility lots of options High salary
07:41 - with lots of added benefits so you have
07:44 - a super high leverage this means if you
07:47 - actually learn devops you will
07:49 - drastically increase your value on the
07:51 - global Marketplace and get a whole new
07:54 - set of opportunities out there and I
07:56 - think people should definitely take
07:58 - advantage of this opportunity but I also
08:01 - know learning devops can be daunting and
08:03 - difficult and that's exactly why last
08:06 - year we created this full educational
08:08 - program to give people the opportunity
08:10 - to learn all necessary skills to become
08:13 - a devops engineer to actually be able to
08:16 - get a job and then start working as a
08:18 - devops engineer and do all these cool
08:21 - stuff that I mentioned but again not
08:23 - just learn some base 6 and then get a
08:25 - job and be stressed there because you
08:27 - can't actually do the real devops tasks
08:29 - they ask you to do but really prepare
08:32 - you to go out there and build those
08:35 - devops processes and do the actual real
08:38 - life devops tasks
08:40 - because often companies would hire you
08:42 - in devops if you have a software
08:44 - development or operations background and
08:46 - then let you transition to devops slowly
08:50 - by giving you various devops tasks but
08:52 - this is a slow and painful and not very
08:54 - efficient way to get into devops plus
08:57 - you don't get hired as a devops engineer
08:59 - right away so you don't really get those
09:01 - benefits that I mentioned and we created
09:04 - our program to give you exactly these
09:07 - skills and knowledge to confidently go
09:09 - out there apply for a job as a devops
09:11 - engineer who can help the company
09:13 - implement the devops processes from day
09:15 - one and that's what extremely valuable
09:18 - for the employers
09:20 - we have already educated thousands of
09:22 - people throughout bootcamp and from the
09:24 - feedbacks we know the amazing impact we
09:27 - are making by educating people in this
09:29 - highly demanded field so this is
09:32 - definitely going to be an investment in
09:34 - your education that will help you get to
09:36 - the next level in the it Market all the
09:39 - information about the boot camp is in
09:41 - the video description if you're
09:42 - interested but now let's talk about the
09:45 - company perspective from the company's
09:47 - perspective when they are looking for a
09:49 - devops engineer they usually write a job
09:52 - opening and either they cannot find any
09:55 - devops engineer or get candidates that
09:58 - want to be devops Engineers but don't
10:00 - really have enough knowledge yet like
10:03 - they have been developers or can
10:05 - configure servers but they don't really
10:06 - have any devops or core devops skills so
10:10 - usually what companies do instead is
10:12 - they upskill their existing employees or
10:16 - hire young engineers and train them
10:18 - specifically in devops because if they
10:21 - can't find them they should train them
10:23 - but again to train people to become
10:25 - devops engineers you need a devops
10:27 - engineer to actually train them so we
10:29 - have a lot of companies who upskill
10:31 - their engineers in devops using our
10:34 - bootcamp which is another proof that
10:36 - companies are willing to invest in
10:39 - building devops know how internally to
10:41 - implement devops throughout the
10:43 - organization
10:45 - now I know that there is some
10:47 - controversy around devops as a role that
10:51 - it was meant as a set of Concepts and
10:53 - principles and not as an engineering
10:56 - role but the reality is that there are
10:58 - real devops engineering job positions
11:00 - and people who actually work as devops
11:03 - engineers and I actually made a
11:05 - dedicated video on that as well
11:07 - explaining the topic and how it all
11:09 - evolved so if you're interested you can
11:12 - go check it out
11:13 - finally since in devops you are covering
11:16 - the whole software development lifecycle
11:19 - it means you work with lots of tools so
11:22 - you need to be constantly learning and
11:25 - expanding your knowledge now this might
11:27 - be an advantage if you're like me and
11:30 - really enjoy learning new stuff all the
11:32 - time or it could be a disadvantage if
11:35 - you want to focus and solidify knowledge
11:38 - in a few Technologies this is actually a
11:42 - necessary thing since devops is still
11:44 - evolving and there is a lot of Dynamics
11:47 - and changes in devops area so you have
11:49 - new tools New Concepts and solutions
11:51 - that people come up with all the time
11:54 - and as a devops engineer you need to
11:56 - actually stay up to date and see what
11:58 - new Solutions are available to make the
12:01 - processes even better one of these tools
12:04 - you might want to check out is actually
12:05 - polomi who is the sponsor of this video
12:08 - polome is a modern Universal
12:11 - infrastructure as code tool which is
12:13 - gaining popularity with polony you don't
12:16 - need to learn a new domain specific
12:18 - language but you can use your already
12:21 - familiar programming language tools and
12:23 - software engineering practices to deploy
12:26 - and manage your Cloud infrastructure on
12:29 - any Cloud platform this unites
12:31 - developers infrastructure teams and
12:33 - security Engineers around a common
12:36 - platform so that everyone can speak the
12:38 - same language and ship modern Cloud
12:40 - applications quickly and reliably if you
12:43 - want to learn more about palomi I
12:44 - actually have a separate video on it
12:46 - where you can see how it works in
12:48 - practice and with that let's move on
12:50 - DeVos processes are never completed you
12:53 - don't just build stuff and complete your
12:55 - work once it's a constant ongoing
12:58 - process just like developing an
12:59 - application you don't just create an
13:01 - application once and you're done you
13:03 - make improvements and continue making
13:05 - the application better and better adding
13:07 - new features fixing the bugs and issues
13:11 - ETC it's the same thing with devops
13:13 - processes so lots of new things to learn
13:16 - all the time as I said this could also
13:18 - be a disadvantage and of course like
13:20 - with everything there are pros and cons
13:23 - here as well devops does come with some
13:26 - challenges as well like too much to
13:28 - learn and too broad of a responsibility
13:30 - can be overwhelming for some people also
13:33 - often there are unclear requirements
13:36 - because companies themselves don't know
13:38 - what devops is exactly so you may get
13:41 - pushed into some role or in doing tasks
13:44 - which are not really in the devops area
13:46 - another big challenge is communication
13:49 - with various teams in the organization
13:51 - and it can be frustrating if they don't
13:54 - cooperate but I plan to make a separate
13:57 - video where I talk about advantages and
13:59 - challenges of devops as a career in
14:02 - general so that you can decide whether a
14:04 - career in devops is right for you so be
14:07 - sure to subscribe and activate the
14:10 - notification Bell to not miss that video
14:13 - now finally I want to mention that
14:15 - choosing a career path is extremely
14:17 - personal and depends on many personal
14:20 - circumstances for me being a devops
14:23 - engineer is working on a wide variety of
14:26 - tasks with a wide variety of
14:28 - Technologies and tools it's
14:30 - understanding the bigger picture and
14:32 - being able to investigate issues
14:34 - efficiently and for me the impact and
14:37 - fulfillment from the work definitely
14:39 - outweighs the challenges now I hope this
14:42 - video gave you good insights into devops
14:45 - and that I could provide some valuable
14:47 - information around it it would be really
14:50 - interesting to know what are your
14:52 - experiences in devops and your personal
14:54 - preferences so share them in the
14:56 - comments for me and for others who are
14:58 - watching the video with that thank you
15:00 - for watching and see you in the next
15:03 - video
