00:00 - welcome to the ansible module till now
00:02 - you have already gained
00:04 - massive knowledge and skills in
00:06 - different devops technologies
00:07 - and concepts as a continuation of the
00:11 - projects in all the previous modules
00:13 - we will use ansible to further automate
00:15 - and optimize
00:16 - devops processes so learning ansible
00:19 - will take you
00:20 - another level up in your devops
00:22 - expertise
00:23 - and help you really stand out with your
00:26 - skills
00:27 - ansible nexu terraform is one of the
00:30 - most popular
00:31 - infrastructures code and configuration
00:34 - management
00:34 - tools currently used in it projects
00:38 - and while you've already learned
00:40 - terraform
00:41 - to automate provisioning servers in nsbl
00:45 - module you will learn how to automate
00:47 - configuring these servers installing
00:49 - different tools on them
00:50 - configuring operating system and
00:53 - deploying applications
00:55 - so in this module you will learn all the
00:58 - important concepts of
00:59 - insable with best practices and specific
01:02 - examples and you will learn all these
01:05 - with hands-on
01:06 - demo projects so by the end of the
01:09 - module
01:10 - you will know exactly how to use ansible
01:12 - in your
01:13 - own projects to automate any type of
01:16 - infrastructure
01:16 - automation and configuration tasks
01:19 - so let's see what you will actually
01:22 - learn in this section
01:23 - of the bootcamp during an almost eight
01:26 - hour
01:26 - insible module we will start with the
01:28 - core concepts of insable such as
01:31 - ansible inventory ansible ad hoc
01:34 - commands
01:35 - and the basic syntax of an instable
01:37 - playbook
01:38 - as well as how to use insible
01:41 - configuration file
01:42 - to change the default insight behavior
01:45 - after that we will learn some of the
01:48 - most common insible modules for
01:50 - installing tools on a server
01:52 - configuring applications working with a
01:55 - file system
01:56 - moving static files between machines etc
01:59 - and essentially you will learn how to
02:01 - map and translate shell scripts and
02:04 - commands
02:05 - into ansible playbooks to automate
02:08 - various
02:08 - common devops tasks and for comparison
02:11 - we will configure
02:12 - servers with different linux
02:14 - distributions on aws
02:17 - and digitalocean platforms you will also
02:20 - learn about ansible collections and
02:22 - ansible galaxy
02:24 - as a next step you will learn how to use
02:26 - ansible
02:27 - variables to make your playbooks
02:29 - customizable
02:30 - and also see all the different ways of
02:32 - setting the variable values in
02:34 - nzibal while writing these playbooks
02:37 - we'll also see
02:38 - how to troubleshoot the results and how
02:40 - to use
02:41 - conditionals and privilege escalation
02:43 - when needed
02:44 - after that we will dive into more
02:46 - advanced topics
02:48 - we will configure dynamic inventory for
02:50 - dynamically getting the ec2 server
02:53 - addresses from aws instead of statically
02:56 - hard coding them
02:57 - this is a very useful concept when
03:00 - working with
03:01 - modern dynamic infrastructure you will
03:03 - also learn how to execute ansible
03:05 - playbooks
03:06 - from a terraform script directly after
03:09 - provisioning
03:10 - a new infrastructure to completely
03:13 - automate infrastructure provisioning
03:15 - and configuration steps in addition to
03:17 - that we will use various docker modules
03:19 - in ansible to work with docker images
03:22 - and
03:22 - containers as well as learn about
03:24 - kubernetes module
03:25 - to automate configuring kubernetes
03:28 - cluster
03:28 - and deploying components in it in
03:32 - another demo project we will integrate
03:34 - ansible in the jenkins
03:35 - cicd pipeline to automate application
03:38 - deployment
03:39 - with a production grade setup in the
03:43 - final demo project
03:44 - you will learn how to make your ansible
03:46 - content
03:47 - more reusable and modular with ansible
03:50 - rows
03:51 - so you know how to write more
03:53 - maintainable instable code
03:54 - for more complex projects of course as
03:58 - part of the configuration is called
04:00 - concept we will host our instable
04:02 - project in a git repository
04:04 - and add playbooks from all the demo
04:06 - projects there
04:07 - so by the end of the module you will end
04:10 - up with a nice insible
04:12 - project portfolio as you see you don't
04:15 - learn ansible just
04:16 - as a standalone tool in the bootcamp but
04:18 - rather
04:19 - integrated in different technologies
04:21 - like docker kubernetes
04:23 - terraform jenkins aws and so on
04:27 - in various real world use cases as it
04:30 - builds on the previous modules in the
04:32 - bootcamp
04:33 - i'm already excited to teach you all of
04:35 - this so let's get started
