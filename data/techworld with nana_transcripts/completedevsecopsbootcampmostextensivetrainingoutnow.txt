00:00 - Welcome to the DevSecOps bootcamp.
00:04 - Why did I create another bootcamp
00:05 - specifically to teach about DevSecOps?
00:09 - According to several data trend analyses,
00:12 - DevSecOps is the most demanded upcoming
skill set needed in the job market.
00:18 - Why?
00:19 - Security breaches are expected to cost
00:21 - companies trillions annually.
00:23 - So while DevOps solved the automated
00:27 - release of applications, it kind of left
out the security, which still remained an afterthought.
00:33 - And to bring security into the DevOps
processes and integrate it into every
00:39 - step, DevSecOps concept emerged and is
becoming more and more popular.
00:45 - So as you see, security has a huge impact
and importance for companies.
00:49 - And DevSecOps is a key role in
implementing security in DevOps processes.
00:55 - That means an engineer equipped with this
knowledge is highly valuable for any
00:59 - company that cares about security at all.
01:02 - Now as you already know, DevOps is
01:04 - becoming standard in companies across the
world and demand for DevOps engineers or
01:09 - engineers with DevOps skills has grown
drastically over the years.
01:14 - That's why so many engineers learn DevOps
or completely change their careers to DevOps.
01:19 - And why we created the DevOps bootcamp as well.
01:21 - So there's a strong trend of engineers
01:24 - learning DevOps, which is already a
hugely valuable skill set.
01:28 - And knowing DevOps will give you an
absolute competitive advantage on the job
01:33 - market for many years to come, whatever
your engineering background is.
01:38 - But DevSecOps is taking this even step further.
01:42 - They're just a handful of DevSecOps
01:44 - engineers worldwide who have the complete
skill set to take over DevSecOps related
01:50 - tasks that companies are so desperately
looking for.
01:54 - So if you want to be in the absolute top
place and stand out even among the DevOps
01:59 - and cloud professionals, this program
will help you achieve exactly that.
02:04 - It will make you extremely demanded and
absolutely irreplaceable.
02:09 - And when you embark on a journey of
learning such highly complex skill set as
02:14 - DevSecOps, you need a comprehensive guide
and learning materials that will teach
02:19 - you the real life aspects and use cases
of DevSecOps and actually prepare you
02:24 - with the practical knowledge to take over
the role or level up your current
02:29 - engineering role, whether you are a
developer or systems administrator, cloud
02:33 - engineer, SRE, whatever it is.
02:35 - And that's exactly why we created this bootcamp.
02:38 - This is hands down the most value packed
and extensive course that currently
02:44 - exists out there on this specific topic,
which provides tons of use cases,
02:49 - practice references, hands on demos and
real life examples.
02:53 - In fact, more than 90 % of the contents
are hands on projects because you learn
02:57 - the best by actually doing things.
03:00 - Also very important note is that we
03:01 - compressed tons of knowledge in this
bootcamp to make sure to give you the
03:06 - most amount of training and experience in
the shortest amount of time possible.
03:11 - Because no matter how valuable a skill
set is that you're learning, you don't
03:15 - want to be spending years before you can
actually use it and apply it in your career.
03:20 - And that's why we have this intensive
boot camps, which has tons of
03:24 - technologies and concepts but is taught
in such an efficient way.
03:29 - No fluff, no unnecessary time wasters,
clear structured path with a perfectly
03:35 - laid out curriculum so you can complete
it within several months, which is very
03:39 - short time for getting a complete
education on some of the world's most
03:44 - highly demanded engineering roles.
03:47 - However, I'm not big on theory and certificates.
03:50 - I don't think that theory and learning
for certificates are actually applicable
03:55 - to do the actual work.
03:57 - I'm a practitioner and I like to teach
04:00 - the practical stuff, which means in all
of our courses and boot camps, practical
04:05 - real life projects is the core and the
theory and explanations are just there to
04:10 - support these real life projects.
04:13 - And that's the only way I believe you
04:15 - will be ready not only to get hired so
that you can learn a job, but actually be
04:20 - able to implement things from day one at
work because you just learn how things
04:26 - should be done in real world and not in classroom.
04:29 - And we have hundreds of students that
04:31 - join the teams and we're able to build
full CI City pipelines, full fledged
04:37 - DevOps processes, automate stuff from day
one without actually needing to learn
04:42 - this stuff at work because they learned
them in the boot camp.
04:46 - Now, one of the main strategies we used
here, especially in DevSecOps boot camp
04:50 - to achieve this is simply collaborating
with multiple DevSecOps professionals to
04:57 - make sure to capture all our different
real life experiences.
05:01 - Because guess what?
05:02 - Different companies have different use
05:04 - cases and practices.
05:06 - But even more than that, I worked closely
05:08 - with and got inputs from engineers of
those tools themselves that are part of
05:13 - the DevSecOps processes and part of the
DevSecOps boot camp because obviously
05:17 - they know what they built and what are
all the practical use cases that
05:21 - different companies use those tools for.
05:25 - And this is, of course, where the reach
05:26 - of our YouTube channel and status of
Docker Captain and AWS Container Hero
05:31 - helps me a lot because I can actually
reach out to engineers of different
05:35 - technologies and talk to them.
05:37 - And I actually make sure to always use
05:40 - this extensive network to the advantage
of our students.
05:44 - So all this knowledge of the security
experts of different fields, technologies
05:49 - packed into this one boot camp, which
naturally means lots of time and effort
05:55 - went into putting together this boot camp.
05:59 - It actually took us almost two years to
06:01 - create the perfect balance of
comprehensive, practical, but compact
06:05 - training in each lecture.
06:07 - And I hope you will be able to see all
06:09 - that when you join the boot camp.
06:11 - Now, before you rush to enroll in the
06:13 - boot camp full of excitement, first,
let's actually find out, do you fulfill
06:18 - the criteria needed to enroll in this
boot camp?
06:22 - Because you need lots of prerequisite
knowledge for this.
06:26 - If you're an engineer who has held any
technical role already.
06:30 - So if you are a software developer, cloud
or DevOps engineer, maybe SRE or systems
06:36 - administrator, et cetera, and very
important in addition to those, you
06:40 - already know and have worked with tools
for containers, container orchestration,
06:45 - and most importantly, CI -CD release pipeline.
06:49 - Then this boot camp is definitely for you.
06:51 - So you have all the skills that are
needed to start learning the things in
06:57 - this boot camp.
06:58 - So adding DevSecOps to your existing
07:00 - experience and knowledge will
tremendously benefit your career and just
07:05 - help you in your job to add even more
value at your work.
07:09 - Because just like DevOps, DevSecOps
encompasses and affects every single step
07:14 - of the software development lifecycle.
07:17 - So you'll be affecting lots of different
07:19 - roles within your organization or within
your project teams.
07:23 - And again, because it's practical, we
actually cover implementing DevSecOps in
07:28 - the entire software development
lifecycle, where you also learn which
07:33 - other engineering roles you will be
affecting and how.
07:36 - That means to list all the prerequisites,
you need to know essentials of CI -CD
07:41 - tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI, GitHub
Actions or something similar.
07:46 - So this is an absolute must prerequisite.
07:50 - You also need to know Docker, Terraform,
07:53 - Kubernetes, Linux, automation with Python
and AWS.
07:58 - Because in the DevSecOps boot camp, we
use all of these technologies, but from a
08:03 - security perspective.
08:04 - So all the basics and all the essentials
08:07 - of these tools need to be there.
08:09 - And these are actually all the things you
08:11 - learn in our DevOps boot camp or a subset
of things you learn there, including Jenkins.
08:17 - But for GitLab specifically, which is the
CI -CD tool that we use in the DevSecOps
08:21 - boot camp.
08:22 - If you have zero experience with it, we
08:24 - actually have a GitLab CI course as well,
where you'll learn all the essentials
08:29 - that you will need for the DevSecOps boot camp.
08:31 - So just make sure that either through our
08:34 - courses or from learning somewhere else
or just work experience, you check the
08:39 - boxes of this prerequisite list.
08:42 - Now, if you are coming from more IT
08:45 - operations background and want to start
into DevOps and DevSecOps, you will also
08:50 - want to have a good foundation of
software development.
08:53 - Like you don't have to be super fluent in
coding, obviously, because DevSecOps role
08:59 - is not about coding.
09:00 - But you have to understand the software
09:03 - development lifecycle concepts.
09:05 - And this can also tremendously help here
09:07 - to connect the dots in multiple places
more easily.
09:12 - And the software development basics and
the entire lifecycle, basically the steps
09:17 - involved in that, you actually learn in
our IT beginners course.
09:21 - So if you want to up your skills in this
area, then that will be the course to
09:26 - start with.
09:27 - However, it's not a must.
09:28 - So it's more of an optional requirement.
09:31 - But that would definitely make it easier
09:33 - to do both DevOps and DevSecOps boot camps.
09:36 - So basically, you need knowledge and
09:38 - understanding of DevOps to the same level
as you get in our DevOps boot camp or, as
09:43 - I said, an equivalent work experience.
09:46 - And if you know my tutorials and courses
09:47 - already, you know that I always, always
explain and take time to thoroughly go
09:53 - through the details of any concept or
functionality that I am demoing without
09:58 - assuming that people already know it in detail.
10:01 - So I don't leave stuff out.
10:02 - And that's why I make sure to cover the
relevant concepts and details in the
10:07 - appropriate courses and boot camps to
make it easy for anyone to decide
10:10 - basically what skills that they want to
learn properly and not repeating
10:14 - everything in every course.
10:15 - So that means if something is not
10:17 - explained in detail in the DevSecOps
course, it surely means that it was
10:22 - already explained in either DevOps boot
camp or GitLab CI course.
10:26 - So that's basically a prerequisite.
10:29 - If you fulfill that, if you check all the
10:30 - boxes here, then you're good to go.
10:33 - So let's get to the actual contents of
10:36 - what you will learn when you enroll.
10:39 - So basically, what new powerful skills
10:42 - and expertise you will have once you have
completed and worked through the entire
10:47 - boot camp.
10:48 - And the first things first, we start with
10:50 - security essentials or security basics,
which is great since you don't need this
10:56 - as a prerequisite knowledge.
10:58 - So even if you don't have security
10:59 - background, this chapter covers all of that.
11:03 - And it's important because security is a
11:05 - very broad topic and we need to cover all
security essentials needed to lay the
11:10 - foundation for the entire upcoming
training to fill any knowledge gaps
11:15 - specifically for DevSecOps.
11:17 - In this chapter, we also go through
11:19 - what's called OWASP top 10 categories.
11:23 - A DevSecOps engineer should definitely
11:25 - know the OWASP foundation and be familiar
with their work.
11:28 - So this is a perfect introduction to them
and one of their projects actively used
11:33 - as guidelines in application security.
11:36 - So we go through this in detail, deep
11:39 - diving and understanding each category
and what security aspects they cover.
11:44 - Very important.
11:45 - We're going to go through different
11:46 - security risks at different levels of the
application, whether it's the application
11:51 - code itself, the runtime, the
infrastructure, and so on.
11:54 - Different security types, explaining SQL
injection, path traversal, XSS or cross
12:01 - -site scripting, client or server -side
request forgery, and several others as
12:06 - part of security basics.
12:08 - And if you're a software developer alone,
12:11 - this knowledge added to your current
experience will make you 10 times better
12:15 - at your work.
12:16 - If you understand the security concepts
12:18 - behind the application security and as a
non -software developer, this is the
12:24 - central part of understanding what
security threads and application or
12:28 - systems around that application can even
have before you learn how to secure stuff.
12:33 - So this chapter is an absolute must for
anybody who wants to understand core
12:38 - application security concepts in order to
learn about DevSecOps.
12:43 - So instead of just learning how to
execute security scanning tools in order
12:47 - to automate DevSecOps processes by just
copy pasting the commands from the
12:53 - official documentation, you actually
learn what you're trying to secure with
12:58 - those tools or what security issues you
are trying to validate.
13:02 - And this is the difference between our
educational material and any other
13:06 - courses which leave out such crucial
knowledge and only focus on the tools and
13:11 - their features without teaching the
concepts and purpose behind them.
13:16 - After understanding the security
essentials, we basically laid a good
13:20 - foundation to build on top of that and
now understand the whys behind the DevSecOps.
13:26 - Why was there a need for it and what
purpose does it have?
13:29 - So here you will learn about the
DevSecOps concepts, the different types
13:33 - of DevSecOps automation tools, the
security scanning types, what you
13:37 - automate and how.
13:38 - And it's also important to understand
13:40 - DevSecOps as its own engineering role and
clear division of responsibilities
13:46 - between DevSecOps and other engineering
roles, which is an extremely important
13:50 - but often ignored topic.
13:52 - And this is an example of a direct
13:55 - reference to practice and how things are
implemented in the real world versus the theory.
14:02 - Now, let me add here, if you just learned
these two chapters that I just described
14:07 - and you didn't even continue with the
rest of the bootcamp, you will already be
14:12 - more knowledgeable in security and
DevSecOps than 80 % of engineers who are
14:18 - not directly security engineers, which is
pretty crazy to be able to learn all
14:23 - these in just the first two chapters,
considering the importance of this highly
14:28 - complex topic.
14:29 - And again, we achieve that by dedicating
14:32 - lots of time to put together the
essential topics, crafting the project
14:37 - outline and going into the right level of
detail in each lecture.
14:42 - And now starts the action.
14:44 - With all this knowledge, we can start the
14:46 - exciting journey of learning DevSecOps
with hands -on practice and integrating
14:52 - security in every single step.
14:54 - Now, the demo projects in the rest of the
14:56 - bootcamp are divided into three main categories.
15:00 - Application security, infrastructure and
15:02 - cloud security, and platform security for
Kubernetes specifically.
15:07 - And each one of those alone in isolation
is a huge topic.
15:12 - So we cover all of them, plus a couple of
more things that I'm going to mention at
15:17 - the end.
15:17 - The category of application security is
15:20 - the part where you learn tons of
DevSecOps tools, which help us automate
15:26 - security validation in our application
release process to basically validate
15:31 - whether our application code is secure or not.
15:35 - And if not, what security issues does it
15:38 - actually have and how can we fix them?
15:40 - So we start off by setting up a base CI
15:43 - pipeline with little to no security.
15:46 - And this is done on purpose so that we
15:48 - can see a clear comparison of before and
after security implementation, securing
15:54 - the pipeline step by step and learning
new DevSecOps concepts and tools in each
16:00 - of these steps.
16:01 - And as I said, there are tons of
16:04 - DevSecOps concepts and tons of things
that go into automating application
16:09 - security with DevSecOps.
16:11 - So we're going to start implementing
16:13 - automated security checks to scan the
application code for any leaked secrets
16:19 - in the code.
16:19 - We're going to do extensive code testing
16:23 - using SAS tools, which stands for setting
application security testing.
16:28 - And we're also going to learn about
software composition analysis to automate
16:34 - validating any third party dependencies
of an application for any security issues.
16:41 - And as part of that, we're also going to
learn the concept of CVEs and how they
16:46 - reference known vulnerabilities in third
party public libraries.
16:52 - So here we're going to learn the concepts
of what each type of security scanning
16:56 - actually does and all the tools that help
us automate those processes.
17:00 - But when we do the automated security
scanning, we also want to visualize the results.
17:07 - So we are going to learn how to generate
reports of any of those automated
17:11 - security checks, how to use a
vulnerability management tool called
17:17 - Defect Dojo to upload those reports and
use Defect Dojo to help us find the fixes
17:23 - and find the remediation of the security issues.
17:26 - We're also going to learn a very
17:27 - important concept of false positive
analysis when working with security
17:33 - scanning tools.
17:35 - And we're going to learn for the
17:36 - practical real world reference why that
is so important and how to configure the
17:42 - tools to minimize and reduce the number
of false positives.
17:46 - What we are also going to do is based on
the Python knowledge from DevOps, we're
17:51 - going to actually automate the process of
generating reports and uploading them to
17:57 - a vulnerability management tool, which,
again, is a use case that you would need
18:03 - in a practical real world application of
DevSecOps, because DevOps and DevSecOps
18:08 - is all about automating.
18:10 - And this is part of that automation process.
18:12 - And then very interesting and important,
we are actually going to dig into the
18:17 - example application that we are scanning
for securities.
18:21 - And we're going to actually fix some of
the issues like SQL injection issue, the
18:26 - third party library vulnerabilities and
so on in order to understand how the
18:31 - fixes are done in general, as well as
important notes on understanding the
18:35 - tasks and responsibilities in a DevSecOps
process and how that applies to real
18:41 - world again.
18:42 - And that is just the CI pipeline.
18:44 - But of course, the pipeline continues
from CI to CICD with the addition of
18:50 - continuous deployment and adding a
deployment part basically opens up a
18:56 - whole new world of security concerns that
we need to handle with other concepts and tools.
19:01 - So here again, we start off by building a
completely insecure but realistic
19:06 - continuous deployment to AWS with bad
security practices so that we can secure
19:12 - that step by step and see the comparison
of before and after implementing DevSecOps.
19:18 - As part of that, we're also going to
learn a very important concept of image
19:22 - scanning, because as you know, Docker has
become standard.
19:27 - We are deploying our applications as
containers and container is a runtime for
19:31 - the application.
19:32 - So we're not only concerned about how
19:34 - secure the application code is, but also
the environment where it's going to run,
19:38 - which is container, how secure that
runtime is.
19:42 - And again, we're going to use DevSecOps
automation tools for container scanning.
19:46 - And on top of that, we actually learn how
to configure automated scans on the
19:52 - Docker repository itself and specifically
in AWS ECR.
19:57 - And again, we're going to go a step
further here and we're also going to see
20:01 - an example of how to actually fix or
remediate security issues found in a
20:07 - Docker image specifically.
20:08 - And that brings us to the next step of
20:11 - the application release, which is the
deployment environment, which, as I said,
20:16 - is a whole new world of security concerns
and security concepts that we need to consider.
20:21 - We're going to learn about infrastructure
and cloud security because that's where
20:25 - the application will run and that's where
the application will actually be
20:29 - accessible by the end users.
20:31 - So completely exposed to public and
20:34 - definitely the best cloud platform to
learn about cloud security is AWS, which
20:40 - is by far the most used cloud platforms
still in the world.
20:44 - So that's what we'll be focusing on in
this boot camp as well.
20:47 - However, I want to mention here is that
as with any other tool that we're going
20:51 - to use in this boot camp, my approach is
always concepts before technologies.
20:58 - And this applies to AWS as well.
21:00 - So even though we learn lots of AWS
21:03 - specific services here, you actually
learn tons of many general security
21:09 - concepts that you can apply to any cloud
platform or infrastructure.
21:14 - And that is extremely important to me to
not just teach the tools and technologies
21:19 - or technology specific things, but the
concepts so that you are actually
21:25 - empowered to go out there and use any
tool that applies to that concept.
21:31 - And that's why I made sure to have
general cloud security and infrastructure
21:35 - security concepts in this part.
21:38 - So what are some of the things that are
21:39 - included here?
21:40 - We basically are going to learn about a
21:42 - very important concept of access
management to security.
21:45 - So we're going to learn the core AWS
service for access management of your
21:51 - cloud platform, which is IAM service.
21:54 - So we're going to go deeper here.
21:56 - We're going to understand the secure and
proper usage of users, groups, policies,
22:01 - and most importantly, the AWS roles.
22:05 - And this is important because when we're
22:07 - automating things and instead of humans
just doing manual stuff, basically
22:11 - services and scripts and tools talk to
each other and the whole thing is
22:15 - orchestrated with automation, then we
need to use roles extensively, way more
22:20 - than users or groups.
22:22 - We're also going to secure deployment to
22:25 - our environment, which is going to be a
combination of secure access management,
22:29 - but also secure network configuration to
make sure that all the traffic getting to
22:35 - your virtual machines on AWS, which are
EC2 instances, all the traffic is secure
22:41 - and it goes through AWS authentication
and authorization steps, which means no
22:48 - SSH -ing into the servers.
22:50 - And what's more important, no static
22:52 - private keys or user access keys, instead
using roles and short -lived access
22:59 - tokens for short -lived sessions.
23:03 - Here we have another step, another
23:05 - concept that actually applies to
application security, but it comes after
23:09 - deploying an application to the end environment.
23:12 - And that is a concept of DUST or dynamic
23:15 - application security testing.
23:17 - So SAST or static application security
23:20 - testing is for the code, the application
code itself, which is also called a white
23:26 - box testing.
23:27 - However, there are many security issues
23:30 - that will only appear when the
application is actually running and
23:34 - interactions to that application is happening.
23:37 - So basically DUST is simulating an
23:39 - attacker who is attacking or trying to
hack into your running systems.
23:44 - And again, we're going to learn the
concept of DUST, the tools, and we're
23:48 - going to see how to secure our
application after finding any issues or
23:53 - security findings with DUST tests.
23:56 - So going back to the infrastructure
23:58 - security, again, coming back to the
automation concept because we want things automated.
24:04 - We are actually going to go into details
of how infrastructure as code helps in
24:10 - securing your infrastructure and why is
it so important in DevSecOps.
24:16 - And once we've understood that, we're
actually going to deploy that and use it
24:20 - to make our infrastructure more secure.
24:22 - And we're going to use Terraform here to
24:25 - basically build a secure AWS
infrastructure for our application
24:30 - deployment environment.
24:32 - Again, with proper access management,
24:34 - network security and so on.
24:36 - And here we're going to go a step further
24:38 - and we're actually going to learn not
only how to secure our infrastructure
24:43 - using infrastructure as code tool, but
also how to automate the security checks
24:49 - when using infrastructure as code to
create the infrastructure.
24:54 - And in doing that, we're actually going
to use a concept of GitOps where we're
25:00 - going to build a CI -CD pipeline for our
Terraform infrastructure as code script
25:05 - and add the security scanning or static
security scanning in that pipeline, just
25:12 - like we did for the application, which is
the definition of GitOps of using version
25:17 - control tool for your infrastructure as
code and treating it the same way as your application.
25:23 - And as a final but very important part of
cloud security and infrastructure
25:27 - security, we're going to learn the
concept of logging and monitoring, and
25:32 - we're going to understand exactly why and
how logging and monitoring help us in
25:36 - securing our systems or even after
somebody has infiltrated our systems.
25:42 - And for the cloud security specifically,
we're actually going to learn two AWS
25:46 - services for logging and monitoring,
which are CloudTrail and CloudWatch.
25:51 - So we're going to learn about these tools
in general, but of course, we need use
25:55 - cases, we need hands -on practice.
25:56 - So we're going to configure those
25:58 - services to monitor the activity and
behavior on our AWS cloud platform across
26:05 - all different services and actually
notify us when something happens that is
26:11 - a suspicious behavior or something that
may affect security of our systems.
26:17 - And as part of that, we're also going to
learn how to monitor and alert on AWS
26:22 - cloud costs using AWS budget service,
which is a small use case, but also a
26:30 - useful one.
26:31 - After the chapter of infrastructure and
26:34 - cloud security, we're going to move into
a third giant part of this bootcamp
26:39 - related to Kubernetes platform security,
because as you know, Kubernetes has
26:46 - already become a standard in the cloud
world and no DevOps related bootcamp or
26:52 - course would be complete without covering
Kubernetes in it.
26:57 - This means we are going to actually
change our application development
27:01 - environment from simple virtual machines
on AWS to a full -blown Kubernetes
27:07 - cluster on AWS using EKS.
27:11 - And that means by introducing Kubernetes
27:13 - cluster on top of cloud infrastructure,
we'll introduce another world of security
27:20 - attack surface and security concerns
which need to be addressed.
27:26 - And our goal is to always equip you with
the most in -demand skills and most use cases.
27:32 - So stopping at AWS and cloud security was
not an option for us here.
27:36 - So learning how to secure Kubernetes
platform and applications running inside
27:41 - Kubernetes cluster will be an absolute
game changer in your career.
27:45 - And I just want to note here that we are
going to be first releasing the part one
27:50 - of this bootcamp, because as I said, this
bootcamp is pretty large.
27:54 - So we kind of divided it up into two
parts and Kubernetes platform security
28:00 - will be another large part two of this bootcamp.
28:04 - But to cover on a high level, the
28:06 - concepts and topics that you're going to
learn related to Kubernetes security,
28:10 - obviously, just like with cloud security,
we're going to cover the access
28:14 - management to Kubernetes cluster.
28:17 - Who has access?
28:17 - What?
28:18 - Who can log in as an administrator to set
28:21 - up and configure stuff?
28:22 - And how are those access credentials
28:24 - managed with the least privileged access?
28:27 - So as part of this, we're going to
28:29 - actually dive in and see again in
practice, not just the Kubernetes native
28:35 - mechanism for access control, which is
Kubernetes RBAC mechanism, role -based
28:39 - access control with service accounts,
roles, role bindings and so on.
28:44 - But also its integration with AWS's
access management, access management
28:49 - service called IAM, which, as you
remember, we mentioned in the cloud security.
28:53 - So basically combining those to give us
secure access control of EKS cluster.
28:59 - And again, this is a very practical real
world use case.
29:04 - But of course, aside for access
management, we also need to secure the
29:09 - applications running inside how we pull
the private images into the Kubernetes
29:13 - cluster, how we make sure to secure the
containers, the pods running inside the
29:18 - cluster so that they don't become the
entry points of security attacks to allow
29:23 - hackers to break out of the pods and
access the whole Kubernetes cluster.
29:28 - So we're going to learn the concepts
behind that, as well as how to secure
29:32 - that part.
29:32 - We're also going to learn the Kubernetes
29:35 - native security related components such
as network policies.
29:40 - So how to do micro network segmentation
and basically secure the access on a pod
29:46 - level rather than on the cluster level.
29:49 - And as part of that, we're also going to
29:51 - learn a third party implementation of that.
29:54 - We're also going to learn the concept of
29:56 - service mesh and how different features
of service mesh actually help you secure
30:02 - your complex microservices applications
in the Kubernetes cluster.
30:07 - And of course, in addition to that, we
have the cluster entry points like
30:10 - ingress controllers, the load balancers,
which are also important considerations
30:15 - when we're talking about security.
30:16 - So we're going to cover all of that and
30:18 - see actual real life use cases of those things.
30:22 - One more super important and relevant
30:25 - topic is sensitive data management in
Kubernetes, because when we have
30:30 - applications that need to talk to each
other, we have databases, we have other
30:35 - services that require authentication and authorization.
30:39 - Obviously, we have lots of access keys or
30:42 - credentials and so on that needs to be
stored securely.
30:45 - So as part of this, we're going to learn
a very popular open source tool from
30:50 - HashiCorp called Vault.
30:52 - So using Vault, we're actually going to
30:54 - demonstrate how to store and use secrets
and sensitive data in Kubernetes and
31:00 - around Kubernetes, including the secret
key management, the secret data
31:04 - management for the applications, storing
any credentials and so on.
31:08 - And finally, again, we want to automate processes.
31:11 - We want to learn the automation parts of
31:14 - the security as well in Kubernetes.
31:17 - Since we're learning DevSecOps, that
31:19 - means we're going to learn the tools for
automatic scanning of security
31:24 - misconfigurations and security
vulnerabilities of Kubernetes manifests.
31:29 - So when product teams deploy their
applications to Kubernetes cluster using
31:34 - Kubernetes manifest files, we can
automate the scanning of those
31:38 - configuration files for any security issues.
31:41 - And as part of that, we're also going to
31:43 - learn what's called policy as code.
31:45 - So basically creating any security
31:48 - policies related to Kubernetes and
enforce those policies as part of the CI
31:54 - -CD pipeline for the application
deployment process, which is a super
32:00 - exciting and interesting topic and
something that also makes working with
32:04 - Kubernetes and managing security issues
and misconfigurations in Kubernetes way
32:09 - easier to handle from the Kubernetes
administrator side.
32:14 - So this part is going to be completely
packed with absolutely amazing, exciting
32:19 - concepts directly related to Kubernetes,
but also involving lots of third party tools.
32:25 - And as I said, this will upgrade your
existing skills as an engineer to a
32:31 - completely new level.
32:32 - And that's not even all.
32:34 - We're not done yet.
32:36 - A very important security related topic
32:38 - is compliance.
32:39 - The need to automate things and make
32:41 - things fast and efficient in DevOps and
DevSecOps world applies to compliance as
32:46 - well, which we all know as this
traditional bureaucratic manual effort
32:52 - that companies have to do to validate
compliance of their projects.
32:56 - But not in DevSecOps.
32:57 - We will learn about compliance as code
32:59 - and the tools that help us automate
compliance using code and scripts.
33:05 - And compliance is an overarching concept
that actually applies to all these three
33:12 - categories that we just went through from
application security to infrastructure
33:16 - and cloud security to platform security.
33:19 - And as part of compliance as code, we're
33:21 - also going to learn about CIS benchmarks
and how they are used as part of
33:26 - implementing compliance as code.
33:29 - And again, all of this will be taught as
33:31 - hands on demo project.
33:33 - So you're actually going to learn how to
33:35 - do all of this in practice and not just theory.
33:39 - And finally, the last but not least,
33:41 - DevSecOps is not only a technological
change and technological implementation
33:46 - where you just put a dozen technologies
together and create automated processes,
33:51 - but it's also a conceptual change or
sometimes even cultural change in IT
33:57 - project teams in organizations.
33:59 - So it's important to understand, again,
34:02 - in real world, what are the challenges
and difficulties of introducing DevSecOps
34:07 - into a project or the entire organization?
34:10 - How do you get engineers on board?
34:12 - How do you introduce DevSecOps
strategically in teams step by step?
34:17 - Because here's the thing, when you as an
engineer learn about DevSecOps, you're
34:22 - getting a completely different
understanding and perspective of what
34:27 - benefits it has.
34:28 - And by having this knowledge, you will
34:30 - know exactly how it helps the business
and teams.
34:33 - But other people, including engineers who
are not aware of those concepts, often
34:38 - may not have the same perspective and may
not even think that this is something
34:42 - important or relevant, or they just don't
have time to research and understand why
34:48 - it's important.
34:49 - So how can you be the driver for
34:51 - DevSecOps in your project and
organization to show the other team
34:56 - members and engineers using incremental
wins, what value it has?
35:02 - So here in this last chapter, we cover
some practical strategies and steps for
35:07 - DevSecOps adoption in organizations.
35:10 - And this could be another huge value add
35:12 - in your career, because knowing this will
let you provide massive value for the
35:17 - company strategically as well.
35:20 - So that's basically the entire curriculum.
35:22 - And as you see, it's huge.
35:24 - It has lots of technologies, lots of
35:26 - concepts, lots to learn.
35:28 - And I'm happy that we can make all this
35:30 - knowledge available to the world.
35:32 - One thing I want to stress here again is
35:35 - that the main focus of the entire
bootcamp, just like in every other course
35:40 - or bootcamp that we have, is to learn and
understand the concepts and think about
35:45 - the tools just as means to an end.
35:48 - That means the CI -CD pipeline that we
35:50 - build, the infrastructure as code project
that we build, all the different security
35:56 - scanning tools that we use, all of that
knowledge is easily transferable to any
36:01 - other CI -CD tool, to any other security
scanning tool, even to any application
36:07 - using a different tech stack than we're
using in this bootcamp.
36:11 - So you'll have all the knowledge to
replace any of these tools very easily
36:16 - because you understand the fundamental concepts.
36:19 - That means if you're thinking about, I
36:22 - want to implement this for Jenkins
pipeline, or I want to do this in GitHub
36:25 - actions or Bitbucket or whatever CI -CD
tools you want to use.
36:29 - So you can literally take the pipeline
and translate it to any other CI -CD tool.
36:34 - So that was extremely important for me
because I believe that is the most
36:38 - powerful level of knowledge when you're
not tied or chained to the tools, but
36:44 - rather see them as means to an end to
actually accomplish the actual goals that
36:50 - you have with your projects, for example.
36:52 - Now, what you get when you enroll in this
36:54 - bootcamp is not only the educational
videos with all the demos that you can
36:58 - work along, but a bunch of other stuff,
which should make your learning process
37:03 - easier, more comfortable, more convenient.
37:06 - So obviously all the Git repositories
37:08 - that we're using in this project are
perfectly structured so you can easily
37:12 - follow them.
37:12 - So all of them will be provided in the
37:14 - relevant places.
37:15 - And in addition to that, we have also
37:18 - created accompanying handouts with key takeaways.
37:22 - And we found that a lot of students
37:23 - actually find value in that because once
they have gone through a huge chapter,
37:28 - they want to kind of summarize in their
heads and kind of revisit all the key
37:32 - points, a way more important addition to
this bootcamp that you also get out of
37:38 - the box when you enroll.
37:40 - We also understand the importance of
37:42 - support for students in their learning journey.
37:46 - And that's why we provide dedicated
37:47 - DevSecOps engineers and a support team in
an exclusive group where you can get
37:53 - active support throughout your entire
learning process.
37:57 - So for the entire learning journey,
you're going to have a dedicated team of
38:02 - engineers who have real world experience
and expertise in this field, answering
38:07 - your questions, supporting you whenever
you need, motivating you and helping you
38:13 - along the journey.
38:14 - And we also made sure to cover multiple
38:17 - time zones with multiple support
engineers so that every student gets help
38:22 - when they need it.
38:24 - So when you get stuck in a demo or need
38:26 - more explanation of some concept, etc.,
you can ask your question in a dedicated
38:30 - channel in this private group and someone
from our support or me myself will get
38:36 - back to you as soon as possible.
38:37 - And as I said, support part is extremely
38:40 - important for us because we try and
successfully achieve to exceed our
38:45 - students expectations with our content.
38:48 - And we want to achieve the same with
38:50 - support as well.
38:51 - And once more, we are not done yet.
38:54 - You actually get two more things as part
of this bootcamp.
38:58 - First of all, I believe that one of the
best proofs of your newly acquired
39:03 - knowledge is a certification.
39:05 - Even though I'm not a big fan for just
39:08 - learning for a certification, I believe
that if you learn something practical,
39:13 - you should have a certified document that
shows that.
39:18 - Because after working hard and learning
for weeks or months, you want to be able
39:22 - to showcase and promote your new skills
in a simple way.
39:27 - And this is included in the bootcamp at
no additional cost because we want to
39:31 - give our students the best way to prove
their knowledge after intensive learning.
39:36 - But even more than that, we also made
sure to provide certificates to our
39:39 - students in a way that is easy to share
or embed in various formats, but also
39:45 - easy to validate and proof.
39:47 - So everyone who sees your certificate
39:49 - will know that it's legitimate because
this technology allows for a validation
39:55 - of a certificate instead of an old
fashioned simple PDF file.
39:59 - So at the end of the training program,
you can apply for a verifiable digital
40:04 - certificate or digital badge.
40:07 - And remember what I mentioned at the
40:09 - beginning, the value of proper security
implementation for companies.
40:13 - So every company who even remotely cares
about securing their applications or
40:18 - systems will have interest to have
engineers skilled in DevSecOps processes
40:23 - regardless of their roles in order to
increase the security awareness across
40:27 - engineering teams.
40:28 - So no matter if you are a software
40:30 - developer, cloud engineer, automated
testing engineer, whatever, you can ask
40:35 - your employer whether they want to invest
in your upskilling and professional
40:40 - training, which many companies already do
by providing such yearly training budgets
40:46 - for their employees.
40:47 - And that's why to help you in this
40:49 - process, we have also prepared the
convince your boss letter with detailed
40:54 - description of skills you learn and
acquire in this bootcamp and the learning
40:58 - outcomes that will actually benefit the
company as well that you can present to them.
41:03 - And finally, we are completely
transparent with information around the bootcamp.
41:07 - And that's why I made this long video to
make sure that I cover every single detail.
41:13 - So you know exactly what you're getting,
how you're getting all the details.
41:17 - So no one is misled or enrolls without
meeting important prerequisite criteria,
41:23 - for example.
41:24 - So we put all this information on the
41:26 - website in this video.
41:27 - We added a Q &A section.
41:29 - There is also an additional questions
form that you can ask us any question
41:33 - that we might have missed to cover.
41:35 - But if you still have any doubt about
41:37 - anything that we didn't mention or just
want to check out the bootcamp to decide
41:42 - if it's actually for you, maybe the
technical level, whatever, you can do so
41:48 - completely free of risk, because once you
enroll, you can check out a few videos
41:53 - during the week from different chapters.
41:55 - You can check out a couple of demo
41:56 - projects that we have and make your final
decision whether you actually want to do
42:02 - this bootcamp.
42:03 - If not, you can give it back in the same week.
42:05 - No questions asked.
42:07 - And at least you will know you have
42:08 - checked it out and made a completely
informed decision.
42:11 - So that was probably the longest bootcamp
overview video in the world.
42:16 - But I hope I was able to answer all the
questions that you might have, was able
42:21 - to give some value in this video itself.
42:24 - And I hope to see you inside the bootcamp.
