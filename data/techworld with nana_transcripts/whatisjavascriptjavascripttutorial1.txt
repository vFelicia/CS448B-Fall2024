00:00 - this video is for absolute beginners in
00:02 - JavaScript so let's see what javascript
00:05 - is and how it's used all modern web
00:12 - applications which are applications that
00:15 - are used through internet browser are
00:17 - all written using JavaScript because it
00:20 - has become the standard in developing
00:22 - web applications the way these web
00:25 - applications are built is that you have
00:27 - a layer of HTML which gets styled and
00:30 - made more beautiful by CSS in order to
00:34 - make this beautiful surface also called
00:36 - user interface smarter and more
00:39 - intelligent we use JavaScript to write
00:42 - logic to create features examples of
00:45 - such features are user registration
00:48 - booking a ticket online shopping sharing
00:51 - photos writing messages etc so when
00:54 - thinking about how websites are built
00:56 - one can separate the design layer and
00:59 - logic layer and in big complex
01:02 - applications used by millions of users
01:05 - each part becomes big enough on its own
01:08 - so as a result you also have website
01:10 - designers also called UI designers and
01:13 - JavaScript developers as separate jobs
01:15 - maybe you've heard of programming
01:17 - languages like Java Python c-sharp etc
01:21 - in one sentence all these are beckoned
01:24 - programming languages and JavaScript is
01:27 - a front-end programming language in fact
01:29 - JavaScript is currently the only
01:31 - programming language you can use to
01:33 - write front-end code now to make all
01:36 - these more tangible let's see how HTML
01:38 - CSS and JavaScript code actually looks
01:41 - like HTML CSS and JavaScript are simple
01:44 - files that you write in a text editor
01:47 - and these files have texts and keywords
01:49 - in them which have specific meanings to
01:52 - the browser
01:53 - in other words browser will know exactly
01:55 - what to do with these keywords so the
01:58 - question is when you create file with
02:01 - JavaScript keywords inside
02:02 - how does browser know that it's
02:04 - JavaScript and not some other text it
02:07 - knows because you tell it explicitly
02:10 - using the file extension the typical
02:13 - profile will have a text extension dot
02:17 - txt for example but when you create file
02:20 - called for example fjs browser knows it
02:25 - must interpret all the contents of the
02:28 - file as JavaScript code and it works
02:31 - exactly same with HTML and CSS to note
02:34 - here browsers are also written by
02:37 - developers using some code so this
02:39 - functionality to interpret HTML CSS and
02:42 - JavaScript was explicitly programmed and
02:45 - made part of all modern browsers it's
02:48 - important to mention here that learning
02:50 - HTML and CSS is pretty easy since there
02:52 - are just a handful of concepts you need
02:55 - to understand and learn
02:56 - they don't change much over time and
02:58 - they're also less logical so it's more
03:01 - learning syntax by heart to use them
03:04 - JavaScript on the other hand is very
03:06 - dynamic and much more powerful since you
03:08 - write almost all the logic with it
03:11 - so JavaScript changes a lot and improves
03:13 - continuously to make writing all these
03:16 - logic easier and more structured so
03:18 - obviously when you look at a simple web
03:20 - application logic for simple payment or
03:23 - uploading a picture or writing a message
03:25 - can be straightforward and easy but
03:28 - think of the complex websites use daily
03:30 - that have hundreds of functionalities so
03:34 - that's a lot of JavaScript code that
03:36 - developers have to manage and work with
03:38 - and that can be very challenging because
03:40 - of that over time many developers or
03:43 - teams of developers that use JavaScript
03:46 - came up with different ways to improve
03:48 - it and make it easier and better and
03:50 - they did it in parallel independent of
03:53 - each other or also based on each other's
03:55 - ideas and as a result different
03:58 - JavaScript quote unquote flavors or as
04:00 - we call them frameworks emerged so
04:03 - framework is basically an improved
04:05 - version of pure vanilla JavaScript which
04:09 - offers its own additional concepts and
04:11 - syntax on top of JavaScript concepts and
04:14 - syntax that makes writing complex
04:17 - JavaScript code easier and most of these
04:19 - frameworks help you pretty much do the
04:22 - same but the difference between them is
04:24 - in how they help you write the
04:27 - structured and managing and naturally
04:30 - when other developers tried all these
04:32 - different frameworks a handful of the
04:34 - best of these frameworks became widely
04:36 - accepted and some of the most popular
04:39 - are react.js angularjs and vue.js so
04:43 - both pure JavaScript and JavaScript
04:44 - frameworks are continuously developing
04:47 - and improving in parallel now to mention
04:49 - here no J's which is also a JavaScript
04:52 - framework is different from all the
04:54 - others because it's meant not for
04:56 - front-end code but for back-end code so
05:00 - it's an alternative to Java Python
05:02 - c-sharp etc this means that if you learn
05:06 - JavaScript you will be able to basically
05:08 - program the whole web application from
05:10 - fronton to back-end using just
05:12 - JavaScript which could be a one
05:15 - incentive to learn JavaScript this means
05:18 - that in order to learn any of these
05:20 - frameworks that I just mentioned you
05:22 - first need to understand basic
05:23 - JavaScript concepts and syntax because
05:26 - all of these frameworks are based on
05:28 - JavaScript and once you've learned basic
05:32 - concepts of JavaScript then you can go
05:34 - ahead and choose one of these frameworks
05:36 - to learn and it will be much easier for
05:39 - you to learn concepts and syntax of that
05:42 - framework on top of JavaScript so in the
05:44 - next videos I'm gonna cover the basic
05:47 - concepts and syntax of JavaScript so
05:49 - that you have a foundation to learn any
05:52 - JavaScript framework
