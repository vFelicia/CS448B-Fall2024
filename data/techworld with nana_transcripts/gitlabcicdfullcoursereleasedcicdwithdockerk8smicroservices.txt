00:00 - hi there i am super excited to welcome
00:02 - you to the gitlab ci city course
00:05 - getlab csd has become a very popular
00:07 - platform for creating release pipelines
00:10 - for your application so i created this
00:12 - course to teach you all the concepts and
00:15 - features to build real-life and modern
00:18 - cicd pipelines on gitlab
00:20 - so by the end of this course you'll be
00:23 - able to confidently use gitlab to build
00:26 - real devops pipelines in your projects
00:29 - since it's a cicd platform naturally it
00:32 - means that you need to know how to
00:34 - integrate it with other technologies so
00:36 - in this course i teach you how to use
00:39 - gitlab ci with technologies like docker
00:42 - docker compose kubernetes aws and so on
00:46 - because as an engineer if you get into a
00:48 - project where gitlab ci is used and you
00:51 - need to work with it you need a course
00:53 - where you can learn not only the basics
00:55 - and fundamentals of gitlab cicd itself
00:58 - like in most other courses but you need
01:00 - to know how to actually do real tasks of
01:03 - integrating it with deployment
01:05 - environments container registries using
01:08 - secret data et cetera and building
01:10 - pipelines not only for a simple
01:13 - application but for microservices
01:15 - applications which has its own specifics
01:17 - and challenges but you don't want to
01:19 - just learn to do it in any possible way
01:22 - like an inexperienced engineer just
01:24 - googling things and putting together
01:26 - something that just works instead you
01:28 - want to learn how to do things in the
01:30 - correct way with actual best practices
01:32 - like properly handling the sensitive
01:34 - data reusing pipeline configuration to
01:37 - avoid code duplication using a dedicated
01:40 - user to deploy to kubernetes environment
01:42 - parameterizing and using dynamic values
01:45 - in the pipeline to make them more
01:47 - flexible and reusable and so on if you
01:50 - have taken any of my other courses you
01:52 - know that you always get the best
01:54 - combination of theory and practice
01:57 - you learn every single concept and
02:00 - feature with engaging easy to follow
02:03 - demo projects but before each demo i
02:05 - explain the concept so you really
02:07 - understand exactly why a certain feature
02:10 - or concept is important and what purpose
02:13 - it has and again you learn not only
02:16 - gitlab specific things but also a lot of
02:18 - additional
02:20 - valuable information about docker docker
02:22 - compose kubernetes microservices etc so
02:26 - it's a well-rounded course with a lot of
02:29 - valuable knowledge for you as an
02:30 - engineer
02:31 - throughout the course i make sure to
02:33 - explain and highlight best practices and
02:35 - industry insights were relevant and this
02:38 - is an essential addition to teach you
02:41 - not only how to do stuff in any way but
02:43 - in the correct way making your knowledge
02:46 - even more valuable
02:47 - so equipped with this knowledge by the
02:50 - end of this course you will be
02:52 - absolutely confident that you really
02:54 - understand how gitlab cia city works and
02:56 - know exactly how to apply it in your
02:59 - real projects no knowledge gaps no
03:02 - insecurities so let's dive into the
03:04 - course curriculum to see what you will
03:06 - learn exactly
03:08 - we'll start with the basics of what ci
03:10 - cd is in general and comparison of git
03:13 - lapsity with other cicd tools
03:16 - then we'll go on to learn a very
03:18 - interesting topic of gitlab architecture
03:20 - and how it all works we'll learn about
03:23 - runners and executors and we will
03:25 - actually create and configure our own
03:27 - runners for the gitlab instance we will
03:30 - look at different ways of operating
03:32 - gitlab and see managed versus
03:34 - self-managed gitlab platform once we
03:37 - have the infrastructure set up we will
03:39 - move on to learn the core concepts of
03:41 - gitlab cicd like jobs stages the
03:45 - pipeline syntax in general how to use
03:47 - conditionals regular and secret
03:50 - variables and reusing configuration code
03:53 - to avoid duplication we will learn the
03:55 - concept of artifacts and how to generate
03:58 - test reports as well as share data
04:00 - within the pipeline using the artifacts
04:03 - we will see how workflow rules can be
04:05 - used to define when the pipelines should
04:08 - be triggered and we will also learn
04:10 - about gitlab's built-in docker registry
04:12 - and how to use it in the pipeline after
04:15 - that we'll move on to more advanced
04:17 - topics and learn how to speed up the
04:19 - pipeline using cache how to use the
04:22 - include feature and use gitlab's job
04:24 - templates in your pipeline
04:26 - and how to extract common pipeline code
04:29 - and build a job hierarchy with extends
04:31 - feature to make your pipeline
04:33 - configuration more maintainable
04:36 - and you will learn all these while
04:38 - building complete ci cd pipelines for
04:41 - demo applications
04:43 - in the first demo project we will build
04:44 - a real-life pipeline deploying a node.js
04:48 - application testing the application with
04:50 - simple unit tests and security tests
04:53 - incrementing and dynamically setting
04:56 - version for the docker image building
04:58 - and pushing image to gitlab's docker
05:01 - registry doing a multi-stage deployment
05:04 - to a deployment server with
05:06 - docker compose and promoting from
05:09 - development staging and production
05:11 - environments after that you will work
05:13 - through a demo of building a csd
05:16 - pipeline for a micro services
05:18 - application in a monorepo and then do a
05:21 - demo and compare
05:23 - building cicd pipeline for a polyrepo so
05:26 - you learn how to do both and throughout
05:28 - these demos we will use best practices
05:31 - of extracting and reusing configuration
05:33 - code for multiple services by creating a
05:36 - gitlab ci templates library here we use
05:40 - docker compose to deploy the services
05:43 - but in the final demo we will take this
05:45 - one step further and configure
05:48 - continuous deployment of microservices
05:50 - to a kubernetes cluster so with all this
05:53 - knowledge and practice you will be ready
05:55 - to implement real ci cd pipelines on
05:58 - gitlab at your work
06:00 - we took time and put a lot of effort in
06:03 - making this course as high quality as
06:05 - possible making all the concepts easy to
06:08 - understand and all the demos easy to
06:10 - follow as well as structure the course
06:12 - in a way that it stays engaging and
06:14 - interesting till the end so i really
06:17 - hope you enjoy it so if you want to
06:19 - learn all these check the video
06:20 - description for the link to the course
06:23 - where you get more information and you
06:25 - can get enrolled i'm very excited to
06:28 - welcome you there
