00:00 - in this lecture we're going to learn
00:02 - about a very important concept in the it
00:04 - world
00:05 - which is virtualization and virtual
00:07 - machines
00:08 - we're going to see what virtual machines
00:10 - are and why are they so useful
00:13 - and learn all the main concepts of
00:15 - virtualization
00:16 - once we learn the concept of how virtual
00:18 - machines work
00:19 - we're going to see it in action in the
00:21 - demo part by
00:23 - creating a linux virtual machine on our
00:25 - computer
00:26 - using a popular open source software
00:29 - called virtualbox
00:31 - i am nana and i have taught hundreds of
00:33 - thousands of people around the world
00:35 - how to advance their devops skills
00:38 - through my youtube videos
00:39 - online courses in the six month devops
00:42 - bootcamp
00:43 - if you're new here be sure to subscribe
00:45 - as i upload new videos
00:47 - all the time now let's see what a
00:50 - virtual
00:51 - machine is imagine you have a windows
00:54 - computer
00:55 - and as we learned a computer has
00:57 - hardware like cpu
00:59 - ram and storage so we would have windows
01:01 - operating system
01:03 - on top of that that controls how
01:06 - applications
01:06 - use these hardware resources and on top
01:09 - of the windows operating system you
01:11 - would have applications
01:12 - that talk to windows so everything's
01:15 - cool here
01:16 - now what if you wanted to use linux
01:19 - instead
01:20 - maybe for your work or maybe you just
01:22 - want to learn a
01:23 - new operating system for that you will
01:25 - need a machine
01:27 - with hardware resources and linux
01:30 - operating system
01:31 - on top of that and then you could run
01:33 - applications
01:34 - on that linux operating system so
01:37 - basically you would need another
01:38 - computer another laptop
01:40 - where you would install that linux
01:42 - operating system
01:44 - now what virtualization is is that
01:47 - you don't need a separate physical
01:50 - hardware or physical computer
01:52 - to install an operating system you can
01:55 - install linux operating system on top of
01:57 - the windows os or vice versa
02:01 - you can install windows on linux or
02:03 - windows and linux on mac os
02:06 - you can do any combination basically you
02:08 - can even do windows
02:09 - on windows or linux on linux and you can
02:12 - achieve that
02:13 - using something called a hypervisor
02:16 - hypervisor is a technology that allows
02:19 - hosting multiple virtual computers on a
02:22 - physical
02:23 - computer on top of the operating system
02:25 - that you already have
02:27 - installed and one of the most popular
02:29 - hypervisors out there
02:30 - is virtualbox from oracle
02:34 - and one of the main reasons for its
02:36 - popularity is because it's
02:37 - open source and virtualbox actually
02:40 - works on
02:40 - all operating systems and it's pretty
02:42 - easy to use so virtualbox will
02:45 - let you create a virtual computer on
02:48 - your windows computer
02:49 - by telling the windows operating system
02:52 - hey can i have some of your hardware
02:54 - resources
02:55 - that you manage to create a virtual cpu
03:00 - virtual ram virtual storage for my
03:02 - virtual computer
03:04 - and as i said you can have multiple
03:07 - virtual machines that are running on
03:10 - your
03:10 - computer through a hypervisor
03:14 - now note here that you can only give the
03:16 - virtual computer the hardware resources
03:18 - you actually
03:19 - have available on that computer if you
03:22 - have
03:22 - eight gigabytes of ram and your windows
03:25 - is using
03:26 - four gigabytes and you give your virtual
03:28 - machine
03:29 - another four gigabytes then you have no
03:32 - ram
03:32 - left to be used for another virtual
03:34 - machine so you can't create another one
03:36 - so basically now you are sharing the
03:38 - hardware resources of
03:40 - one machine to run multiple
03:43 - virtual machines so this means that as
03:45 - long as you have one computer with one
03:48 - operating system
03:49 - using the hypervisor like virtualbox you
03:52 - can install
03:53 - other operating systems on top of it but
03:56 - these virtual machines
03:58 - actually don't see each other and
03:59 - they're completely isolated
04:01 - so the virtual machine itself thinks
04:05 - that it is an independent computer it's
04:08 - the only one
04:09 - running on that computer it doesn't even
04:11 - know that it's a virtual machine
04:13 - and it doesn't know that it's hosted on
04:15 - top of another operating system
04:17 - and that separation is actually great
04:20 - because
04:20 - if something happens to that virtual
04:23 - machine
04:24 - something breaks inside or someone hex
04:27 - inside that virtual machine
04:29 - it won't affect the main operating
04:31 - system
04:32 - the main os probably won't even know
04:34 - that the vm has
04:35 - some issues and it doesn't care so
04:38 - when this happens you can just delete
04:40 - that vm and create a fresh new one
04:43 - super easily now you're probably asking
04:46 - what is it actually good for
04:48 - what is the usage or benefits of having
04:51 - a hypervisor and having virtual machines
04:53 - on your computer first of all it's
04:56 - really great for learning new operating
04:58 - systems so now you don't have to go and
05:00 - buy a new computer and install
05:02 - and linux on it you can basically just
05:05 - host it
05:05 - on your windows machine if you want to
05:08 - maybe you want to
05:09 - just experiment and play around with an
05:11 - operating system but you don't want to
05:13 - actually
05:14 - destroy or endanger your main operating
05:16 - system
05:17 - so you can quickly spin up a virtual
05:20 - machine
05:20 - you can play around with it and do all
05:22 - the stuff that you want
05:24 - and then once you're done with it you
05:25 - can just basically remove it
05:27 - another great use case for virtual
05:29 - machines
05:31 - is if you want to test an application
05:33 - like a web application that you're
05:35 - developing
05:36 - maybe you want to see how that works and
05:38 - how it looks like
05:39 - in different operating systems in
05:41 - different browsers so you may be
05:43 - developing on a mac os laptop
05:47 - and you want to see how your application
05:48 - performs on linux machine in a firefox
05:50 - browser and you may
05:52 - also want to see how your application
05:55 - runs on windows
05:56 - in internet explorer browser so you can
05:58 - create virtual machines
06:00 - for both of these combinations and test
06:03 - your application
06:04 - there and when you're done you can just
06:06 - delete them
06:07 - before moving on i want to give a shout
06:09 - out to kesten who made this video
06:12 - possible
06:13 - castings k10 is the data management
06:16 - platform for kubernetes
06:18 - k10 basically takes off most of the load
06:21 - of doing backup and restore in
06:23 - kubernetes
06:24 - from the cluster administrators it has a
06:27 - very simple ui so it's super
06:29 - easy to work with and has an intelligent
06:32 - logic which does
06:33 - all the heavy lifting for you for my
06:36 - viewers
06:36 - casting provided an ebook kubernetes
06:39 - backup and recovery for dummies
06:42 - which you can download for free so be
06:44 - sure to check out the link in the video
06:46 - description
06:47 - and now let's see what's the difference
06:49 - between type 1
06:50 - and type 2 hypervisors and this type of
06:54 - hypervisor
06:55 - that i just described which is basically
06:59 - creating virtual machines on top of an
07:02 - existing operating system
07:05 - is called a type 2 hypervisor
07:08 - so you have the host operating system or
07:10 - the main operating system which is
07:12 - already installed on the hardware on
07:14 - your machine
07:15 - on that operating system you install a
07:17 - hypervisor like virtualbox
07:19 - right so on windows you install your
07:21 - virtualbox and then
07:23 - using the virtualbox you can now install
07:26 - guest operating systems and the guest
07:29 - operating systems as i said
07:31 - will borrow the hardware resources from
07:34 - the host operating system
07:36 - and the type 2 hypervisors are typically
07:40 - used for personal computers
07:42 - for the use cases that i just described
07:45 - however for big servers that companies
07:48 - are using
07:49 - you have the second type of hypervisor
07:52 - which is
07:52 - type 1 hypervisor which actually works
07:56 - in
07:56 - exactly the same way however the main
07:58 - difference here is that
08:00 - instead of installing a hypervisor on a
08:02 - host
08:03 - operating system you basically install
08:05 - it directly
08:07 - on the hardware and that's why the type
08:09 - 1 hypervisors are also called
08:12 - bare metal hypervisors so the hypervisor
08:14 - actually controls the hardware resources
08:17 - instead of
08:17 - talking to the host operating system
08:20 - whether it can borrow the resources for
08:22 - its virtual machines
08:23 - so it sits directly on top of that
08:26 - hardware
08:26 - and controls everything and some of the
08:29 - popular examples of
08:30 - type 1 hypervisors are vmware
08:34 - esxi or microsoft's hyper-v
08:38 - and once installed basically the concept
08:41 - is the same
08:42 - as with type 2 hypervisors you basically
08:46 - just install
08:46 - any operating system on top of it so for
08:49 - big servers you'll have
08:51 - one physical server with a bare metal
08:53 - hypervisor
08:54 - installed on it and then you would have
08:56 - multiple
08:57 - virtual machines that are running on
08:59 - that hypervisor
09:00 - all sharing the same hardware resources
09:03 - and type one hypervisor
09:04 - is mostly what those big companies
09:08 - and big cloud platforms actually use to
09:11 - create and run their whole
09:14 - infrastructure
09:15 - so when you create a server instance on
09:17 - a cloud platform like aws
09:19 - or digitalocean or google cloud or
09:21 - whatever platform
09:22 - you're creating these virtual machines
09:25 - on a physical server
09:26 - and other users who create an instance
09:29 - may get a virtual machine on the same
09:31 - exact physical server
09:33 - as your virtual machine but as i said
09:35 - these vms are completely isolated they
09:38 - don't know anything about each other
09:39 - so if something happens in one virtual
09:41 - machine if someone gets
09:43 - hacked whose vm is on the same physical
09:45 - server
09:46 - you won't even know it because each vm
09:49 - is running in its own isolated
09:51 - environment right
09:52 - they don't share network they don't
09:54 - share any resources they don't share
09:56 - anything they're completely independent
09:58 - from each other
09:59 - now i give you some examples of why type
10:02 - 2
10:02 - or also called hosted hypervisors are
10:06 - useful right
10:07 - for using them on personal computer but
10:10 - what are the use cases
10:11 - of the type one hypervisors so what is
10:15 - basically the big advantage of companies
10:17 - going out there
10:18 - and using this virtualization
10:22 - on their server infrastructure one big
10:25 - advantage
10:26 - of using virtualization and hosting
10:29 - multiple virtual machines
10:31 - on one physical machine is efficient
10:34 - usage of hardware resources
10:36 - because now you may have these
10:40 - performant big servers on a cloud
10:43 - but you can actually or cloud provider
10:45 - can actually let the users
10:47 - put together any combination of
10:49 - resources
10:51 - they want in their instance by picking
10:54 - and choosing
10:55 - how much cpu how much ram how much
10:57 - storage they want
10:59 - so they have this flexibility of
11:01 - choosing the size of their instances
11:04 - because everything is virtualized right
11:06 - the ram
11:07 - and cpu and storage so all of these
11:09 - resources are virtualized
11:11 - so that's one big flexibility so now the
11:14 - cloud providers they can actually use up
11:16 - all their server
11:17 - physical server resources by actually
11:20 - dividing them
11:21 - into small pieces that are then used
11:24 - by virtual machines now there is one
11:27 - more
11:28 - very important benefit and basically
11:31 - transformation that happened
11:33 - in it industry because of virtualization
11:36 - and that is basically abstracting away
11:40 - the operating system that is running on
11:42 - the hardware
11:43 - from the hardware itself and that
11:46 - abstraction actually is a really big
11:48 - deal and let's see
11:49 - why so before virtualization when a
11:52 - company had a server like
11:54 - their own database server or a server
11:57 - where jenkins was running
11:58 - they would manage it themselves like
12:00 - install an operating system directly on
12:02 - it and then start
12:03 - installing applications on that
12:05 - operating system like installing and
12:07 - configuring jenkins
12:08 - or installing database application etc
12:12 - and when the operating system is
12:14 - installed directly on a hardware without
12:16 - that
12:16 - hypervisor layer in between that
12:19 - operating system is then tightly
12:22 - coupled to the hardware that means
12:25 - if the hardware component of the
12:26 - computer failed
12:28 - like the hard disk exploded or the
12:30 - motherboard failed whatever
12:32 - and you couldn't replace that component
12:34 - because maybe it was an
12:35 - old server and you couldn't find that
12:37 - component anymore or maybe it was just
12:39 - not
12:40 - repairable anymore for whatever reasons
12:42 - it meant your whole computer would be
12:44 - useless
12:45 - and the operating system and the
12:46 - applications you installed and
12:48 - configured on it
12:49 - and all the data would be gone so
12:51 - relying on that one physical box
12:54 - meant one point of failure and therefore
12:57 - high risk of losing all the services
12:59 - running on that machine with
13:02 - virtualization however
13:03 - you have your operating system as a
13:06 - portable
13:07 - file that you can move around and these
13:09 - files are
13:10 - virtual machine images so that portable
13:13 - file
13:13 - that image will have the operating
13:15 - system all the applications
13:18 - the browser applications the editors
13:21 - jenkins whatever applications you would
13:23 - usually install on an operating system
13:26 - all the configuration
13:27 - files pictures documents basically
13:29 - everything
13:31 - would be inside that portable file
13:34 - and since it's a file just like a
13:37 - picture or a text document
13:39 - you can make copies of it and you can
13:41 - have backups of it
13:42 - which is amazing and really useful
13:45 - especially for companies
13:46 - that means you could take your whole
13:48 - jenkins
13:50 - server operating system and pack it into
13:54 - this portable image where all your
13:56 - jenkins configuration
13:58 - all your plugins all your data basically
13:59 - would be inside
14:01 - exactly as you configured it and you can
14:03 - make backups of that
14:06 - image which are called snapshots right
14:09 - so you'd have
14:10 - operating system image snapshots so now
14:13 - if something happens
14:14 - to that virtual image where jenkins is
14:17 - running
14:18 - like you mess up jenkins configuration
14:20 - or someone hacked into it or
14:22 - the hardware breaks you can simply take
14:24 - that snapshot that operating system
14:27 - image and simply run it on a different
14:30 - computer
14:30 - with hypervisor on it so by containing
14:34 - the operating system and the application
14:36 - layer of it in a portable file
14:38 - you can secure your application and your
14:40 - work
14:41 - very easily and you can move it around
14:44 - machines
14:44 - without being dependent on any
14:48 - physical server so the virtual machines
14:50 - and the virtualization concept
14:52 - generally is very powerful and that's
14:55 - why you see it
14:55 - everywhere in it it has completely
14:58 - changed the way we work
14:59 - so whether you want to become a cloud
15:01 - engineer a system administrator software
15:04 - developer
15:04 - or devops engineer you need to
15:07 - understand the virtualization because
15:09 - you will be working with
15:10 - virtual machines this video is actually
15:13 - a small part of a linux module in the
15:15 - complete
15:16 - devops educational program linux is an
15:19 - important
15:20 - prerequisite for devops engineers so in
15:23 - the linux module you learn everything
15:25 - you need to know about
15:26 - operating systems and linux as a devops
15:29 - engineer
15:30 - so if you want to become a devops
15:32 - engineer or build up your devops skills
15:35 - from xero to knowing all the required
15:37 - devops concepts and tools
15:39 - be sure to check out our bootcamp and
15:42 - learn
15:43 - from a docker captain aws container hero
15:46 - and cncf ambassador with that
15:49 - thank you for watching i hope you
15:51 - learned a lot
