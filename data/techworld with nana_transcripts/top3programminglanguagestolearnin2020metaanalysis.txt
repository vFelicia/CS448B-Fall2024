00:00 - what are the top programming languages
00:02 - to learn in 2020 whether you're a
00:05 - beginner or an experienced of to a
00:07 - developer looking for new job
00:08 - opportunities this video will help you
00:11 - decide which one to learn the criteria
00:14 - for the popularity metrics are among
00:17 - others the job opportunities you have
00:19 - the difficulty level of learning the
00:23 - language and also the community behind
00:25 - it
00:26 - and this is not based on our opinion but
00:29 - rather a research we need a meta ranking
00:32 - based on analysis of more than 30
00:35 - articles and different statistics like
00:38 - Stack Overflow survey and search indices
00:40 - and by the way at the end of the video
00:43 - tell me what you think about the ranking
00:45 - and which language you will choose to
00:48 - learn in 2020 number three is Java
00:52 - according to tod search index which uses
00:55 - the aggregated data of all search
00:58 - engines Java has been the most searched
01:01 - programming language over the years in
01:04 - terms of job opportunities there are
01:06 - more than 30,000 job openings for Java
01:09 - developers which is an increase of 108
01:12 - percent compared to last year and
01:15 - generally speaking across all articles
01:18 - and statistics Java is mostly ranked in
01:21 - the top three so what is the reason that
01:25 - Java is so popular so the first reason
01:27 - is that Java is used in a lot of
01:30 - enterprise application development so
01:32 - big companies who are developing
01:33 - software especially legacy software they
01:37 - use Java and that explains why Java is
01:39 - still popular and amended the second one
01:42 - is Java is used in Android development
01:45 - so with the rise of popularity of
01:47 - Android apps of course Java gets even
01:51 - more popularity and the third one is
01:54 - because Java is an established language
01:57 - it has a lot of community support behind
02:00 - and Java is a powerful language for
02:03 - back-end development which has a wide
02:06 - range of features for different use
02:08 - cases like database connections
02:10 - networking parsers etc
02:14 - number two is JavaScript according to
02:17 - Stack Overflow survey JavaScript has
02:20 - been the most popular programming
02:22 - language for the seventh year in the row
02:24 - and in these two surveys all top three
02:28 - in the ranking are JavaScript frameworks
02:30 - as for the job opportunities there has
02:33 - been a hundred 22% increase in the
02:35 - number of JavaScript job openings in the
02:38 - last year and as a JavaScript developer
02:40 - you would get an average salary of
02:44 - $115,000 in the USA so why is your
02:48 - script so popular the number one reason
02:51 - is that javascript has a lot of really
02:54 - good frameworks for web development and
02:57 - besides the front-end frameworks like
03:00 - react and angular and buges it also has
03:03 - beckoned framework like node.js which
03:05 - makes javascript actually a full-stack
03:08 - programming language so as a web
03:10 - developer you could actually program the
03:13 - whole website just using javascript the
03:16 - second reason is that compared to Java
03:18 - which is used mostly in enterprise
03:20 - applications javascript is often used by
03:23 - startups for faster development and
03:25 - faster time-to-market because javascript
03:28 - is very flexible and has an easy set up
03:31 - so you can get started with the
03:33 - application development really fast you
03:35 - can now use JavaScript even for the
03:37 - mobile development using its react
03:39 - native framework which you can actually
03:41 - use to develop for both Android and iOS
03:44 - platforms and generally speaking if you
03:47 - want to be a web developer you cannot
03:49 - avoid learning JavaScript and number one
03:53 - is Python according to these statistics
03:56 - which is an aggregated stats from
03:59 - multiple surveys github repository data
04:01 - and search in the cysts python has
04:05 - become the top programming language also
04:07 - according to pi poll which is based on
04:09 - Google Search Engine Python tutorials
04:12 - have been the most searched on Google
04:14 - compared to other languages and
04:16 - according to Stack Overflow survey
04:18 - Python has been the most wanting
04:21 - programming language for the past three
04:23 - years meaning that developers who don't
04:25 - use it yet
04:26 - say they want to
04:27 - use it and in terms of job opportunities
04:30 - and average salary a Python developer
04:32 - would get in the USA is 120 thousand US
04:36 - dollars a number of job openings for
04:38 - Python developers is around thirty
04:40 - thousand which is an increase of 121
04:43 - percent compared to the last year so how
04:46 - did Python become the top programming
04:48 - language the number one reason for that
04:51 - is Python is used extensively in data
04:54 - science machine learning artificial
04:57 - intelligence all this new cool trends
05:00 - because Python has a lot of powerful
05:03 - features and libraries that are used in
05:06 - data processing machine learning AI the
05:09 - second one is that it's super easy to
05:11 - learn it has a very simple syntax and
05:14 - the concepts are also pretty easy to
05:18 - understand so for data scientists or
05:21 - people who don't really know how to
05:23 - program Python would be the easiest
05:25 - entry point into programming and in
05:28 - addition to this Python also has a large
05:31 - support community so to summarize each
05:34 - of these languages are very powerful and
05:36 - they're cross-functional so you can use
05:38 - them in many different scenarios however
05:41 - each one of them really shines in their
05:44 - own specific usage area so how do you
05:47 - decide which one to learn the answer is
05:49 - that based on your interest and your
05:52 - career plans you have to reverse
05:54 - engineer so for example if you want to
05:56 - become a web developer especially with
05:59 - the focus on front-end then you should
06:01 - definitely go with JavaScript but if you
06:03 - want to work on enterprise applications
06:06 - in big established companies then you
06:09 - would probably need to learn Java again
06:12 - if you are more interested in data
06:14 - science machine learning this kind of
06:16 - stuff and also if this is going to be
06:18 - your very first programming language
06:19 - then go with Python now if none of this
06:22 - is interesting for you and you're
06:24 - dreaming of becoming a game developer
06:26 - then you should go with C++ because
06:28 - that's the language for game development
06:30 - or if you want to concentrate on
06:33 - developing mobile apps for iOS platform
06:36 - then you should learn swift an important
06:39 - point here is that what
06:41 - ever language you decide to learn stick
06:44 - to it for the whole year and learning
06:46 - properly before choosing and switching
06:49 - to another language again because when
06:51 - you're learning properly it's going to
06:52 - be enough to already get a job in that
06:55 - specific language and then you can
06:57 - always add a new technology or a new
06:59 - programming language to your skill set
07:01 - so please share in the comments what are
07:04 - your career goals and which language you
07:06 - decided to learn in 2020
