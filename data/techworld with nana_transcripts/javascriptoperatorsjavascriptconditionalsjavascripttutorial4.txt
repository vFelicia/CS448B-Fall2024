00:00 - in this video you will learn with very
00:02 - simple examples and visualizations
00:05 - everything about conditionals and
00:07 - comparison operators in JavaScript so
00:10 - first let's see what comparison
00:12 - operators are let's consider as an
00:16 - example Facebook feature to display
00:19 - birthdays of its users so basically if
00:23 - today is your birthday
00:25 - Facebook will show a birthday icon and
00:28 - will send notifications to all your
00:31 - friends and for Facebook to check
00:33 - whether it's your birthday today
00:34 - basically it has to compare today with
00:38 - your birthdate right
00:39 - so that comparison or equals in
00:43 - JavaScript is expressed with 3
00:46 - comparison sites like this so one
00:50 - comparison sign is reserved for
00:53 - assigning variables as we saw in one of
00:56 - my previous videos of variables so
00:59 - double or triple equal signs are used to
01:04 - check the Equality of two values so it's
01:07 - the difference between the two so let's
01:09 - say I have a variable age 30 so if I
01:14 - compare value of variable age to 30 then
01:19 - I get true right if I triple compare
01:23 - that I also get true so same results now
01:27 - if I compare the value with a string
01:32 - representation of 30 I also get true
01:36 - however if I triple check I get false
01:41 - and this is a difference between these
01:44 - two the double comparison checks
01:46 - equality of the values on tooth sides so
01:50 - checks the value here checks the value
01:52 - here and compares them by the value the
01:55 - triple equality compares value and also
01:59 - the type the data type of those values
02:02 - so if I have a number here and a number
02:06 - here which are same values then it's
02:08 - going to be true if I have a number
02:11 - value here which is defined here
02:13 - and a string value here of the same
02:15 - value I get false because the data types
02:18 - are not the same so that's the
02:21 - difference and obviously if I put here
02:23 - another value it's gonna be false in any
02:26 - case right like this or like this
02:29 - doesn't really matter and that little
02:32 - difference can actually have a big
02:34 - impact that's why these concept is
02:36 - important in JavaScript general rule is
02:39 - that you should in most cases use the
02:42 - triple equation to compare two values
02:45 - now let's consider another example where
02:48 - you order something on Amazon it says
02:49 - that shipping is free above purchase of
02:53 - 20 euros so when you add things to your
02:55 - cart program checks whether your order
02:58 - total is above 20 or below 20 and then
03:02 - calculates the shipment costs based on
03:04 - that and let's say charges you 5 euros
03:07 - if your if your total order is under 20
03:11 - euros so now we don't have the equal
03:14 - check anymore but rather is it higher or
03:17 - is it lower so the way to check that is
03:20 - let's clear these so let's define
03:23 - variables so you have the total price
03:25 - let's say you gathered items that are 19
03:28 - euros and now the program checks if
03:31 - total price is greater than 20 euros you
03:37 - get a boolean expression of false
03:39 - because this condition is wrong in the
03:44 - same way the program can also check the
03:46 - opposite direction so you can check
03:48 - whether your total price is below 20 but
03:52 - notice that we don't check for value 20
03:55 - so what happens if the total price is
03:58 - exactly 20 so basically here we need to
04:00 - check that if total price is below 20 or
04:04 - 20 euros in both cases you get charged
04:08 - for the shipping so in order to do that
04:10 - you can combine those two expressions
04:12 - and say like this so either it should be
04:16 - less than 20 or to be exactly 20 for
04:19 - that to be true and as you see each of
04:22 - these comparisons return to you a
04:24 - boolean expression of either
04:27 - or true only one of these outcomes is
04:31 - possible so what this means is that in
04:34 - the program you check if this condition
04:37 - comes out as true then you want to offer
04:41 - free shipping otherwise you want to
04:44 - charge five euros for shipping and the
04:47 - way it's going to be written inside of
04:49 - the program using JavaScript syntax is
04:51 - if your price is greater than twenty
04:55 - here will be code that lets say
04:57 - calculates or sets the price of shipping
05:01 - so here we set it to zero there is no
05:04 - shipping cost otherwise is expressed
05:07 - with else shipping cost equals to five
05:12 - euros so this is how the conditions are
05:16 - used in JavaScript to check the
05:18 - condition and based on that divided this
05:21 - or if we switched that condition we can
05:25 - also check if total price is less than
05:28 - or equal to twenty then shipping cost
05:32 - will be set to five otherwise the
05:36 - shipping cost will be zero so to go back
05:40 - to some technical terms in JavaScript
05:42 - this here is called if-else statements
05:46 - whatever is inside if is called a
05:49 - condition so this thing here that
05:52 - evaluates to either true or false is a
05:53 - condition and this here that compares
05:57 - those two values is called a comparison
05:59 - operator so greater smaller equals etc
06:03 - all these are comparison operators but
06:07 - let's say you have a case where you have
06:08 - three different shipping costs right so
06:11 - for example if the price is below ten
06:14 - euros you get charged five euro shipping
06:17 - costs if it's below twenty you get
06:19 - charged only three euros and if it's
06:22 - above twenty you get charged nothing now
06:25 - you don't have if-else only but you have
06:28 - three conditions it's also super simple
06:30 - to do that with if-else so basically you
06:34 - check again if total price is less than
06:38 - or equal to ten
06:41 - you get charged five euros and here you
06:45 - are gonna say else/if which is another
06:49 - statement where you can write the
06:51 - conditional where we're gonna check
06:53 - where the total price is less than or
06:56 - equal to 20 in that case you get charged
06:59 - three euros and there comes our final
07:02 - else which is zero so now I have three
07:07 - conditions here so the first condition
07:09 - here says it's less than or equal to ten
07:13 - the first one checks another condition
07:16 - and the third one important thing to
07:19 - note here that the last else or the the
07:23 - else here doesn't have a condition
07:25 - explicitly but it implies that both of
07:28 - these above conditions were false so
07:32 - both of them were wrong B and because
07:35 - it's implicit we don't have to check it
07:37 - explicitly here so you could also go
07:40 - here and do that else if price is
07:46 - greater then 20 and this will work just
07:50 - fine however because it's implicit we
07:53 - don't need that so we sell comparisons
07:55 - between two values using equals higher
07:58 - or lower the final operator is not
08:02 - equals
08:03 - for example consider a feature where a
08:06 - web application checks whether user is a
08:09 - Premium Member or not obviously if you
08:13 - are not a premium user you won't see the
08:15 - cool features they have or you won't be
08:18 - able to access some premium content so
08:22 - when you log in program will check is
08:24 - user membership premium so with equals
08:29 - or it can check use a membership not
08:32 - premium and in order to express that
08:35 - negative comparison you use this syntax
08:38 - so not equals in JavaScript is expressed
08:41 - with exclamation mark and double equals
08:44 - and to show that in if-else statements
08:47 - let's say if user membership is not
08:50 - premium show user non-premium
08:54 - contents or maybe even recommend a
08:57 - premium upgrade as a marketing measure
09:00 - and else show premium contents and
09:05 - finally you can combine all these
09:08 - conditions so for example if today is
09:11 - your birthday and you have displayed
09:13 - that on your profile only then the
09:16 - program will show the notification so
09:18 - both conditions must be true so if today
09:22 - state is the same as your birth date and
09:25 - birthday displayed is true so here you
09:29 - can use a comparison with boolean true
09:31 - or false so both these conditions must
09:34 - be true for notification to be sent and
09:38 - in JavaScript the syntax for end is this
09:41 - so this basically is also a valid
09:45 - condition that you can also put inside
09:47 - of the if condition so if this whole
09:50 - thing is true then show notification
09:53 - else do not or another example back to
09:57 - the shipment cost let's say you don't
09:59 - pay for the shipment if the total price
10:02 - is over 20 euros or you have Amazon
10:05 - Prime account so the way to express that
10:08 - would be total price over 20 euros or
10:12 - amazon prime equals so here only one of
10:18 - them has to be true for you to get free
10:21 - shipment or in JavaScript is expressed
10:24 - with double pipes and again you can put
10:27 - that in if statement and say if either
10:32 - this or this is true then give a free
10:37 - shipment otherwise don't and you can
10:40 - also use negation in conditions for
10:44 - example you want to check whether this
10:46 - whole thing is false and the way to do
10:50 - that is using the exclamation mark and
10:54 - the brackets so basically this will
10:57 - check whether this whole condition is
11:00 - false now even if you understood all
11:04 - this concept it's always a good idea to
11:05 - practice them yourself
11:08 - so that you get it better so because of
11:10 - that I'm gonna put a link to practical
11:12 - exercises for conditionals and
11:14 - competitors in the video description
11:17 - below so make sure to check that out and
11:19 - practice yourself with a couple of
11:21 - examples and once you do that you can
11:24 - come back for another JavaScript video
11:26 - and if you don't want to miss that you
11:28 - can subscribe to my channel and click
