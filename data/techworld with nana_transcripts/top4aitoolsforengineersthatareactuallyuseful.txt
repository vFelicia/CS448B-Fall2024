00:00 - AI is the hottest topic right now and AI
00:03 - tools are being developed for all areas
00:05 - including different it Fields And since
00:08 - you are on the tech world with Nana
00:10 - Channel we will be talking about the AI
00:12 - tools specifically for devops and Cloud
00:15 - use cases to make it more interesting
00:17 - and valuable for you I decided to focus
00:20 - on categories of AI tools like
00:23 - monitoring security Improvement and so
00:26 - on instead of just comparing random or
00:30 - most popular AI Tools Plus I'm going to
00:32 - give you my honest experience of using
00:35 - these tools in my actual devops projects
00:37 - and explain why I'm not the biggest fan
00:39 - of AI tools right now and just a heads
00:42 - up none of the tools I cover in these
00:45 - categories are sponsored plus you know
00:47 - my motto which is Concepts before tools
00:51 - so all examples are from my practical
00:53 - experience in my engineering projects
00:55 - and my additional extensive research
00:58 - that I do for each video and if there is
01:01 - a sponsored mention of a tool I will
01:05 - explicitly highlight that in the video
01:08 - for example later in this video I'm
01:09 - going to announce a sponsor because I'm
01:12 - very proud of few awesome tech companies
01:15 - that we work with and by the way
01:17 - recently we saw that 70% of you who
01:20 - watch our videos are still unsubscribed
01:22 - if you received value from any of our
01:25 - videos be sure to subscribe so you don't
01:27 - miss any new content we put out out here
01:30 - and by the way in the comments you can
01:32 - also make suggestions about which tools
01:35 - or which tutorials you want us to create
01:39 - and post here with that out of the way
01:41 - let's get to it devops is all about
01:43 - Automation and efficiency right whether
01:46 - we want to release a new feature fast or
01:49 - secure our infrastructure or monitor our
01:52 - platform and prevent any issues in time
01:55 - as part of devop principles all these
01:57 - should be and can be automated so
02:00 - imagine a scenario where AI is helping
02:03 - take over the tedious repetitive tasks
02:06 - help automate things and help engineers
02:08 - make databased decisions this means
02:12 - super fast code validations proactive
02:15 - support in case some issues happen on
02:17 - your Cloud infrastructure or commence
02:19 - cluster automatically detecting security
02:21 - threats and super quick response to
02:24 - incidents all driven by the power of AI
02:28 - now if this sounds too good to be true
02:30 - well because it is most AI tools right
02:33 - now aren't mature enough to use them on
02:37 - autopilot right now you need to use them
02:39 - like any other tool they can't do
02:42 - everything automatically for you in fact
02:44 - many of them still need a lot of human
02:47 - review and validation but that doesn't
02:50 - mean that they are useless there are
02:52 - still some really good use cases for AI
02:55 - tools right now now the obvious one we
02:58 - all know is cat gbt which I'm not going
03:00 - to talk about here because it's much
03:02 - more general purpose it's not specific
03:05 - for devops plus I actually have two
03:07 - videos on chbt with extensive use cases
03:11 - so you can check them out here but even
03:14 - though you may be getting by with C GPT
03:16 - for now these kind of tools have many
03:19 - limitations when it comes to devops and
03:21 - Cloud specifically when we think about
03:24 - devops and all these automations and
03:25 - Cloud platforms with so many services
03:27 - it's always about integrating various
03:30 - tools together to build these automated
03:33 - processes right like you need to
03:35 - automate monitoring in your cluster and
03:37 - automatically notify teams of any
03:39 - abnormal behavior you want to automate
03:41 - detecting security issues or you want to
03:43 - help automate the provisioning of
03:45 - infrastructure and generally the
03:47 - integration of various tools together
03:49 - and by the way if you haven't already
03:51 - you can download our complete devops
03:53 - road map which I created to give a good
03:56 - structured overview of all the elements
03:59 - of devil in exactly the right sequence
04:01 - to understand the complete flow you can
04:04 - grab the tech Devils road map directly
04:06 - on our website for completely free
04:09 - because I believe everybody should have
04:11 - access to this important knowledge I
04:14 - will leave the link to it in the video
04:16 - description so go grab it from there so
04:19 - what are the use cases of AI in devops
04:22 - and Cloud the first category we have is
04:25 - the AI code assistants and the main use
04:28 - case for such tools is in writing
04:30 - infrastructure as code or configuration
04:32 - as code and so on a popular example here
04:35 - is GitHub co-pilot and there are lots of
04:39 - very similar tools that basically do the
04:41 - same they are your code assistant within
04:44 - the code editor or IDE so they help you
04:47 - with code suggestions code completions
04:50 - basically they predict what you want to
04:52 - code based on the current context and
04:55 - suggest that code for you or you can ask
04:59 - specifically to give you code piece or
05:01 - entire code block by simply typing the
05:04 - logic in English and it will give you a
05:06 - respective code for that functionality
05:09 - you can even ask it to refactor a code
05:11 - block or clean up the code find any code
05:14 - duplications any dirty code so to say
05:17 - and also interesting use case is you can
05:19 - ask it any explanation on the
05:21 - application code or Improvement
05:23 - suggestions so for example if you're a
05:25 - junior engineer trying to figure out
05:27 - what the terraform code in your new
05:30 - project does you can use an AI assistant
05:33 - to understand the code so you can use it
05:36 - to actually learn and become better at
05:38 - the infrastructure as code tool that
05:41 - your new team is working with now the
05:43 - limitation of such tools based on my
05:46 - experience of using various such AI code
05:49 - assistants for my devop projects is that
05:51 - the code they generate is usually not
05:53 - entirely usable so you still need to
05:56 - validate the output before you can use
05:59 - it or in most cases you have to fix the
06:02 - output because output of the tool simply
06:05 - doesn't work so sometimes you have to
06:07 - double check with the official
06:08 - documentation and so on I actually did a
06:11 - separate video on GitHub copilot and the
06:13 - entire overview here and as I said there
06:16 - are many other AI code assistants out
06:18 - there like Amazon Q which I also covered
06:21 - so you can learn more on those tools and
06:24 - some interesting use cases about them of
06:26 - how to use them as a devops engineer in
06:28 - those videos
06:30 - now code assistants are useful when you
06:32 - can use it directly in your code editor
06:35 - while actually writing the code so you
06:37 - don't have to switch between your code
06:39 - editor and internet browser to use those
06:42 - tools so all these tools have this
06:44 - feature to be integrated in any popular
06:47 - editor or IDE like Visual Studio code or
06:50 - intellig Etc and interesting to point
06:53 - out that there is even an AI powered
06:56 - code editor like cursor where the editor
06:59 - itself has the AI integration so it
07:02 - gives you a lot of the additional
07:04 - features to AI code assistance as part
07:07 - of the editor itself now most of the
07:08 - functionality is very comparable to the
07:10 - AI code assistants but the main
07:12 - advantage here is that the editor the
07:14 - cursor editor is actually able to
07:16 - understand the project context better to
07:20 - give you more precise code suggestions
07:22 - or answers to your code related
07:25 - questions the next one is actually a use
07:27 - case which I think is much more useful
07:30 - than AI code assistance for devops and
07:33 - cloudspace which is AI powered
07:35 - monitoring tools monitoring in devops
07:38 - and cloud is a really complex thing that
07:41 - absolutely needs to be automated when
07:43 - you have very complex systems with
07:46 - thousands of servers and tens of
07:47 - thousands of components on those servers
07:50 - you can't do observability manually you
07:53 - have to automated and alert proactively
07:56 - when the services and applications in
07:59 - your system system behave abnormally
08:01 - because you can be sitting in front of
08:03 - the dashboard or manually checking that
08:06 - all your services are running properly
08:08 - but configuring automated monitoring and
08:10 - alerting is actually a pretty
08:12 - challenging task so this is where
08:14 - monitoring AI tools may be useful one
08:18 - popular such tool is data Do's Watchdog
08:21 - so Watchdog is part of the data dog
08:24 - platform so it's basically like a
08:27 - builtin intelligence layer that
08:30 - continuously analyzes billions of data
08:32 - points from your infrastructure to
08:36 - applications to the underlying platform
08:39 - to find the issues proactively and help
08:42 - you resolve them quickly and the good
08:44 - thing is that data doc also has a
08:46 - feature that basically kind of digs into
08:49 - the issue to identify what actually
08:52 - caused that issue because once the issue
08:55 - is identified the troubleshooting part
08:57 - alone can take a lot of time to exactly
09:01 - pinpoint which one of your thousands of
09:04 - components in your systems actually
09:06 - caused that abnormal behavior or that
09:08 - error so again by analyzing the data
09:11 - about how the services are connected to
09:14 - each other how they correlate how they
09:17 - behave it can pinpoint exactly where the
09:19 - issue is coming from so again you can
09:21 - save yourself manual effort on
09:23 - troubleshooting and fighting root cause
09:25 - of the issue and one more thing which is
09:28 - also very important is is what's called
09:30 - Predictive Analytics it basically means
09:32 - that by analyzing previous data on all
09:36 - the abnormal behavior that has happened
09:38 - and identifying any Trends it can
09:41 - actually tell you if there are any
09:43 - potential issues that may happen in the
09:46 - future and as I said this is much more
09:49 - interesting use case because this is
09:51 - exactly the strength of an AI that it
09:54 - can analyze large sets of historical
09:57 - data as well as analyze the data for
09:59 - correlations between the systems between
10:01 - the services and applications and find
10:04 - the exact issues as well as predict any
10:06 - potential issues before they happen now
10:09 - at the heart of devops are cic City
10:12 - pipelines right that's where a lot of
10:14 - devops Automation and optimization work
10:17 - is done and one of the cicd tools that
10:20 - really focuses on saving time of the
10:23 - developers and optimizing the release
10:26 - workflow is team City pipelines from jet
10:29 - brains who is a sponsor of this entire
10:32 - video so big shout out to Jet brains for
10:36 - supporting our channel so we can create
10:38 - valuable devops tutorials like this one
10:41 - I've used the team City pipelines
10:43 - already and what stood out for me is the
10:46 - main focus on developer productivity by
10:49 - providing self-tuning pipelines which
10:52 - have basically builtin pipeline
10:55 - optimization options so while you're
10:57 - building and configuring the PIP line in
11:00 - the team City pipelines tool the
11:02 - platform itself guides you with buil-in
11:05 - intelligent suggestions of how to
11:08 - optimize your pipeline and because of
11:10 - that the biggest convenience for me was
11:12 - that I don't have to switch back and
11:13 - forth to some documentation and back to
11:16 - the tool to configure various details of
11:20 - the pipeline like adding caching or
11:22 - running jobs in parallel to speed up
11:25 - pipeline execution and so on now if you
11:28 - know me you know I I don't like
11:29 - configuring things in UI everything
11:32 - needs to be scripted as per devops best
11:34 - practices everything is code right so
11:37 - the way I used team City pipelines
11:39 - myself is I configure the pipeline via
11:41 - the tool in the UI using its self-tuning
11:44 - features and once I'm done I can save
11:47 - the pipeline configuration and it will
11:50 - automatically save the yl configuration
11:53 - of my pipeline in my git repository
11:56 - simple as that as always I will leave
11:58 - all the relevant links in the video
11:59 - description and you can actually try out
12:02 - team City pipelines for free now on to
12:04 - the next AI tool for devops another
12:07 - interesting use case is security Centric
12:11 - tools specifically tools that can
12:13 - prevent any security issues before they
12:16 - happen by doing Security checks and
12:19 - discovering any security vulnerabilities
12:21 - based on statistical data or abnormal
12:24 - behavior detected in the systems there
12:26 - are some security AI tools that even
12:29 - allow operations team to configure autof
12:32 - fixes when security issues or
12:34 - misconfigurations are detected so the
12:36 - tool itself will find and fix the
12:39 - security issue before it can get
12:41 - exploited one popular tool in this
12:43 - category is Cystic which similar to data
12:47 - dog uses machine learning and advanced
12:49 - analytics to give you proactive
12:52 - monitoring of large complex systems
12:55 - especially in containerized environments
12:58 - and we know in today's devops world
13:00 - containers are a standard you may have
13:03 - thousands of containers running
13:05 - different services and your applications
13:07 - on multiple environments and imagine if
13:09 - you have thousands of containers on
13:11 - different systems how hard it is to make
13:14 - sure that each container and each
13:16 - service within that container is
13:18 - actually running with security best
13:20 - practices is not misconfigured does not
13:23 - have any security vulnerabilities that
13:25 - can be exploited and so on so because of
13:27 - the sheer number of of containers and
13:29 - applications it's just hard to keep
13:31 - track and have an overview of security
13:35 - status in all of them and again that's
13:37 - where AI tools that have the capability
13:40 - of analyzing large sets of data really
13:43 - fast can be useful and that's what CTIC
13:46 - does basically it will automatically go
13:48 - through the entire environment it will
13:50 - detect analyze and it will highlight any
13:53 - potential security threats that it
13:55 - detected in your systems and cytic
13:58 - actually has this visualization tool
14:01 - that will show you a path and a tech
14:04 - would take from its entry point all the
14:07 - way to the sensitive data and again we
14:09 - have the same issue here because once an
14:11 - issue is detected now the engineers will
14:14 - have to identify the root cause of that
14:16 - issue so that they can fix it so
14:19 - troubleshooting and digging through tons
14:20 - of data or logs is definitely going to
14:23 - be challenging so tools like cytic do
14:26 - this kind of troubleshooting and
14:28 - Analysis in addition to identifying
14:30 - issues and it tells you exactly where
14:32 - the issue originates from and how it can
14:35 - be fixed and again this can be super
14:37 - helpful and save Engineers a ton of time
14:40 - in troubleshooting the issues and one
14:43 - last interesting thing about cytic is
14:45 - that they actually introduced an AI
14:48 - workload security feature which
14:50 - basically means that the AI workload
14:53 - itself that is deployed in kubernetes
14:56 - cluster for example can have lots of
14:58 - security vulnerabil ilities in fact they
15:00 - detected that over 30% of deployed
15:04 - generative AI workloads that were
15:06 - running in comm's cluster were publicly
15:09 - exposed which means people could
15:11 - actually interact with that AI tool from
15:14 - outside and get a lot of sensitive data
15:16 - in the output so they designed this
15:18 - feature specifically to monitor security
15:22 - for AI workloads running in
15:24 - containerized environments another
15:27 - category of AI tools that are also an
15:29 - interesting use case especially in the
15:32 - cloud space are tools that help you
15:35 - manage your resources on cloud
15:38 - efficiently and save Cloud costs and
15:41 - again this could be a really challenging
15:43 - thing to do when you're applications and
15:46 - your deployment environment scale when
15:48 - you have lots of services running in
15:50 - your environment when you're using a lot
15:51 - of Services of the cloud provider in
15:54 - your applications for convenience or
15:57 - when you're using multicloud and so on
15:59 - and there are AI tools like Cloud health
16:03 - or usage AI or cast Ai and they give you
16:06 - an overview of how efficiently you are
16:09 - using the infrastructure resources as
16:11 - well as recommendations of how you can
16:14 - optimize the usage and save cost for
16:17 - example what type or size of instances
16:19 - you can be running which instances that
16:22 - you running are underutilized or not
16:25 - used at all plus they use the predictive
16:28 - analysis to provide you with information
16:31 - about how much infrastructure or how
16:33 - many instances for example you would
16:34 - need but this of course Works only for
16:36 - workloads that are more predictable
16:38 - based on that it can also give you
16:40 - recommendations on scaling your
16:42 - environment based on usage patterns and
16:46 - to basically help you avoid unnecessary
16:48 - costs of using resources that you don't
16:51 - actually need or you won't need as much
16:53 - in the future and again it's really
16:55 - important for these tools to actually
16:56 - support multicloud because lot of
16:59 - applications a lot of complex
17:00 - applications today are running on
17:02 - multicloud environments so having an
17:04 - overview of your workloads across the
17:07 - cloud platforms is also an important use
17:10 - case so I believe currently these are
17:12 - some of the most important use cases of
17:15 - AI Tools in devops and Cloud
17:17 - specifically and as I mentioned at the
17:19 - beginning I generally think that AI
17:21 - tools right now are not mature enough to
17:26 - really fulfill these ambitious prom of
17:29 - us Engineers just focusing on this big
17:32 - picture and high level logic and the AI
17:34 - tool just does all the technical heavy
17:36 - lifting in the background for us because
17:39 - that's actually not the case yet even
17:42 - though they have tremendous capabilities
17:44 - and they are able to process and analyze
17:47 - massive sets of data and do Predictive
17:50 - Analytics and so on right now there are
17:53 - still just another set of tools that you
17:57 - as an engineer need to have under your
17:59 - tool belt that means the technical
18:02 - expertise and the technical knowhow
18:05 - behind devops and Cloud all the concepts
18:07 - and Technologies is still very much
18:10 - needed because AI tools cannot replace
18:13 - them yet however as I mentioned in use
18:16 - cases such as automated monitoring or
18:18 - security enhancement because of just the
18:21 - sheer volume of components and workloads
18:25 - that we are running in modern systems
18:28 - these kind of AI tools can massively
18:30 - increase our productivity and save us a
18:33 - lot of time so we can actually focus on
18:36 - more exciting engineering but still
18:39 - technical tasks I hope I was able to
18:41 - give you a valuable overview of AI tools
18:45 - for devops and Cloud use cases I would
18:47 - really love to hear from you what other
18:49 - AI tools are using in your devops or
18:52 - Cloud projects and what are your
18:53 - experiences with them and I'm sure it's
18:55 - going to be really interesting for all
18:57 - the other viewers so please share them
18:59 - Below in the comments and with that
19:01 - thank you for watching and see you in
19:03 - the next video
