fine uh click great okay so we are live on youtube thank you everybody for stopping by in our episode number three of interview tips live streams that we're doing at code academy community trying to bring you the best tips and advice from recruiters about getting jobs in tech your first job and all kinds of help that you might need when you're working on your resume on your cover letter things to know about the phone interviews the technical interviews and any other questions that you might have today our guest is madison madison you want to introduce yourself yeah of course hey everybody um i am madison i'm a manager of technical recruiting here at codecademy so what that means is i lead a team of folks a few that have been on previous live streams included uh responsible for hiring all of codecademy's technical roles uh prior to codecademy um i worked in both recruiting and people ops positions across companies in tech media and advertising spaces so breadth of experience across different industries hiring for various roles yeah seems like you've definitely been around quite a bit um you you um how how does recruiting compared to uh like all the places that you've been like all the roles you've done you like it yeah recruiting um in general yeah no i i enjoy it it's a lot of fun um very i think uh our vp of people calls it like very much like a roller coaster you know because it kind of is like oh are we gonna we're gonna hire these candidates today et cetera et cetera just put it very lightly um so it can be a lot of fun and i really enjoy building relationships with people too so like getting people really excited about where they're going to work i just think it's super fun and um you know that's why i've always been you know internal at a company so like being able to you know help build teams uh at codecademy that build things that like not only they care about but i care about too it's just it's a lot of fun you know it's one of those things uh we keep repeating to our learners is that recruiters are also people like sometimes you're so stressed out you're so you know that you're so caught up in the moment like i'm applying for this job are they gonna ask of me technical questions soft skill questions you know the typical like tell me one time where you had a problem how you fix this sort of thing uh yeah so we always try to remind our learners that when you're applying for a job there's somebody on the other side yeah they you know they want you to succeed too like the fact that they have an open role means that they want somebody to join the team so just keep that in mind that you know it doesn't have to be an antagonistic serious um sort of situation where you against them that's always a thing so i'm glad that you said that you know you really enjoy it and it's like very exciting because it is um it can be very exciting so let's just jump into uh what everybody is here for which is like some advice on applying for jobs and you know getting into tech uh do you have any just to get you started uh any sort of general guidance on let's say you are a developer selftaught and you are applying for your first role what are some of the things that people should be considering when they are applying for these jobs yeah yeah i think you know you could take that in a whole bunch of different directions as far as you know some basic you know do's and don'ts or just key things to consider i think when you're applying for roles is you know definitely research the companies that you're applying for at least a little bit i think especially when you're earlier on in your career right super helpful i think to try to get as deep of an understanding of a company and what they do as you can based on the information that's out there um there are a lot of different places you can go to try to look for you know more information on the company whether that's on glassdoor or just simple google searches right another tool that we use is builtin nyc um builtin i believe also just went national so um they you know have information about companies and content around companies all over the place as well so there's a lot of different you know different tools you can use to try to find more information about a company and then also i think also try to find the company values and and think about that and see how that aligns maybe with your own values as well um codecademy for instance we have our company values on our careers page and so i always you know get really excited when a candidate talks to me about you know the values on the careers page that they came across and how that relates to you know what they're trying to do and where they want to go next with their careers and everything like that so definitely recommend you know trying to dig a bit deeper there um and then you know i think of course you know continue to dig into the job descriptions um you know continue to dig into your own resume as well um you know i think you should be able to use a fairly consistent resume across the board but you know if you notice within a job description or within something a company is doing um you know and they might be looking for some experience that you could maybe highlight a little bit more on your resume um that's not a bad idea as well to maybe like amp that up a little bit too trying to imagine myself in the position of um uh first time applicant especially if they don't have uh any you know any tech experience where maybe there are career switchers or the first time you do tech when you talk about researching companies and they and the values um i know there's like a hard balance between finding a good place and just finding a place that will give you a shot um how do you see do you see like that tension happen a lot like do you have any any thoughts on like well you you want to be somewhat picky in where you wanna you wanna make sure that you're gonna have the right mentors you're gonna have the right place to grow as a person but at the same time a lot of people are saying look i'm applying for 100 different places yeah i just need i just need someone to give me a shot so is it like like a balance is this something that people can be thinking about or like any way approaching this problem it doesn't seem to have a solution yeah yeah i don't i don't think there's an easy solution to that one right because of course of course you want to find the place not just a place um and i think that's a great mindset to have in that sense you should definitely be picky but also you know a place you know a company that you might not think initially would be the place uh you know it might just be a place could potentially be the place you know if you're asking the right questions i can find out more information about how you might be able to grow there or you know how the teams work well together or what the mission you know two years down the line at a company might be and that might get you more excited about that too i think you know i think it's it's it's yeah it's a bit hard i think especially earlier on it's good to maybe cast a little bit of a wider net because it's also a lot of like you don't know don't know sometimes too right and so you might uh before like come across something that you didn't realize you would actually be kind of more excited about and it's also okay to recognize that even if you might not do something you are the most excited about initially you can definitely find a way to you know learn things that will be valuable to you in your next role um you know and that maybe end up at the place the next time as well so i think as long as you're thinking about what you're going to be able to learn from that job and how you're going to be able to grow uh even if it's not like the premier company you want to work for still a super valuable experience so i think you can you can continue to guide your career in the ways that you want to that way awesome so what i'm hearing is that sometimes having a bit more of a medium term or longterm approach to your career it helps basically saying maybe shortterm you think this is not the place that you thought you would be but if you think about longlonger term like you know accumulate experience add that to your resume you know you will always have like i guess kind of like put things in perspective a bit uh you also touched on researching the company before you apply for has a good point to do when you're applying for jobs how much weight should a candidate put into places like glassdoor like you know you look at the reviews and people are saying like i was here it was a bad experience or like i did this interview or they asked me these questions totally out of place is there is that something to be aware of like beware like okay yeah they're valuable but put it in context yeah yeah no i think uh they are definitely valuable resources but i think you have to be a little cautious as well i think i don't think you can take everything at face value glassdoor you know is essentially right like the yelp of of reviewing companies um and so you know you're going to get better or worse reviews whether they're accurate and accurate um obviously not everything is going to be inaccurate so i'm not trying to say that but um you know definitely be cautious and it and you know feel confident and the fact that you should be able to ask questions throughout your interview process too so even if you're still wanting to move forward with the company even after maybe you've heard things that you don't necessarily love or a little you know you know i think maybe might be a little discouraging um at least initially i think you know just make sure you're asking those questions to address those concerns because you know potentially a review from even just a few months ago uh you know it could could have already been addressed internally and adjustments might have been made and you know they can address how they're working to adjust those types of concerns or improve processes or whatever the case might be um you know wherever your concerns might be with those reviews so i think um definitely encourage candidates to not get totally turned off by things like glassdoor necessarily but you know use that as a part of their process when they're trying to figure out if this is really the best place for them so definitely don't hesitate to ask those questions that sounds like a really good idea it's not don't don't use that as a reason not to apply but do keep it in mind maybe during the the application process where the recruiter says do you have any questions for me maybe that's the moment to say well you know i wanted to address this concern or i wanted to learn more about this particular that's that's a really good point um is there like um like an etiquette when it comes to uh we're talking about researching companies if you find if you go to linkedin or twitter like maybe you find some of the recruiters or some of the people of the company like is there an educator like how far can you connect with these people before it sort of becomes maybe crossing the line or becoming inappropriate like how much research can you do or how much connection can you do with a company before you should worry about it like before it becomes a red flag yeah right right right um no because there's there's definitely a bit of a line right and i you know encourage folks who have mutual connections especially like if you didn't realize someone you went to uh high school with or whatever the case might be or you know just someone that might be in your network um works at the company definitely encourage you to reach out to them via linkedin or you know if you're if you're that close to them shoot them an email or whatever the case might be um and see if they have time to connect or you know refer you to the right person um you know we see candidates who will reach out to folks within the department you know that they're interested in applying for um and so on which is okay but i think um you know the biggest thing to keep in mind is that you know folks of course you know have a lot going on at any point in time whether that's work personal etc so it might be professional or personal reasons that they might not be able to get back to you so i think as long as you're understanding of folks who might not be able to you know either follow up as immediately as you might hope for or you know take the time to connect on the phone um you know i think then you're then you're okay um because we've seen some candidates who you know have kind of crossed the line and become a little more you know don't understand you know why you won't get on the phone with me etc um when they're interested in learning about opportunities and while we absolutely love you know the engagement and you know someone being so excited about an opportunity you know it's just not possible all the time unfortunately and again that could be due to personal reasons as well you know maybe they're just not available um for a reason so i think just keeping that in mind um you know the same way we don't want to waste a candidate's time ever um you know we want to make sure we're staying up to date with candidates as much as we can and getting them feedback as well um you know we have to be respectful of time both ways so i think you know gentle reach outs to folks that work at the company in the department that you work with or other mutual connections if you see someone is connected with someone you know um you know trying to see if you can get an introduction i think those are all great ways to go hmm yeah i i know that uh sometimes that eagerness can translate into annoyance or uh this it's a fine line between trying to just show that you are interested in the role and saying you know i really uh i'm motivated for this or like i really want this uh there's a fine line between that and just just getting in people's nerves basically you're like becoming more of a nuisance i guess a little bit so um everybody wants to get back to everybody all the time you know and you know i think it's just again just you know thinking about it both ways and just trying to you know be respectful and then that's all you can do but you know i think a candidate who is super engaged and you know very excited about an opportunity is great and as long as we're communicating well in that way then you know there's no harm no foul okay and uh thinking about uh newer newcomers applying for jobs is just in general um is there like is there a rule i know that i've heard different versions of this but uh when you're applying for jobs sometimes especially if you don't have any prior experience you might find yourself not checking all the boxes in a job description um what do you think that is like an appropriate ratio of like let's say okay they asked for eight things i know five five out of eight seems like a first shot is there like a like a typical number where recruiters might look at an applicant and say like from the recruiter's perspective you you get i know i talked to harlan i talked to other teammates at her meet uh and they said they said you know we only have so much time to look at resume so we get so many and there's a big volume so what do you think that there's like a fair line between applying for something and definitely not being qualified for it or saying this could be enough that a recruiter on the other side is going to look at and say okay yeah yeah and it can go up and down right you know it sounds like as harlan you might have said uh you know sometimes you're you know you have more or less time or sometimes positions are getting more applications versus not you know and so then you know you might be able to take a little bit more time um to review you know more and more applications or you know dive a little bit deeper um so there's no perfect answer or perfect guess of whether or not i think you know if someone is actually going to be able to reach out and connect with you on the phone um but i think you know give yourself you know some room right you know i think as you were saying right there's not necessarily a perfect number but i think one way to go right is um when you a lot of job descriptions are separated into like musthaves and then nice to haves and so if you look at you know some of the key things in those musthaves like maybe the top few bullet points that are in those musthaves of like musthave x type of experience um if you meet some of those and then especially if you meet some of those nice to haves but maybe not all of the musthaves as well that can you can kind of think of that as maybe supplementing a little bit where a recruiter maybe would be more inclined to say like oh you know they're missing on one or two of these things but then they have these other things that make them really applicable for this job as well so like let's connect and you know try to dive a bit deeper into the experience so i think you know it yeah i think you know it definitely it doesn't hurt to to apply right i think uh you know what i hate seeing candidates get tripped up on and um something that is super prevalent you know throughout you know i think the tech industry and beyond is you know when you see a position that has like we're looking for four or five plus years of experience or something say for like a more senior level role and someone only has three and then they still don't apply you know i think if you're missing on one to two years unless it's you know a senior role and you're just in you're just starting out you know so if you are trying to look for your first engineering role for example if it's a senior engineering role that's looking for four or five plus years of experience then maybe that's not going to be a fit since it's your first role that you're looking for as an engineer but once you're more at a senior level you know if don't take like the just hard line years of experience so to heart that it you know prevents you from applying um because you see that with different types of candidates all the time so i would say that's one where you can you know i think feel a little bit more comfortable at least you know shooting somebody in that respect i think what somebody told me once a few months ago i was talking about this somebody else and they said let them be the ones that say no don't self uh select yourself out and it was sort of like if there is a gray area where you're not sure like you were saying like if you have three years of experience and then looking for somebody with four or five if you are sort of like not sure it's better that they are the ones saying no then you say no to yourself yeah is that fair yeah i think that's a great way to think about it as long as you know yeah let them say no and even if they say no right now in six more months another year you know it could be an absolute yes right so um definitely encourage i love seeing folks who reapply you know after a certain amount of time as well and it's just very exciting to see that you know kind of come through and i'm like oh they've applied to us last year and like oh that's great they've grown in their experience let's talk to them and get them on the phone um so i definitely agree definitely don't select yourself out of the process you know give yourself that opportunity because otherwise you're not going to know either way so might as well try to and i think this uh this is a great point to switch gears into the don dues and the first one that comes to mind is how often can you apply for a role before it becomes sort of like bad like let's say for example that code academy is hiring five different senior engineers should you apply for all five roles or are you or should candidates understand that companies the recruiters own companies like if they think that you're a better fit for a different role like you just apply for one and they will direct you to the right one like how does that work yeah no that's a good question um and a lot of companies think about this differently and i've experienced that throughout my career as well um how folks think about this when folks apply to different roles i think one of the biggest things is not applying to roles that are completely different you know so we've had people apply for just like a role in our marketing team and then a role on the data team and then you know a role in engineering and it just it none of it kind of fits well together you know i think um the example you pointed to is an interesting one in terms of like if we have five senior backend engineer roles open which i think we have a close close to that number right now um for example and you know they're on just different teams i think in that respect you know if the requirements are pretty similar in that respect i do think it's okay um you know to apply to to multiple roles in that respect because you're essentially applying for you know a senior backend engineer role and it can be helpful to potentially get your resume seen a bit more because you might have different recruiters working on different roles and so that way you know you might have more of a likelihood of being seen that way um but otherwise i would say usually try to stick to one but i think if it's similar types of roles that way it is okay to apply to both but again it's tough to say um because companies do think about it differently i've worked at a company before over there like if they apply for more than one role we don't even want to talk to them because then they don't they do and i was like okay that seems a bit harsh um but you know that was that was the way they were operating um at that point in time so um you know we handled things a little differently on iron but you know i think there's no perfect answer so again i think if you're applying to a similar type of role um like back end engineer for instance then i think it you shouldn't necessarily be putting yourself in danger if you apply for multiple teams yeah because i imagine that uh when you are applying for jobs you might become you might be concerned that um they're gonna think of you like hey this person is applying for so many roles at once uh and usually when you you want candidates that are strong at the role that they're applying for so if you apply like you said for multiple roles you might come across as you are not good at any of them right right like a little maybe that you it just comes a little like dissolved i guess or like diluted it's just like you value dilutes a little bit when you apply for multiple roles and i know that uh so i mean some especially for junior roles sometimes people are concerned that if they apply even when their roles are similar it's one like you said if you apply for more than one maybe they will disqualify you right right off the bat and number two they're concerned that they built some sort of rapport with the uh with the company where they're like well this person just applied for anything so you know like they just dropped five five copies of the resume here whatever so i know that's a valid concern for some people that just feel like yeah all right they don't want to seem too desperate but they do want to increase their chances of getting higher yeah yeah that's why i think if you're applying for you know a similar backend engineer role right it can make sense to kind of you know socialize your resume a little bit more in that way but um when they are quite different types of roles or with roles with very different focuses um i think that's when folks might start to question too like do you have an understanding of what you're looking for out of your next role um and then that and that can be a little bit that can raise some flags for folks sometimes um because i think you don't have to know exactly where you want to end up in five ten et cetera years right um and also you can say what you want now and that can always change too um but i think you know when you're applying for such different roles it makes people question again like is are they going to be happy in this role you know and what they're looking for a question um you know i always ask and most recruiters will ask on their initial phone calls with you is you know what are you looking for out of your next role what is most important for you in regards to where you're going next like whether that is compensation whether that's you know a missiondriven organization a team you know that works super crossfunctionally you want a role that has a lot of autonomy or whatever the case might be you know having just that sort of understanding so if you are applying for two just very different roles you know then it might you know it might those types of things might not align um for folks that you're speaking to in your process definitely valid um do you have any other like big domes like general like just just in general like if you're applying for a role it might be a junior role might be a more serial is it any sort of like very i would say not obvious but it's things that are just like across the board avoidable that will diminish your chances of getting a job yeah yeah i think something that is coming to mind a lot is uh you know especially once you're speaking with with a company um not you know completely disparaging your current or previous company um especially as you're speaking to past experiences um you know if someone is like why are you looking to leave your current role and you're like i hate my manager you know the company is just a nightmare it's a mess you know you definitely want to avoid things like that you know talk that really even if you your com your company is terrible or something like that whatever that might mean you know you just want to avoid phrasing it that way and talk about how like maybe you know right now you know you're experiencing you know being a little bit micromanaged and you prefer to have a lot more autonomy in a role you know talking to like how you know you want to continue growing in a next role versus kind of hating on um or throwing too much shade at your current or former employer yeah definitely that's something to avoid for sure because the big the big the big thing to do right is to talk about your experience what you've learned you know how you've you know adjusted or made improvements moving forward and like how you'll apply that as you continue to grow within your career as well rather than just kind of focusing on the very direct things that you haven't liked about something um so that's definitely one big thing uh that i think is just a nono across the board regardless of how junior senior you might be it really sounds to me like um basically the rule of thumb is you should be focusing on yourself so when somebody asks why are you leaving your old role like why are you changing companies instead of disparaging your own company and talking about them you should be talking about you like well i try to achieve this i'm trying to change this i try to tackle new problems i'm trying to find new mentors or new right like it's sort of like you you want to always phrase it in the context of you the candidate and not so much in everybody else right right right yeah i think you know focusing exactly as you said you know on yourself um and your continued growth i think is where you want to be of course it's good to acknowledge you know the team etc in terms of like being you know at codecademy one of our values is we win as a team right so of course you want to think about things that way as you continue to grow but it is in regards to what you are looking for right so people will usually say like yes i'm looking for a missiondriven organization i'm looking to work with new technologies to work on new problems and i'm really just looking for a team that i get along with and you know like want to collaborate with and a team that really you know you know has this type of environment etc um you know i think again even though you know you can still hint at things that are team related it is still focused on what you as a candidate are looking for versus like saying why something else is bad that's nice um it's coming to mind because i think that they don't so don't do this or don't do that in the com when you're applying for jobs it seems that a lot of people uh when they're applying for for roles they they will try to how to put it they i'm not like not embellishing but sometimes you know you're trying to sell yourself and it seems like there's a bit of a give like a wiggle room and how you you can showcase your strengths while minimizing your your weaknesses i guess so um have you had in the past in your experience um anyone that maybe has taken it too far like is there is there a point where you're saying like this is not even going to help you anymore like you don't need to do this um is it is it like is there any sort of like don't do this uh for example you rush me like should you you know i'm just trying to think like journals don't forget yeah general in terms of you know over embellishing or you know yeah you know hiding your experience a bit too much um i think that and let me know if this isn't getting at the heart of the question but i think in terms of your resume and you know how you speak to your experience folks will interviewers are usually able to tell you know when something is kind of like you know where they're getting question marks about you know did you do did you do this or did your team do this or what you know you need to very much be able to speak to the part that you played in that experience um you know where you know you can very clearly talk about you know what you accomplished in previous roles um you know discussing the projects specifically that you worked on and being able to deep dive into that quite a bit um obviously you know if you're a very senior engineer let's say you know talking about a project you worked on 10 years ago maybe you don't remember all of the key details but with an experience or two or in your current role you know being able to speak to what your role was you know within uh the work that you did or projects you worked on you know what resources you had um you know what kind of impact project had and who you worked with and talking about you know what that team structure looked like and you know being able to speak to you know your working style or how you iterated on a project et cetera et cetera really being able to like drill down into the details quite a bit um i think uh you know if you get to the place where you're not able to do that you're kind of like yeah i did this thing and someone asks you how you did the thing and you can't really talk you can't really speak to how you did the thing or how you you know iterated or you know improved on the thing or you know who you worked with as a part of doing that thing um then you're going to be i think talking about your experience a little bit too much yeah that's that's fair i think i mean people can tell i think especially recruiters i mean i think it's important for our learners watching this uh to remember that recruiters are professionals that are doing this for a living like you there is you're not the first can and they're they're going they know what they're doing so it's a lot better to be honest yeah and that's going to get you further that's going to get you far more than trying to right work right and i think the key thing to remember too is it is totally okay to admit what you don't know um you know in fact that's that's one of the biggest don'ts that i see sometimes too is folks you know kind of make something up or try to skirt around and answer um you know of course you don't want to just say i don't know and you know in that period yeah you don't want to say that um you could say you know i actually haven't had experience with this before um but you know in a situational sense here's what i think i might do but you know this is also i want to recognize that this is an area of growth for me um or you know this is what i've experienced second hand so far you know you can admit what you don't know um you know i think that's it that's a that's a big strength for someone if they you know admit what they don't know or it are able to like talk about a mistake that they've had it's all about where you go from there right um acknowledging any growth areas or ways you've improved in the past and things like that is like in my opinion and most of the folks i've worked with in interview processes a big thumbs up um you know from everyone yeah i think that people have to get a bit more confidence in their skills like i mean if you got to the phone interview like if you got to the first hurdle like if you submitted your resume and somebody said this is good enough that i want to talk to them like pat yourself in the back just be like okay there must be something there i'm i'm a strong like i have to be a strong enough candidate that they're willing to to talk to me so so you know like sometimes it's like there's no need to to like do anything strap again or to try to push it too far you already passed that sort of like check right like yeah you already showed that yeah so i think uh you know some people just just like yeah put it all in context um before we finish i wanted to also ask you we touched this in the beginning um some of the resources that our learners can use to prep for interviews or to prepare in general for interviewing i know that uh there's a lot that goes into this so this typically for a tech company there might be a phone interview there might be like a some sort of screen that might be technical interviews and behind it you might be talking to future peers or senior or managers that you might be you might have to have some takehome exams or whiteboarding interviews depending on interviews so so there's a lot of moving pieces and all throughout the process you're having to showcase your skills and you need to be able you need to like all these things so besides uh we already mentioned glassdoor do you have any other resources that people should be utilizing more that you see that you maybe feel that they are underutilized when candidates are applying for jobs like for example we talked about researching uh is is researching on twitter or linkedin like a strong thing to do yeah yeah no i i think yeah utilizing all of those different channels like twitter linkedin etc but again i would say you know especially if it's comments kind of like glassdoor right you know you can't rely on you know what everyone else might be saying so a lot of stuff on twitter right is a lot of opinion or you know various different types of content pieces so i think you know don't necessarily take it just at face value um i think you know other good things to keep in mind outside of just resources and researching the company is you know as you get through uh parts of the interview process not being able you know or excuse me not being afraid to make sure you understand who you're gonna be meeting with so if a recruiter like ever doesn't you know give you the schedule of folks that you're meeting with um they're just like hey we're you're meeting at this time for three hours like see you there you know definitely ask them who you're meeting with um you know if possible ideally they'll provide you with linkedin information so you can like research a little bit about who you're meeting with um obviously you don't need to go down a whole rabbit hole of finding out every piece of information about your interviewers um but it's just helpful i think it makes it humanizes the experience a little bit more of you know being able to understand a little bit more about uh your interviewer's journey and how they got there and things like to you know got to you know let's say codecademy for example um and and all of that good stuff and i think um thinking about that not being able you're excuse me not being afraid to you know ask your recruiters if they can like hop on a call before a final round interview to chat about what you can expect and answer any other questions you might have i think yeah not hesitating to ask questions to your recruiter or in your interviews especially as you go through the process definitely you know prepare questions that you might have or you know that you might have time to ask throughout your interview process i think that is also a really great way to learn about the company um i definitely enjoy when candidates even very early on in the process have you know a certain amount of questions um or you know can we can get through a certain amount of questions within a certain amount of time um you know as long as i have time i'm always happy to you know hot like stay on a phone call longer with the candidate to answer questions because it's really invigorating for me too personally i feel when a candidate is like tell me more about code county like why you really enjoy being there what brought you there or you know what's been one of the biggest struggles that you've had you know at co academy or elsewhere et cetera you know things like that i mean doing that in person sort of research is is definitely a great way uh great way to learn about the company um but also i think you know using you know searching for depending on what types of interviews you're doing too throughout the process i think um you know trying to find those resources as far as what you can ask like if someone's doing a behavioral interview um you know understanding i think how you know what types of questions might be asked and you know how to respond to those again i think taking the approach of you know being able to really deep dive into your experience so far with whether how limited or vast that is um and just being able to you know as confidently as you can speak to what you've done the parts that you played how you've improved what you've learned et cetera um you know it's definitely you know one of the best ways to prepare yourself for any interview process all right um this is a closing question that i have um a lot of our learners especially like we keep coming back to the ones that are trying to get the first job and very junior roles i've heard in the past from some of our teammates that they know okay i accept that you're you're applying for a junior role so there's some leeway or there's some some concessions that are given so in terms of your experience or your work experience or what you've achieved because obviously this is going to be your first role uh so um i know that a lot of people get nervous about the soft skills part they were like they're gonna ask me how i work in teams they're going to ask me if how i solve problems in teams or how i communicate my communication skills and some people put in their resume it's almost like a gimmick like on the side of the rest we might say skills and says teamwork communications i don't even know what that means right so do you have any thoughts on on the whole soft skills area of interviewing and going through that interview process where people don't know how to showcase they know how to practice them they don't know what to get them they know what to do with them uh have you seen like in your in your in the past like this struggle and like do you have any any advice yeah how about this yeah absolutely no i think that's a great question um and a great thing for for folks to think about especially earlier on in their careers too um one thing that's coming to mind is you know don't hesitate to utilize experience that you think might not be relevant for these types of questions for example you know especially you know if you're a career changer right um and you're moving into software engineering when someone might ask you about like can you give me an example of a time you worked in a team um you know for a project whatever the case might be that does not have to be necessarily you know an engineering project that can be from you know like something that's coming to mind for me you know before i went into recruiting i worked in hospitality i worked in retail et cetera you know and so moving into the recruiting space for the first time you know i didn't have that experience and that's okay but there are other ways to think about you know similar soft skills and how that translates to any type of position um so when you're thinking about those soft skills type questions about you know can you tell me you know about your collaboration skills things like that that would probably wouldn't be the question but um that's what i'm going to do with your skills if you need to tell yourself skills not so much that wouldn't be the question but you know one one big question that comes to mind is like can you tell me about a time you made a mistake you know as a junior engineer you're like struggling to you know struggling to come up with like oh when did i make a mistake in terms of like you know engineering or how that might you know you know play into the role here you know talk about something else you know there are tons of other experiences that you most likely have whether they're you know inside engineering or tech or not um you know because again soft skills are apply anywhere not necessarily just to this specific role um so of course if you have an example that's relevant to this specific role use that but if you don't um you know it's not like where you a part of you know your background of what you've been in previously you know bring it from elsewhere like talk about the job that you had in high school or you know you know something that you learned at a club um that that you know that you were a part of um at any point in your life um you know for example or you know just whatever the case might be you know it's not usually too much of a reach um to think about it that way so even if you don't haven't had a role within engineering previously pull from previous experiences because again as you're saying it's more about you know the ability to do these things rather than the experience you know depending upon you know what role you might be interviewing for yeah i know that i tell people all the time if you don't have do your research right like what kind of things you need for your role and then once you've done your homework and you know what you need if you don't have it you can get it like especially now with so many online communities and so many online opportunities uh if you feel like oh i don't have a good example of being working on a team or leading a team develop your skills online find and there's so many uh communities online that will give you that chance of like collaborating with people online and then you can showcase that yeah i collaborate with five people online we built these things together we did this thing right so i feel like uh soft skills is one of those things where it's not immediately obvious kind of like when you're going through coursework like oh these are my lessons on python it's not so immediately uh obvious but at the same time i feel like soft skills are everywhere like you just talk to people you're dealing with people you're developing yourself skills so yeah absolutely okay well um i want to leave a few minutes for q a so i'm gonna go check on the chat and see what people are talking about uh let's see if we have any questions for you um let's see somebody was asking how long they should be waiting before they reapply for the same company so uh specifically if they were applying let's let's make that point for a code academy what is that like a good time frame for saying apply didn't get it is it three months is it three months six months yeah is it longer yeah no it depends it depends on the role um i would say anywhere from six months to a year typically um depending upon like how far you got in the interview process you know if you applied to the role um and you know we never got on a phone call for instance whether that was because we just closed the role you know before we were able to speak or um you know we weren't ready to move forward at that point in time i think applying sooner is totally fine as well um you know until you are able to sort of like get on the phone you know with that recruiter or um you know get a more concrete answer as to you know why we're not moving forward um i would say you can kind of gauge the timing that way so uh for example if you know we didn't get on the phone call because you know we felt you weren't qualified for the role or you were lacking some skills um etc you know for what we were looking for then i would say you know six months to a year uh depending upon you know where you were in the process and then i think if you just didn't care from us for some reason because we were closing the role or you know we filled the position you know apply as soon as something reopens um but i think if you you know get anywhere into the process and it's a you know there was a lack of skills i think six months to a year is usually like a good general guideline and and spend that time getting the skills right not just weight like if you didn't get it because of that lack of skills spend those six months learning the skills yeah absolutely he said um i know that a lot of people a lot of companies unfortunately when they get back to you they usually it's like a very simple sort of uh sorry you know there was a lot of candidates who didn't get it yeah is is there like a like a rule of thumb like can you be a little persistent like reach out and be like i would love some feedback on why didn't get this role something like is that totally acceptable like some people feel like maybe that's crossing a line or something can you is that is that fair to ask for for feedback and why you didn't get it or it doesn't depend on how far you got into it yeah yeah i would say it's totally fair to ask for feedback um as far as you know expectations of what you as a candidate can potentially get back you have to be a little bit i think lenient and understanding in that sense i think again no like you know you can always ask for feedback i would say if it's just in an application it is more than likely going to be harder for a recruiter for someone to get back to you very directly um or very quickly about you know why we didn't move forward with the application um you know usually after a phone call um we'll try to provide context or you know after a phone call we may send a slightly more general message and if the candidate follows up for feedback we'll usually try to get back to them as well um but especially after any inperson meetings or after like any takehome evaluations anything like that um we usually offer the opportunity for you know feedback like to get on a call um like after our final round for example so again i think it never hurts to ask right just kind of similarly how it doesn't necessarily hurt to apply to a role that you're not 100 confident um that you might qualify for you know definitely ask but then i think just temper expectations a little bit um you know based on the stage of interview process that you're in okay another question uh when you're looking for your first job should you filter your job search for openings that only say things like junior or internship yeah um it really depends i mean titling is different at every company so you know there's not necessarily a perfect answer because for example you know our um initial software engineering positions are software engineer one so that doesn't have junior in the title anywhere um you know so for you know that might not that might then edge you out of some opportunities as well so i think um so i guess it depends on the company it's like you research the company and if they like to call their junior roles software engineer one then don't search for junior developer right yeah i guess it just comes to the nomenclature or like the keywords that they use yeah yeah there are you know there might be a few key titles that a lot of places use um that as you said uh you know companies can call anything a number of different things to of course they want to try to align with industry standards too um but there's no one perfect thing that you know i can 100 say you know every single company uses so i think um as you said it's a good idea to take a look at you know that company research them um you know see what some of their folks that maybe are a little bit more junior you know call themselves on linkedin and then make searches that way okay and i know this this is probably to a specific question for your role and this seems to be more of a technical interview like uh kind of in the technical interview process sometimes you will interview by engineers that work in a code academy like the company you apply for you talking directly to people that will be your peers or your managers uh so this person is asking if recruiters you often look at an applicant's uh submissions of places like open source places or github repositories and things like this do you know if recruiters specifically look at these kind of submissions or is that like if you're far enough in your application personally somebody will yeah it depends sometimes yes um i would say i think um depending upon you know the amount of hiring that might be going on for example um maybe not but i think especially for like apprentices and things like that for apprenticeships internships um we'll take a look at that as well um or that might be a part of the overall you know application process in general um one thing i can say is for example when we might be looking for candidates for a role um if we're not getting enough folks applying or we do try to proactively just like reach out to candidates as well that might be a fit for positions at times and um we will use you know things like github for example to search for folks too uh based on like the technologies that they're using and their submissions and things like that so it definitely doesn't hurt um you know to have that available um and i think as a part of interview process um you know that's something that a lot of companies look for as well as far as you know what you're doing outside of you know just your nine to five sort of role um to contribute to the overall you know sort of tech space and engineering community in general okay uh this person is asking about technical interviews and they're wondering if technical interviews change depending on the experience showcasing your resume so um i think this is my thought um you can i'm hoping for your answer but i think interviews are usually set for the role not for the candidates so like if you can't this person asking if the technical review interview will change depending on their experience that they're showcasing the resume i think the answer is no no but in a sense right depending upon your experience in the resume that will affect which role you're being considered for right so um in a sense yes but no it is not tailored um directly to each candidate so if we're interviewing candidates for a senior back end role let's say your senior back end engineer if we're going to keep using that example you know every senior back and engineer candidate receives the same technical interview regardless of their experience you know whether that's a little different from someone else's or not they receive the same general interviews across the board okay fair let's see if there's any other questions to wrap this up okay so uh we had a question here say uh are there any underrated tech positions that a candidate should consider to apply for to get their food on the door qa quality assurance testing technical writer how to go about it so have you seen in your experience uh working here at code academy like um any role junior roles that tend to be more firsttime friendly firsttime friendly firsttimer friendly i don't have to say i it's so tough to say i think um not a bad question at all i think um very interesting one you know i've got like broke my way into recruiting by doing something completely different but kind of doing an initial get your foot in the door sort of role um so i i completely understand that um that i think um tough to say i think at cook academy specifically there for example there's not one position i would point to i think um any good company will try to help facilitate you know a transition for you um you know if you come into one role and realize that you would like to you know continue to learn more about another type of opportunity whether that's you know technical or not um you know a good company will help support that transition um of course you have to temper your expectations a little bit you can't just start and be like actually never mind i want to go be an engineer um can you make that happen in the next month no that will that won't happen um but you know for example we have folks uh at codecademy who have made internal transitions since i've been here and we've been able to support those um you know because they've been within their role for you know a certain amount of time and you know they spoke to us whether it's from day one or a year into the role they realized they were really interested in learning more about something else um you know within reason we will try to you know good companies i think will try to help facilitate that type of transition um and that obviously can take some time in terms of making sure that we can you know a company can support the professional development and learning of that person um and help get them exposure to that type of opportunity and then eventually hopefully transition them into that role um you know so i think i think those opportunities can potentially be be anywhere um so it really depends of course if you can get into a role that helps give you some exposure to the type of work you might want to do eventually that's great but i wouldn't necessarily say there's like one particular role and not an academy specifically that's fair i think uh depending on where you're applying for what you're applying for it also you need to learn the keywords that they use like for example you talk about software engineer one versus junior software developer or keywords like that i know that for data particularly it's also you also need to learn the different sort of like ladder the the the wrongs in the ladder because there's a difference between a data analyst being a data scientist i mean uh like there's all these keywords that you can use and they mean different things yeah so i'm not sure that the person asking this question will meant it that way but i would definitely research what the role you're applying for is and what the typical names are for a junior role in that that would be more like you know like everybody knows that internship means low level like it's just it's what it means so uh so i would just yeah uh research your role and what is typically the nomenclature i guess i like the name for it okay well we've been talking here for a while uh madison thank you so much for spending some time with us and the community here i'm sure that a lot of people have learned a lot and i know that there will be a lot more questions so we just kept going all day but uh you know we have to stop at some point um thank you for being here live with us today yeah no thank you so much thank you so much everyone for for dropping by it's great virtually with you yeah and uh reminder that we're doing this every week and we'll have another recruiter on next monday as well so check out the past videos if you haven't seen them yet and we'll see you next week everybody thank you and have a great week and that's the
