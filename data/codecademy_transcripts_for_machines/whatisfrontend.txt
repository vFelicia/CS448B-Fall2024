hi this is Pat with code Academy I'm a web developer based in Washington DC if you've been wondering what frontend web development is you've come to the right place even if you have some experience it can be incredibly confusing if you're a seasoned web developer it feels like the definition changes yearly and if you're not a seasoned web developer it feels like the definition changes yearly so in this video we're gonna talk about what are some of the timeless basics that makes frontend web development frontend I'll also cover some of the uptodate industry practices that we can stay relevant as well as some of my own experiences because I am a frontend web developer let's get started so what is the frontend well put simply the frontend is the part of the website that a user or customer interacts with so they load up your website www.investmentpitch.com nt asks of frontend web developers so a daytoday could look like updating a company's webpage and this could be a small update or even a larger update like creating a new layout for for the new website and it could be as huge as creating an entire new page or an entire new application for for a company and and and in addition to that there are smaller frontend tasks that could be building HTML emails for email campaigns you could be making sure that website is working correctly on mobile and tablet devices because you know we're all on our phones these days we're all pulling up webpages on the phone reducing the pages load time so this could be cleaning code ripping out old code that doesn't need to be loaded or even code splitting so that you're only loading the stuff that you need and making sure that a web page is usable by people with disability or injuries this is all good frontend stuff but when we come down to the technology of frontend there are three big technologies that are associated with frontend and that's gonna be HTML CSS and JavaScript HTML stands for the hypertext markup language and you can think of it as the skeleton of a web page it is both the structure and the content of the page CSS is the skin and the clothes of the web page if HTML is the skeleton CSS is the Styles it stands for cascading style sheets and then JavaScript is the interaction so how the page moves and the way that you can and work with it javascript is a language that can be executed both in the browser and on the server which makes it a very versatile and quick programming language to use so these are the three big technologies that go into the frontend and so so if if you want to drill down as that you know where do we see the frontend so an analogy that I find helpful to some learners is imagine you walk into a coffee shop to get a cup of coffee you know what how does it look when you go inside what are the fonts colors and what what sort of signage do they have what kind of branding do they have around that is going to be the front end but you're not there to look at the place you're there for coffee in order to get it you have to place an order with the barista based off of what's off that menu you have to interact with the breeze but they can't make it without the ingredients so they are gonna go get the milk and the syrups and the creams and the coffee beans the front end is what enables you to interact with the back end but the back end is only the process of giving you the ingredients that you asked for in the form that you're expecting so for some everyday examples we could take go back to Amazon for example the pictures the descriptions and and all the buttons and in the de fonts the descriptions that's all front end that's the interface so the next question is how does all this come together so there's front end designers and sometimes these are referred to as user interface developers as opposed to frontend engineers or JavaScript engineers front end designers or user interface developers they don't deal with a lot of functionality necessarily what they're trying to do is they're trying to take the designs that came from either a design agency or the design team or maybe they made them themselves and they're turning them from static images into actual functioning webpages and this is a skill in and of itself because getting stuff pixelperfect and doing it at mobile sizes and tablet sizes is a real challenge as opposed to JavaScript engineers or frontend engineers these are the types of frontend developers that aren't as pixel perfect they might not consider themselves design inclined what they're trying to do they're trying to wrangle this massive application and do it in a scalable and efficient way so that it can be styled and look correct so sometimes friend engineers also do design work as well so it kind of depends on where you work but there's typically two kinds of specializations so if you're new to web development you're probably confused about where the front end starts where graphic design fits in and how does it relate to user experience design let's start with user experiences I it's user experience design is the research testing and study of how users interact with something they want to know how a user interacts with a website is it is it easy to use is it hard to use our users lost when they get there who is your target demographic and user experience interfaces are the product of that research now good frontend developers don't need to be user experience designers but they do need to understand what they're building and then you understand that is the product of user experience research but at some point we have to start making design choices to represent the kind of image that we want to show we have to start picking colors we have to start picking fonts and styling choices so how a website looks and feels is very much intertwined with all the design choices that we've made and as frontend we implement the design choices of both our user research team and our branding team so this is Austin this is frontend we build the interfaces we are pulling together the decisions that were made from the UX team and also the graphic design team our canvas is the browser so a big one here is cross browser compatibility of all the technologies that are available to us as frontend developers sometimes those out dates what is currently available for certain people keep in mind that not everybody Auto updates their browser so if they have a browser that is older than the technology that we're using it just won't understand the technology that we're trying to push forward so a lot of the great new features in CSS are kind of out of reach for older versions of Internet Explorer and depending on where you work that can be a huge problem and then another big one is the screen size so our phones are taller than they are wide but tablets are kind of in the middle of that because you can turn them in a couple of different directions and reorient your content accordingly but then browsers are wider than they are tall so this makes it kind of challenging to have a unified design that looks consistent across all different device types in terms of tools of the trade there's a couple of patterns that we see pretty consistently one is gonna be the CMS the content management system and this is gonna be WordPress or Drupal and these these to power a significant amount of the web there are other ways of achieving a frontend these are pretty popular right now especially with a lot of companies these are gonna be your frameworks and libraries like react and angular and view and where these come from is that they they took an approach of seeing okay we have a lot of similarities and commonalities across this website like they're you know these buttons all look the same they're all the same size they're all the same color these images all need to be consistently the same why are we creating it one by one and so what they do is they they tend to build what are known as classes and these are gonna be like you know blueprints for okay this button is gonna look like this and that's why these these libraries have come into favor is that it makes if you have you know thousands of buttons on your website it can you imagine trying to maintain each and every single one of them so they're all consistent it drive you mad that's why these libraries are so powerful so the last thing I want to talk about here is why frontend is so important I think this is something that gets but does it get as much coverage because we're so concerned with building front ends that we figure out that the why is important it is the digital representation of a company of an individual or an organization so when there's in congruence there when there's small problems there are even spelling mistakes like this this can have drastic implications for that brand because the frontend allows a user to use that service or that website or contact that individual so it's building the bridge between a customer and a product or service the harder it is to use that website it tarnishes the brand and in some cases it can actually repel customers any company hearing that would probably bristle because the whole point of having a website is so that it's it's available for you to use something also fundamental about the frontend is that it is also the manifestation of somebody's idea maybe even their dream this at some point somebody had a night eeeh and it can actually get a little bit emotional because this is the realization and the visualization of what they've been trying to accomplish you know we don't get to see the back end as it and in all of its majesty and we don't get to see the database we do get to visualize what the front end looks like and so oftentimes it's a disproportionate amount of credit for how website looks and works but it also gets a little bit more of the blame for how website looks and works so the front end kind of bares a little bit of a disproportionate load for our emotions about how we feel about a company or service it is an emotional reality of how the web works this is Pat with Co Academy I really hoped you enjoy watching this
