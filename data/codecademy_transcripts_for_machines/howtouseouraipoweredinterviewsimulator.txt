hey everybody Dante from Co Academy here today I'm going to walk you through our new AI powered interview simulator this is a feature that we released a few weeks ago into beta and we're excited to have you try it out now the reason we built this is because we know that interviewing is super critical for finding a job especially a tech job and in today's challenging job market it is even more important that you build your interviewing skills uh to stand out from the crowd so we wanted to build something that will allow you to practice while you job hunt um so this is a tool that's powered by AI but gives you freedom to craft a scenario that is right for you so in the next couple of minutes I'm going to go through how this works and how it benefits you and hopefully at the end of this you'll try it out yourself and give us some feedback so let's start so what you see here is the interview simulator landing page and you can get here in a few ways number one you can get here via our Career Center in the navigation so if you come down here you'll see newon code academy interview simulator or if you are enrolled in our full stack front end or backend engineering career paths you'll see a link to the page here so you you see just release practice interview scenarios using our new AI power tool so if you C click any of those buttons you'll get to the interview simulator page which is where you'll see a description about what it is pred by open Ai and then you'll see an empty State here so when you finish your interviews they will actually populate here so you'll be able to click on them and refer back to them and back to the feedback that you get from the scenario and just as an FYI so if you are a free learner you get access to this to one interview for free um so you get to try it out for free if you are a free learner as a plus or Pro learner you get access to five interviews per day right so that's a good amount to practice while you are job hunting so free Learners can try this for free once and then plus and pro get up to five interviews per day so let's start building our interview so this is actually the most powerful part of this feature is that you get to actually personalize and customize your interview scenario um based on job title job level the scenario the company type and you get to add your add in your experience so you can see here with the job title we are starting with three full stack engineer front end and backend engineer so these happen to be three of our most popular career paths and these are also three of the most popular uh job roles that people look for when get going into Tech um Tech roles specifically so for me I'm going to start with full stack I have some experience with uh frontend development I also have some experience with backend development uh building apps with let's say flask python flask and apis so I am looking for for a full stack engineering position now we get to job level so obviously every role has a level attached to it some roles may be entrylevel roles for people who are relatively new in the industry or coming out of college uh some roles may be midlevel and some roles may be senior level uh for me I'm going to I'm looking for entry level roles right I have about two years of experience um so I'm still looking for entry level roles not yet ready for midlevel roles so I'm going to click that and now we get to the interview scenario um and this is one of my favorite parts so when you go through an interview process for any job not just technical jobs you usually have different types of interviews you have a phone screen that you typically do with a recruiter then you have Behavior interviews that a recruiter may ask you but also so you may have behavioral interviews with other people in an organization um and then you have technical interviews which is typical for technical roles um in Tech and then final rounds typically happen with you know leadership or someone who is higher up who will ask you a set of questions for the beta phase of this feature we are starting out with just phone screens and behavioral interviews um this is these are scenarios that most people will encounter with and uh interviewing for roles and then obviously as you go throughout the interview process you start to get to the lot of parts of the interview but we're going to start out here with phone screens and behavioral interviews and for my scenario right now I'm going to click on the phone screen and now the fourth step is choosing the company type so there are different types of companies that you could work for right there are small companies startups medium Enterprises uh multinational corporations right if you're somebody who's trying to get into big Tech you'll probably probably be looking for a multinational corporation uh scenario right for me personally I'm a startup guy I love the grind I love startups those are the types of roles that I'm looking for for the scenario so I'm going to click on Startup and now we get to our experience so here in three steps we can add a little about ourselves right so here in this box I have to add information about my work experience or volunteer experience so I'm actually going to update this to 20 let's say 2020 to 2022 I was a junior engineer at code academy which is kind of fake because I wasn't but for the sake of the video let's say I was a junior engineer at e Academy right and let's also say for for a year I had an engineering internship at IBM right so let's say IBM let's say 2019 to 2020 right so that's my work experience again I am relatively junior level engineer so don't have a lot of experience um but I think I believe this is enough to get me in the door and now we go to projects and skills so this is where you list out all of your the skills that you have your hard skills soft skills and also any projects that you worked on right so for me it's already populated so JavaScript HTML I'm going to add CSS here uh know a little bit of python again this is a full stack role so I have to know some backend languages as well I know Python and flask jQuery is you know basically JavaScript um I'm going to add apis I've been built platforms with apis before um I will also add in some projects that I've worked on so add a new line here uh built an ecommerce mobile essay website I've also built a SAS platform built a B2B SAS say SAS platform right and you can feel free to add more things in in there as well let's say for the sake of it I know Excel and I know SQL and I know uh let's say Java you know so I have pretty good skills experience and education finally I'm just going to keep it as a BS in computer science um I think for a lot of people that's typical if you are coming in from another industry you can put in your degree here um because you'll have time to explain your you know your background and your projects and whatnot so uh for some people who are already in Tech you have a maybe you have a degree um in Tech um you can put that here but also feel free to put in another degree if you have it um if you're transitioning from one industry to Tech so now we we've we're done with setting up our interview scenario um and we will save that experience so here it is we are going to do a phone screen with Sasha right so what this is going to do is this is going to mimic and mirror a real phone screen um so I'm excited I have my glass of water right next to me and typically phone screens are 30 minutes um there it may be longer depending on what company you're working you're trying to work for um but the Baseline typical phone screen is 30 minutes so let's start so welcome to my practice interview we'll get started in a few seconds so now we have the first question from the recruiter Sasha hello it's great to speak with you today to get started could you please tell me a bit about yourself and your background so this is where you would tell the recruiter about your professional background so when a recruiter asks this there're not asking a personal question right they don't they're not asking you about your favorite color or your favorite food or how many siblings you have they really want to know they really want a snapshot of your professional career and what you've done right you don't have to go into a ton of detail um just give them a snapshot of who you are professionally and in this feature what we can do we can do two things we can type in our response and we can speak our response here right now I'm going to type in my response and say the following I work on numerous full stack projects in the past last three to four years working for code academy and IBM and I'm make completely making this up but you get the gist I spent a lot of time using Python and blask and apis to build small apps and features that have helped the companies that I work for drive or user engagement and B I let's say my expertise is in let's say using python to build as backend apps and that's my response now Sasha says sounds like you have some solid experience in fullstack development particularly with python and flas can you tell me about a project you worked on that you're particularly proud of yes I've worked on many projects so I will go into some detail on one I recently built a website that helps uh let's say white collar workers improve their daytoday efficiency with uh let's say front end and backend mini apps and let's say I also implemented AI through let's say open AI API and let's talk about the results so typically when you talk about projects and things you've done throughout the interview process you also want to talk about what the result is so let's say after building this app this website my company saw a 32% increase and customer engagement and 11% increase in Revenue that's my response now Sasha ask that's impressive it's great to hear about the impact your work had on user engagement Revenue now moving forward in your career what are you hoping to gain from your next role I'm hoping to work on a wider variety of projects that incorporate new technologies like AI I'm also hoping to work on projects that have more visibility I spell visibility wrong inside and outside compy lastly I also want to work on projects that have a positive impact on our society now this is where a recruiter will ask you about you know details about what you're looking for in terms of your role so here Sasha is asking us in terms of the company location and work environment what do we prefer now this is very relevant in today's day and age especially postco where a lot of work is either hybrid or remote work um although some companies are trying to get more employees to come back into the office um this is something you should learn beforehand before you get into the interview process you should learn about a company's remote work policy um if you do if you can't learn about that on the website via the website this is the time to ask about that uh when you are given the opportunity in the phone screen so right now we're going to tell Sasha that we are looking for remote only jobs which again depends on your preferences um if you are somebody who's okay with hybrid you know you can tell a person that um but for me personally for this situation I am looking for remote only I'm looking for remote only jobs because I have two children so the flexibility is important for me however I am willing to go into the office once in a while maybe once per quarter understood flexibility is key especially with family priorities now let's switch gear slightly move to a technical question so Sasha is now asking me a technical question um again this is not a technical role but what a recruiter might do is try to probe a little bit at your expertise and your skills um and try to understand how fit you are for a role so I'll will respond to Sasha and say okay run and development deals with and please do not grade me on this uh I am not an expert so this may not be an expert answer but I'm going to do the best I can languages uh set front end languages and uh frontend I say front end languages like HTML CSS and JavaScript so this is a very hard question for me right now because I'm a beginner so I'm going to do the best I can and this is a very simplistic answer that I do not recommend Java and C++ front end includes website styling and interaction whereas backend includes Ser uh say database management servers and let's say in servers I'm going to stop there not the best answer but this is a demo so we're going to go with it right so now Sasha is asking me about a time when I had to integrate an external API and the challenges I fac during that process so I recently said that I integrated uh open ai's API into assass app um so I'm going to talk about that experience absolutely all right recently integrated open AI API into as SAS app the biggest difficulty was setting up rate limits because the API was a paid API based on usage so I had to think strategically spelled strategically wrong about how to allow users to access API based features now it's ask me about my previous role at code academy what was the most challenging project or task that I experienced let's say I had to work on making that app more accessible which was difficult because there are so many accessibility guidelines and best practices I was able to work with stakeholders across the org to understand important accessibility issues and address them with my code so now this is the end of the interview now we are going to get feedback from Sasha in a few seconds now here is my feedback from Sasha it says great job what I did well so what I did well I articulated my experience in my career goals I gave specific examples when I asked about projects uh I also explain technical Concepts suggestions for next time my response were comprehensive and well structured but I need to provide more specific details and examples to support my claims so for example I talked about the open AI API integration but I needed to elaborate on the specific strategies I Ed to manage weight limits and then I needed to talk about the details for the accessibility issues as well and then she tells me finally remember to pause briefly after answering and check if the interview has any qu followup questions questions so I made a strong case for my abilities as a full stack engineer Sasha was impressed so that's great and my an is displayed a good understanding of various Tech Concepts and that's it now if I go back to save interviews what I'll see here is my interview that I just did with Sasha and my grade right and then I can go back in here and look at the feedback right and I can continue to do this right if you're a plus or Pro learner you can do this five times a day every day and really get that practice in right practice is critical for building your interviewing skills right so luckily this wasn't a real interview um I'm not interviewing for entry level roles but you get the gist of how this works and how it can be powerful so you can personalize this scenario for what you're looking for then get that critical feedback that you need to iterate on your interviewing skills and you can do this while you're job hunting so search for those jobs practice your interviews and then you will be prepared to do the real interviews whenever you get that interest from a company that you've applied for so we hope this helps please try this out again if you're a free learner you get a free interview if you're a plus or Pro learner you get five a day try this out see how it works for you and provide us with feedback in the forums or on social media or if you have any issues with it you can feel free to contact our support team as well thank you have a good day
