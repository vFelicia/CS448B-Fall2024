i forgot about the delay it's been a minute since i've been in the live streams let's see all right cool we are live so hello everyone out there um welcome to another edition of codecademy live we've got a special hour of code edition for you um my name is alex koontz i'm a curriculum developer here at codecademy and i'm back with zoe zoe it's been months since we've done these together has been we really kicked it off you know back in the spring but uh i haven't had a chance to do one since then so do you remember the last one that you did oh gosh i think it was when we kicked off the like official streams with the data visualization with python i think i did the first one of those um well and probably did another one i think marielle and i did one in there but it was someone like it was the beginning of the path i think i think it was like we were still in python so it was definitely definitely some time i was saying my hair was like so much shorter i'm like uh can you track the time over like your screenshots and the different youtube channels yeah mine certainly is at least since then i think someone i was on the phone with the other day who i went to grad school with was like oh my gosh like your hair it's so long i don't think it's been this long since 2015. yeah all of our quarantine look going on i see people in chat talking with us uh funny enough uh some of the folks i recognize from chat they've been with us uh this whole time since we've been doing live streams so hello to i think fede i don't know how to quite say your name but i recognize you from those on streams so um hello everyone if you're watching this in the archives um every now and then uh we are doing these live coding sessions so if you'd like to watch us live and chat with us as we're doing this feel free to you know subscribe to our youtube channel follow us on twitter we're kind of sending out information about that all the time otherwise if you're here with us live welcome uh zoe do you want to talk about what we're doing today yeah sure thing um so today we're going to be doing a short demo on how to build an augmented reality app with arjs um so very exciting stuff what's great about uh this little project is you can get an ar app running with basically like 10 lines of html code it's pretty short it's really nifty and then there's like lots of room for um experimentation and customization after that so with alex i'll be going over the basic parts of getting your code set up we're going to be using glitch to do that and then we are going to be going through a couple of ways of adding items to your sketch if we have time we're going to be talking about how you can start customizing it with different 3d models and markers markers are the images that you use to focus your ar app on in order to get the augmented reality experience um and yeah that's kind of that's kind of the run of it i do appreciate folks who are saying yeah stiff competition with github universe presentation that one was going on today or even our coworkers are watching that instead of us probably but you know um but this is this will be like a really fun little project um i've done this workshop a couple of times honestly the same to alex the last time i did this was the week before the new york city shutdown had the chance to teach this at um wix wix has this really cool playground space um near the hudson river in new york city and so we got to do an inperson workshop and we were the last in person workshop of the series that they were doing that time around yeah literally the next the next one they were already like nope covid can't do it like a week later yeah that's i guess something to mention that yeah we're doing this as kind of a nice little hour of code workshop or presentation i know i uh both of us actually used to be classroom teachers and i would do um around this time an hourlong workshop with my computer science club looking for fun activities and so hopefully this is a nice little activity that you can start from basically nothing maybe if you know a little bit of html that will help but you can get a fun little ar um little applet working yeah and one of the great things about this is that we've put together a starter code um one of the reasons i love teaching workshops and classes with glitch is that you can create a template for your students to go off of so you don't have to worry about um you know folks having an id on their computer you don't have to worry about uh downloading any libraries everything's going to be already set up all the libraries are in script tags ready for you to go through um alex just dropped the setup template in the chat so you can navigate there that's where we're gonna start i'm gonna walk us all through what the different code means uh for folks who've done html before this is gonna look very familiar to you um but there's some special things in there so yeah and if you're watching this uh the recorded version the link that i just dropped in the chat is in the youtube description as well so you can follow along there perfect cool so um again thanks everyone for showing up i'm gonna uh share my screen and we can get started um so basically i'm gonna be walking us again through the code i'm gonna be talking about a couple of libraries and so we'll be looking at some documentation with that i'm also going to point out some codecademy content that would be helpful for you to go over if you haven't done those courses already in terms of what we're learning today so let's get started awesome um so alex we're good on the screen share comments uh yep i see the aframe uh course yep looks good perfect okay so i'm gonna navigate away from that for a second but what we're going to be doing today is actually using a library called arjs uh so as folks who are here probably know ar stands for augmented reality so augmented reality apps are basically the ability to overlay um different graphics usually 3d models oftentimes animated on what appears to be your local surroundings so would love to hear folks have used ar before if you have any favorite ar apps alex do you have any favorite ar experiences you've done uh that's a good question uh yeah so i one question i was actually going to ask you as i think about that is i think oftentimes vr virtual reality and ar augmented reality get confused what's the difference between the two yeah so in virtual reality you're actually using a headset um whereas in augmented reality you can just have it on your phone or you can even um typically it's used on your phone sometimes you can get headsets like the hololens is technically an ar one um virtual reality you're in a completely virtual environment so it sometimes will take elements of reality like you can see your hands in a vr space they're represented with 3d models but with augmented reality we are in fact as the term suggests augmenting the reality around us by overlaying it again by putting on top of what we see in our surroundings different images sometimes you can add sound to it to uh 2d videos you can get pretty creative with what you can do with ar pokemon go has got to be the most successful ar app of all time right i mean that's the one that always comes to mind for me i mean so if folks haven't played pokemon go one you're missing out i know it's like maybe what three or four years beyond that point but um it was really fun but yeah so basically like the augmented part in pokemon right is like when you are uh capturing a pokemon and suddenly your camera turns on and what you see is what would be right in front of your camera but um on top of that instead of like right if you had your camera open you just see like you know i see my desk in front of me you would see a cute little pikachu chill in there and you would have to then uh you know use your pokeball to go and capture the pikachu um so the actual characters that's the augmented reality experience we've got some pokemon go haters [Laughter] you know it's funny like niantic really did uh try to spin that off into a couple different things like i tried doing the harry potter one like honest god harry potter nerd um at one point in my life um my dad is a huge fan of um oh gosh it was the first one that they did i really should know this it has like different factions or in the enlightenment or the resistance he's obsessed with this um i can't believe i'm forgetting this he's like played this literally i think for the past 10 years of my life anyways sorry dad um well i i think that's a good point do you have do you have more prac so games are obviously a good application of augmented reality and even though people might say oh what's the use of games i think games have you know value absolutely yeah um are there examples of more practical um examples yeah yeah um i've seen a couple practical examples recently because i've been trying to buy a couch so crate and barrel actually i believe it was offers a ar app i think a couple other furniture purchasing companies do this too where you can um get your piece of furniture you're looking at it on your mobile phone and they're like try this out in 3d or whatever it is dry it out in your space and you can turn you know click it and again your camera comes on and suddenly you see that camera i mean you see that camera you see that couch you see that couch and you can try and see about how it fits into your space using augmented reality pretty interesting um i think there's cool artistic examples um particularly when it comes to like place based storytelling so some friends of mine in grad school did a whole project around the stonewall bar that's in the west village in the history around that so you could do like an audio and video tour but it was using locationbased augmented reality to show that to you on your phone it's really cool i think one thing that uh all of these have in common is one uh your pho there needs to be a camera of some sort right you need to like be able to point your camera at something and say i want to put an image or i want to put something there in the thing that we're seeing on the screen right now the dinosaur is being placed or those little um uh markers are being placed um around i think it says staten island or the butterflies are being placed so you need a camera pointing at something and then you also need the object itself and i imagine that that's what we're going to dive into today of like how do we tell our code you're looking at the thing that is what i want my object to be placed on and then how do you choose what object that you want to be placed on yeah exactly and so there's a couple of different ways of doing that um so in this documentation we can use three different ones so you can see here at the top there is image tracking where you can take a customized image like a photo and use that as your marker and what um tells basically your uh your phone like hey put this object here on top of the image um there's also location based uh so if you are in a particular place based off of gps data it knows to render the image or model um and then lastly is markerbased and markerbased is um kind of the the oldschool technique but it's very simple it's what we're going to start with today and i encourage you to start there and then explore image and location based tracking um but with marker based basically um i don't have a good image of it here but i have one right here you use something called a marker qr codes or one of these this is the classic one called hero there's also one that's called kanji that uses the japanese kanji character and if you point your phone at this like you might add a qr code rather than bringing up a url like a qr code does um in this case again you would see the models on top of the hero marker so we're going to get to see that today yeah any other questions before we dive into things or should we look at the chat and see what folks are saying yeah in the in the chat um if you have questions before we actually get started coding um zoey i don't know if you have an example of the final result that we're going to be building to right now um but i think that would be kind of cool to see what we're eventually building to yeah absolutely so let me just drag up my super secret code um well i'll show it yeah i'll show the outcome first and then we can we'll dive into it so this is gonna be a little weird for everyone because you're gonna see me twice on the screen we tried to figure out if we could call in to zoom from my phone um which would be the better way of doing it um but oftentimes when i'm prototyping these experiences i end up um just kind of doing them in glitch doing them in my browser and then bringing up the marker on my camera like you can see here i'm literally going into my favorites because that's where i keep my hero marker that i use all the time and there you can go there you can see it um this is cody this is our codecademy mascot um this marker i mean this marker this model was actually made by one of our um one of our colleagues natalie wee uh who took a skillshare class during quarantine which is pretty cool she learned blender and she made this little little cody um so yeah so you can see obviously like i'm um it's shown twice i assume to you guys uh you can see me holding up my phone nothing coming up and then um where i'm running the program in my separate screen where i'm screen sharing right now if i hold it up it sees the hero marker we've got our little dancing cody that comes into my little home office environment and now you can also see what my office looks like yeah we got the behind the scenes look at the iowa poster the iowa poster yeah that's my uh it's my partner's side of the room he's a very proud iowan yeah we've got a we got a question can you touch it can you uh so uh you've got your little ar cody in there what happens if you um if you if your hand interferes with it so if i'm covering up the marker it's immediately going to disappear because it can no longer track but of course we can pretend and play around with it um you know get a little little little tap on the head wherever i find them there you go good little cody yeah that's interesting i wonder um if we we can start to think of interesting extensions into um this project and for the record i i don't know how to do this zoe is totally leading this workshop i'm actually going to follow along with her so zoe how reasonable would it be to do something like um i've covered the marker now can we do something like you know run the animation of cody getting squished or something like how how easy is that to do in um the library that we're using of saying okay if the mark if the marker gets covered it's no longer being shown away yeah can i do something with the um yeah that's really interesting i actually haven't tried something like that because most of it is the marker telling the program to run right now and that's like the emphasis on it um but this is so a arjs is built off of a frame so there are other things with it um but um yeah that's a really good question maybe we should experiment with that and see what happens yes yeah another good question if you put hero markers all over the place would it show multiple codies so is it basically any hero marker that it sees it's going to pull up the um the model that's going to pull up the model for it yeah and so the way we actually have it programmed right now is so that you can use multiple markers for it which is nice it can have multiple basically kind of like cameras yeah another good way to do this and we were thinking about doing this because it's a little bit awkward to like be showing the phone and the phone like turns off and all that stuff yeah you could print out the hero marker put post on your wall and then there you go uh you know whatever whatever model you have attached to that your marker would show up yeah exactly unfortunately i like many millennials do not own a printer in my personal home if we were not on a pandemic and i was at code academy i totally would have printed them out that's what we usually do for workshops um we're just useless millennials and avocado toast ruining our lives um but uh but yeah and so um kind of mentioned this but i'm going to turn off this one for a second so we saw the hero marker but one thing we'll be talking about too if we get to have time is that you can actually make your own markers and train your ar uh apps on that so say here a marker not really liking the look of this um you know we have this resource um that's been built to create a marker train it and then you can bring that into your sketch so i'll show another sketch um where we actually have codecademy marker it looks a little janky but you can create a codecademy marker and then have cody come up on top of that yeah cool all right should we get to it anything else you want to talk about um well i think i think we're good um yeah we can just dive into dive into the code i think maybe actually the last thing i'll plug is that so arjs um as i mentioned is the library that we're going to be using but arjs specifically is built on top of uh a library that's actually built on top of another library uh so arjs is built on top of aframe right turtle's all the way down um so it goes on top of aframe which is a really simpletouse app for building web vr experiences so we're taking the web vr experience and turning it into a web ar experience um and there's a couple of great things about webvr and web ar so i know some people were talking about um ar kit ar core so one of the nice things about something like arjs is there's a lot more simplicity to it you don't need to be learning swift or any bespoke um you know mobile native language in order to build your app you can just use html css and javascript to do so um and as mentioned so we have aframe aframes actually built off of another library called 3js which is pretty complex aframe does a really nice job of wrapping a lot of um 3js methods and builtin variables into a much easier to work with environment and we've got an aframe course in codecademy which is really nice so um what you'll see in this course is that it'll introduce you to aframe how to build environments eventually writing a component um but it will kind of show you what are different things you can do with aframe and then you can think about how do i translate some of these items into an ar environment instead of being in a vr environment um i i've used aframe before i've never used um this ar library before but i imagine that because i've seen aframe before a lot of the uh concepts will be familiar it's gonna look super similar so let me uh make this a little bit bigger on my screen so so before you get started can you show navigating to that uh from the link that we've provided which is just the uh yeah hour of code glitch so so i have conveniently packaged all of these um into glitch um gonna have a little moment and plug glitch for a second so uh glitch is a really fantastic online um browserbased ide where you can really easily do projects share them remix them so today we're going to be remixing this project template that i've already gotten set up so you can find it here under the codecademy ar setup you can see i've also got the solution code here that was the one that i just showed with cody and the hero marker if we have time i'll get into the codecademyar custom marker which uses that custom codecademy marker i was referring to earlier so what we're going to do is we're going to click on the codecademyar setup and this will show the project page it shows a demo of it too so you can see me again on the video and then we're going to go into edit project awesome so i'm already in here so i'm gonna uh click out i'm seeing a couple people join me here too this is one of the reasons i really love glitch as a teaching tool um you can see who else is looking at this right now so we see some folks uh who have glitch accounts it's nice is like you don't have to have a glitch account to get started you can go and you can remix code and then if you need to save it you can do it there um so i'm realizing one of the tricky things is is because i'm signed in so i'm gonna just take a moment to sign out and redo that again so folks can see it so if i go back here and i go to this link again and i go to view source as in a nonperson you can see a lot more nonpeople in here you can click remix to edit and once you click remix to edit it's going to load the project for you again you can do this all anonymously without signing in which is really nice it may take a moment to load the project which is cool just loaded for me which is good perfect and so now we can start walking through things i am gonna sign in now that i've shown you all how to do that remixing step um just so i make sure that i am in the right section got everything cool cool cool all right um so you now have your own version of this code which means that everything you do this is your own project now you can modify it however you want obviously welcome to follow along with me you can also make detours and try other things out too so we're going to start by just talking about this code and how it's set up in glitch um so glitch when you spin up a new project or in this case if you remix a project that's a basic web dev project gives you a couple of things um i'm just going to cover what we're using we're going to be using our assets folder here so this is where we can upload any images that we need to use any 3d models i'm going to come down to index.html this is our html file and it's already set up for us and so i'm just going to walk through here um you can use javascript um i have not used css with aframe personally but you can in terms of like styling a loading screen for example something like that we're just going to keep it super easy peasy today just work in one file again this is what makes it a great hour of code project because it is something that can be done really in under an hour with still a lot of room for experimentation and creativity cool um any questions so far so we've got a couple we have uh do we need a webcam for this uh i imagine the answer is yes right because your your webcam is going to need to see the marker uh in order to make your arm yeah yeah in order for us to see it in here what you can do is if you want to prototype this on your cam on your phone and what i should first say and this is kind of one of the shitty things about arjs is that um it currently has a couple of key points well not key points where is the thing requirements that's what i was looking for so it works on every phone that has webgl and webrtc um but you cannot use chrome on an ios which does not support camera access it does look like they have now supported android which they didn't do actually back in march so that is a pretty big upgrade um in terms of what it was before um so you can what you can do is if you are in glitch and you go to show and you go to in a new window you'll see um first of all make sure you allow camera usage and everything else you'll see that there's a url here you can actually type this exact url into your phone so i'll show what that looks like in safari on my phone make sure you put the https in first colon slash uh funky in my case you want to put in whatever yours is so i'm going to put in my randomly generated one which you can change the name of to uh dot glitch dot me okay so i'm loading this hopefully you guys can see that um but it says okay want access to the camera yes i'm gonna press allow um it says the immersive device needs to have access to your camera yes and motion sensors yes allow allowing just saying allow to everything and so zoe this is this is if there is no webcam on their computer they can basically run the app through their phone which has a camera hopefully which hopefully has a camera on your phone yeah uh needs some cam camera of some kind so what you can see here is the again the rest of my office um and if i had like a hero marker for example it when we finish the rest of the code because this isn't the final code you'd be able to see something appear on your camera here um so again a little bit a little bit confusing because last time we were using the phone as the hero marker and now we're using the phone as the thing that will have the augmented reality experience in it yeah so again like if you want to print out your hero markers and you want to see the ar app on your phone uh that would be that's the way to do it too so it's not so it's not stuck to your computer right you you don't have to be using your computer webcam to be the to have the thing that's showing the ar experience exactly yeah so like when i do these workshops in person we print out a bunch of hero markers everywhere and then people can you know usually they test it in the browser at first and they'll hold up the hero marker and show it so on the browser and make sure everything's working it's a lot easier to go back and forth between typing english and then showing it in the browser um and then after you're ready and you want to show it as like a a phone experience then you just type the url into the browser again super easy you don't need to download any apps you just go to a url and it's ready to go cool all right i think we should uh jump into the code let's do it all right so i'm gonna keep this um i'll just close this down for now but let's jump into the code okay so i've talked about this a couple of times but we're using basically two libraries in order to make this app work uh let me know if it gets too dark because it's that time on the east coast i can see i don't have my lights on um so first here you can see we need to include a frame obviously um so again a frame is this uh web vr library that in the next library is based off of so then we're going to include the arjs for a frame library so this is really important when you do this on your own if you go to the ar.js documentation you'll notice that there is several ways to import the library right so we import a library in html with a script tag what we're looking for specifically is arjs with marker tracking and then we want to import the aframe version not the 3js version even though aframe is built on top of 3.js we want the aframe version um you can always replace it with a specific version but for these purposes just make sure it's this one here again this is in the setup code already so you don't need to worry about importing it you don't need to worry about your students importing it if you do this with them cool um alex just let me know if anything comes up in the chat and can answer questions as we go on different trying to answer questions in chat as well as people are typing brilliant cool so um folks are familiar with html if you're not take your learn html course on codeacademy i helped write it um we've got a body tag right so as we know on a website our body tag is where the content of our website goes same here with our ar app the content of our augmented reality app is all going to go within the body tag so let's dive in another level into the body tag so what we have here is an a scene tag if you've done a frame before you will have recognized this this is how you set up your web vr scene but in this case we're not doing webvr we are doing arjs so we want to make sure that we're adding additional information which is just this line of embedded arjs and that's again what lets the program know it's ar not er in this particular case okay next important thing within the scene tag so make sure everything at this point is nested right we have our body tag we have our scene tag next important tag is our marker tag so as i mentioned we're doing marker based uh ar that's different than image base that's different than location based so with the marker tag you can have an attribute a preset and you can actually define what marker you want to use we're going to use the hero one which again looks like this uh you can also change it to there's a couple other ones like kanji uh you can find all of this in the documentation and lists preset here uh preset markers you can use so so those are all built in so it knows okay if you give me hero then i'm gonna be looking specifically for this marker which is like built into all of uh off the library yeah exactly so um you can see right here for preset this is the attribute that i was mentioning before these are the um ones that are our preset marker so hero or kanji um when we talk about custom ones um we will show how you need to use the attribute type to determine um a different kind of one awesome um so i'm gonna jump out of the marker one for a second but i'm gonna come down here to camera so again this is super important um our web app needs to know um that we have a camera in place um and that's gonna move according to the marker position so in a frame they have this kind of like general object um component called an entity um a frame runs off of an entity component system there's an article about it in our learn aframe course and it allows you to do a lot of special things you may notice that there is a camera component in a frame we don't want to use that one because you can if you're only using one marker so it actually would be fine in this circumstance but as someone was mentioning if you want to use multiple markers you want to make sure to be using the a entity camera one awesome all right so um jumping back into marker um the next thing that's super important here is this is where your content goes okay so anything you want to show up on your marker needs to go within the marker tag definitely think about that for debugging if something's not showing up maybe because it's not in your marker tag i catch myself doing it all the time um there's a lot of levels of nesting going on so you just want to be really careful um to make sure everything's nested correctly it's one of the nice things again about having the setup code so if i if i wanted my ar app to show one object when i look at the hero marker and one object when i look at the uh what's the other one g marker copy marker um could i just uh put them on the same level of nesting so would they both be inside the ac good question two markers um i believe so okay yeah in a minute honestly i'm like really good at getting the basic part of this stuff so something to play around with once we make our final product maybe we can add a second a marker that will uh show some something completely different where we define what the hero marker shows but then the other marker could show something else honestly like that would be my assumption because there are definitely apps that you know want to see different images different qr codes all of it's based into the same logic right it's not different apps so there's definitely a way of having multiple markers in there but that would be yeah a good thing to to figure out on your own extension challenge project we've got some good questions in chat i think we should get a little bit further into the code but i'll uh i'll um write them down to ask you in a bit okay cool um we're almost there so the last thing that we're going to talk about right now is um adding an actual component from a frame into the code itself so as i mentioned you want to make sure all of your content was within the marker um and so in this case we have um a box so it's gonna look like a cube um and you can guess by the different attributes here that we have a position attribute that centers it at zero zero zero and a color attribute that sets it to red um so if anyone has any guesses in terms of like what do you think what do you expect to see happen once we turn on our app um can use this as like a moment yeah good question so given that we're saying the marker the hero marker we're asking for this a box tag with a position and color uh thing uh what do you call them properties uh attributes attributes um what do you expect to happen as we're waiting for chat to answer us i'll throw some questions at you um could you uh where is this could i use arjs to add glasses on people's faces uh no unless it was glasses on an image of someone yeah exactly so you could make or if someone had a had the marker on their forehead right or if someone had the marker on their forehead or if they were standing in a very specific locationbased spot that the gps could find them in so if you built like a photo booth or something that was in a particular spot yeah set center of times square you could say anyone stay you know at the center of times square if you run your app there then uh glasses will show up at people standing in that exact location yeah exactly um okay cool we have a flat box a red box in the top left corner uh that that's really interesting intuition from cat a red box in the top left corner i'm guessing that's not someone's been doing p5 yeah exactly zero zero is usually the top left corner uh you wanna you wanna say what this is zoe yeah so in this case we're using um the xyz coordinate system kind of people sometimes show it like this in terms of your hand but x would be right the horizontal y would be the vertical and then you have z shooting out into space um in this particular set of circumstances uh it's actually directly in the center so what we should expect to see is a red box directly in the center of our of our marker let's try it out i'm gonna uh find my hero marker again my phone and again i'm gonna post the link one more time in the chat of this is the starter code that we're starting with so if you have a webcam um i suppose zoe do you want to show how to run the program uh yeah so um i prefer you can run programs in two ways with glitch i like doing it in a new window and you can see now on my shared screen that the camera is up um and i just need to point my marker that's on my phone which is hard to see with the background on but you can see it there oopsie all right there we go square at zero zero zero so it looks like it's you know pretty directly on top i can rotate my phone it rotates with it if my screen goes dark like it just did it stops tracking uh what are the other benefits of having it on a piece of paper and not on your phone um but yeah so i can move it across even it's interesting it picks up reflection and uh disrupts the image and the camera the way the camera is able to read the image that's interesting so thanks to the marker um or something absolutely yes i find myself this is why i have it literally in my state images um do you want me to chat it to you yeah just chat to me and i'll post it in chat and then afterwards i'll make sure it's in the youtube description again this is the thing that you could print out it doesn't have to be on your phone but basically you need this marker somewhere whether it's a digital version on your phone or a physical version in order for the pro for your ar program to see it exactly so i should also i want to see if this works um yeah so this is oh man how am i going to show this i'm like should i try moving my my monitor maybe i will i want to see if i can point my laptop screen at this wow yeah i know it's like you're gonna have to kill the background uh that's what it is i am gonna have to kill my background everyone can see everything anyways right so it doesn't even matter if i show a background anymore okay um answering questions from the chat yes the source code um from glitch if you go to that first link in the youtube description or the link that i've been posting in the chat if you go to codecademy ar setup that's the source code and you can go and download all the code from there yeah so it's hard to see because obviously there's no depth that you can see on my phone but you can kind of make out that there's a red square coming up on my phone because i'm pointing it at my screen that has the hero image on it that i'm currently screen sharing with the rest of you this is some major tech inception right now so yeah it'd be amazing if someone walked in here took a photo because i'm literally sandwiched between my laptop and my monitor with my phone in between yeah so this is the phone is the thing running the app the computer is the thing that's showing the um the marker and yeah piece of paper and so right really the best way to do this is get your phone being the thing that's running the app which like zoe was saying you can just enter in that url um onto your phone and then you can walk around your house if your markers are all over your house you can point it at them and then the red cube will show up for now exactly yeah cool so i'm gonna go back to the way my setup was um like if i can't get something okay it is very lovely outside um cool so now that you guys we've gotten rid of the facade of where zoe works you can see it from all the different angles um awesome so now comes the fun stuff okay um we got a basic ar app working with very few lines of code what is this this is a total of like i mean if we took out all of my comments it would probably be 10 lines of code that's really special um you know i think one of the reasons i love teaching things like html is it's really accessible it's really quick to get something that's immediately gratifying and i think that's true of this project too is that um with doing very little work you can get a red box to show up on the screen yeah and i think one thing that's cool too is that as we're going through this next stuff if you want to start playing around with your app as we're kind of introducing the introducing the kodi model and more complicated models play around with that position right what if you say position is 2 0 0 or what if you change the color to green and stuff like that and you start to dig through the documentation to find right basically if i again if i were in this workshop i would probably be googling uh a frame a box because that's the kind of box and now looking for information about position about color about other things that i can do with this box um as i'm waiting for us to get to like trying to add cody and all this other craziness that we're going to do exactly so um okay i won't dig into this too much but basically aframe has all these different primitives that you can work with again this is i believe covered in our aframe course um so you can start to like look for different things like ah here's the whole section on primitives this is what i was looking for so we used a box but you can use a circle a cone a cylinder octahedron uh you can add lights you can add a ring you can add a taurus knot i love the taurus knots um you can add even a video um if you want a video to play at a certain location super easy to get that working um cool so like alex said definitely encourage you to dig around in the documentation and see what you can do just with the aframe primitives here to make this a bang for your buck let's move into talking about using custom models because i think that's one of the most exciting things um so custom models um this is also talked a bit about um in aframe um so when you have 3d models aframe provides components for loading gltf and obj they recommend gltf because that's becoming more of the standard uh this is a really great page i actually i believe we link to this in the resources later but you can find models in lots of different places sketch fab's a personal favorite of mine um a lot of people make it there google also has something i think it's called like google voxel name does that sound right okay apparently not uh i don't know google 3d 3d models free yeah so uh sorry i was i was answering chat so i was like oh no you're good i'm not listening for a sec so we're looking for now that we've got a square we're looking for models that we can add to this instead of our square right exactly yeah so i'm trying to remember oh polygon that's what it's called google polygon is a place where i've gotten several before um do they not have polygons okay well we're gonna we don't need to go through this and finding a model it takes time um to often find a model if you have experience with 3d modeling or interest in creating your own models definitely recommend blender it's a free program that's really great um oh supercraft apparently is built with a frame and no modeling skills haven't heard of that that one looks super fun i would try that out um what's nice about using gltf2 is it's just one file if you use an obj you need to make sure you have the obj and the material one so i'm going to show them interior i'm going to show adding a gltf1 um so give me a moment while i make sure i have everything in place so what we're going to do here is um i'm going to just close out this um i'm just going to comment this one out for now and we're going to go to our assets folder so you'll see there's already a scene gltf that's rendered there don't worry about that we are going to do is upload an asset and now i need to find my kodi asset is here we can't see that on zoe screen share but somewhere on her local computer you've downloaded uh what is it it's a dot gi tf file yes dot g i think it's gl gl sorry um no that's all good uh google poke it's google poly okay great yeah this is why i shouldn't remember things of the live stream of frantically just typing random things into google but yeah so as alex was saying when i click upload an asset you can't see it but a file system comes up i'm selecting um the gltf1 i'm going to click open you can see it said uploading asset and now i have this kodi 3d2 asset right there right so this is like a whole other world of ar stuff of like you could really i mean this is what some people's jobs are like the person who made this little kodi um asset of making these 3d models that then you know whoever is going to go and uh and put these models um in their project exactly um so awesome opportunities for collaboration too if you've got a friend who's a 3d modeler you can you know hit them up and be like hey person can you make me a cool trex model that i can use in my ar app uh like i did with natalie i said hey natalie can i use your awesome cody one too um so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna go to the aframe documentation and search gltf you can see that this a gltf model component comes up i'm going to click on that and it has an example here what we're going to do is do this second way of using a gltf model which is directly linking the url in the source this other one has like a whole loading system i find it to be somewhat finicky personally so i'm going to just copy this because copying pasting is your friend when you're learning how to code no shame in that game and then you're going to go to index.html and you can delete your box i'm just going to put this right underneath and i'm going to post it in now what i need is right i don't have a tree.gltf i have my kodi.gltf and so i need to head back to my assets folder here and then if you go to your um your asset that you want in my case the kodi one i'm going to click on this and it has a url generated for me by their cdn content delivery network uh so this is nice another reason i love using glitch is i don't have to worry about hosting my assets anywhere right like if i was to put this on the web um if i'd been developing it locally on my own computer and have to figure out okay how am i going to host everything how am i going to link it all together this makes it pretty simple so i've copied that i'm going to go back to my index.html and i'm going to take out the tree and i'm going to post in this really ugly looking url here any point another thing i love about glitch uh i should just just click format this file and boom it's on a whole new line it looks really nice um like we did before with the box i'm also going to give it i should have waited to prettify it but it's cool i'm going to get a position of 0 zero zero so again x y and z are all set to zero so it should be right in the middle um yeah then we're gonna let's test it out yeah so the big step here is getting your hands on one of these models and bringing it into your project we're doing it through this asset folder and glitch and then hosting it on on glitch here using this url um you know if you're not running this on glitch you can do that um through your local file system or you know basically you just need to you need to give your program access to this um 3d model file which can be kind of tricky honestly like i think that that's part of coding where people get lost because it's like um it's always hard to start combining these different parts of of your computer like right now it's not just this html file anymore it's now we have to look into this asset folder and the asset folder is talking to like we've uploaded the asset and it's being hosted at this at this url so all of these things start to kind of mix with each other but again i think the important thing is that the goal that we're trying to do is give our program access to the 3d model file um yeah yeah absolutely and i would say you know not all 3d models are created equal you'll see this as you try it out when i've taught workshops in the past sometimes it can be challenging to find the right model for your purposes which is nice if you have a friend who can 3d model things for you even with natalie we had to have a little bit of back and forth because the way that it was being exported you have to be really careful when you're exporting 3d models to make sure that you have all the different components together that the lighting is right on it all these different sorts of things so don't be discouraged if you know even after three tries you don't find something like really take your time to find a model that you like another thing i'll say is that sometimes for these models they're done at like a really high um at a really high quality so when you initially import them they actually look massive they're like giant and you don't see them on the marker at first because they're so big so you'll want to use attributes around like height um in order to scale it down yeah and then you know so always try that too if you're having i imagine that almost even has to do with the camera where by default your camera is like you know a set distance and i'm kind of talking about on my butt here i don't really know but it's like i imagine that if so you point your k you point the thing at the marker and if your asset is giant basically the camera is going to be inside the asset and so it's not going to show anything so if you could like either back the camera way far away or shrink the asset down um yeah yeah so you can probably even put position and stuff like that in camera like if you've ever done any vr stuff you know that you can position your camera in a very particular way in relation to your assets in a vr space too to determine like what the experience is for a viewer once they enter that space like are they above items are they below them or right are they very close to them so they look really big are they much further away so they look very small so yeah it's like having that kind of mindset of how everything would be mapped in virtual space but thinking about okay but this is real space so that's why i'm not seeing it show up on my phone because that's my little just my little window into it right now all right let's run this and see uh see if we can see that model yeah all right so um let's see how this goes all right here we go so this is what we saw in the beginning right so we saw whoopsie you saw this little uh cody he's not spinning um that's because in the solution code i actually have so like a little bit of animation on him um so if you're interested in animation rotation um you can you can uh oopsie take a look at that solution code that's in uh yeah yeah exactly so that's all in the solution code that alex linked to beforehand um so and then again something to like look at the ar documentation about um you know where is um the stuff around rotation animation properties you can loop things um and also like maybe you know changing again the position of cody so he's not like directly on top of my marker maybe you want to have it appear slightly differently again on a phone though this would look very different because um if i had like let me keep popping up um if if the paper if the hero marker was on the ground and i was looking at my phone it would look like he was just like standing right directly on top of it this is just kind of like a little a little weirdness right now um sorry i'm going to put you on the spot for a potentially interesting extension that we might be able to try out here okay can you go back to your code okay um can we add the other marker so can we add the ar marker for um kaji right in addition to this one in addition to this one and give it just the red box again and then can you go grab your partner's phone and pull up the kaji uh marker and the uh and the hero uh marker i don't know if uh if you have the ability to go grab both markers but let me let me try oops and i definitely want that to say marker okay and i'll grab that here let me see if i can grab justin he's probably looking at imagery or something all right one second okay um meanwhile i'll talk to chat as zoe grant goes and grabs another phone um people are saying that they have major imposter syndrome and i think that that is a super common experience uh again the thing that i would do to um try to alleviate that is to experiment with this again right like really i think it's a one a massive accomplishment even to get this running but two play around with these three numbers with position and see if you can figure out what's happening see if you can add a different shape um not just a box but again zoe was showing all of those different shapes um and then finally i think the 3d model thing is a little bit complicated and a little bit tricky to do but if you can go download a free headphones back on glitch sorry so i'm just uh just monologuing here uh if you can go into uh go grab a free 3d model bring it into um glitch then you can have exactly what zoe has here um i think that that part's a little bit tricky i would say if you're feeling super overwhelmed i think the better thing to do is to play around with those uh attributes on just the box all right here's the box hey here's cody nice hey there we go all right i'm gonna get my nut back to my face okay there it is all right so shout out to joey's partner for uh sacrificing their phone for uh you know 15 seconds um he's expecting a call so he was like it's a call oh no oh my god wow i'm not answering a call and i think that that's a that's a really cool demonstration though of like uh you're not just stuck with this one marker you can have you know you could put you could print out 10 10 of these different markers 10 versions of these different markers you print out 100 different copies of each marker and put them around your apartment and now you'll have like thousands of different objects popping up around your uh around your apartment yeah absolutely um yeah no that was that was great that was really fun um and unfortunately we only have four minutes left but what i will say and i think this is in the um source code again little challenge project um and i did link to the code the solution code for this as well if you want to see what it looks like but you can upload um a image so i did this the other day with like the codecademy logo it looks a little squinched so you may want to find something that's like actually more of a square um but you can um you know change the border color how oh no that's actually the image size don't mind me pattern ratio so i was talking about how much of the pattern it is to the the black line and then what you do is you would download the marker which is like a dot pattern and download the image and i'll show y'all what it looks like what that code looks like really fast so again everything's there um what is different is that in the ar marker tag we now have the type pattern and we have our url going to that pattern so once i downloaded it i uploaded it to my assets you can see here we have the scene and the codecademy 3d2 these are actually don't worry about these that was from something else is trying out but we want to focus on the pattern one here and so if i go back um that's basically where i pasted it in yada yada um and then again here i have my model and i have um the source code this one also has animation on it so it has rotation animation and i can show you oh my phone battery dying um go to my library so i uploaded this last night you can see that's the marker that i made um if you have an iphone i'm a big fan of just like when you download it to your computer airdropping it to yourself otherwise text it to yourself so i understand the reason for making your own models is there a strong reason for making your own markers is it just so that you don't accidentally overlap with you know other hero markers that are lying around outside the world or something oh i haven't really thought about it i think mostly just for like the more customization so if you are putting it out there right it's a lot cooler to have this say codecademy sure than it would be to have uh just a random yeah i guess yeah for it for an art exhibit right you could make it your uh you know your logo or something if you're making this part of your own exhibit so you can kind of personalize yeah the markers themselves yeah so so yeah so and like i mentioned you know that one's specifically a marker one but other things that you can explore as extensions of this are using this is see this image that i was playing around with of our coworkers sarah eating some shrimp cocktail back in the free covid days when we had a game night at the office [Laughter] so if you want to try imagebased tracking like i was trying out you can go to the image tracking section of the arjs documentation it has example code here uh to show you how you would do that um you would again use this nft marker creator in this case and you can upload an image what's nice about this is it will also give you a level of confidence um as to how well it thinks that image will do um they also have like a whole uh section on like whether i'm trying to find where it is but um basically it will tell you if you want to understand the better if you want to understand more in depth how it works and what makes a good marker they explain it here actually the more complicated it is it's the better it gives it more points to be able to identify more distinct yeah um so yeah again like that makes it a more custom experience immediately is having um a personalized image like that um and then yeah let me take two minutes to answer some questions from chat um we've got uh stop screen sharing sure um a question of just can you make a game from ar and how would you do so yeah that's a really good question obviously as we were talking about at the beginning of um the uh live stream there are a lot of popular games that integrate ar into them pokemon go being one example of it um you know i haven't done as much work integrating javascript into the experience but aframe is very popular for creating webbased games you don't have to even use aframe for web based vr you can just use it simply for 3d environments online so it is very popular for creating game mechanics um so you know you'd have to do a bit more work in terms of like figuring out collision detection stuff like that like it may not have builtin functions that like a gaming library like phaser.js or even unity or something like that would have you can create ar apps with unity um i used to do a lot of unity ar workshops with euphoria i think before i may be built into unity now so that actually is a pretty simple way of building apps but i'm sure if you're working with javascript you can figure out ways of building uh games in ar2 yeah nice uh kind of general question about javascript what do you guys think about javascript phone stack developers do they have their place in the industry or better to be more diverse with other coding languages that's a great question well uh as a web development domain lead who worked on the full stack javascript career path um i do think that there is definitely a place for full stock javascript developers in the industry um i'd say particularly in like coastal cities and um places like new york there's a lot of javascript based shops using node node and express um i would say um you know full stack javascript is a great place to get started but it's not where i would stay i would definitely invest in other languages particularly java especially if you're interested in building out your backend capabilities um python with django is another popular offering um eight bit eight frames asp.net with csharp uh which we which we have a course on is extremely popular particularly in the midwest and the south with enterprise shops um so yeah so i'd say like start there it's nice just to be able to have one language and you can build full stack applications um especially if you're interested in building out your portfolio that way and demonstrating what you can do you know a lot of the concepts are going to translate across languages and then it's just a matter of learning different syntax and how different um you know systems work together nice okay and then final question for the session uh this one related to ar can i use something similar to show in a native using java and xml android app so as the camera gets loaded and the app in the app to find the marker et cetera so basically does this kind of system work um in other languages in this case java and xml in an android app i mean i'm i'm sure you know it's just it's a matter then it's a library right like it packages everything really nicely for you um so i i always confuse which is ar kit and which is ar core i think ar core is the android based one for doing an air kits the ios one i think so correct me if i'm wrong um and so i yeah i would say um you know obviously there are extremely skilled developers who have like figured out how to leverage the hardware of a phone in its camera in order to create ar experiences for android and i i'd say always start with the library if you need higher fidelity you know you can go a step down and figure that stuff out but um yeah i would start with the library cool all right one more question john carl always says alex answer my question or i won't go to sleep after this jean carlo was the person asking about um javascript uh okay i live in new york and would like to know if with just full stack javascript can i get into the field instead of learning ruby python django etc yeah i mean that's basically what all the bootcamps are teaching these days again i basically architected the full stack path so i would not steer you wrong um you know we had subject matter experts and people who are in the field who are part of the app production um so you know we built that because we saw that it was actually more common um to use you know full stack and of course too it's not simply just about javascript it's also about um you know alex just wrote this great postgres uh skill path that we also incorporated into our career path and so we're teaching you how to use um postgresql and sql with javascript whether that's like um you know directly interfacing with postgres or using an orm like sqlize so that you're writing it actually in pure javascript and bringing it in but yeah a hundred percent i mean we hired people at code academy who come from full javascript backgrounds so it's possible cool all right folks um thanks for joining us uh zoe this was awesome uh super super fun um again if you're if you caught this late this will be posted on youtube all of the links to relevant stuff will be in that youtube description and uh yeah i think we will uh i think we are planning on having more live streams in the new year so keep an eye out for our youtube channel and uh if you want to see more of us so
