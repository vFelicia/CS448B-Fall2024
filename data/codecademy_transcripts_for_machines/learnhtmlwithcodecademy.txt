all right there already oh my there are a lot of people what's up everybody hey you know we 5 166 oh boy there are a lot of people how people join it low for me Italy what is that hello from Turkey amazing Brooklyn Brooklyn ok see some Ghana but I really hi what's up oh wow that's awesome next to see Israel this is amazing 378 people alright let's do this alright I saw some SoCal up in there nice F I'm in LA right now that's and I'm from I'm streaming from Brooklyn New York yeah Oakland England that's New York in there cuban Mississippi if somebody says New York oMG stay safe Shanghai Rainey Los Angeles it's worth that right now oh we got a cup of LA mmm Locke Jakarta Iceland is this gonna be on YouTube um so the answer is no unfortunately I think we are recording though so I think it's gonna be available on YouTube after for right now though like live it's just on zoom all right can you switch between tracks yes it's just links so we'll send the links how are we how are you Sonny how do you feeling today I'm pretty good it's like little bit chilly and cloudy outside but I'm feeling pretty cozy where's up in my apartment same I feel like I've had enough time and quarantine to like get used to my setup here and actually feels like a little comfortable not like life in general is comfortable but just like I got a good setup crew she have a few more minutes I'd like two more minutes to get everyone you know get here and set up thanks for doing this isn't a lonely time yeah all right shall we get started I think yeah yeah yeah yeah so as you come in let us know where you're from and yeah we'll tell you what's going on over here cool so uh Sonny do you want to introduce yourself first yeah hello everybody my name is Sonny I am a crick m developer at code Academy and a former CS taught CS in the classroom in New York you might have seen some of my courses including Lin C++ my sequel data science path learn Swift learn how we're programming with circuit Python and so on mmhmm I am Nick Dockweiler I'm also a senior equipment developer here I guess son have you been here for like about the same time like and yeah so I'm in LA I used to work in the office and now I'm gonna be back with family what else okay I worked on also we work together on the analyze see that it was sequel that's right I did some work on the course started the career path what was it ho combinations I'm down all of the Alexis stuff I'm gonna see sharp stuff I did the JavaScript unit testing yeah what was your favorite favorite little things a little project I could get well definitely wondering how to code stuff at the beginning of code foundations if anyone takes code foundations and then the first few lessons they're all like interactive little games that one did it all the p5 yeah so okay so let me talk about a little bit of like how this is gonna work today so we are gonna be hanging out for about 90 minutes and what we're gonna do is first want to talk about like what hTML is this is learn HTML by the way okay so we're gonna show you a little bit of what that is on like our computers and then we're gonna be doing a lesson so we're gonna be doing learn h2o Mike's in the room hello interesting some questions when they pop up don't don't mind me okay cool this is Mike everyone so yeah we just did introductions so I said 90 minutes we're gonna talk about HTML show you how it works a little bit in the browser and then we're going to lesson it's one of our most popular lessons learn HTML mmhmm and we're gonna do the first lesson of course so if you're interested in making websites if you just want to see kind of like how websites are built or just get an introduction to programming this is and then after that we're gonna be doing a little project with sunny Sundays gonna walk us through kind of like once you know a little bit HTML you'll be making your own one that's over than 90 minutes our goal is to have you with some with some kind of working website maybe like your favorite band it might be like your own portfolio project we're gonna get you there anything else to add no I think we're solid sweet okay so let's hop into it let me show you what learning Gmail is all about I'm gonna share my screen in a minute but first so learning some HTML stands for hypertext markup language and the way I want to kind of like think about it a Santa Monica what's up here and so let me share my screen here I'm desktop okay cool all right so this is my browser I can't see the chat at the moment so just let annoyed ears so yeah if you can't see my browser that's okay so I'm working on Chrome but if you have Safari Internet Explorer or whatever it's a browser and it's just like any other app it just reuse vials and in what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go to code ketamine learn and that's just the website and what's gonna happen is it didn't send me a text file and chrome is gonna understand that language in the text and display a web page for me so if you use like word or you use like iTunes or whatever music player you know that there are files like this have doc file and word can read those doc files and there's mpg and like iTunes can read and BG files but they're all just text that's a that's a spoiler today is that they're just text and it's the same with HTML browsers know how to read HTML so check it out when I go to code kademan learn just a website my browser requests the HTML file the HTML file that Codecademy has its sent over here to my computer and then it reads HTML and shows me this page so now I'm going to show you what that text looks like just that plain text so if I go to rightclick and you can do this on your own computer most of them if you just rightclick inspect you get this inspector which is cool like developer tools that we use a lot so the web page is up top here and then you can see the code down here this is the plain text file that my computer just got and you can see even here pro member corresponds to that pro member up there so check it out I'm just gonna change that let's say I'm a mom did that look burger boom so you can see I'm just changing the text file and it changes what's on the screen because the prouder just knows how to read that let's do something else more fun let's check out this image inspect and let's see here I have some links over here ready to go yeah over here so instead of my face I can change again this is an image tag and I'm just changing information to HTML to redirect and set up to an image of me doing image of donuts so now I'm donuts and I'm a seed if there it is up there that's just my webpage now so um that's kind of just get you started on the idea of like what we're gonna be talking about today and if you're curious no it's just on my computer and if I reload it goes away because bars are just accepted requested a new web page again I know but today we're gonna show you how to make that stick and how to make exactly what you want so yeah so you want to hand it off to you talk a little more about like the history stuff like that cool cool and make sure to send out the link for the course just so people just in case people yeah we'll do that right now get situated so while Nick is doing that I'm gonna give you all a brief history of HTML and the Creator so I actually remember walking into my first CS class in college and and the professor when she talked about HTML briefly she said something that really struck a chord with me over the years she said HTML powers the internet okay so to give you some history context HTML was created by Sir Tim bernerslee who was a mentor of the world wide web in the first browser and I said Sir Tim bernerslee because he was actually knighted by the Queen HTML was created in 1991 the year that was born but it was not released officially until HTML 2.0 which was published in 1995 okay and then comes HTML 4.01 which was a major success wiley popular and then comes to HTML 5 billion up 5.0 which is what we currently use worldwide 5.0 HTML 5 is essentially an extension of HTML 4.01 and it was published in 2012 okay but let's go back further and dig deeper into this story there's something very cool here to the time when the world wide web was invented so it all started ashle with one single proposal in March 1989 Tim bernerslee was working at CERN at the time if you don't know Stearn it's the European Organization for Nuclear Research in Geneva it is one of the world's largest and most respected scientific research centres my dad actually worked there and that's why my family moved to Europe when I was a kid but anyways bernerslee basically distributed a document to his coworkers to his colleagues in March 1989 and the proposal name was information management a proposal he at the time he basically knew that certain had vast quantities of valuable information stored all over the place and it'll be really nice and really easy if they're all linked together right so he recommended creating a networked hypertext system to manage all that knowledge in the database and here's a piece of story that I always liked his boss at CERN took a look at that proposal and read through the proposals that basically described the early web and wrote back vague but exciting and I thought that's really cool because later on this proposal became probably one of the most revolutionary inventions in the history of mankind right it's able to make what we're doing right now possible like video conferencing real time in real time for people around the world and that's also something I really like about this story is that a lot of the a lot of times great things come from one idea in one individual a lot of times if you're really blue in something and the especially if you're a programmer I always tell my former students just go and don't it let the work speak for itself you know his boss might not have believed it in it but he basically gifted the world won't the probably won't the coolest thing ever right and if bernerslee stopped right there he would have already been you know very legendary status in my book but he didn't he basically later on became a champion of the web for he basically fought for an Internet that's free and open system and fair and for everybody and I think there only a handful of people for me when I think about if I just think hard enough that like makes me very emotional and I think Tim bernerslee is one of those people and here's a quote that found in The Times Magazine in 1999 so he said so they said Tim bernerslee wove the worldwide web and create a mass medium for the 21st century the world wide web is bernerslee's alone he designed it he loosed it on the world and he more than anyone else has fought to keep it open nonproprietary and free cool right whoo dude you should definitely check out some of these TED talks at least one of them just to like get his idea I mean what's really special to me about building what that path like the web dev learning sequence HTML CSS and JavaScript is that you're almost learning it from from like a you're almost like learning it and watching the web evolve right HTML is started for HTML was like the skeleton then you know a CSS came along a couple years later and then JavaScript came along so in this lesson this live stream were almost starting from the very beginning here and every time I write HTML sometimes you know it's so simple right but you know sometimes I still think about like the story that that like I you know just like fine throughout the years about bernerslee and just very cool to to think about very zenlike that he was able to you know keep him like not compromise his integrity and values he could easily been a billionaire but you know he just really became a champion of this new the modern web anyways enough rambling for me sorry sometimes like when I think about the stuff I get like pretty yeah into it yeah I'm gonna turn it back to Nick so we can actually get started no dude that stuff is important and it's crazy to think that's like not that long ago not that long ago right the Stu still like rocking a nice suit sometimes I see him like he's doing this new thing now but call solid but yeah yeah I don't dude it's still very young yeah so with that in mind I'm gonna explain a little bit more about like technical stuff like how the zoom works how this all works and then I'm gonna jump the lesson because I was seeing just a few questions about that so we are in zoom and this is just like a room but you can see the three of us Mike me and Sonny and then all the guests if you want to chat you can chat if you want to ask like an official question that'll stay rather than let get pushed up in the chat and you just go to this Q&A at the bottom and click that and then some of these are open some of these are answered we'll do our best to keep up with those when we can so just to recap this is the learn HTML course it's gonna be about 90 minutes and we're like 15 minutes in and the lesson that we're going to cover I'll show you on my screen they kind of like exist a couple places on our website right now so bottom line is if you need to find some links vicechair the right screen I am so not okay hold on okay okay here we go here's my password here's my way what am i sharing the right screen can you see my you can see the cut of the news code Academy calm yeah we can see that we can see the the blog post Google okay so this is if you have any question about links this is where you go news code Kadim e.com slash learn from home day so if you go down here 1030 build web sites learn HTML that's us that's sunny that's Nick and you should be able to get through to there and then if you want to get to the secure which one of these links will take you to so this one I'm just gonna walk through this to make sure everyone has the links okay so it doesn't actually link you to the course so of course where you want to go is here let me start here you're just gonna work no yeah lesson name yeah okay but I think we're the I want to show them the course learn from home conference oh then you can just take out the lessons so the slash lessons take that part out yeah I think oh yeah we just double check because I think that Kenny gave us a winning yeah learn learn HTML I saw that there's another one that I wanted to show that is all I want to basically give you all the courses that gonna happen this week earth today so that you have options well here it is here it is yeah okay check it out so yes we're do learn HTML but if you go to this slash learn slash learn from home conference then you have access to all the courses that are happening today so this is gonna go on for a while and if you stay in this kind of like track basically the next things HTML CSS JavaScript we have some other people doing t5 Swift and are today so if you go to learn HTML we're gonna be taking this lesson and if you want if you're really feeling it you can take more a second lesson here and then you can also take this project which is normally paid but it's free for today so I'll put this in the clinic this is where you go that's for the can you send them like an easy link instantly okay I said I said the link yes sorry for loop yeah okay let me get it to it so right go to here learn HTML interactive lesson introduction HTML there it is thanks Sam Sam name is happenin is cool alright let's get into it I'm gonna keep my notes here so don't forget anything cool yeah let me um yes okay cool so this is learn HTML and it's gonna we're gonna go through like most of these exercises not all of them and we're gonna kind of like talk you through it and this is go camping so if you haven't taken a lesson before that's okay I'm gonna walk you through all of it the way that it works is you have a narrative on the left with some checkpoints and the idea is that we're gonna teach you something and then have you practice it and then on the middle in the middle here there's a code editor let's bring your Tiger code and I'm gonna show you right here this says type your name in between the h1 tag then press run so let me refresh this to make sure I'm on the right situation here okay cool go down here one and then if I do need Eve and I click run it's gonna check my work and apparently I did it right so I get this green question mark okay that's like this a little easy to read yeah so we Nick let's let's go over the I can I can do a little breakdown for for people who never use coke hammock before for like our learning environment yeah yeah you want to take over you may just show my spring yeah do share your screen um so just for all the new people that never used coke at me before on the left hand side we have the narrative that explains some information with followed by one or more checkpoints on the bottom and in the middle of the screen that's something called the code editor and when you type in the code when you press run if it's correct the the checkpoint will turn green if it's not it will turn red and on the right hand side we have the D we have and in this case it's a browser window and some other cool neat features that you can check out is if you're stuck you can click on the stuck get a hint part if you need to reference some formation for previous lessons you can click on the cheat sheet link after the checkpoint and then on the very top of the coeditor you'll see the file name so in this case is index.html mmhmm this for all the new new you know new coke at me mites yes and then I want to show them the cheat sheet cuz yeah yeah very much yeah one of these babies right so this is what we're this is all like the content we're gonna cover today actually this one's nicely put together so you can see all the all the like kind of like the facts that we're gonna cover today cool let's go back okay so let's zoom out for a minute here yeah okay so yeah let's start so don't zoom in again so uh what is HTML there's well welcome and hTML is a skeleton of all web pages so like Sonny said this is what the internet is built on and it stands for hypertext markup language you don't remember eyes that and essentially it's you know the language in every file that a browser gets to show some web page and this is just HTML which is like the skeleton but if you want to put on clothes and make your website dance then you're gonna need CSS and JavaScript and those are coming up after this lesson so stick around for those cool so we saw our first example of this this is an HTML file and whatever I type in here is gonna show up on the right so that's right there I can put anything in here like last time I was putting curriculum developer I can run that oh there it is okay that's just to show you how it works now let's get into the anatomy of an HTML element so everything in HTML is this like the atomic piece of HTML is an element so every webpage is built up with a buncha elements and this is one element shown right here so there's an opening tag it's got these angle brackets there's some kind of content and then a closing tag and it's got the angle angle brackets and the slash this particular one is a a P tag so this could say anything in the past that said h1 it could say div whatever it's this is the important part and then the content inside so this is what you're gonna see on the screen hello world and just to be clear the whole thing is the element the red parts are the tag and the inside is the content so when we use those words just so you know what we're talking about that's what's going on um yeah let's keep going so let's get into one of our first elements it's called the body element and you can see that it has these angle brackets like before and instead of P its body yeah I did that into class once someone told me to do that for like a black pose for a photo like that I was doing this and they're like no up here okay cool so body tags so first let me show you what it looks like add a body to your web page using the body element okay click run so make sure I did this right yes okay now add the following code between your opening and closing body tags so that means your my tags between those let's that's the content P life is very short and what we have and I forgot the closing tag there we go and run it there it is now it shows up in our browser okay so now we've seen two elements we've seen the body and P which stands for paragraph okay yeah and suddenly feel free to jump in whenever you see I'm missing something cool right okay so you saw a P element within a body element and the way that it works in HTML is that everything's nested you know how I'm like if you're doing like a research paper or an essay you have like the full essay and then you have separate paragraphs and then within the paragraphs or sentences then within the sentences are words it's gonna be the same in HTML except it's like a body and then there's paragraphs or like headers and paragraphs and then we're going to get deeper and deeper so this first example the paragraph is within the body and we use like a family treat kind of vibe so the body is the parent element and the paragraph is Pete is the child element and you can say that the P is nested inside the body and usually we like to flip these spaces here just to make it clear it's like every time you go one layer deeper you add two spaces to indent it and you'll see once we get into more code it's going to help to have it nice and tidy okay so check it out as another example here's the body and it has one child which is the div and then that has two children each one and P you can say that h 1p are children of the div and that's children of the body okay so let's add a paragraph below as a child of the div so if its child is going to be in between two right here gonna make sure that I indent properly do that here this paragraph I'm gonna copy it is a minister day oh sure that I did there yeah cool okay so so far we've seen bodies P elements and nesting the h1 and the div you haven't seen yet and we're about to cover that but they're all elements okay so yeah that's nesting let's get into one in some actual elements now so headings you notice in this web page our code County webpage there's this kind of like bowls bigger font up here and it says headings so that's a that's a heading itself and that is a type of element so when like I said when the browser gets the HTML file it knows how to interpret it and those ever read it and when it sees those h1 h2 h3 which I'll teach you in a minute it knows to make them bigger and bold so example and newspapers large headings are typically used to capture a reader's attention other times headings are used to describe content like a title the movie educational article HTML the same way and there's six of these headings so you're gonna use these for like titling mostly and they go from bigger to smaller each one the biggest then h2 h3 h4 h5 each of those get smaller so right now you can see this example gave us let's see here h1 h2 and h3 so you can see that h1 is the biggest brown bear h2 little bit smaller and h3 is even a little bit smaller okay so what are we doing here below the h3 heading that says features and an h2 this is habitat just a quick question on h6 yeah that's the lowest it's just 1 through 6 okay so here's habitat it's a little bit bigger than h3 because it's an h2 then below that it's asking me to put h3 countries with large brown bear yeah yeah so this one is gonna be a little bit smaller that habitat to this h3 and then let's do one more I'm just gonna copy here to make it x there this one's going to say countries with small so basically within habitat they're going to be countries of barge brown and then country the small brown there we go finally make another heading then set h2 heading that says media so now on the same level as about brown bears and habitat there's also going to be a media section h2 media but it cool so those are headers I like to see all of them at once just so you can really get a feel for it check this out do three four five six okay so over here on the right I just add a little my own content it just as medius three four five five times with each well why don't we just go through it all the way each one does the same thing but you can see that the size is different so each one's the biggest here I get some always smaller smaller until you get to age six cool so those are headings one through six and one its biggest six its smallest modem okay so I saw a couple questions about divs and these are dips its ends for division and basically allows you to group your elements into meaningful sections so right now I have all these each one's h2s h3 swimming around everywhere I want it to be represented in my code a little bit better so I'm gonna use divisions just to kind of separate it out so below the h1 that says brown bear and an opening date there so here we go div and then place it place the closing tag after H CSS features do okay and because now these are nested they're like inside I'm gonna push them in two spaces and I want to give myself a little more space here visually check that I did that right um then add another one above h2 and then after wrapper then like I said they're nested so I got to push them in indent them cool finally wrap it another one around say yeah around media it's a dip yep push that back okay so like I said before there's like the about brand bear section there's the habitat section and the media section so I'm using divs to separate them and now it's nice and tidy can use white space whatever I want do here do here and to tip here okay so little side note here we teach you tips but there's a lot of other grouping elements so section is another one and article is another one I think there's no aside is another one but we're just gonna teach you dude because that's the general one and as you get more and more into HTML you'll see one to use section and article and stuff but Dave is just the basic one to get started okay so Deena DeMaria says should you uniquely named the div to easily reuse yeah in fact that perfectly leads me into my next exercise attributes so within an element you can add extra information those are called attributes and there's a name and a value so one of those is ID so here's an example you have the div and now it has this attribute name is ID value is intro an ID is just like like you said to make a give a unique name to each of these dips you're not gonna see anything changing on the right side in the browser but this makes it easier for one us to read the code and to later on when we get into styling these divs and these IDs are gonna help us add styling to our elements in length groups so you can say like this div and all of its children make it look green this next Dave and all this children make it bold or whatever rather than having to say like paragraph to paragraph pair with heading ahead and Henning make those bull okay so show you some examples first one is introduction right that's below yeah okay then this next one is supposed to be have it taught then finally this next do is so the point is for this one that attributes exists you can add them to all elements and each elements have like slightly different options for what the tributes are but they're extra information so we're about halfway through the lesson let me pause for two seconds for just make sure that I'm answering people's questions and that the Q&A isn't going on unloved so zoom QA what else is going on over here so we're on the first lesson of learn HTML you can use the link up here I use anything for another and that dude this is like a bigger no okay and then we're on the seventh exercise here so if you ever get lost you can just check out the bottom left here I'll tell you what exercise we on the lesson I'm cool so some questions about code Academy versus formal courses you have some questions about disk okay discounts an easy one I can answer we are currently running a scholarship for students who are affected by the Cova nineteen pandemic and and if you have been laid off and it's you're not in school that is something that we're working on right now and should be releasing soon and that's gonna be a way to to help you out I can't like say much more than that but yes there's there's something coming and you'll if you follow along with codecademy just check us out on Twitter you'll be able to hear when that stuff is going ok and yeah so this code Academy course you can do this on your own whenever you want but we're you know doing it all together today scholarship for teachers so yes if you have an edu or k12 address you can search for code can we scholarship you'll be able to find it and if that doesn't yeah so that that you should be able to do that yeah so just make sure that when you get the scholarship that you have edu or a k12 or a student address thank you go out have any issues and even contact our customer service that can help you out here ok it seems like a lot a lot fast I have a tendency to do that question about is slow down yes ok I'm gonna slow down ok so so Benjamin Oxley asked do you have any personal HTML project we could see for it and product reference so I think after this stream we can post the the code on github so we'll sound on the link and you can all check it out yeah whether we built a band page together or whether we build a portfolio page together yeah ok so let me get back to recapping so we talked about HTML and what it's used for I gave you an example with the inspector you saw that it's just a file browser knows how to interpret it and knows how to make it look for the user for us okay we saw elements so hTML is made up of these elements and all of them you're gonna see angle brackets content angle brackets okay thanks one of them one of those elements that we saw is body and I saw a couple questions about why body that one the browser like I said needs to understand the HTML and every browser is a little different and so it interprets HTML a little differently but one thing that we can be sure of is that it understands body and it knows that body everything inside body is what needs to be shown to the user so that's something that we don't really see like on the right side in the display but it helps our browsers figure out what to display so that's lucky okay then we also talked about like nesting so remember we had this body inside there there's an h1 so the h1 is a child of body there's also a div the div is a child of the body element and then this P tag this P element is a child of the dip mmhmm okay okay dibs in a second but first with these H's those are headings and they just tell the browser to format things a little differently give them their own line make them bold make them a little bigger than paragraphs and each one so I did this little example down here you can see what they look like same word but over here h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 or 6 this is what they look like so those are those and then we talked about divs which are just another element div and they're good for grouping things keeping things ordered a stands for division and when we get into styling with CSS and interaction with JavaScript it's going to make us a lot easier for us to like add features and then finally tributes which are pieces of information that you can add to each element for example ID which is like a unique identifier you can add that to our divs and it's just a little equation here just says ID is the name of the interview habitats the value yeah we'll get them two more of those cool so I've been talking about CSS JavaScript a little bit if you want to make I like a website like Tok Adam II over here you'll need to know HTML and CSS and JavaScript right now we're focusing taking it one at a time HTML is all about the content the skeleton and then if you stick around after this we're getting to CSS stick yarn after that we'll get into JavaScript so we're gonna cover all those today all right how we doing on time it's 1115 and we have 45 minutes okay so I want to get this done in like 15 minutes and give somebody some time for his project cool cool all right so we talked about paragraphs I'm gonna skip this one for now I guess I should allow I just first matter of time I'm not gonna cover dibs I will talk about am and strong so M and strong if you want to make things italic and bold then you're gonna use strong and M so check this out the Nile River the Nile River is the longest river in the world so if you want this bold you're gonna wrap your text and strong if you're gonna do italics you're gonna wrap it in M so M is emphasis that's what stands for and it's the italics so let's show an example here this ursus arctos is like a species like a scientific thing so we should make it italics because that's what you do for latin names so remember italics is emphasis and there is no it's okay yeah you can see it's talent then what we supposed to do next let me just run this to make sure I'm doing things right all right then brown bears about brown bears least concern should be strong should be aka bold that's right here he's concerned let's see if that works yeah bold okay and then there's also line breaks so these look a little different they're just a just a starting tag just BR like that and if you want to do some cool like poetry or IQ IQs you want to break up your paragraph that's what you use is be ours so for example if I wanted to put a break after these concern get to be our VR and it's just um a line break run it you can see now this is pushed down a little bit let me do that one more time but delete this you should see there jump back up to lose concern there it is more time yeah yeah separate cool and what my question about that so why do we need break elements can't can't you just add you know to enter you know two new lines after okay good question thank you so so remember we said browsers interpret the HTML file there's a certain way that they know how to read HTML turns out the browsers don't care about whitespace I can just go like this I can just do as much as I want browser doesn't care it's gonna look the same so we need to be specifically to tell like hey actually in display not in this white space stuff actually for users show them a line break so you need to be specific and say BR then that will make whitespace but everything here like within the actual code it's not like a word doc it doesn't whitespace is essentially ignored in fact I really want to make this ugly I don't recommend this you could just like put everything on the same line it would still work nothing changes browser knows how to read that yeah thank you that in Bernard asks why to be ours and not a P so yeah so the question is I pretty sure what Bernard is asking is I added to be ours here why not just make this a new paragraph and I agree you could do the exact same thing by essentially deleting this ending the first paragraph and starting the new paragraph looks the same hmm so this is just an example to show you breaks I agree that another paragraph makes more sense here let me show you a realist example say after features I wanted like more space I want to make it clear that habitat is separate so I'll find where species is which is okay I made a mess here so have it before habitat I want to add some more line breaks so that's right here they are the ark and you'll see habitat come down a little bit and we have things nice and spaced out so there's looking more realistic example look on line breaks okay I'm going to cover a few more tags so you've seen headings those look bold those are bigger you've seen paragraphs those are like the regular text how do you make bullet points let me make numbered lists the unordered list is bullet points and the way it looks is you else answer unordered and Li stands for list item and the way it works is you have this ul and then within there you put the bullets that you want so this code is gonna look like this output let me show you an example I'm dining that says species create an unordered list like this remember we need those list items so it's not gonna actually look like anything yet okay then add the list items in there great so within here I have archetypes actors are toys I also need chorus okay I'm just gonna run this so you can see it alright so starting to get some bullet points here and then coke I was angry because I haven't finished in so what's ahead hurry hurry hurry hurry ballast I say that right and then finally or no so you think cool I did do arctos okay okay there we go cool moving on so I showed you bullets Richard unordered lists and I'm going to show you numbered lists those are like ordered lists so said of UL you use oh well and again you just have to list items in there so this is the code example and this is what it looks like so if you're using numbers if things are like actually need to be an order like this recipe then use an order lists if they're not like this arctos over here then you use unordered list UL let me show you this oh well under the heading that says countries with large brands yeah yeah add an ordered list okay alright so we're gonna be adding stuff under here you're not gonna say anything yet because I haven't had any other size let's add some now Russia has large brown bears United States now that then it old bears okay so here we got the numbers real quick I saw a question from Lisa I'm gonna say tags and elements mmhmm what I shouldn't be really saying is that is tags are the stuff in here so for example this oh well that like text is a tag an opening tag and this slash oh well is the closing tag the whole thing all together is called an element mmhmm okay and a lot of times I feel like even in tech even like uncooked Gammy's engineering team when people talk about tags and elements they kind of use them interchangeably mmhmm like strictly speaking like in a more correct sense element is the opening tag the content and an optional closing time yes thank you okay so we've had text all day let's make let's put in some images and they're called an IMG programmers don't like to type that much they're lazy so when we can take out letters we do and you just we just you get used to it IMG is image um and notice that this one's a little different there's no closing tag it's called self closing tag it's essentially you start with the image you have some attributes and then slash closing tag slash angle bracket which is like closest itself so you don't need anything else to make image and then the one attribute that you need a source SRC and then the value is whatever the file name is cool so we have given you a image here I can actually go directly to this give a spoiler it's a brown bear that's just a image online you can all can get there but I want to put it inside my webpage so with under media what I need is an image okay so there's a tag which represents the element there's just one tag for the element this time but it needs this source attribute with the value of being that URL and we got a bear next ok image alts mmhmm so another part about being a developer you have to think about everyone using your product there's gonna be a lot of people using a website across the whole internet and some people will have a slow internet connection or some people have problems seeing so you give some texts to the image that describes it so if you can't see it so you can't load it I'm also if we make a mistake and put the wrong source name the text will show up okay so Oh also it helps with SEO search engine optimization basically helps you get hiring the list on Google okay so let's add an alt so basically just have to describe it this is a large brown bear as I understand it okay here is again so if you want to like see this as an example I'm just gonna make a mistake and break my mm link to though it's a grizzly where okay excuse me okay uh uh thanks thanks iris okay so if I break the link it's gonna show me the alt text instead of the image this is just a way to test that you wrote your right alt text here we go the grizzly bear so even if the image doesn't show up we at least understand what's supposed to be there mmhmm let me fix this and you'd also and this would also kind of would be would present as if you were doing a screen reader say if you couldn't see very well and you needed the computer to read it out loud so there it is okay almost there I've got two minutes and I'm handing over something last thing is videos right yeah we saw images now let's get into videos same thing except was of this source but now we have three more tributes with height controls also image was like a self closing tag it just have that slash and go back at the end this one actually has both an opening and closing tag okay so let's add a video down here this is kind of the architecture here just opening and closing tag but yeah opening and closing video and you want to put this source in there so source think what was that and run that okay we've got an image going here there's the video I can't play it yet and it also is not the right height or width so I keep adding some attributes here the width with 320 and the height so these are pixel sizes oh my god what'd I just do okay run okay so now we're starting to get the proper size finally wait what'd I do wrong here find the width of the video is 320 my height is 240 oh I also need rolls there we go okay now I got control sir can start playing this it was cute bear thankfully and then finally like I said with the images to be sensitive to people that can't read it properly this also house with SEO and also if you break the video link you still have a description here and this says do not supported this is pretty general test um little placeholder there it is okay by the way controls was what enabled these buttons down here so if I delete this run it again no controls you can't play that back controls run it at these days you alright graduations everyone thank you for making it to that slog with me hmm you now know some HTML and Sonny is gonna show you what you can do with it so I'll pass it over to some cool thanks Nick so before we get started with this portion of the stream we can do either two things we can either build a band page together like your favorite band page together or we could build your personal portfolio page so spam and chat press one for band and press 2 for band portfolio page yeah good luck reading I do okay well I'm seeing a lot of two's it's a portfolio page he's a gamer so you can read things a lot faster than I can okay if that cool should I share my screen go for it okay so we have 30 minutes let's see if I can blaze through this actually let's do another thing should we let me know because I can't see the chat anymore we go through do this locally on your own platform like show you how to use vs code or do you want to do this in the review exercise are we asking me or yes I mean yeah both of you and I can't see the chat right now people are loving vs code and local right now vs curl ocol oh dude they're loving it yes code are we doing it 30 minutes yeah alright let's go I've been trained the last few years let's go okay so we're gonna do this locally on your personal computer so I'm gonna send out this link in the chat right now so I'm gonna explain what yes code is but go here and download it you can download this whether you're using Mac OS you're using Linux or Windows it should work great question from Tanmay Arora so vs code is a coeditor developed by Microsoft it includes so right now we're doing everything on the code cami environment but usually you do this off platform on your own personal computer so Co editor is where you type your HTML code just a note there is something called visual studio vs Co stands for visual studio code but there's actually visual studio and visual studio code Visual Studio is an IDE which stands for integrated environment integrated development environment okay it's like the full suite and Visual Studio a vigil state vs code Visual Studio code on the other hand is just a coeditor but it supports a debugging support skit control supports github supports syntax highlighting see how you know how on this web page there are a lot of nicelooking colors that is all because it's a nice holiday and according to stack overflows 2019 develop developer survey vs code was the most popular one I used to use Adam and I switch over to yes code so make sure you download that same and let's show you give you some basics of it so I have it right here pop it open cool and the two two ways so this is Visual Studio code so there are two ways to open a new file one is you click on this link right here new file or you can click on file this little file tab and then new file so I'm going to click that and here we have a blank file where you can type your HTML code also give you some more basics so on the left hand side here is a fat and Explorer or a file navigation system here is the search button where you can search for keywords in your in your code base is the little version control system little debugger and extensions so we actually have a coke am a syntax theme so if you just search here coke at me / syntax theme you can actually get the color theme from the from the coke cami environment so you just click install here from the Marcus marketplace and then set color theme so I'm going to set it right here so boom it looks a little bit different it looks a lot I'm not familiar something do that work let's see I did not work you can also do this right here so color theme coat colors indices boom now we have a nice little file so to do this locally on your computer here's what I suggest I'm gonna create a new folder in my desktop and I'm gonna call it scream ok and I'm gonna go into this file explorer I'm gonna open the folder of the streams of desktop stream folder I'm going to click open it's gonna reload and now we have a stream folder right here as you can see it's the toggle it's like a little toggle and I'm gonna do a new file okay and I'm gonna just type in each one Sonny Lee close it and I'm gonna save it by using the short the short cue command command s okay I'm going to store it inside the stream but make sure to save it as something dot HTML so index I'm going to call this file index.html okay I'm gonna save it because I give it a five extension of dot HTML as you can see the color has changed now vs ko recognizes as a HTML file so when I click on the stream folder and I double click the index dot HTML file you can see we have a little webpage on your computer here's a file path cool a bit slower please I'm sorry let's go a little slower feel free to type in the chat any questions I can see the chat now and then also reminder if you want to just practice you can still build HTML on that last review exercise Sonny just showing you the souped up version where he's doing it locally on his own computer with his own text editor yeah so have a new folder called stream you know stands for this stream and then can't repeat that method to start vs code I just clicked on the after you download it you should have the application locally on your computer go what do you do so repla asked Remo asked what do you do with a new folder so I'm gonna keep all my files for this web page for this portfolio page on this in this folder called stream ok so let's get started there gonna be a few things that might go over that that are not part of the the lesson but it'll be part of lesson two in the introduction to HTML but it's still okay so there's something called a doctype which stands for document type declaration and every web page actually should have this there's another element called HTML element and all of our code will go inside here okay an opening tag and a closing tag cool and then there's we learn about the body tag the body element sorry this is where all the code that would be written that will be displayed on the web page so let me just type my name one more time Sonny Lee every time you make a change to the code you need to save it so either file save or command s and then refresh the webpage so I have this webpage open actually I do not some the doubleclick right here the webpage open right now I need to refresh it so anytime you make a change so let's take out my last name save refresh and the page is updated cool so let's go there's something called you have the body tag but the body element but there's something called a hat element this is where you display the meta information about your webpage so let me just type in some meta information this stuff sunny these web site I'm gonna save it refresh it and all this does is see this little tab right here in this browser it changed to sunny Lee's website and that's what this does okay I'm gonna leave this here for now this is called like boilerplate adiyae asks how you add your theme again so this is a code kami syntax the open source code kami syntax theme I'm gonna send you link right here it's open sourced on code camis github account created by Walmart for more engineers don't say I'm so fellow John call let's continue so when we decide when we try to build a webpage for you know a portfolio web page before we get started we usually need to like think about what we want to have in this page right yeah usually I should have you know white boarded it out or you know draw it out on a piece of paper but here let's just do three parts let's do a a session called about me let's do a section called work and let's do a section called social media okay so let's create a heading one and let's call it Sonny Lee's webpage website and then here's a little really cool thing that we can do it's called a marquee element it's a really fun one and let's do the content inside let's put welcome save it refresh here we have a nice little heading and a little no text that's like come across the screen okay cool and now let's create three different sessions one called about me or introduction whatever you want one called work with a list of stuff that I worked on and then one calls social media so let's do h2 about me I'm gonna copy and paste this so command C command P let's do work and then let's do social media so under about me let's write something about yourself so I'm gonna have a paragraph tag now I want to say I am a critical developer at curb kami and a former CS lecture save refresh now we have three headings and a little paragraph good so in the work section let's create maybe that's great maybe two different things one for for our projects and maybe one for writing I do a lot of writing on the side so let's do an h3 element so heading three with the content work and let's copy and paste this on the bottom let's do one for writing okay and then let's create two bullet point lists in these two okay to list out all the different work that we've done and all the writings that you've done so under the writing let's do unordered list UL element and inside let's make for myself I'm gonna make two list elements though I stands for list you all stands for unordered list okay for this one I'm gonna do want some blog posts I did for Kobe nineteen so it's called dear students dear teachers students and parents and the other one it's an interview I did with yarn structure the creator of C C++ so I'm gonna do interview with the Arne Strauss scrub the creator of C++ sweet freshest and then we have a bullet point list cool and then maybe work let's do another bullet point list and let's do some cool stuff that I built at coke a me so maybe the Instagram filter coke a me has a Instagram IG filter that you check out then recently Kirk a mean she shoots version 1.0 okay it just came out of beta so let's refresh right here Oh instead of work let's actually do projects there's to work here this this will look nice oh and then this looks kind of boring right now with just text so let's add an image underneath social media let's add an image element so I am G stands for image and we're going to do source the path name I have an image I'm gonna use let's see what are you okay I have an image right here call Sonny Boy gift it's a gift file and I'm gonna put that image inside the stream folder okay so these two are in the same filed a same folder now on the computer on my computer so inside here instead of putting a URL I am going to put something called the relative path usually with URLs you have wwe.com be calm slash Sonny Boy on gift right but what happens when we put the same image file in the same folder with the HTML file that what writing me we can actually use something called relative path with dot slash and the file name Sonny Boy gift I'm gonna close the image tag save it refresh it Oh what's spell sois ron SRC mom save it again refresh it hey there's a gift underneath there is cool so sunny um I just want to make sure that everyone has a little bit of a break before the next session so maybe like around 1155 we do a little stretch break okay we cap as I said cool cool cool you can aspire it's maybe too quick so let me just show you the screen real quick the code real quick so it's not too bad so all we're writing is this cool the only thing I think we didn't talk about in Nick's session is this part that's just some code that you can include okay so you don't have you can ignore this part and also the marquee element actually we didn't talk about it okay to recap you where are these files on your computer so this is in a desk on my desktop in a folder called stream I just named I just create this little folder called stream with the index.html file and an image inside cool and then you're editing the HTML file here yes and then could you show them one more time how to open that file on their browser in the browser okay so to open this file in vs code we right click it and click open with VSK visual studio code to see the code itself if we want to see what it looks like on the web page you just double click it sweetie okay let's add a little bit more information on here just to make it more fun let's have a another list called maybe interests something to have something called h3 element of interest so let's do two interests with a couple I like the video game dota 2 I like VR I like music save it refresh it and now you see something okay and we also forgot to add in social media links I'm going to go back to the web page I'm a copy and paste another polar point list okay and let's do some some self plug right here let's do Twitter at some num num and let's do github at sunny mmmm save it refresh it and then bin we have this and let's customize style a little bit more let's use a strong tag to make the Twitter and the github bold add the strong opening tag around the word Twitter and another strong opening tag and closing tag around the world around the word github save it refresh it as you can see these two turn bold okay and then let's actually add a link so this is something we have five minutes let's actually do this so that to make this page more interconnected to other pages I'm suppose we want to add a link to another page on the type this in chat right now it's something called an anchor tag it's with the letter 8 okay but that's not all so anchor tag there's something afterwards um an attribute that says H ref which is similar to the source attribute part of image so it's H ref and the URL inside and this opens the link the content to another page so let's do this right here I'm gonna add an anchor tag a my add a closing anchor tag okay remember there is something that attribute called href hyperlink reference and I'm gonna add a link right here the blog post linked sorry okay it's just a new URL for the blog post so now when I save it refresh it you'll see that this actually turned into a link that you can click on I'm gonna click right here and it takes you to the blog post that I wrote okay can y'all see so inker tag with an attribute called href and the attribute value is wrapped in double quotes the URL of whatever we want to paste a link out to cool and I have another one right here I copy this I wanna make this link out to the interview that I did with Arnie brochure so here's a link new link replace this URL delete it paste it in and you are at URL this closing tag should actually go here okay and then we save it let's go to this webpage refresh it and let's try it out boom it goes to interview okay but right now the one when I click on the link it links out to the other page in the window itself a lot of the times we actually want to open the link in a new window so this is how we do it we add another attribute inside anchor tag called target equals and the value is underscored like okay this stuff you'll learn later on it looks might look kind of crazy right now it's actually not so later on the introduction to HTML course you can check it out so now when i refresh the page I click the link it actually opens up in another window so I still have the old page right here very neat and then let's do the same thing for the social media so let's make the word at Sunny numb not a link some do an anchor tag a a trap with the link HTTP colon slash slash ee ee twitter.com slash none of them goes there with the double quote and then let's close the ink attack okay and then here remember we want to open up in a new window then we do target equals underscored link save it refresh it and now we want to click on this link right here it should take me to my Twitter account cool Oh notifications okay we do the same thing and I copy and paste in this in for my github page so instead of Tariq on it'll be github.com slash sudden number and this anchored this closing tag should not be here it should be right save it refresh it and now this is also a link cool and then what else should we do please slow down please please please I'm sorry we're we're a little bit out of time so I'm really hoping my bad I went over a little bit yeah it's okay it's okay but I'm sorry hmmm somebody tried to face look now and I get on Facebook let's see so let me take a look at the webpage it okay looks pretty neat it's a good start in the next lesson next breakout session you'll learn something called CSS and that's where you'll learn how to style this make this more pretty maybe add a background color change the font and so on okay yeah and then cool yeah I think this should be post on YouTube I'm not a hundred percent sure I'm so please check back on the YouTube page maybe in a week if not it'll be emailed actually the recording Mike told me if the recording is going to be ready next week mmhmm and then you'll all get if you registered of course everyone did here you'll get an email and it'll send you right to this recording so if you didn't catch everything that's okay you'll have a chance to redo it on the recording and then of course follow along with learn HTML on the site Mike the Jeff so net yeah just one that we should be the recording should be out Tuesday just need a couple days to get everything together but I will email everybody who attended yeah and if you didn't quite get to making vs code or um adding this on your own locally on your own computer that's okay you got to see at least like a real developer in action and seeing what like kind of the workflow looks like overall and and what's possible yeah I can post this so check out my github page maybe later today I'll post the code there you'll see should be a new repo just enjoy no no we have three more minutes so please ask us any questions before we yeah all right thanks thanks thank you for for watching yeah it's all yeah I mean we're it's definitely an interesting time for for for the whole world yeah you know everything's kind of on pause right now nobody really knows where everything is heading to so it means things like this made me have something to look forward to so we're in the same situations as everybody watching right we're all stuck in our homes I think it's a great time to like reset to pick up coding if you weren't you know if you if you're like a workaholic an you want take a break I think it's a great time to take a break if you you know feeling like you want to you know get started with you know some things this is also a great time to do so yeah and really sorry again for for blazing through the the project which we had a little bit more time but hello so yeah if you stick around in the next two minutes give yourself a little stretch break will Pat the back for getting through this first 90 minutes and mike is gonna share a link to or you know what you can just access it I'm gonna post it on the right now on the chat your goes there it is that news
