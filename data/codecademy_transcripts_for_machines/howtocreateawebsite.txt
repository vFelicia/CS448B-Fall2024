what is up everybody I am Brendon I'm a fullstack developer based in Brooklyn New York and today I'm going to be walking you through how to create a website so I'm going to be showing you how to set up the structure of our website we're gonna cover the relationship between a URL and a web browser I'm gonna add some content to our website and then show you how to view your website in the web browser and then at the very end I'll show you what you can build when you add a tiny little bit of CSS to our website so let's jump in okay let's start off by making sure you have a text editor installed you think of a text editor as the microsoft word for code it's a piece of software that serves is the environment in which you write and manipulate code if you don't have one installed I'd recommend you head to code Visual Studio com to download the Visual Studio code or vs code for short text editor it's a completely free download and it is available on every operating system out there now there are a bunch of different text editors out there there's sublime there's atom which I've used in the past I'm sure there's others floating out there they all basically accomplish the same thing so you do you but I'm going to use vs code for this tutorial so once that's downloaded go ahead and open up vs code the first thing we need to do is create an outer directory to house our project directory is just another word for a folder once we create that directory we can then create an HTML file that will serve as the home page for our website now there are a few ways of creating this folder and file if you're feeling comfortable with the command line I challenge you to use it if you don't know what the command line is we offer a course on code Academy that teaches you how to use it and I'll include a link to that course in the description below but for this tutorial I'm going to assume that you don't know the command line and I'm just going to use the standard way of creating a folder in file I'm going to be using my trackpad and the text editor user interface enough Jib jabbing let's start doing something so I'm going to click the file option at the top of my window then click open I'm going to navigate to a special folder I've already created reserved for all of my code Academy related projects code Academy and then I'm going to click this new folder button at the bottom right here I'm sorry to bottom left and I'm gonna call this folder hello underscore HTML so create that and then I'm gonna open it and cool so I've got my folder opened here next let's add our HTML file I'm going to call this one index dot HTML notice how this file ends in a dot HTML if you're writing some CSS or some JavaScript you would instead use a dot CSS or a J yes for JavaScript and that goes for whatever language you're writing in now why have I called this file index dot HTML whenever you make a website it's best practice to name the homepage of your website index because web browsers have been built to expect an index.html file as the home page of a website also other developers will know exactly where to look to find your home page because it's the industry standard to use index so I'm going to hit enter and you'll see the index.html file is automatically opened up on the right side of our screen here and we can start putting some code inside that file ok so let's add some HTML boilerplate now every HTML file requires some starter code in order for web browsers to be able to read it this is what's referred to as boilerplate now there's actually two ways to do this the first is using the built in HTML boilerplate templates included in our text editor I'm using vs code so depending on which text editor you're using this may or may not be an option for you but I'm going to type HTML and then you'll see a bunch of different HTML boilerplate options I'm actually going to navigate down to the third one and what I'm going to do is I'm going to hit enter and boom I've got my boilerplate ready to go if your text editor does not have this option you can go over to this article on code Academy comm and copy the template we've included here and paste it back in your HTML file now don't worry I'll include a link to that article in the description below both of these options worked fine though I'm actually just going to keep that first one I had now before we start adding content to our website one thing I'd like to point out is the fact that every HTML file has two main sections the head and the body the head section is reserved for things that are not important for humans things like linking to CSS stylesheets or JavaScript scripts there is one exception however and that's the title tag that you see up here this is the name of the tab you see from the web browser so if you notice up here it says how to create a website that is completely controlled in the title which is relevant to humans because you know when you're viewing tabs you're like Oh which one's open on here HTML tutorial BAM got it but anyway the body is reserved for the actual content of the site things that humans actually see like text images links and videos etc now what I like to do is indent the head and body section like this so that I can clearly see they're enclosed in HTML tags again you don't need to do this but it just helps me for my eyes so I can clearly see that you know everything is enclosed in this HTML tag and I've got my main head and then I've got my main body section right here let's actually start adding some things to our website inside the body section let's create a heading I'm going to add in h1 and then hit tab and what v/s code is going to do is it's automatically going to create an opening and closing h1 tag the H in h1 stands for heading there are actually six other heading tags there's h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 and h6 the numbers correspond to how important the heading is in regards to SEO one being the most important and six being the least when you start playing with HTML you'll eventually realize that h1 tags automatically get assigned at the largest text size compared to the other heading tags so h2 would be a little smaller than h1 h3 would be a little smaller than h2 and definitely smaller than h1 and so on and so on ok so let's put some text in between these tags so I'm going to put howdy folks it's everyone's favorite entertainer dot dot okay and I'm gonna save that really quickly I use the command I'm on Mac command s and we have that saved and we are good to go and finally we've got a website with some actual content now you might be wondering how do we view this website we apparently created well how would you view any website you'd open up a web browser and enter a URL in the address bar to go to that site for example let's go to code Academy dotcom slash learn slash learn dot each night dot HTML okay so we're looking at the HTML file for the learn HTML section of the code Academy site first things first let's talk about the URL I just entered itself because I bet you didn't know this so the URL which stands for Uniform Resource locator it's just a path to a specific file in this case we're currently looking at the learn HTML resource which is inside the learn directory located on code Academy comm server hence code Academy com slash learn the directory slash learn HTML the actual resource or file we want to look at therefore the structure of the URL is much more descriptive than you think now with this context a web browser is simply a piece of software that can interpret and render HTML files just like how you'd use a media player to listen to music or Microsoft Word to read and edit a dot doc file so if a URL is just an address to a specific file or resource on your computer it seems to reckon that we can use a web browser to even view a resource on our own computer so let's look back at our text editor and try and piece together the URL for our index.html file we know based on this navigation bar over here that our index.html file is located in our hello HTML folder and if you remember from the beginning I had placed this folder inside my codecademy folder so so far our URL looks like this and this is not valid HTML code by the way but I just want to show you here so the URL currently looks like this so code Academy folder and we placed the hello HTML folder inside that inside that is this file that we're currently writing in index dot HTML however I know that this is not the full picture of the actual address of this index.html file because the computer I'm on has multiple accounts on it meaning that this file is likely located in another file that represents my account which contains all of my folders and files and none of anyone else's so let me show you a cool trick here I'm gonna right click on index dot HTML and click on the copy path option I'm going to paste that and you'll see here something very interesting notice how there's a user's folder and inside that a Brenden folder and then inside that codecademy folder inside that hello HTML folder and finally inside that the index.html file this is the full path of this index dot HTML resource located on my computer and let me just get rid of this for now actually let's comment it out I'm gonna hit command forward slash and command forward slash and that has been officially commented out meaning it's not going to throw any errors when we go and try and reload this page okay so let's add a new tab here and then I'm going to paste that path that I had copied before and boom we've got our website now I want to point out the difference between the URL we just pasted and the one we were looking at before this one is considered a local URL because it points to a specific file located on my computer that means it's local whereas the codecademy one let me open that up over here this one is considered a remote URL because it's a path to a file on a remote computer Codecademy comms computer you'll also notice that the remote URL is prepended by the letters HTTPS here HTTP stands for hypertext Transfer Protocol secure which is the special series of hoops your web browser must go through in order to request data from someone else's computer but don't worry web browsers automatically handle all of this hoop jumping underneath the hood so you don't have to worry about it now back on our website you might notice something annoyingly obvious our web site doesn't look that good mean it's a little too plain vanila you know unfortunately we can't handle any styling through HTML that's actually where CSS comes to play and at the end of this video I'll actually show you another version of the site that illustrates what you can accomplish with CSS but for now it would be sweet if we had an actual image to go along with this h1 tag we created to show off everyone's favorite entertainer so let's add an image to our website so to add an image I am going to hit enter and then I'm going to type the letters IMG and then hit tab you'll notice a few things that stick out about this HTML element first there is no closing tag and there's honestly a bunch of different HTML tags that don't require closing tags luckily I don't have to memorize the ones that don't because my text editor knows it for me but second there's some text that comes after the letters IMG the one we're going to be using is SRC short for source so whatever URL of an image we supply to this SRC attribute will be rendered on our website as an image so I've got a picture of my favorite entertainer over here not Drake Gris and I'm gonna copy that URL sorry Drake I mean I love you but come on it's gritty so I'm going to copy that URL go back to the text editor and paste it in between the quotation marks of that SRC attribute paste so I'm going to command S Save come back over to our web browser refresh that tab and boom gritty in all his glory alright so that's it for our website again it's certainly not the most aesthetically pleasing website in the world but at least it's something but before we go I want to show you what you can accomplish with some CSS so I've added a little bit of CSS to my old website and you can see how much of a difference it is I mean this compared to this it's like night and day I've got my navbar I've got my button when you hover over it the style changes and it just I mean it looks like a legitimate website so this is what it looks like when you combine HTML with just a little bit of CSS already folks so that is how you create a website in a nutshell we did a lot today we set up the structure of our website using our text editors user interface we the HTML boilerplate code to the index.html file we then use the web browser to view that file we talked about the differences between a remote URL and a local URL we talked about HTTP which is the protocol web browsers used to view data located on someone else's computer we then added some content to our website including an image of gritty and at the very end I showed you what you could accomplish formatting slash style wise with a little bit of CSS so that is it for this walkthrough and I will see you in the next one bye
