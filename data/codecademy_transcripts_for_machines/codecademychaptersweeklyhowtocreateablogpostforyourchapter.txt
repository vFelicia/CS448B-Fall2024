bring you this quick tip on a whole new feature thanks new york city a whole new feature that you can use is a very user called the blog a blog totally old school right but actually totally awesome so here i am on the community.academy.com page i'm going to say let's take a look at the rio de janeiro chapter for a pretty good example of how to use a blog so oops scrolling down scrolling down we have a meet up on the fourth a past meetup organizer and all the way at the bottom this is where the blog will show up if you use it so i think a blog is a really good way to give a prospective member an idea of what your blog is about or alternatively like lucas did and for this chapter it's a pretty cool way of doing a recap a writeup of each meetup and you can share it via blog um it's one of the most straightforward ways that you can let someone know what your chapter is up to or what you care about or what your members are saying so how to do it well you will start by number one going to discord or via email letting mike or me or a community manager codecademy know that this is something that you'd like to do and after you've let us know we'll give you permissions from the back end and then you'll hop into your dashboard you'll see the button right up here and you'll create a draft after creating a draft you can save it to preview it and then hit submit after hitting submit mike or i will see it and we'll give it a two thumbs up and you'll have a blog post on your meetup page i hope this was helpful i think blogs are awesome i think they're a really great way of showing members who come to your page what you're all about and i look forward to seeing some of your drafts thanks so much have a great week
