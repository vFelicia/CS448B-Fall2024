hi I'm Sarah from code Academy and today we're going to talk about a fundamental concept in computer science loop's life like programming is full of repeating routines and sub routines every day we wake up and brush our teeth we don't just brush one tooth we rushed each tooth in our mouth until we've brushed all of our teeth in programming when we know we're gonna use a routine again it's good practice to put that routine into a function so that we can reuse it when we want to repeat a function or subroutine multiple times in a row we can use loops the other day I wrote some instructions for frosting a cupcake and put them in a handy function frost cupcakes so that I could reuse them whenever I needed say I need to frost three cupcakes in a row okay no problem I can just call my function three times right but what if I needed to frost five ten or even a thousand cupcakes here's where a loop saves the day a loop allows you to continually execute the same code multiple times or loop through a routine until a stopping condition is met there are different types of loops and each programming language has their own syntax but all loops have one thing in common a stopping condition this condition is checked every round and the loop will continue to run until the condition is reached if our goal was to frost four cupcakes the loop stopping condition would specify to continue to frost cupcakes until four cupcakes have been frosted so our loop would run frost cupcakes four times giving us four fully frosted cupcakes loops allow us to tell the computer where to start and provide a condition upon which to stop all in a few easy to read lines of code which is super sweet
