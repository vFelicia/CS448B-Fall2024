hey everybody if we haven't yet met my name is alisa vigil and i'm community manager with codecademy working to serve you our chapter leaders so today's video is on how to avoid being locked out of your own event it's happened twice and it was really awful and terrible for the poor chapter leader who got caught in the situation thankfully for the second one that happened we were able to get in there first but the the point is nobody should have to deal with this so today we're going to do a little demo on how to make sure that you can not get locked out of your own event on the day of so here i am i'm sharing my screen this is where you'll see the name of your chapter and then any live events will be under events tab hooray it's here three dots gets us to edit your event we are not interested with general info we are not interested with sponsors and partners the magic slash nightmare is happening under rsvps okay here we go looks totally normal we're gonna have you know 50 people oh wait what is this settings thing right here click on it it looks like it should be absolutely nothing but it actually is hiding some really incredibly important boxes over here so what i've done is i've set the availability to end in until 30 minutes into the start of my event and that is so anybody can still access including me up until 30 minutes into my event if we don't set this it's unclear right now if you're gonna get locked out of your own event so it's really important to when setting your event up on your rsvps tab that like third modal and event setup click on this b9 looking little settings button and set your availability end into 30 minutes into your actual event now just to make sure that we're actually all good here i'm going to close this and go to publish super important to make sure that we've saved all changes there and events back here we are going to preview our event page ah availability ends on october 23rd which is the day that it's happening and we've set the time for 30 minutes into the start of the event again this video is on how to not get locked out of your own event in the moments before it's going to happen because that's really scary and really avoidable thank you for watching have a great day
