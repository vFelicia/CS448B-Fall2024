should be working think that we are live um but as per usual we will just give it a minute to get things set up um let us know in the chat if you are there uh we're we're keeping an eye on the youtube chat so if you're watching from a different streaming service we might not see your messages so come on over to youtube if you'd like to talk to us throughout the stream for those that haven't watched before i'm sophie and this is jamie who's going to be joining me today walking through some hypothesis testing for associations we're really excited to get started i think ooh select star from awesomeness i like it yeah that's what we're going for uh on this kind of where i am it's a little bit cloudy and i don't know i'm ready for some some fun coding together cool so it seems like people can see us and we might as well get started because we've got a lot of material to get through today i don't know how much of it we will actually get through um so with that i will share my screen so if you do have one question from the chat did she break alex after last week no i i don't think i broke alex alex could live stream all day long if if somebody would allow him um but we wanted oops that is not what i meant to share um we wanted to uh mix it up a little bit jamie also very much enjoys live streaming so um and he is also helping me with some of the master statistics uh phase two work right now so um so yeah we're we're all uh kind of running this live stream series together me alex and jamie and we're excited to have jamie today i'm excited to be here yeah and alex is in the chat confirming that i didn't break him so all right let's get started um so this week we're actually going to be returning to a data set that we used earlier in this series so this is i think it's the first data set we actually use it's the heart disease data set so as a quick reminder this is a set of data for a sample of patients who were screened for heart disease and some information about those patients was collected um and we're gonna focus in on a smaller subset of that larger data set that we looked at in the first week and so for this week we're just going to look at a few of the variables um and we're going to see if we can try to understand the relationship between each of those variables and this heart disease variable which indicates whether or not a patient was ultimately diagnosed with heart disease um i see yeah i see some people from various places in the chat and i see a question what do you do when you don't work on data um i i mean i don't know i feel like there maybe there's two ways to interpret that question but i feel like we're all just working on data all the time data is everywhere um anyway so basically similar questions to what we were looking at the last time jamie was on um so i think the last time jane jamie was on we were talking or actually maybe two times ago we were talking about uh relationships between variables and we looked at some plots and we looked at some summary statistics like correlation or um a difference in means and in that case we were looking at a data set and calculating summary statistics for that exact data set but in this lesson we're going to start talking about hypothesis testing for an association and the reason why this is a little bit different is that in this example we have this sample um here i'll actually run some of this code so that you can see uh we can take a look at the info actually see how many rows there are um right so there's 303 uh patients in this data set so we could calc or we could look at this data set and understand the relationships between different variables so we could understand like are there more males or females who are diagnosed with heart disease or do people who are diagnosed with heart disease in this data set tend to have higher cholesterol or something like that um for today though we're not interested in just this data set we're actually gonna be trying to think about how this data set can tell us something about heart disease more generally so we're going to kind of open things up and say like based off of this data we're going to imagine that this data is randomly sampled so these people were randomly sampled from the general population we're going to say based on this data can we understand what predictors are or what variables what things about a person are most predictive of whether or not they're diagnosed with heart disease out in the world not just in this data set cool um great so i see there's a question about what kind of data is this um this is well i'm going to answer that two ways so this is a tabular data set um in its format so jamie do you want to discuss really quickly what tabular data is um so yeah tabular data is basically just data that is in table form as we see here so each column represents a variable in the data set so we have age sex trust bps called you know just like a bunch of different columns and then the values within the columns like are part of like each of these variables so some of the variables in this data set are categorical and some of them are quantitative um so for example um i think like one of the columns that we're going to look at here is going to be that i might pronounce this wrong style yeah memes are really bad so i think this is uh foul so sal refers to the heart and then this is short for achieved um because it's related to like the heart rate that you achieve during an exercise test um yeah we'll go over the exact meaning but exactly so the the tabular tabular data is just data that's arranged in rows and columns and then kind of the next level down in terms of what kind of data this is is it's being stored as a csv file um which is just a common format for storing tabular data but there's lots of other ones that we could read in cool so i think let's get started um i'm gonna kind of walk through some examples of tests and then even though this is not in the stats path i think we're gonna do some simulations of tests too because i think i think it's fun and it helps us understand so um the first thing i want to do is let's let's take a look at some of the quantitative variables so things like we'll go through what they all are so we've got age which is just the age of the person in years trest bps is um i believe a blood pressure reading at rest so bps is blood pressure and t rest is yeah um i think blood pressure at rest uh call is cholesterol levels we're gonna ignore these two i think if you joined in the first serie or first session you'll see these are actually categorical variables and then we'll focus on val achieved or heart rate that's achieved during in exercise tests yeah okay we have a um another question that i think will be of interest to you in the chat so someone asked when inspecting associations at this level can we talk about predicting as in flagging which variable is predicting watch yeah so i think it's really i'm not sure if i fully understand the question so if i don't ask or if i don't answer it to uh to the degree that you're hoping then definitely let me know and i can try again um but i think it's interesting to actually think about the difference between looking at an association and figuring out whether you can use that association to make a prediction um and so if you see an association in the data um it doesn't necessarily mean that one thing causes another and it doesn't tell you about why it doesn't tell you anything about the why um for that association so one piece of the complicate or one piece of complication is that if you really want to make any sort of inference about causality like if you lower your cholesterol you'll be less likely to get be diagnosed with heart disease or something that kind of that kind of research requires a diff requires focus on the the design of the experiment not the actual analysis so much i mean the analysis piece too but you can't really answer those causal questions with simple methods unless you have set up the experiment to do so um but then there's the next piece which is that it's a different problem to try to like set up a predictive um model for example of who's gonna be diagnosed with heart disease based off these factors than it is to look at each individual variable separately um we we definitely have some upcoming new content on predictive models which i think will be hopefully useful to people um but yeah we can definitely look at flagging like thinking about which of these variables for example is most predictive of heart disease um so i'm gonna do what the way i'm gonna do this to start is i'm gonna use that same like group by function that we used earlier earlier on when we were talking about summary statistics so what i'm gonna do is i'm going to group my data set by um heart disease so whether or not someone has heart disease and then i'm just going to calculate the mean of those like by those groups for each of the quantitative variables cool so um looking at this i don't know jamie do you wanna uh talk about any of this like what do you see here we can kind of ignore these two um and focus on the other four so i guess i just like looked for like mean differences across each of the columns so i think the one that sticks out to me the most is uh i still don't remember how the the thalak i'll call it that um the one column on the far right so there seems to be a pretty big mean difference um when heart disease is absent versus present so that might be like one i want to that i would want to analyze and then also the cholesterol level column also seems to be a pretty big mean difference um like when heart disease is present present there seems to be uh there are like when heart disease is present like there's seems to be a higher average level of cholesterol um and then age and the i think the resting blood pressure column like there's also like a somewhat noticeable mean difference so like those are all columns that we might want to analyze to see if there actually is truly a mean difference across these variables for sure yeah so it looks like there's differences across the board but as jamie pointed out some of them are definitely bigger than others so we see like the biggest difference here um and we can also do this for median if we wanted here i'll actually just grab this it might look a little different i'm not sure i think honestly so interesting so for median it's the same median resting blood pressure for the two groups even though it's slightly different here so that's interesting and the median age difference is actually even larger than yeah and that's interesting cool um i think beyond just looking at these pictures it's useful to actually or these tables it's actually useful to look at a picture so um there's a few different options for pictures that we could look at but i find that a box plot is really useful so let's do that let's do it for i think what did i do in the final i did val achieved or that lock i of course she chose the most complicated sounding one um so let's do that so we're gonna do um x equals heart dot um val oh no heart disease and y equals right so we see that differential even more clearly we see that val achieved is is higher for people who have no heart disease or who are not diagnosed with heart disease so basically people taking this exercise test they can get a higher heart their heart rate up higher if they don't have heart disease if they do have heart disease it seems like there's some sort of limit um or a lower limit to how high they can get their heart rate during this test so that's interesting so like i said before i think the next question and actually i think let's pick one that is closer which one was close trest bps maybe yeah it's pretty close it had the same medium so right so let's see t rest bps so here's one right where when we looked at the means so let's scroll up for a second looked at the means it seems like blood pressure resting blood pressure was slightly higher for people who had who were diagnosed with heart disease like very very slightly higher mean not even a slightly higher median and when we look at this box plot we kind of see what that looks like it seems like there's a larger range maybe for um resting blood pressure among people with heart disease but for the most part right like these these boxes look pretty close together and the question is is this result like if we found a hundred thousand more people and we collected their resting blood pressure and then we've recorded whether or not they were diagnosed with heart disease down the line if we did this for a hundred thousand more people or a million more people would this picture still look like this would there still be a difference in the means uh what they're not is this just a result of random chance in the same way that we talked about the binomial test and same thing here right like it's possible that there's just a difference between these two groups because of the random sample that we chose i don't know what do you think jamie do you think that this big of a difference could be due to randomness um i think less likely for like the these two box blocks i also think it depends on like the size of the sample so like depending on like 303 yeah with like 303 different data points i think that there clearly is like and this like it seems like there definitely is an association for the thalak group um but for like the resting bps i feel like this one is like requires like more analysis to see like is there actually you know like is there actually like some sort of something going on here between the resting blood pressure and like whether or not heart disease is present yeah totally i i tend to agree with you um so i think with that let's let's jump into try to trying to simulate how we would do it how we would run a hypothesis test here because i actually think you know i think two sample ttests are probably the most commonly used hypothesis test and a lot of people don't know how it works underneath the hood so i think you you all will be really benefited by hopefully seeing this at least once so let's let's give it a try first thing i want to think about is if we're running a hypothesis test we have to start with a null and alternative hypothesis so i'm going to switch to markdown we're going to write out our null and alternative hypotheses really quickly so start with the null jamie what do you think the null hypothesis test is going to be so again what we're trying to understand is is whether um this difference or this difference in group means is going to be true of the whole population so like if we're trying to come up with standards in the in the usa or maybe global standards for um what predicts heart disease or what is associated with heart disease um we want to know if this kind of a mean difference that we're seeing here is going to persist for that larger group so null hypothesis so i would say the null would be that there is no that like there is um no difference um so basically that the like there would be no um mean difference in are we doing uh here uh there's no difference should we choose one that's a little bit easier let's choose let's actually look at what did i do earlier today because i thought that was a good example let's do trest bps let's do the resting blood pressure one yeah so for doing uh resting blood pressure it would be that there's no difference in resting blood pressure between patients who have heart disease and who don't have heart disease great okay so and i'm gonna add just one word you might have said this and i just didn't catch it but for the two sample t tests we specifically compare sample means instead of medians um but you could do you could run a test to compare sample medians if you wanted to so here that sounds good to me there's no difference in mean resting blood pressure among patients who do and do not have heart disease well what would be the test you'd run for uh median differences would it be like a similar ttest type thing or is it like called so to be honest you'd probably have uh there's there might be a test but you would probably the only way i can think of to do it is by running this kind of simulation that we're about like building out yourself um because i don't know what the null distribution would be off the top of my head probably look it up um yeah that's a great question i actually don't know that the answer if you if you know the answer to that in the chat then definitely let us know um okay and then the alternative could be one of ver various two different things or various things three different things i guess um let's actually look at the one we haven't looked at a box plot for resting blood pressure let's do that oh no we did we did oh it's here sorry um okay so we we have this here we've seen that um in our in our mean differences that people who had heart disease had slightly higher uh resting blood pressure but the medians were the same and the there's a fair amount of overlap here so let's say our alternative hypothesis is that there is a difference in me and resting blood pressure among patients who do and don't have heart disease cool um okay so with that lined up let's run this um so remember that the thing that we need in order to run a hypothesis test is we need to use the null hypothesis to generate what's called a null distribution so another way of writing this null hypothesis is saying that and i'll actually write it down another way of saying this is that the true mean resting blood pressure of people with heart disease minus the true mean resting blood pressure of people without heart disease equals zero so basically the difference in the mean blood pressures for people with and without heart disease is zero is basically what this null hypothesis is saying i remember writing that a lot um when i took ap statistics yeah it was like for sure classic way to start like the classic yeah usually with like the the greek mew which is i i always loved writing out that greek you because i like it was like the first time i like was using those fancy symbols so fancy um yeah so okay so keeping this in mind right basically what we're going to want to do in order to run a hypothesis test to test this is we're going to want to say okay let's imagine that the true mean between these two things is zero let's generate let's imagine that we took random samples with that with the true mean being zero the true mean difference being zero calculate the mean difference for each of those samples and look at what that distribution looks like that's our null distribution and then we're going to look at the observed mean difference that we got and see where it falls in that distribution so let's like let's actually think this through because i think there's different ways to simulate all these different hypothesis tests and i feel like this one is really fun so jamie do you have any ideas and this is this is a tricky question and i also will ask it of everyone in the chat if you are if you're coding along with us or watching along with us feel free to answer this as well so we have this data set right with um with information for each person i'll reprint it um about whether or not they have heart disease and what their resting blood pressure was do you have any ideas jamie or audience how we could simulate a situation where there's really no difference between the resting blood pressure of people with and without heart disease using this data kind of a hard question i'm gonna just like um so if you want to take like i'm guessing you want to take like random samples like from the data set but you want to make sure like those random samples like don't have a mean difference um yeah really like it's actually like a really fun a fun trick um i'll give you a hint and no nobody from the chat has yet been brave enough so we'll keep we'll keep going with the suspense for a second um it has to do with this heart disease column we're going to do something to this heart disease column oh are you just gonna like randomly assign each like could you basically just like randomly assign things absent and present so basically instead of like actually being associated correctly it's just like random yeah so the mean difference will go to zero exactly so part of the assumption if there's an association here is that whether or not someone has heart disease is gonna somehow impact what their resting blood pressure is so each like row kind of goes together right and the way that we're gonna simulate the null hypothesis is we're gonna break that we're gonna say okay each row doesn't go together anymore this is just a list of resting blood pressures and this this column just tells us how many people have blood pressure and how many people don't but we're gonna kind of i mean we could do this without permuting this without missing this mixing this around by using um like a probability like a sampled probability and use like the probability that you do or don't have heart disease to resample this for everyone but it's easier to just do it by basically taking this column sorry just the heart disease column mixing it around randomly and then recalculating the difference in means for that simulated simulated data set where the simulated data set is our original data set where we just broke the any possible association between these two things that's really cool yeah so let's let's walk through how to do that kind of piece by piece so um first let's just walk through how we would move this um how we would permute this heart disease column so i'm going to just like write this out so i'm going to call this scrambled and we're going to take basically before i call it anything we'll just do this out so i like this numpy.random.sam function and it takes a couple of different parameters the first one is just the thing that we want to sample from so we're going to sample from heart dot heart disease now how many values jamie do you think are we going to sample um the same like number of data points are in the data set yeah exactly so we're going to sample everything in this in this column um so i'm just going to do like blend heart which is going to be 303 and then we want replace equal to what jamie uh so we probably don't want to put like when we take when we sample a data point we probably don't want to return it yeah i mean no you definitely could do sampling with replacement i believe that's called like a bootstrap don't quote me on that because i think that's right um like a bootstrapped sample pretty sure that's right um so you definitely could do that but in this case if we really just want to take all these take this whole com column and randomly rearrange it we'll do replace equals false so basically we're just like we're putting all of these absences and presences in a bucket and we're randomly choosing one at a time and then the first one we choose will be first the second one we choose will be second and so on and we're going to choose all of them again but we're just randomly when we are randomly choosing them we're randomly choosing the order that they're gonna be in whoop and clearly i did something wrong is this no let's see what i did in my example code you might need to specify or replace if it's not necessarily oh you already did specify replacements oh i think it's dot choice not dots yes all right guys okay so there we go we see now this has been reordered um so before the first ones were absence presence presence absence absence now we've got absence presence absence absence absence so a little bit of a reordering and the entire this entire column has basically been reordered so i'm going to do is i'm going to save that as scramble so that's my scrambled heart disease um output whoops some for some reason this jupiter notebook when i zoom in i like can't put my cursor at the end um okay so the next thing we're gonna do is we're going to use that scramble version to recalculate a difference in means so we're going to say okay now we're going to make our simulated trest bps for people with heart disease we're going to set that equal to heart.t rest bps but we're going to take just the resting blood pressures where scram the scrambled heart diseases are equal to presence so i think you have a tiny typo on the secondly i think it's i think it's bps not bsp good catch um okay and then i'll copy that and we're gonna do for no heart disease it's where our scrambled is equal to absence and then sim mean diff is going to be the difference in means between those two so it's going to be mean of this minus mean of this um so i see as we're doing this i see a question asking is this a statistical class or python um it's actually kind of both it's really a stats class um but we're using python so if you want to also get comfortable with python i think this is a great way to do it especially if what you're interested in is stats or data analysis or data science this is a great way to also learn python and then um and then i also see a question about using jupyter notebook versus another ide definitely you can use any ide that you would like uh we've been using jupyter notebook just because it is a really nice way to save your code and output in one go but oops i'm not paying attention but you can definitely copy this code over to any ide that you're comfortable with and then run it also if you have a codecademy subscription then you can for sure um do do this in our learning environment this is actually based on a project that we currently have and you think upcoming hopefully soon is a sandbox learning environment that you can use so i'll actually send that project to the chat so people can see it nice okay so in this example um just to recap what we did we scrambled absence and presence and then given those new scrambled absences and presences we recalculated a mean difference and in this case that mean difference for people with simulated or scrambled absence of heart disease versus presence of heart disease that mean difference was negative 3.5 in this simulated sample and if we do it again we'll get a different number now it's closer to zero right now it's positive so we'll get slightly different numbers each time and what we can do is we can actually put this inside of a for loop so that we repeat it and grab these numbers each time so i'm gonna just create a null mean diff uh empty list and then repeat this a thousand times unfortunately tab everything and then what i'm going to do is in this last line instead of printing it i'm going to take null mean diff and append that simulated mean def onto the end and then so that we can take a look at it i'm gonna plot this well i see a question about or someone said i'm learning r now i love r if you are learning r that makes me happy because it's just great i've gotten so used to python now at this point that's also exciting for me but yeah r was technically the first language i learned because i used it like a tiny bit in high school once but then i like went to learn python in college because that's what all my classes used so now yeah it's all if i know that much are left what your class is or what your um or what your work uses in the end um okay so jamie do you want to kind of walk through this picture like what do you notice about this picture and is it what you expected it to be so it's centered around zero and it's like pretty much an approximately a normal distribution um and we should we should expect to see it centered around zero because of what we did in the beginning where we tried to basically make it so that when we took like when we took samples from the like our data set we you know like scrambled the absence and presence values to make it so that you know it would come out as a mean difference of zero um and basically what we see right now is like just a thousand samples of that i think it was a thousand right and just like plotted so yeah and i think because of what we did the way we played with the data we this is what we should see yep exactly so right so it's centered at zero exactly like jamie said because we simulated our data set so that the mean difference would be zero by essentially breaking the association between those two columns um cool uh i see a quick question how long does it take for a beginner to learn python or any other language i think it's a slow process i'm still learning for sure and as you learn more languages you get faster at learning new ones but for a beginner you know you can definitely get off the ground pretty quickly and then it's just a continual uh learning experience to be honest for years and years especially because they change everything so quickly so okay so this is our null distribution and now let's actually plot our observed uh mean difference onto this distribution so remember let's actually calculate that uh we'll calculate it down here down here so our true observed mean difference was mp.mean of heart dot uh t rest bps among heart dot heart disease equal equal uh presence actually i should break this out so that we can all see it so basically what i'm doing here is i'm saying in the actual data what's the observed mean difference so this is the t rest bps for people who have heart disease and then we can pull out the true blood pressure of people who don't have heart disease and then gosh i can't spell today and then we can take the mean difference between them right and and then i didn't print it so this we could have gotten from the table up above but our true mean difference between these two was 5.32 so in reality there's about a 5.32 point difference in mean blood progressing blood pressure for people with and without heart disease so let's plot that as a vertical line on this graph so it's going to be um plt.ax line x equals this and color we'll make it uh and we see that this is pretty far out to the right we could have seen that before drawing the line too we see that if there's really no association um that big of a mean difference is pretty unlikely it's definitely not unheard of but it's actually pretty unlikely which is a little bit surprising like given how close those two boxes were but i guess the sample size is pretty big and then if we want to actually calculate how many are outside of this what we can do is we can use our same trip trick from before we can take the sum of all of these values in the null distribution and we have to turn them into a numpy array first so our remember all the values in this null distribution are called null mean diff so we're going to say how many of these values are greater than the observed mean difference um in our sample and that comes out to there are three and then the pvalue remember is the proportion so we did this a thousand times i guess instead of hard coding this i can say len of this so that's about .003 and remember that this is a onesided pvalue the twosided pvalue we draw a line that's equally distant on the other side and also include the area to the left of that which theoretically this thing should be symmetrical so it should be roughly equal so the twosided pvalue would be roughly two times that that would be roughly this times two and now we can actually compare this so there's a builtin function for running a um or there's a there are a lot of functions that you could use for running a twosample ttest i'm gonna grab one um that i've used before from scipi uh sorry i see this is an example of always learning right i don't have this memorized of um like which is the best function to use i gotta find it okay well there we go so we can also run this um but instead of sal achieved we want the um we want t rest bps for people with heart disease and then t rest pps for no heart disease let's see print p val and it's about .08 so our simulation slightly underestimated this but if we run it again we might get closer or if we run it more times let's try that one yeah so that time we got .008 so almost the same as what we got for the ttest that's housed within scipi um i'm just taking a look at the chat really quickly um are there any other questions i see there's someone who said they didn't get a reply was that was there a question in here or was that one an earlier or was that a different comment um i think i'm answering uh his question right now because it's the most recent one someone also asked um a question about r and i sent them something but i'm not sure if you have a quick answer yeah someone asked about the pipe uh at some point hopefully i would love to do a live stream on r and the pipe uh function because it's great um i see a question two sample ttest does this refer to the two subsets of binary categories grouped within the data set absolutely yeah so two a two sample ttest is really we're kind of treating these two things those are two samples um and they're we're thinking of them as independent samples so there's a group of people that have heart disease and that's one of the samples and then a group of people that don't have heart disease that's our other sample and we're comparing our sample means um it's called a ttest because this distribution is theoretically a student t distribution it's actually theoretically a normal distribution but the student t distribution is really similar to the normal distribution and we use it a lot of times because um it's almost like a slightly slightly squished normal distribution it has thicker tails and so it overestimates the um it overestimates the pvalues like slightly which helps protect against errors so last week we were talking about hypothesis testing and errors and so that's why people use a t distribution student t distribution over a normal distribution for hypothesis testing but yeah we should get the same numbers cool um yeah so i see can we test for normality with the ttest um so if you're gonna if you want to test whether your data is normally distributed using a hypothesis test you would need a different hypothesis test but if you are asking whether um we could test against a normal distribution instead of a student t distribution the answer is yes so you could use like a two sample z test um you could basically use a z test for this as well and you would get the same answer basically um i hope yeah i hope that the screen isn't too blurry i'll try not to um scroll too fast so i wonder if that also causes it okay i also have another random question because yeah so this was the um this was like the variable where the mean difference was pretty small and the median difference was zero right does that mean if we did a median like if because like the sample median difference was zero would that mean if we like did a similar ttest style thing but with medians like we were describing earlier would we get a much different result from it probably yeah do you want to try it so let's let's just say we wanted to get a um a null distribution for the medians i'm just going to copy this down so we're gonna do exactly the same thing except we're just gonna calculate the median difference here instead of the mean and then append that and then we'll just a lot of histogram of this and show it really fast and we'll see yeah so basically it looks like this distribution we get is really we can add some more here i'm gonna reprint this with is it bins 50 oh wow wow yeah so basically what's happening is that the median and the simulated null distribution is almost always zero it's very rarely these other numbers so it's i guess hard to calculate a pvalue here based off of this simulation i don't know actually what this distribution should look like super interesting it's probably it's just a very condensed distribution like zero is by far the most common um yeah that's interesting so yeah so the p value i mean are observed mean median difference was zero so the p value would be like a hundred percent yeah the the pvalue would never be that small yeah yeah huh it's like so weird that the mean median would have like such a different like evaluation of the test yeah for sure and like i think the reason why people use the mean generally is that the central limit theorem applies which is to say that because we have we have the central limit theorem and this is getting into the weeds of things but right the expectation of a of a difference or of two random variables added together is just the the sum of the expectations so basically like the distribution i guess it doesn't matter so much expectation but basically if you have two normal distributions their sum is also normal so or their difference so basically like this is this is normally distributed and we know that it's normally distributed or student t distributed if we want to be conservative so it's it's very easy to run this test cool so we are also running pretty low on time um but i think it's worthwhile to just show since we spent most of the time on um on the ttest anyway let's see can i pull this over um if you look in the final code for this week you'll see that we did this for um for a few other variables and you'll see for example that um the pvalue for resting blood pressure was .008 for cholesterol i think it was even higher 0.139 um and if you look at i think i did the simulations out for a couple of them so this was the simulation that we just did this was a different simulation of the basically the same thing um i again got i think .008 um but if you sorry if you were to simulate out um with something where there's a more clear association so i think i did with an example with the chisquare test out here which is like this is my null distribution and this was my observed value then this is where you get like those super small p values like 0.00017 or something was one of them cool all right what do you think jamie i think we're gonna kind of run out of time so i'm just gonna run through really quickly some of the other tests that you can run and things that people might want to look into if they're interested in learning more about this so if you take this course on codecademy you're going to see a few other different types of hypothesis tests so you'll see something about the anova hypothesis test and tukey's range test which are useful when in our example before right we had a binary variable so again back to the two sample t test right we have we have either heart disease or no heart disease but what if we are instead interested in how that fall achieved or whatever the heart rate that you achieve is related to what kind of chest pain you have and there are actually four different kinds of chest pain not just two categories um so if you want a hypothesis test to understand whether there are differences between any of the pairs of these two categories right so there's a bunch of different pairings that you could make then you can run an anova test and you can then follow it up with tupi's range test which will tell you where those differences lie so in this example here's an example of a tukey's range test looking at the association between um type of chest pain and uh and val achieved and when we look at this output we see that there are significant differences between the asymptomatic group and every other group with respect to chest pain but there's no significant differences between the other groups so the true right means that the pvalue was small enough at a level of 0.05 to reject the null hypothesis and say that those two groups are statistically significantly different um and then we can see that in this picture right where the asymptomatic group has a lower vowel achieved than all of the other groups but the other groups seem pretty similar and then the other hypothesis test that's included in here is the chisquare test which is used for looking at an association between two categorical variables so in this case for example people who have and don't have heart disease and different types of chest pain so is there an association between whether someone has heart disease and what kind of chest pain they have and we can run that hypothesis test using a chisquare test and if you are interested i have included some questions or some examples at the end in the final code um that's available on github where i simulate a chisquare test so if you're interested in learning how to simulate a chisquare test you can look there essentially all it all it is is you say okay what proportion of people have heart disease i'm going to randomly assign whether or not someone has heart disease based on that proportion and then i'm going to randomly assign whether or not someone or what kind of chest pain someone has i'm going to randomly assign them separately we can even do exactly what we did before which is like randomly permute this row or this column of the data set and randomly permute this column of the data set recalculate the chisquare statistic every single time and look at that null distribution so um with that i think we have one minute left i'm looking at the chat to see if there's anything else i can adjust or address sorry sophie i did mention uh because someone's asking questions about like r and statistics based questions yeah item i did direct them to like the forums and mention that you like answering our questions about r and statistics yes definitely if you post in the forums you can definitely tag me i also um keep an eye on the forum questions but i think my tag is so summer three um i will i'll double check that uh but yeah definitely post in the forums i i check them and i love talking about stuff um i don't know off the top of my head what the shapiro test is i'm seeing this question about ttess versus shapiro let's look it up really fast oh foreign normality so oh shapiro wilkes test right so shapiro wilkes s is for testing whether a distribution is statistically significantly different from normal um so it's actually like i i've seen this used now that i'm seeing this i've seen this used to check assumptions for a model so for example if you are going to write up or try to design a predictive model in order to predict resting blood pressure based off of other characteristics um one of the assumptions is that resting blood pressure has to be normally distributed and so if we look at it best bps um it may or may not look normally distributed this doesn't really look normally distributed it looks kind of skewed and so then if you wanted to test is this is this significantly different from what a normal distribution would look like you could use the shapiro wilkes test the ttest is specifically testing for different mean differences between two groups so looking at an association between a quantitative outcome var or a quantitative variable and a binary categorical variable um okay well uh ed you can go back and uh hear my answer to your question hopefully cool so hopefully we got through all those questions if you have more i love hearing from you post on the videos in youtube post in the forums on codecademy talk to me tell me that you like these tell me that you hate them tell me what we can do better um these are really we hope that learners are getting something out of this and that we can have this kind of little community um i know both jamie and i and i know the same is true for alex we all love kind of having connections to everybody that is learning on our platform and we also are constantly learning ourselves so this is really fun for us to get to even though we're all kind of locked away in our houses um get to interact with you all and hopefully um learn from each other so cool well with that i hope everyone has a great rest of their tuesday thank you for letting me join thank you for joining thank you so much al alright thank you so much jamie
