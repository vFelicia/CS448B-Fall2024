I think for a lot of selftaught developers or career switchers or just people who don't have an advanced degree it can feel really daunting or just like totally Out Of Reach um so I was wondering like what are the most important skills for developers to have now if they aspire to work in AI my suspicion is that AI is going to make software development more valuable I think one story you can tell is that oh maybe this is actually a good thing for the experienced developers but actually bad for juniors because it's like Junior developers are now kind of getting replaced with AI I think it's actually going to help out Junior developers more because I think a lot of the value from senior developers comes from having a vast kind of repository of knowledge of like oh I know how to do this I've seen this before AI now can kind of Outsource some of that knowledge where it's like oh I don't know how to do something but I can still do it quickly because I just asked chat CPT to write the code obviously chat gbt can't do complex things but for quick and dirty things it's actually a fantastic tool
