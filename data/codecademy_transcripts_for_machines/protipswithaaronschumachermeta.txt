I everyone Welcome to our back to school series of live streams this is day two of four this week I'm Jonathan Trung the head of community here at cocami I'm joined by my colleague Mariana Benjamin one of our community managers who is moderating our chat another Community manager of fedi loka who is our streaming specialist and Community manager and our special guest Aaron Schumacher uh there will be we'll actually have two q a sessions today uh which my guests will discuss more in detail so feel free to ask uh them during the event because we want this to be interactive and as you ask questions or comment please please please remember to add here to our community guidelines and keep things respectful um I'm pumped to introduce our guest speaker Aaron Schumacher who is again data scientist at meta fun facts about him Aaron has worked as a data scientist for meta for more than two years uh before working for one of the world's largest and influential tech companies and hanging out with Mark uh he formally served as a data scientist and software engineer for a company called Deep learning analytics now of General Dynamics mission systems he taught Python and R for general assembly and The Meta data science bootcamp he's worked in the private public and nonprofit sectors which include major management consulting firm who's Alan Hamilton New York University and the New York City Department of Education he's a fellow Badger like me who studied mathematics at the University of WisconsinMadison and received his Master's in teaching math at Barr college he used to camian even visited the New York headquarters for an event in 2011. super cool and and most importantly Aaron is a phenomenal bboy or more commonly known as a breakdancer and part of the legendary Midwest monsters crew for all the dancers out there his career best was advancing to the semifinals of R16 career in 2009 uh for the individual footwork battle which is on YouTube and uh that's a quick recap about him from me uh but you can hear more about Aaron yourself so I am going to ask the mic to Aaron Aaron please take it away all right thanks so much I'm going to get a couple slides up just to have sort of a visual here all right so yeah thanks again uh exciting to be here talking to folks um I'm going to introduce myself just a little bit more um on a personal note I am based here in Washington DC I you know live with my wife and my daughter who would really like you to know she is almost five years old um like John said I am a data scientist at meta actually my metaversary is tomorrow so it will be exactly two years tomorrow um before that I've you know worked elsewhere in data for about 10 years I put my website up here planspace.org that's sort of a Blog that I post things at if you're wondering you know about anything in the slides here if you go there planspace.org there's a post with a link to these slides so you can find everything there um I encourage you to connect with me if you like on LinkedIn and other things happy to meet folks you know however it works for you all right um so a couple disclaimers that I need to do uh first I am here today representing myself as an individual and not any employer current or former so there's some limits to how much detail I can get into on specific projects um also I'm going to be giving recommendations uh but it I don't know everyone's background I have had my particular set of experiences um I'll talk about them and I'll recommend things you know with some confidence sometimes but your mileage may vary um and you know I'm not trying to say that I know the one true way uh for any of this stuff but I'll tell you what I think has worked for me okay so uh like John was mentioning we're going to do kind of two sessions of slides and question and answer after each one um so what I'm hoping is that I'm going to tell you a little bit about me and some of my recommendations and give you lots of things to ask questions about so please fill up that chat with questions that we can talk about uh I'm only going to talk about sort of one story during this first session of slides but I'll mention a lot of things that you may want to know more about so let us know what you want to hear more about so that we can have this be as useful for you as possible My Hope Is that you can take something from this that helps you to take you know some Next Step that moves you in the direction you want to go all right so about me and my background and my recommendations uh so I studied math um and I have these two degrees one of them is a master of arts in teaching which is sort of a weird master's degree but it still counts um sometimes people ask me you know should I get a college degree and I think the answer is yes I'm going to sort of be your dad about this um now I have a mentee who like a lot of people uh quit school during the pandemic and I'm really happy that he has now started again um I think it's a great learning experience uh I think it's a great credential to have that opens doors for you so if you're in a position to get that formal education don't don't miss that opportunity of course it's not the only way to learn things I've learned a ton on uh platforms like Coursera code academy other kind of massive courses um I think you should definitely be doing these two you'll learn a ton as well um so you know it's not either or it's both and in my opinion all right um on jobs you can see on the right a huge list of all the different job titles I've had across my career and one thing you might notice is that it's been a twisting turning path at times before kind of settling down in working in data where I am now when I started my career uh I was a teacher so I was for three years a teacher before kind of transitioning to data science so I'm happy to talk more about that if people want to hear about it ask questions in the chat all right I put a slide in here on setbacks um you know if you're in an interview you may not want to lead with this kind of material but I think it's important to acknowledge that setbacks are real um and they're not fun at the time hopefully afterwards you can look back and you know see it as a learning experience so I have included two here not because I've only had two setbacks in my life but because these are two I feel comfortable talking about today so if you want to hear more details about this again put it in the chat uh if you've ever had a bad interview we can have a chat about bad interviews all right um this is volunteering and a way to you know connect this to Career is you can volunteer close to the kind of work that you'd like to do professionally so there's for example an organization called Data kind uh that has chapters all over the place I've been doing stuff with data kind for a long time I did a data dive with them just this past weekend great experience great chance to learn and meet folks I also volunteer with hack diversity it started I joined as a mentor but then ended up doing technical work for them and learned a lot about operations research kinds of things in a way that I wouldn't have had you know in my normal job so volunteering is is a great thing for you and for other people so an opportunity to look for um oh I think I missed a slide let me make sure I have the right one okay so can be related to volunteering can be just out in the world I've just called this events a lot of the ones that I'm listing here are kind of competitions where I happen to do well but you know anything where you're going to get out and meet people and work together I think is a huge opportunity and way to advance um so this is the one story I wanted to tell and it's around this Arlington Public Schools thing it's sort of a story that ties my career together in a sense um and also illustrates the kind of winding path and and opportunities that can happen uh over a career so I happen to get a job at NYU which meant that I could audit classes I happened to find out that there was a class I could audit that was being taught by John Langford and Jan lacun who are big names in machine learning and John Lagoon is one of the top three people probably in deep learning so I audited this class great opportunity time passes I moved to Washington DC I go to a Meetup where we do 30 second introductions of ourselves and I say I'm working on something with python so this person named John not this John a different John um anyway I mean John K and we get to talking and I mentioned this class um so you know we're sort of friendly later is John K setting up a team for the Arlington Public Schools competition which is a sort of data competition to predict uh who's going to drop out of high school um so we work together on that and John gets to see that I don't only talk about python but I can I can do python um okay so time continues to pass John K founds a company called Deep learning analytics and he gets a contract that means he's going to be expanding the company and so he calls me up and invites me to come work at his company and this was the start of a great career experience where I worked with John for six years had some success with this company we got acquired three years in um and you know this was a huge like longterm growth opportunity for me and it sort of put me in the position where afterward I was you know able to uh you know interview well and pick up jobs in meta for example so um anyway that's sort of one tale of the weirdness of my career uh and I think it's interesting that you don't always have a plan in advance but you sort of look for opportunities over time okay if you want to know more about any of that you know questions in the chat please all right I put speaking next because my my old buddy John K is doing a talk tomorrow on um on Transformers like chat gbt I helped with a tiny part of the talk I'm very excited to see the full version in a big audience anyway the point here is that there are opportunities for people to give talks and it's a good way to sort of get your name out let people know what you're good at um it's a thing that you could do that people I think don't realize that they can do if you're an event organizer often you're really trying to find speakers um so if you are prepared to give a talk you could probably do it so I encourage people to get out there and try doing talks like this um I have in my experience like picked up contract work from people who saw a talk I gave um yeah it's a a thing that will force you to you know do a lot it put a lot of effort in and get exposure as well so encourage and Aaron Aaron Aaron not to interrupt you but this is a that's also one of the reasons why I reached out to you about doing this live stream because I knew that you have given many talks and I was like Oh Aaron would be fantastic for this thanks thanks yeah well try to do fantastic we'll see we'll see how other people think um but yeah yeah great opportunity uh and and I think more available Than People realize like I I am not a magical person who can be the only person giving talks you can too um okay projects I think a lot of people talk about projects and like Project based learning I mean I think they're right projects are a great way to build skills and demonstrate your skills um so here's a collection of things that I've done that are public or have been public um I think you want to make projects real as much as possible um so I encourage you to find and do projects that are meaningful to you um I think my last one here is on writing so these are blog posts that I've done over the last five years um and my point here is just that reading and writing is great for Learning and it's great for honing that skill of writing which is a skill that's going to be important in like every career um so coding is important writing for human audience is also really important also it can demonstrate you know that you know about things you can become a resource for people um and in my case I like look back at my old posts and like it's a record of things I used to know how to do and can can find again okay um I wanted to mention I like went a little hard on my job search when I was looking to transition sort of from Government Contracting world into big Tech um so I talked to a lot of companies the list here is places where I interviewed and got an offer um so there's a wellknown blog post called five offers in five days mine was not quite as dense as that but I interviewed a bunch of different places uh it was an interesting experience it was a lot of work um it was a thing that when I was younger I didn't know that this was a thing you could do was interview for many places kind of at the same time um but is is one approach that might might be something you want to aim for possibly all right ask questions if you have questions and then I threw in the slide which is on types of data roles just because I think some I don't know where everybody's coming from um so this is sort of roughly how I think about different kinds of data roles where data scientist is people that are using data to learn about the world it's about figuring out what's going on it's about measuring how well we're doing figuring out what's important to focus on uh setting priorities these kinds of things it's closely related to some of these other job titles data Engineers are going to be you know sort of closer to software Engineers working more on data flows data Pipelines I don't know if they'd love to be grouped with database administrators but that's sort of the more oldtimey kind of related position and then software engineer is where I've put machine learning engineer I think often machine learning is more split from data scientists and people think not to say that data scientists don't ever do machine learning but I think a data scientist is more likely to do machine learning as a kind of analysis so to speak than to be putting into production machine Learning System so anyway if you have more questions about that happy to discuss more research scientists is the weirdest one to position here because it could be sort of a lot of things but anyway I wanted to include that just to set the stage a little bit all right and I think I'm going to stop there and my hope is that there are questions that we can talk about we have a good number of questions uh thank you so much for that comprehensive overview um Aaron I know that we only have so much time um first things first you have a few slides that have a lot of information such as all the different kinds of uh blog posts that you've done the talks the projects so on and so forth we have um a user a few users asking whether or not they could actually get access to the slides so after uh after this event are you open to sharing those slides with everyone oh yeah yeah if you go to my blog there is a post with a link but I can put it in the chat right now um all right I think that's the right link um yeah I think I have it so that people can view it yeah I think I think the user uh noted that uh he or she wasn't able to access uh the slides because of whatever we're searching so um if you can't do it right now uh you can access it later yeah yeah apologies on that I think I have the permissions set right now um so try again if the link wasn't working for you apologies all right cool um uh some users would love to learn or hear about yeah your worst interview setback okay great this is sort of a fun story years later to talk about it was not as much fun at all at the time um so this was when I was uh it was sort of My First Data job was as an analyst with the New York City Department of Education um so this is sort of a government job right I'm in an office where you know lots of people wear suits every day um and I was looking at this startup called Newton it was a tech company working on education technology so I thought it was really interesting you know it seemed like a natural topic for me the background in education and I was really excited about it I think I managed to get the interview because I had done so well for one thing I had the background in education which sort of connected with their mission um and I had done some projects that sort of demonstrated that I you know had the ability to like do some coding make a website this kind of thing so I managed to get the interview but I was not at all prepared for it uh I didn't know what to expect um I was coming you know from this sort of government style where my assumption was I'm going to start with something that sounds silly but it kind of contributed to how I felt through the interview um my assumption was you know you go for an interview you go wearing a suit so I show up at this little Tech startup you know in my one suit that I owned everybody else is in tshirts and jeans um I think if I had done a good job at the interview it wouldn't have mattered but I did awful throughout the interview and it just was one more thing that made me feel awkward um so like basically everything that went wrong they could go wrong went wrong and some of them were my fault so like there was coding at a whiteboard and I had been working mostly in r but got into my head that python was the cool language to use so I said oh I'll do it in Python and then knew nothing about python I had done very little Python and so even coming up with things like some to add a list of numbers I was not coming up with some um so I was I was bombing the coding there was a algorithms question that should have been an easy slam dunk sort of binary search question um but I had no idea and just like failed to understand the question basically uh there was a question that was like a statistical sampling question and again I did not approach a correct answer so it was an interview that I was totally not ready for um and so it was embarrassing and and sort of uh I don't know maybe a reality check at that point uh but it was also you know a very memorable learning experience where I sort of started to get a sense of okay if I want to you know do better in a future interview I'm going to need to learn a lot more and and you know prepare better for for interviews um so uh at the yeah at the time it was uh quite a bummer but uh I think I learned you know from it down the road well that's great that you learn from it and I think that if you were to be under dress and go to a place that was a little bit more uh or everyone dressed up I think that would actually be a lot worse than the other way around so um uh next question um how long in terms of months uh did it take for you to prepare or pass the Fang uh coding and system design interviews what resources did you use oh sure so I I guess one way to say is it was a multiyear process really um so I I think some kinds of preparation were kind of incidental but helped a lot so like I was leading a team when I was at uh deep learning analytics and so one of the things that we did kind of as a team like kind of skill development and fun activity was we would do coding problems um you know there are like these algorithm problems that you see in in coding tests um and so we would do these and sort of share our solutions back and forth and so that was one way that I started to practice these kinds of things at the time I wasn't really thinking of it as interview prep as such but more like let's help the team to develop skills and that kind of thing but it helped me I think doing that so when I started in Earnest um there were a number of of things that I needed to focus on uh so I definitely spent a lot of time I'm on you know sort of Lee code style coding things um there were some resources that kind of broke up the problem types into a number of classes and I thought that was a helpful way to think about it because if you're trying to do you know all 500 million different questions you'll never finish them all but if you learn a couple big classes of problem you can sort of get pretty close to a solution to a lot of the problems um so that was one thing I had been working as you know more of a machine learning engineer effectively in that job so one of the things I had to brush up on was SQL so I actually I actually spent a good deal of time getting up to speed with SQL one resource that's pretty memorable is Julia Evans work she has sort of fun uh comic book style materials and also sort of a playground where you can experiment so that and then also doing you know sort of practice problems on some of these sites um on system design I had never done a system design interview before but I needed to get ready for system design and machine Learning System design questions um so I spent time with like there's at least one maybe two now books that are called that are something like cracking the system design interview and it just collects a lot of different kinds of problems so that's both interesting to learn about and you know helps you get ready for this I think system design is yeah it's a tricky interview to me still um so that was a lot oh I'll mention also I prepared specifically for Behavioral interviews I think that people see the kinds of questions and sometimes think oh I can not prepare very much because this is just asking questions about my life but you will absolutely do better if you think through some answers in advance and sort of have stories from your experience to draw on at least for me is it is hard sometimes to come up with something on the spot so you want to be as prepared as possible for the full range of interviews you've listed so many different kinds of resources and for interviews or you can never over prepare so um but thank you so much Aaron uh next question is what advice would you give new grads trying to find data science roles in the current market yeah so the current market um I mean I think what this means is that the current market is not as good as it used to be I think that's probably still the case I think it's maybe opening up a little bit more um so I guess the advice that I would give is to find a job that is going to give you a place to launch from um by which I mean like you know Fang for example may not be hiring as many you know fresh grads as they have done in the past but there are still a lot of companies that are looking for people so you can find hopefully a good fit uh where sort of a company's need matches what you can offer and that will then give you a place to build up skills build up experience be able to sort of prove yourself and be you know the launching point for whatever your next step is um yeah so like in my case you know I started a job that was not a data scientist titled job I started as an analyst for Department of Education um you know I sort of knew that it was not the job I wanted to have for my whole life right but it was a great place to work on something that I cared about and to learn more to get ready for the next step um On a related note uh and and since you you did switch careers uh so to speak um let's say if you were someone and and this is one of the questions from um our viewers like you're in customer success like it's a totally different field right like what what are some things that you should consider and things that you should look into if you want to make a complete change uh careerwise I mean I'm assuming you do use some math right and some um things that you learned uh through your previous job work experience but let's say you're completely new to the entire field what are some things that you should know before making the lead yeah I guess what sort of things you should know or things you should know a thing you should consider um I think there's that like and I know you talked about this briefly at the beginning but like data science is such a like a large field right let's say someone's like guys I wanted to like do data science but I just don't know like where to start like what are some uh tips uh that you would have for them yeah so I mean in my case I don't talk about my case and then maybe talk about some other cases so in my case I was you know going from education and my first step was a step that was very tied to education right so I think that if you can make a move that connects in some way with the domain that you have experience in I think that is a great way to start moving um you know even if you also want to change industry uh it can make sense to you know to take small steps in the direction you want to go um so so I guess that's one thing uh I think I'll mention that you know I worked at the metis data science bootcamp which was a fulltime boot camp and had people who were you know they had left off in their previous job and and really dove in to a fulltime thing uh where they were trying to quickly skill up and then you know move to a new thing um and many of them had success with that but it is it is challenging so I guess one thing to expect or to know about is that you're probably going to have to work hard um to to sort of pick up skills um to work in an environment that is different to what you're used to um and to you know kind of have to prove yourself where like if you are coming from a job where you're established at all you sort of know how things go um you have to be ready for more uncertainty and sort of figuring things out from from Square One um so that's that's one thing um I guess I want to mention also that even if you're changing jobs there's always you know even if it's not domain there's always some things that connect so you know if you're working in customer success you probably are interacting with a lot of people you're using people skills hopefully your people's skills are good and this is going to be something that can help set you apart um help you to know how to communicate effectively how to work with people uh and you know really bring that to your future work uh in whatever field um that's a few thoughts I guess you know that's that's a great Point too right um one of our Engineers here director of product engineering actually uh Judah Anthony uh on a in a past event noted that uh when he interviews people he's always looking for people who have good people skills because you're constantly working on like in teams right and so if you lack those it's gonna your success is gonna be impacted by that yeah communication always always so big empathy uh yeah I'm just agreeing um uh going back a little bit again with your impressive list of all the things that you've written as well as your speaking engagements like could you give some advice about like how you started writing um I mean it sounds obvious but like just getting into the guru of writing as well as uh like your first speaking engagement and and how that led to other opportunities yeah I think I guess maybe a piece of advice or a way to think about it that I think is helpful is uh don't put too much pressure on yourself don't stress it too much so like when I started writing things and putting it online um it was it was not anything that I expected people to read it was sort of uh I feel like writing this and so I'm gonna do it and I'm gonna put it up um so like there are certainly times when you want to get something really polished and have an editor and stuff but for a lot of writing and blogging online you don't need to worry about it to that level um so I I think that's helpful for getting unblocked and for getting started right like a blank page a blank blog can be scary and I think sometimes people get stuck where they're like ah if I put something up it has to be the world's best post and so they never put up any post they never do any writing um you know sort of similarly uh like on speaking specifically there are small ways to start right you're probably not going to start by headlining a big conference as the keynote speaker right um like one thing that I've enjoyed doing a lot is lightning talks right is that five minute talk where you know even if it's awful it's done in five minutes uh and and often you know they're looking for like 10 people to do lightning talks and so hey get in there talk to the other speakers give her your best shot uh meet people that are interested in the same topic and and have it sort of grow from there hopefully um yeah so there's there's some some thoughts on it I think just just do it just do it progress over Perfection love it love it uh another question uh where did you put there's a couple questions in here uh where did you apply for the research data scientist position at meta uh what was the interview like if you don't mind sharing I don't know if you are uh able to share um and then do you have any tips how to optimize applications to get interviews what are some important factors or the most important factors yeah so like part of my I guess strategy that I'm espousing here is building up exposure building up experience sort of bit by bit so that you know people can see you and sort of know something about you um you know before your application um and so in my case most of the positions that I interviewed for I was contacted by recruiters right and so if you can swing this I think it is great to have a recruiter coming to you right and you know this you know I think hiring is is slower now and so there may be fewer recruiters reaching out at the moment but um I think when recruiters are looking for people that's their job is to get people jobs right so your interests are aligned um they're you know on your side so to speak um so yeah I think the the strategy here is get exposure get experience and then opportunities are more likely to come your way okay so obviously that is not happening for everyone at least not today right maybe it'll happen to you five ten years from now um but what do you what do you do today uh I do think you know the advice on trying to get a referral from someone is good advice um I'm happy to refer people by the way but the best referral is going to be from somebody who really knows you knows your work because they can really vouch for you so like lots of opportunities that I've had I mentioned the story of meeting John um opportunities have come from people who knew me and knew like oh this is a guy who's interested in this kind of coding or this kind of problem um so like even even my job at the New York City Department of Education I I got that you know in substantial part because somebody that I had met through break dancing actually um I was interested at the time in trying to simulate the Universe I think I was inspired Maybe by uh wolfram's new kind of science but I didn't have Matlab and I really thought Matlab would be a good thing to use um so I asked my friend hey you know Brianna who was doing a PhD at Columbia at the time can I use your computer lab access to get in and use in use Matlab and so this was sort of the main way I think that she knew that I was interested in technical work and you know actually you know tried things and did things um and so you know years later when I was trying to find my first job in data uh she made the connection to to let me know to apply for this job so uh people people are usually important um otherwise I mean you know I've heard for short stories of people submitting tons and tons of resumes and and not getting responses I think my main advice there is to not be discouraged too much um and also you know don't only submit resumes you should be doing other things right like go to events meet people talk to people you know have that coffee with somebody at a company you're interested in you know build build relationships there's lots you can do uh all I heard was uh learn how to break dance build get into that community and then get the referral from you which is part of our back to school promote Aaron will refer you um thank you so much Aaron uh another question uh and by the way we have three minutes before we're gonna we'll move into this uh the latter half of our uh talk here where you'll provide tips and then we'll open up the Q a again so sorry if we can't get to all the questions which we have lots and lots of questions here um I have a first stage interview for junior data analyst role do you have any tips slash things to talk about that might be less obvious than the usual relevant skills slash experience chat hmm Okay so I'm hearing that this is a first round interview um so often If you're sort of at the early stage um you know sort of people are are trying to see whether you like sort of have any hope of making it through the the full interview um so that's one thing is to you know absolutely be prepared I don't know whether this particular one is going to have a technical aspect to it or not sometimes early interviews don't have as much of a technical aspect and sometimes they do hopefully you're you're hearing about what this interview is going to you know consist of um so I think you know make sure that you are coming across as an excellent human somebody that people are going to want to work with um you know try and have a human conversation with whoever you're talking to and be upfront be passionate hopefully authentically about the kind of work so that you know they can feel that you really want to to do this um and then you know if you can be ready to speak to related work that you've done of course I think this is probably something that people expect um so yeah I guess a couple thoughts but yeah it can vary depending on what sort of uh first round it's going to be awesome we are at uh 12 40 eastern time um so we'll get into the the second half of the call so um we'll get we'll try to our if if uh you asked a question and Aaron didn't get to it uh we'll figure out a way for you to ask the question again in a different way on the forums um after this call and then you can um Aaron will to try his best to respond to everybody so yeah yeah I'll try and be as available as I can all right um and we can certainly answer questions that we didn't get to yet if there's uh if there's time all right um so this next section um what I'm trying to do here is go the opposite direction so at the beginning I was kind of going from my very specific experience toward uh recommendations and now what I'm trying to do is distill things down to General recommendations and hopefully it makes sense based on what I've been saying about my experience what I've been talking about uh I think I think the general category or or idea here is that I encourage people to try and increase their opportunity surface area meaning give yourself more chances for good things to happen right so this can be meeting more people developing more skills uh you know making more things available for for people to discover you um but you know just always be trying to expand uh your your world your your view so a couple like kind of specifics kind of in the order that I think they matter um so one is be human be be real um I think you know I'm sort of an introvert so this is not always easy for me but you know try to meet people and engage with people in a really kind authentic way and and like I said be somebody that you would want to work with right um like often this can be you know even something that trumps technical skills is if if you're a really great colleague and you're always supportive and helping everyone uh people will want to work with you and and you'll get more opportunities because people think you know who do I want to ask for you know help on this new project who do I want to give this opportunity to and and they'll be more likely to think of you um so I think this is huge I've mentioned a couple times how my opportunities have come from people that I've met uh I mean I think I think this is a big thing uh it can be I think portrayed as a negative right if if it's sort of perpetuating bias and you know sort of limiting opportunities and obviously that's bad um but I think you want to make this a positive for you as much as possible by by meeting people and being that person that people know as you know a reliable expert you know really great person to work with um so that's that's sort of what I'm trying to say by be human um other thing I'm going to say is to be creative and I mean something kind of specific here where it's it's not just like you know imagining pretty clouds and things although you know do that too but I mean create things make things and and put things into the world um so like I showed my lists of like I've written a bunch of blog posts uh those are things that if I had you know just done them in private and not put them up or maybe never finish them uh I think I would be worse off for it I think it's good to make things finish them and put them in the world to to sort of live a life there uh I think it helps to develop skills it helps to develop sort of your reputation your visible collection of work um and and I think it's important uh so be active be making things um I think this is a big part of continuing to grow and to learn and to you know be out there um so be understanding I put in here this one has more of a specific data connection right in in data science and related things often the whole name of the game is to understand what's going on um and and to know how much of what's going on can you understand right so you want to have a really good sense of epistemology like why do I think things uh what evidence do I have um but also huge uh curiosity and and a drive to understand things at the deepest level right so sort of understand more than you need to understand and and go learn about related things right so expand into areas even areas that aren't what you're immediately working on go learn about something that you're curious about understand it and then you know a month later some new work pops up and you're ready to do it because you already learned about something uh that puts you in that position um I mean there's also a human connection here you want to understand people and and be an understanding person uh but yeah understanding sort of things as deeply as you can as completely as you can you know identifying which parts are are well understood and which aren't uh is a huge thing all right and I put be confident in here um and I don't know how much this is still the case but I still you know have seen things um like on LinkedIn somebody will put in their in their profile that they are an aspiring data scientist and I would I would suggest that you could put in a better title than aspiring data scientist um because if if somebody sees aspiring data scientists what that often can mean is that you're not a data scientist so so go ahead and you know describe yourself in the most confident way that you can um right you can be a data scientist without having a you know a title from a company that says you are and I think it's important to you know represent yourself honestly and do the work but then let people know um that that you are able and and able to uh to execute and perform well um I think that it's really important um maybe I think we have enough time that I can share one fun story which is um I was all right I'm doing it so I was playing um paintball one time and it was the end of the day there was a huge crowd of us hundreds of people probably at this course and they set up a castle defense right so one team is in the castle defending the flag the other team is trying to storm the castle and it was sort of a Kobayashi Maru situation there was no way for the attackers to win because the other team had Advantage they were going to destroy you um so I was on the attacking side and I went and got shot and killed several times but then what I realized was the way people decide who to shoot was based mostly on who was shooting them we had some markers but I just lowered my gun and walked calmly in as if I belonged in the castle and just walked up to the flag and took it and you know I'm not encouraging people to uh you know mislead anybody about what you're doing but in this case having the confidence to do something was what made me able to do it and I think to some extent uh you know in situations where you might be feeling imposter syndrome uh you know acting as if you don't have imposter syndrome will be enough to get you beyond that um so go out there and you know be your best most confident self all right damn Aaron just just uh walking in acting like a badass taking the flag wow yeah um people thought I belonged there so they let me do it all right um so I I want to recommend um taking a Next Step um whatever it is and this is a book I like the cover of this book because it has this image right where you go from one point to the the other and it shows that the path is not direct right you might take a step in the wrong direction you might take a step to the left or to the right um but if you keep trying to move in the direction you want to go eventually you get there um I guess sort of the next level interpretation of this is in advance you may not know what the end point is right there's a there's a different book called um why greatness cannot be planned um and I think it applies to a lot of things in life where you don't necessarily know what the final state is you're just trying to explore the space and move in directions that seem good to you and the important thing is to be active and keep moving um so I think you know in my experience this has been true like I didn't set out you know when I was trying to get into data and say I want to get a job at you know a giant tech company right if I tried to do that directly or or thought that that was my goal from day one it would have been really frustrating so I think what's worked for me and and what I hope is a good approach for others is to um really focus on the moment right do the best work you can where you are keep trying to move to adjacent states that you think are where you want to go um but don't worry too much about what you're going to be doing 12 years from now right when I started out I I didn't know where I would be 12 years hence um so the important thing is to keep moving keep growing uh and and finding the next opportunity so uh if you're not sure what that is here are here are some really concrete steps that you could take and do um so the first one I think is to do a project and I recommend the best thing is if it's something that comes from you uh something that you're passionate about that you're curious about just go ahead and do it do it for real like seize it um if you're really not sure and you just want to explore some problems um recently I discovered this comap contest which is a kind of modeling contest that I think is probably got a bunch of problems that are interesting for data people um so they've got a lot of problems on their site you can go look at historical ones and people's solutions to them if you're if you're in college right now you might try and join in a comap contest the next one I think is in February um another thing you could do is read a book I think reading a book is underrated these days I think uh you'll you'll like reading books more than you think I've got some lists of recommend recommended books um like for me reading pragmatic programmer when I was in my first data job was something that was really uh you know helped to to shape me and move me in directions that were productive in in my life um uh like I've said a couple times I I really recommend writing um I ideally write it and share it but even if you're not going to share it write it um you writing and thinking go so well together you'll learn more you'll solidify and and hopefully work on communication it's I love writing um go to an event you could it could be a volunteer event you could try and give a talk you meet people great thing to do um if you're at the stage where you're working on your resume I have some recommendations on resumes specifically that's a post on my blog and if you want to get referred for a job at meta I've got a blog post with information on how to do that and I'd be happy to put in a referral for folks so yeah and the main thing is do something I recommend you do something all right so let's stop with the slides and and see if there are some questions all right Aaron we we still have uh I think we can take this time to go through some of the unanswered uh questions there's some questions related to the latter half of this talk here uh first I think about um the website they keep referring to uh which has the link to this deck as well as all of the things that you linked within this deck here is uh plantspace.org is that correct blankspace.org yeah I will drop it in the chat as well I'm sorry I haven't been able to keep up with the chat myself if it's possible and look at it again uh after complete bit and then uh you also have a newsletter is that correct so people can like sign up for your newsletter yes I don't know if I call it a newsletter it's not as regular um uh but I do send out updates sometimes on on what I've been doing on the blog um so yeah you can put your email in if you want to get emails from me uh mostly okay what I've been putting on the Vlog now nice nice uh to our questions I'm new at learning python how often do you use apis in your work have you dealt with issues with API Keys often it's been frustrating learning feel stuck at times yeah so I guess in my work now I pretty rarely interact directly with apis um I mean it totally depends on what problem you're trying to solve and you know sort of what you're working on right um so like I have in the past used apis to get data um I've made like a Twitter bot and things like this um I agree that it can be frustrating right you have to jump through like oauth Hoops sometimes and whatever uh if you want to focus on the like data aspects um I think you can find apis that are less locked down um that's one thing if you want to just focus on data work itself like sort of directly you can go directly to a data set rather than messing with an API uh yeah this is like people mean lots of different things with data scientists in particular so sometimes a data scientist is the person who's writing code to grab the data or do something with an API but not always so yeah focus on what's interesting to you yeah I didn't leave it at then okay next question uh I want to land a job as a data analyst do you think that knowing about frontend development could help me stand out from the competition or is it better to know backend development as a data analyst yeah I think you know both back end and front end are going to be you know sort of supplementary to the core data analyst work I think right um I think I have sometimes brought in frontend things in data work so like if you want to make really custom visualizations maybe you are using a frontend framework maybe you're using D3 uh in JavaScript right um so I guess that's where my head goes first um although yeah I think I think it depends where you want to specialize right like if you're edging more towards like data engineer kinds of roles then that's going to be a little bit more backend like yeah I think I would focus on the analysis part most get strong as you can there and and sort of see what you need to reach for right so if if you're trying to do some analysis work and you find yourself thinking I need to make a visualization uh using you know some frontend thing then then you have a good reason to go and do it um I think I really I really like learning things most when you're doing it for uh real reason right so like find find a need and then learn to to meet that need um next question which book will you recommend for a novice learning or for novice to become a software engineer without any computer science knowledge so the one that I've been recommending for a while is I think it's Peter Downey has a book called think python and that one is pretty good and it's freely available online um so I think that is a pretty good place to start um there's also a book from mit's python course which has some things to recommend it but I guess if I have to pick one right now I'll pick the think python probably okay uh I think this will be the last question uh before we have closing remarks um do you have any remarks uh Pros cons et cetera I'm working in big Tech versus government in a data science role hmm well they're different um yeah I think like there are differences in the kinds of impacts you're likely to have right and so this is I think the thing that brings people to government often is you want to make a difference in um you know a concrete way or that the government policy uh you know local government whatever level um and I think I think it's important and and I I would like to see more great people working in there um I was you know part of why I started out in uh Department of Ed is because I care about education um it's hard to avoid the reality that big Tech is gonna probably compensate you better um which matters especially as you get older and have a family maybe it's part of where my head is at um and yeah the the work style is uh a little bit different right is a lot more fastpaced in big Tech some people are concerned about like worklife balance so maybe that is a possible downside of big Tech it hasn't been my experience really what I find is that I work about the same number of hours but work harder per hour in Tech so there's a couple thoughts um I'm not sure if I answered the whole question but yeah yeah uh that's it for our questions I just want for all the people who are very please go round of applause you know right in the chat you know uh clap emojis uh to Aaron Schumacher of meta who is not only a data scientist but also uh renowned uh break dancer slash bboy um badass paintballer um overall voracious reader and uh thought leader so many things Aaron um we are going to do our best to have him answer your questions after this event and we'll provide a link uh to the forms in the email if you rsvp'd uh to the event you will receive a link uh to that because we want to leave everyone hang in there uh who asked the question um please subscribe to our YouTube channel to find out the latest events that we have coming up which just so happens we have two more events uh this week tomorrow we have uh Ted Sanders of open AI at 1pm and then on Thursday uh with Jimmy ha of Salesforce and Asian leaders Alliance so um again thank you so much Aaron for taking the time really appreciate it and I hope everyone out there has a good rest of the week thanks Academy Community talk to y'all later bye thanks
