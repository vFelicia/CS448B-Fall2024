all right hello everyone welcome to another edition of code Academy live my name is Alex and my name is also Alex and we are here today to celebrate the launch of our static statistics course Alex and I just wrote an intro to statistics course where you learn a lot about different statistics to calculate and how to interpret them all in Python and so we are going to do a little stream today to show off some of this stuff from that course and then also talk a little bit about some of the ideas that we that we discussed there I see that we got a lot of people in chat but we want this to be super interactive we would love for you to chat as much as possible ask us questions we have people from all over the place Brazil England Michigan Pennsylvania so please get in the chat if you'd if you'd like if you just are seeing us on code Academy you can get to the YouTube page by clicking on the title of the YouTube video right here and that will take you to the YouTube page there we are and you can get in the chat here and if you are just see us on YouTube and we are going to be coding in the code Academy coding environment and so you can that go back there by clicking on that first link in the description and then you can code along with us in this environment nice we have a lot more people in the chat Alex you want to describe a little bit about what we're gonna do today sure yeah so if you have questions as they come up please just send them here I'll be describing things on the screen so I won't always see but we Alex or or I will what Alex won't handle it and at some point I don't have someone from Brooklyn that'll be super relevant today so what I'm gonna start off by doing is just talking you through the last exercise of central tendency exercise or lesson a module what we used so in these series of lessons for mean median and mode what we did was we took a data set of a hundred of the greatest novels of all time right so greatest novels alltime from a survey from a French magazine my favorite Frenchman yes we all have we all have our favorite French magazine that's 100 so yeah the survey was translated to English for me and I took the hundred greatest 100 authors from that and we try to get to the question what is someone's a person's most creative age so we just took the ages of these authors at publication for the top 100 novels and we plotted a histogram like this we found the mean and the median and the mode and we try to answer the question when are people their most creative so Alex if you're looking at this histogram right we'll say ages on the bottom here from you know 0 out to 80 when would you say somebody is their most creative yes so I mean that's a hard question to answer with just this data that we have but looking at this data you know you could say anywhere in your late 40s you know late 30s to early 40s that seems to be where most of the data is is located you know we have these different statistics mean median and mode that are telling us slightly different things but they'd all seem to be kind of around the same area so my like baseline guests you know would be somewhere around 40 okay cool so and I think another thing that's important to note here is we we don't want to say that somebody's most creative everyone's most creative years can be gleaned from this information because this is just survey data from a French magazine right but what we can say is we can say you know when people tend to have their greatest novels published right but let's say that Alex I were a 60 year old novelist okay and I wanted to publish my greatest work would you tell me that that is impossible based on this data no certainly not impossible I mean it like it's less common but you know it happens it looks like it happens more often than someone in their 50s but maybe that's just a you know small quirk of the data because there wasn't that time data but no definitely definitely still possible okay cool so what we're gonna do now is we're gonna jump into what our goal is for today so so this is kind of what we're showing you here is kind of the like finished product of answering a question and that question was like when when there are authors they're most creative and so Alex you can that you can talk about how we are gonna go through that entire process of forming a question looking at the data set and trying to reach conclusions or you know reach outputs like we have here but we're gonna do it all from scratch sure so eventually we're gonna Alex this point we're gonna fill out this document in front of you all if you want to pull out scratch paper if you have notes or something like that and you can write along with us feel free to do so but the first thing we're gonna do in a second we're gonna fill in this question thing and you all are going to help us find this question from there we're gonna then fill in the this data portion of our report so the data portion we're gonna get a histogram graph just like the one that you just saw to help us answer this question and then we're gonna fill in the mean median mode variance standard deviation related to whatever data that we use to answer the question above and then right at the end we're gonna sort of introduce the problem a little bit more articulately because we don't know what exactly that question is gonna be yet and then down at the bottom here we're gonna try to draw some sort of conclusion make some sort of claim and sort of address also the assumptions that were making in the discussion section so yeah yeah one of the things that we thought about a lot when we were writing the course was it's not enough to just be able to you know understand the Python syntax to find the mean or find the median like we really cared about teaching the skills to be able to interpret and articulate those findings that you that you find through those statistics so that's kind of the goal of this of this exercise is to not only find those statistics but to be able to talk a little bit about them and what they might mean absolutely so the data said that we're going to be using right we don't have a question now but the data set that we have is in this public code Academy at repository and I'll actually post a link to that in chat as you're talking about looks great so what this repository has and what we're just going to focus on today is housing data in Brooklyn New York so street easy is a real estate company real tear in New York City and they provided us with a bunch of real world real world information so the the data includes a bunch of columns with the rental ID building ID those are probably less interesting less important but what we do have is we have the rent number of bedrooms bathrooms square footage the minutes to subway public transportation whether these these things have a dishwasher elevator doorman and what we want to do is want to use this data set to help us answer some question okay so at this point we would like for you all in the chat just take about a minute think of some questions that you would like to see us try to address using the skills that we have from the statistics the statistics courses that we've taught you so far yes we we just practiced with a question that we came up on our own we're we would be happy to do that again but we're really interested in seeing if you guys can come up with some really interesting questions that we could explore using all this data let's see Kavita you asked how how strong is your Python knowledge have to be to get value from this but we'll be coding some in Python and we think that you don't need very much Python experience at all we'll be doing some stuff that maybe will gloss over a little bit in terms of like manipulating the data but really what we're focused on is getting these statistics and interpreting the statistics so we don't think that you need a ton of Python experience you think that's do you think that's fair I agree just know we will be recording this for later yes these these live streams always go the YouTube channel right after right after we finished filming them so our goal is really to focus on the on the statistics concepts and we're just using it Python as the tool that we that we need to sort of like exercise those statistics concepts and you'll be able to follow along with our code so you can type it type it as as we go okay so we would love to go ahead and take a look at this information that we have available to us is there something that you're curious about and again this is like a very open prompt of just like any question that you might want to try to answer using a histogram using sort of disparate descriptions how profitable is the practice of an employing a doorman interesting so that's like from the buildings perspective if I if I include the doorman can I start raising the prices a lot yeah we're going to pay a lot charge more yeah that's that's a good question how we're the majority of new residents are saying from do we have information that could get us that yeah not seeing that in it's like like I'm where they're moving from right or they call when they moved what neighborhood can get the most square footage per dollar okay what's the mean median square foot of $1000 rantin oh that's a good one that that like might be a little too specific to like statistics right asking what is the mean what is the median yeah so we can definitely take that a little bit higher level so we have two of those around the same thing what neighborhood can I get the most square footage per dollar what's the mean median of square foot per one thousand dollars rent so it's it's a essentially how far does your dollar go okay we'll give you another few seconds in case anyone to ask a question okay okay right so so what sorry what do you think of our question we're looking at square footage a lot we have a few things on square footage right and we want to talk about rent there positive relationship between rent and having a roof deck meaning if you have a roof deck does your apartment cost more which was each minute on the train casa in rent on average the mean general building age per neighborhood what is the average commute the average cute okay my apartments smaller in terms of square foot size is there something to do with date that I'm not seeing here is building age years yeah yeah okay talks what do you what do you what do you want to do Alex I'll let you make the okay so you know what's something that could be interesting is I think we could start by just looking sort of like high level cost per square foot okay and doing a hair histogram with that and then and we're gonna need to get your help with this at the end remind us to sort of then start splitting into groups so we can start looking at doorman right people might have a good roof deck we could possibly even look at neighborhoods okay so so for now we'll start with the question of sort of what is the distribution what is the right how does square footage affect rent okay or cost what is the impact of square footage oh excuse me square footage on apartment rent in where are we this is Brooklyn Brooklyn New York and so one of the things you can actually find well you we go to the raw data for Brooklyn sure right so we have a bunch of different CSV files here I think this street easy dot CSV file has all of the information so across every borough but you can go ahead and download this data yourself if you're interested in looking at Manhattan instead of Brooklyn or Queens instead of Brooklyn feel free to basically swap out whatever data said that you want to use but we will be using Brooklyn great so the two columns that we're gonna start looking at is the rent column and the square footage column great okay cool so you can notice like some prices thirty six hundred forty nine hundred square footage twelve hundred is better the largest that we'll see well we'll take a look at that in a little bit okay so we're gonna go back to the live streams here and go ahead and refresh this page in case you were sitting on this page like thirty minutes ago because we made some changes to it so I would say everyone should you know refresh this live stream page and again if you are just tuning in you can find you can find this page by clicking on the first link in the YouTube description cool so the first thing that we want to do is we want to import this CSV file okay so importing the CSV file what is the name of our CSV file right so we've done some work behind the scenes to already import this CSV file so we have this data dot CSV why don't you take a look at that I guess okay so this is a mess but this is the same mess that you just saw github when it that was a lot so that had a better formatting so in script up I what what should I name this variable Alex yeah so this is all rental data about Brooklyn so yeah like Brooklyn rental sure okay and how do I read this in yeah so we're gonna be using this library called pandas which is a Python library that is really good at keeping track of data it's there you use these things called data frames a lot and you've Lodhi or CSV files into data frames and so we can use this pandas function what is it it's CSV load CSV I don't know yeah sure this is pretty common we're gonna have to look up how to read CSV island python looks like I already look this up okay maybe maybe with pandas the Panthers okay good idea so all right here we go look at that so I had already clicked on the link what we need to use is this PD dot read CSV okay so back over here PD dot read CSV and our file name is yeah data dot CSV okay so we've already seen the data in we've already seen the data and github and now what we want to do is we wanna try to print this to the console yeah just to make sure that that worked correctly loading that in alright so we're gonna take our variable name here and we're gonna take a look at it in the console what you can see is we imported all this data it doesn't look particularly good but we feel good about the fact that we've imported the data right now there is an easier way to look at just the top of it we can type in dot head at the end and this just shows the top five rows yeah and you can see that it's 18 columns as well and so that kind of will reflect back again it's probably easier to look at the github page but we had 18 different columns of this one was rent this one was whether there was a doorman this one was how many bedrooms they were go on yeah all right so the next thing that we want to do is we want to focus on just a couple of columns here right so Alex which columns do we care the most about so we are doing rent and square footage okay find the rent and square footage okay so I think it would be interesting for us to just look at what our mean median and mode rent look like so what we can do is we can print out and what was the column name does anyone know the column name that we were using for rent yeah we can go back and look at the github page want rent here okay so and you can even see that in our print out over here on the right of we have a column there all right now I'm printing out just rent what you should see is just one column with all of the rent values in it all right now eighteen hundred eighteen thousand fifteen thousand and that last round so before we we actually print out the mean of just the rent does anyone have any guesses on to as to like what they expect to be the average rent in Department New York yeah you actually didn't do this in our in our practice so I don't know what what do you think Alex my guess is is somewhere around four thousand because we're not limiting by our number of bedrooms or something you know I actually maybe not I don't know maybe right right cuz there's you know there's five bedroom apartments that were better in this town is that okay I would guess like 2500 2500 and he raised it and so now this is the question and this is something that we go over in our in the stats course that you could take is how do we find the mean of this and we're gonna end up using the numpy library and up at the top you can see that we import numpy as NP so we can call NPD on average okay sort of like right but so so yeah it looks like the average rent is 3300 okay and then let's look up the now the average square footage yeah I'm also kind of interested in maximum into we might want to do that yeah and what was our column for square footage I don't know if it was abbreviated or not okay so sighs underscore square foot all right so our square footage average is eight hundred and ninety nine dollars okay at this point does anybody have any questions with what we've done so far at all hi from Wisconsin mark great so if our original question was about how to calculate sort of the dollar per square foot we're actually kind of close to that already right sure but we're not getting as much of like a distribution of that but let's just uh let's just see what the average like dollar per square foot is okay so can we divide these two columns by each other I think I think we could probably do that but before we do that let's save these two variables sure right okay so we'll do average rent and have average well that's not the average rent and the average square foot that's just the oh sorry okay yeah I thought you were grabbing just the columns oh okay all right and finally what we can do is to get the price per square foot you can print I already do this Alex we could just divide average rent by édouard square foot that's a typo there okay great so you're gonna be paying on average in New York City three dollars and seventy cents for every square foot in your apartment interesting okay so this is a good start I think that maybe what we can do now is look at the dot rent dot mean interesting rich is dot mean just a normal Python function I didn't I didn't look that up as you keep talking Alex let's see so if everybody sees what rich wrote there let's see if we type in print Brooklyn rental data dot rent mean yeah so the daughter rental indefinitely uh definitely worked out guys the rent column and yeah all right so this is a different syntax so it looks like we have our pandas dataframe we're grab grabbing the column rent and we're calling the mean on that so what we did right here is we use the numpy function average which is something that we use a little bit more commonly in the lessons because their introductory so we just have a raise that we're averaging over whereas with pandas you can use this dot rent dot mean so whenever you have a data frame you can use that syntax but this is not the syntax that we use as much because we were just focusing on average in the Indo lessons okay great so now that we have this sort of the average cost per square foot in Brooklyn at large how do we start breaking this down into some of the examples that we saw before right so one of the examples was doormen right one of the examples was roof deck what do you think so we could go in that direction what I was thinking and we could decide what we wanted to do I think that we can so we have our column of here's all of the different rents and we have our column of here's all the different square feet I think we can divide those columns by each other and so now we have a column of for every apartment in Brooklyn here is the average or here is the price per square foot okay love that and then we could make a histogram of that and say oh look at there are some apartments that are really cheap per square foot there's apartments that are really expensive per square foot let's see what that looks like good call all right let's go with that and then and then once we do that then we can also say okay now let's all look at you know apartments that have to remember things like that okay great so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna comment out these print statements and and I think this will work dividing two columns by each other so Alex is saying is we're gonna create a whole new array a whole new column we're not gonna add the column to the data frame but we're gonna have a column of rent per square foot we're gonna set that equal to our rent column / our square foot all right so we're not getting an error it seems like it seems like something happened so what do we expect to see here I mean so if we know that the average was like three dollars per square foot right I would expect to see a bunch of numbers that are somewhere around three great so we got this this was the one that was a 18000 or 9th right all the way down here and then we see numbers that are above and below the three which was our average all right great so that that $18,000 one the fact that it is so is that a big apartment or a small apartment right because it's its feet or its price per square foot is relatively high so it costs a ton and it's not it's not enormous ly large compared to other other apartments second right yeah yeah so I wonder if we see later maybe we can check this apartment see if it has a doorman see if it has a roof deck all of these things you'd expect to cost more okay great so now what we can do is I think that it's time maybe to start filling in the values that we have in our short document right so what did we get for the mean well we can now we can now take the we can take the mean of this new column that we made and I think that that should be the same as I said okay we did it a little bit differently but we'll see if that's the same okay so we have rent per square foot let's take the mean of that yeah so as we saw earlier it's NP a ver äj yeah or because this is a series from a data frame you could do that dot mean like a rich said yep okay great so we got something a little bit different here but close to the same same value yeah all right so we'll stick this in as our mean all right 3.8 3.8 and our units for this are three point eight dollars pour per square foot okay that's our average value now we're going to do the same thing with median and mode here so if you just copy that print statement down you can find NP medium and the NP median is 3.7 okay same units right 3.8 we'll round up these seven seven yeah and 3.8 2 so one thing that we can we can sort of start to think about as we look at the mean and the median is how this impacts the spread in our data what does this tells us about the spread in our data right well do you want to define what the median is is first before we start to think about that like what is the median sure yeah so the the median is the value that falls directly in the middle of this dollars per square foot so imagine if you had this huge array of dollars per square foot and you order them from smallest to largest the median is the value that falls right in the center of that right and in this case the median is pretty close to the mean but it's not exactly you know they don't line up exactly and so when that happens what does that what does that tell you about the about the data set usually so usually what that'll tell us is the mean can get pulled out if there's a long tail in our histogram so what I when I see this and I see that three point eight two is slightly larger than three point seven seven what I would expect to see in our histogram which will plot a little bit later is this long tail that runs all the way out to the end of our histogram which pulls the mean out now we don't know that for sure and that's why we're gonna plot it in a little bit but that's sort of my intuition okay so next let's find the mode so the mode is not that we're using is not part of the numpy library so we're going to use stats dot mode yeah and why don't we after you write that line let's go up and what could be import state ministers do we know what this where this stats is coming from sure so this is where we're importing stats so it's part of this side pipe akka Chand Python and so once we import stats like this we can then call it down here use functions from it down here yeah okay so this looks a little bit different right so we have a mode of three and Alex what do you think this 14 represents right well so the the mode is the it's the value that is most represented in the data set and so that value for us is 3 and we have this count of 14 which means that 3 has shown up 14 times in our in our data set of price per square foot cool so our mode is 3 so the most common value that we see in price per square foot is 3 and we see it 14 times so we're gonna add this over here and we'll do three dollars per square foot okay so the mode value you'll notice is pretty different from the mean and median and that's not unusual because the mode just tells us the most common value it doesn't say where the data is centered it just sort of happens to be usually that the mode is close to the mean and median because you'll have most of your values near the mean and median great so next thing we can do here is find the variance so Alex what are we what is the variance tell us what is what is this gonna help us find yeah so the variance helps describe the spread of the data so whether the data tends to be close together or far apart and so I guess in this context it would be you know do we have is there a lot of variability in the price per square foot are some apartments $2 per square foot and are some apartments you know $15 per square foot or do they all tend to be around the same area so that's the idea behind the variance and standard deviation and they're really similar statistics and we can talk about why you might want to use one versus the other but let's go ahead and just calculate both of them right now okay so this isn't our numpy library again and we use bar and rent per square foot and you should see something like this alright so we have one point three one all right cool before we talk about what variance is let's just find the value for standard deviation so I'm gonna leave these units you know mystery that's right mystery yeah that's right yeah all right so standard deviation what is our standard deviation what's the command for that yeah so you can get standard deviation again through numpy using STD standard deviation of rent per square foot cool okay okay yeah and so those numbers are pretty close which is interesting because they're both kind of close to two one but the variance the units in variance are actually squared so it's the units of variance I guess in this case our dollars per square foot squared which is a very confusing thing squared right so if our standard deviation is dollars per square foot for variance we'll have essentially dollars raised to the second over a square foot raised to the second so you're gonna write this out dollars squared per square foot squared yeah okay which is very confusing this is kind of the reason why standard deviation exists because it's really hard to wrap your mind around what this value of 1.31 means in the context of you know reality and so the standard deviation is just the square root of the variance which is a measure of spread but it's in the same units as everything else so we can say like okay if I have an apartment that cost five dollars per square foot that is about one standard deviation away from the mean right that's the mean is around four and the standard deviation that's around one so if I have an apartment that cost five dollars per square foot I'm one stay deviation away which is you know not absurdly different from the mean but it's getting out there again you can you can in our in the stats course that we just released we go into a lot more detail about kind of how one how you calculate this where this number comes from and then to kind of interpret it great so one thing that I actually want to try really quickly is seeing if we get the same value by squaring this sure okay so squaring this is the essentially equivalent to do we do like that so it's star star and put guy star star yeah so hopefully for the standard deviation we should see this 1.14 equal to 1.3 great so these are exactly equal okay yeah I saw your question in the chat yeah the livestream will aren't they're always posted right after we finish recording so if you jumped in late or if you can't stay for the whole thing you can always find it on our YouTube channel alright great so Alex would you mind now we're going to yeah adding this this we're gonna add a new component so that we're actually able to plot the histogram sure okay so histogram is a way to visualize our data in a little bit more sort of straightforward way so that instead of trying to describe our data just with these numbers we'll be able to like really visualize the spread and it should be a lot more practical if you remember back to the initial histogram that we showed with the the novelist's you you saw that that was sort of a spread from 10 out to where was it what 1817 yeah there was one person who had their most productive or most what was the question that went with when are your when did you publish your most successful successful book right and there was somebody that who published around seventy right so Alex just added a component so I want everybody to save their workspace and then refresh the page all right so I'm just gonna hit enter here and hopefully that's the old one okay so we plotted something else here that we're gonna actually replace in a little bit but before you before we do that I want everybody to uncomment this right here import code can be lived three Seaborn saps what does that do yeah so this is something kind of behind the scenes at code data me in order for us to draw the output of Matt of matplotlib matplotlib is kind of like the standard Python graphing and visualization library in order for us to show that to you over here in the in the web browser we need to import this kind of funky package so this is something that if you're coding along at like off the code cavity platform you will never encounter coke adam ii win 3 under source Seabourn it's just kind of a little quirk that that we have to that that we have to deal with right ok great so what we're gonna do we're gonna leave these print statements here but we're gonna just like plot the histogram really quickly without any labels or anything with that just so that we can see sort of progress so the histogram plotting is we use this this matplotlib pipe lot and matplotlib is like pythons library for all things plotting so whenever you want to create a figure or graph your data you're going to be using matplotlib for the most part so we're gonna plot rent per square foot yeah and so we're calling the hist function for histogram and let's just see what this looks like and we need to call a plot dog show as well okay great so we have the same histograms that we had before and we need plot show I always forget that yeah all right great so we should be seeing a graph that looks something like this and what are the numbers down here on the x axis represent Alex so that is our units that we've been dealing with this one time so that is the price per square foot okay price per square foot and then on the y axis what are we looking at so those are the counts so how many times was something between between four and five dollars per square foot okay great so something that I like to use to sort of like demarcate between the bars is what is it edge edge weight edge color maybe let's all look it up okay so there's a way that we can add the marks between the so it's like orders between each of the bars we'll get back to that in a second what I want everybody to do first is to just look at the our mean median and mode and where you see them falling in this plot so you'll see our mean should be somewhere around 3.8 and that's right where all of these bars are towards their peak right median same thing right towards the middle that's like the central tendency of our data where is the mode three seems to be a little bit smaller but it's still centered in a way in a place that's pretty close to where we have our peaks and it but it doesn't have to be this this mode could just as easily be between five and six it's just a matter of what the most common value is and coincidentally it happens to be near the middle and there's a higher probability of it being near the middle than it is somewhere else but that won't always be the case yeah this the first time I by the way it's edge color equals black is how you add some supplies between there I I was a little bit confused as to how the mode could be in something that wasn't the tallest bar and how that can happen is so there are I think yet so there are 14 threes and that's represented somewhere in this bar and in this bar there's more values but maybe it's maybe there's one 4.1 and one 4.2 and one 4.3 right and all of those are represented in that bar but they aren't all through yet like they are like they are here where there's 14 different threes yeah so now that we have our graph I think it's important to always add title and then X and y axis labels okay so we're gonna have the title with PLT dot type title okay that makes sense yeah what should we call this so we're looking at the cost per square foot sure okay so Brooklyn apartments rent per square foot of Brooklyn Apartments and I'm gonna save it make sure to make any mistakes all right capitalize per here so our X label that was our units which is per square foot or dollars per square foot I guess okay so we'll say rent per square foot and this is gonna be in dollars so usually this is how you'll see something like this well do foot raised to the second you usually you'll see that like superscripted in some way it's probably a way to do that in math well if I don't know it off the top of my head yeah so rent per square foot is dollars per square foot and then what is our yaxis again Alex it's just the count of how many times we saw that happening the in the data set so this count makes sense I think count works yeah okay great so this is the plot that we were we were looking for right what I'm gonna do is I'm going to copy this plot and I'm just going to do a screen grab and on max it's a command shift for and now I'm going to be able to bring this into my Google Doc see our histogram from our our test up there in the top right that was a good one okay so at this point we're actually done with the coding portion for the main part of this document all right but what we're trying to communicate here is that like the the programming part the Python part is really just the start those are the tools that we use to try to communicate something to make a claim to that that we can support with data that answers our question above what is the impact of square footage on apartment run Brooklyn New York right and the fact that we use Python was like kind of arbitrary I mean we talked a little bit about why we chose to wrote the write the lessons in Python over another language like R is a really common language for for stats and I don't know I guess we settled on Python because it is really commonly used for statistics like this pandas and numpy and all these libraries do exactly what we're looking for yeah but we're really kind of like python is the tool and we're interested in the outcome or the things that you can learn through statistics right exactly and so what we're gonna do here now is a to actually label our data right because imagine somebody comes to see this figure and they don't know at all they don't have any context on the question or anything like that that is always the objective of labeling a figure so what I want you all to do is I want you to think about what you would label this figure in your own words we'll give you about a minute to do so and then if you want you can you can share in the checked our boss is watching this he says they look like brothers I can see it okay we have rent per square foot of Brooklyn apartments okay what type of graph is this though sandy I think that would be helpful right yeah like what's the value this is actually a good question that I guess I don't particularly know the answer to like we've labeled our graph appropriately we've given it a title what sort of extra information goes in this figure one description that that we haven't already done in the title yeah I think that a lot of times it depends on who the audience is and where you're going to be using the figure and its label because this is a pretty small document and it's pretty easy to find the description of this figure I think that like we don't have to have as much in this figure but if you were imagine you had a 60 page document and you explained a figure somewhere yeah nice rich so somewhere in you know a 60 page research paper of some sort or a view of some sort and you explained a figure somewhere somewhere in that document in like the written discussion section of your document then it's really hard to find that description and what would be helpful is if you have a description that's like really in great detail just underneath your figure so most people would would see this and know that this is a histogram but for the sake of this example let's just say that this is a histogram of the rent purse where rent apartments in Brooklyn the data was acquired from Street easy okay great so if somebody anybody comes to this document and they look just at the figure they look at the figure label they should know what this is communicating out okay so then we also want to label our table it's our table I think we should be as consistent as possible with the initial label and we can say something to the effect of the central tendency and spread to say statistics of the rent per square foot of apartments in Brooklyn New York yeah and in general these the central tendency and spread our descriptive statistics right there they do a their purpose is to describe what this data set looks like okay so now just to finish things up it's always good when you have a question to start with a brief introduction and in the introduction we're setting the stage we're saying something to the effect of where we're getting the data right what else do you think probably I don't know how much do you do describing the describing the data like we have all these rows and columns maybe we do the descriptions of the rows and columns that we actually ended up using I think in general it's good to good practice to link out to where you got the data so we could have linked out to that github page so sorry basic question in this day and age what can Python do that you cannot do with Excel yeah yeah so I mean Excel can do a lot of the same functionality that Python can I think the as you get further and further along in terms of like the complexity of the questions that you're asking or you know I'm writing a or like I wrote some machine learning algorithm where I wrote some something that it's like very advanced in data science where I'm taking all this data I'm doing some complex things with it and then I'm getting the output and at that point once you get you output I suppose you could download that that output from Python throw it into Excel and like finish up in Excel getting the graphs but yeah so I guess I guess for me the answer is like you can do complex programming tasks with Python easier than you can in Excel I think a lot of it has to do with data handling so Excel is like a like a visual first type thing you can use Visual Basic but the purpose of Excel a lot of times is to see your data in the spreadsheet and when you have datasets that are really really large larger than even say 10,000 rows and a lot of times people do Campbell wrote data that's way way bigger than that Excel doesn't really like you can't believe visualize them don't mean you could Python is a much more sort of like customizable language it has a lot of like plugins in a large community that I think is is not as easily accessible in Excel and Visual Basic which is the the language behind Excel so yeah I think anytime you have really really large datasets it's probably or you think you will be using large datasets it's probably best to use a language like Python R or MATLAB there's some other ones out there as well yeah and the fabien your question about are we don't have anything yet although keep an eye out there's yeah so our smells bad now that should be coming great reproducibility is possible in our slash Python but Excel can you explain that a little bit more because I think you can are you saying like reproducing the same equations like compartmentalizing different functions and things like that cat yeah I don't know what I don't know what reproducibility means either but yeah one thing that's really great about any programming language like Python and R is you're able to like build like classes functions that you can reuse on all different types of data set and that may be what the cat is referring to yeah yeah reproducibility of code yeah yeah okay great Thank You Catherine great so what we're gonna do because we have about 10 more minutes is we're just going to try to write the introduction and discussion to this so the introduction is we'll just say that we used a data set from Street easy that contained rental information for apartments apartments in New York City specifically we focused on the rental cost and a square footage of apartments in Brooklyn from that we calculated the cost per square foot of all Street easy apartments in Brooklyn New York so that sort of sets the that sort of sets the stage for what we do then in the the data section so if somebody reads that they'll know exactly what to expect down here so if I were to send us out to somebody I would add a link to the github the github yeah of our data set so the last thing and the most important bit here is the takeaway points right the takeaway so what does anyone know what we can sort of say about the this data yeah and again we didn't plot the mean median mode we didn't really we haven't really talked about what the variance actually means I think like we were talking about before there's a slightly longer tail on the right than on the left where there's some very very expensive apartments per square foot yeah I think it's worth asking the question did we did we adequately answer this what is the impact of square footage on apartment rent in Brooklyn New York I think that we probably didn't fully answer that right right because we probably would have wanted to bend these into different square foot bins and find the average within each of those interesting yeah so if we said okay here are all the apartments that are under 2,000 square feet what's the rent there that would have been another another good way of tackling that yeah so let's just think about what we can say from this right so it looks like what we can say is mainly described by the descriptive statistics here so we could say the mean median and or the mean and median cost per square foot apartments in Brooklyn New York is equal to theirs is near 3.7 or 3.8 $2 per square foot and then we can say something about the minimum and maximum values the spread the cost per square foot is between about one and about 8 yeah now I think that the most interesting thing is looking at just the standard deviation value so Alex can you talk a little bit about what the standard deviation value means in the context of this problem yeah so typically with standard deviation if you have a normal curve like this and we haven't really done a thorough definition of what a normal curve is but usually about 66 percent of the data falls it falls within one standard deviation of the mean meaning okay our mean is three point eight two so that's great around here and our standard deviation is about one dollar so that means like within this within the range of like two what is that like five I guess most of our data is gonna fall in there 90 what is it it's 95 percent of data falls within two standard deviations of the mean so two standard deviations of the mean is again if our mean is right here two standard deviations is you know basically two two and a half dollars away so that will be out here and up here so it kind of gives you a sense of how unusual a certain data point is so if I have an apartment that costs you know seven dollars per square foot I can say okay that is over two standard deviations away from the mean so that's pretty unusual okay so I think one thing that I actually want to do now and that was everything that we were trying to do just in this document but I think a bit of a more interesting question would be if possible to see if we can do this if you want to hang out a little bit longer if we can calculate the same values for living in Manhattan and living in Queens all right because we have this data and we can probably plug those in pretty easily so what I'm gonna do first because I always like to sort of make the figures you've connected yeah but beforehand so I'm going to insert a column well you do that I'll take a look at chatons there any questions that I can answer mmhmm yeah people are talking about where is the best place to learn Python I strongly recommend code Academy I can actually even find a link to our Python courses yeah sandy says you can challenge yourself with easy challenges on project Euler I love project Euler there's some really cool fun challenges there what kind of jobs will we get in the future yeah I think that that's one of the goals of code Academy is to help people find jobs and so you can imagine learning the skills to do this kind of statistical analysis could be helpful in a ton of different corporate jobs okay cool so alex is grabbing what if this is Manhattan yeah yeah and I did this by just going to raw and literally copy and pasting the code into our data Dappy why so I created a new CSV file here at Club Manhattan I save that and then I'm gonna do the same thing for Queens yeah if you all have any more questions feel free to feel free to ask and chat okay so now we have each of these CSV files and in script up hi this is not good practice but what I'm gonna do really quickly is I'm just going to change my data dot CSV here to Manhattan bat CSV right and so now all our variables are like poorly named because it's no longer broken or any data right so you can see now our histogram changed a lot it's spread from 0 all the way up to 20 so it looks like there are it is a lot more expensive per square foot in Manhattan that's my kneejerk reaction or at least there are some really really absurd apartments in Manhattan that cost 20 bucks per square foot that's true yeah it doesn't look like there are many out here right there are some so so we've got five point four five and five point three five that's cool yeah and five point three five we have the same units so I'm going to I'll fill in both leader yeah and then let's get standard deviation as well for this one so the standard deviation is 1.4 are you asked will this be recorded and saved yep these go on our YouTube channel right after we're done recording and then next we'll do Queens do you think this is gonna be higher or lower than Brooklyn right so I've used this data before so I I know but I am i I think it's gonna be did you copy my staff copy yeah sorry about that Queens all right all right so now we're back to having this sort of this distribution that's much yeah actually relative to the last one it is a lot narrower we just have see more in each of the buckets here and we have a mean of 3.2 and a meeting of 3.0 so as I suspected it is a it is smaller in Queens we're less expensive in Queens yeah it's less expensive in Queens and 3.0 and that that right tail on that on that histogram in Queens even like a little bit more pronounced where they're you know this almost like looks like skewed I wouldn't even call that like a normal curve necessarily so for those of you who are familiar with with square roots and squaring values you'll notice that the standard deviation is larger than the variance in this example because when you're squaring a value that is small less than one that is less than one that a relationship is inverse okay great so now we have some new data right this doesn't exactly answer the initial question so let's ask the somebody I think did have a question similar to this what question did we answer with this data Alex I mean so we answered how do or how are the different boroughs or how many the different boroughs differ in terms of okay what does B affect the borough on cost yeah the cost per square foot so what did we answer and so I would say that this is a little bit closer to what we answered and I think it's fair to say that we found the Queen's was the least expensive per square foot and Manhattan was the most expensive per square foot actually Manhattan is the most expensive like quite a bit yeah right yeah almost almost like yeah one and a half to two dollars more yeah the average in Brooklyn a lot yeah over over $2 per square foot yeah and you know there's more than we could do here where it's like we don't really know the size of these data sets so you know maybe we should look into how many you know maybe there's only a hundred Manhattan apartments in our Manhattan data set and there's you know ten thousand Brooklyn apartments or something so you know we could be a little bit more thorough in terms of like understanding what these data sets look like all of that all of that stuff is kind of like assumptions that we've made in our discussion we've assumed that the data was collected in the same way that they didn't like profile that specific set of people you know there's a lot that we're assuming about the data yeah so I think that's that's all all we have does anyone have any remaining questions about this data or this data set yeah and we would encourage you to try this out on other other data sets that you can find there are some really cool just just like we have on github there are some really cool data sets that just exist for public use on github so we would encourage you to kind of like play around with your Python abilities and your plotting and your statistic abilities just like this disco cat if you have any courses on becoming a doorman we never actually found out if that would be a good thing or a bad thing we didn't look at the doorman stuff so we're gonna have to dig into the data before cool all right thanks everyone we typically do live streams on Thursdays although since we did this one on Monday because Alex was in town I don't think we won't do one this next Thursday so keep an eye on our YouTube channel is probably the best way to find out about future live streams they're also on the go to dashboard also keep an eye on this Newman noteworthy section this has kind of been updated recently and every morning when we're gonna have a live stream we update this this card so keeping an eye on new and noteworthy is a good way to find out about these huh yeah anything anything else from you else that's it cool all right great thanks everyone thanks everyone talk to you later
