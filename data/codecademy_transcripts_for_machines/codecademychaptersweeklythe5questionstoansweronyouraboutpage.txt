hey everybody my name is elisa i'm a community manager with codecademy today's quick tip video is about the five questions you need to answer on your chapters about paige let me just get right to it those questions are when how what why and who totally the basics right but i think that there is power in doing the basics right so let's go through them when how often do you meet what schedule being regular about the time that you meet every two weeks every month on the last friday of the month being specific about that regularity will help somebody who is busy like so many of us are with our jobs and our lives decide okay this fits into my schedule or it doesn't quick decision to make how what's the format of your of your chapter and your meetup i know many of you are um hoping to figure that out in your in your first in your first meet up i think it's a great idea to just make that decision especially for your first meet up and then have that discussion with your chapter members after but having that decision made on your about page lets people know ah okay this is something organized and this will be worth my time what what topic will you cover i know this seems like a thing also to decide on with your group but follow what's interesting to you and we'll get to that now why the why this is number four why what is your purpose and your mission why is it important to you to build local community articulating that is definitely going to speak to somebody who is a good potential member and will agree they'll probably agree why it's a good reason to build local community a local coding community and you'll be able to recruit the um the right people that way finally who speaking of the right people being clear about who your chapter is for is as easy as a sentence with a format people learning x in y city so applied that would look like people learning react native in new york city i'm learning react native in new york city are you learning who's learning in new york city that's an easy one for people to be able to identify themselves with so i think that that's a really great place to start now i know i'm going to spend some time on who because i know that that sounds counter intuitive but i promise you from experience it is better to have especially when you're starting five people who are there for the right reasons because they're learning react native in new york city given that example than a hundred people who came to a meet up and they're not sure if they're interested in um python or maybe they're gonna go with javascript or maybe machine learning having those people who know why they are there gives them a reason to connect that those hundred people who aren't sure why they're there won't have they won't have that reason to connect that those the five people who fit the who description will have okay so recap when how on your about page share with your members your potential members how often you'll meet to how what's the format do you have speakers are you going to do projects be clear this can change but being clear about it helps people make decisions what what topic will you cover are you about learning javascript are you running through the data science path the what is in a lot of ways the meat of of why somebody shows up why what's your mission what's your purpose why do you believe in building local coding communities probably you'll find some likeminded people that way and lastly who people learning x in y city or y university this is totally a great place to start there thank you so much if you have any more questions you know where to find me mike and you know where to find each other because now there's some experts in the group and this is getting good and exciting have a great day
