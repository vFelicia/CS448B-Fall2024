when I was spanked I'm teaching my friends had a program or even really just trying to learn myself it was so clear that there just so many barriers to entry so many frustrations and we wanted to take all those frustrations and remove them I was a political science major in college and went to the library looked at a stack of for dummies books on programming and didn't know whether I should learn you know basic or COBOL or PHP or whatever and so I learned JavaScript with Ryan's help and then I wrote the first JavaScript lesson for people like me if I could understand it then we'd help the rest of the world be able to understand it as well and in in the tiers we've been around more than 24 million people have started on that journey with us Sam's one of our learners who started to code on code Academy after completing part of our code year program he illed this website called outgrow dot me and it ended up being one of the times top 50 websites of 2013 and that was just an incredible moment where I realized here we had learners who were building real applications for the world that were having real impact what we want to do is be that conduit for anyone to enhance their impact on the world by learning the skills that help them better themselves and also better their communities we think about what we build as the fiber that connects a community of what is millions and millions of people and we looked around and we saw that resources that people needed in order to get jobs weren't available to them and we decided then that code Academy would be a free and easy way for anyone to learn the skills they need in order to better themselves and find a job so when I think about how far we've come with code Academy it's really just the beginning
