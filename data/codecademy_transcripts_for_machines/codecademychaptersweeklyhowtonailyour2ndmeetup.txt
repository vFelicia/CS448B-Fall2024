hey everybody my name is elisa i'm a community manager at codecademy for many of you you've already completed your first meetup and that's major congratulations to you um that's the hardest part i would say until it's time for a second meet up there's a lot of things that go on in one's mind and like okay we're gonna do this again but what if it's not all the same people who are svp or what if it's all different people um in meetup number two then from meetup number one or what if it's three people the same from last time but one degree whatever the point is that that fluctuation is totally normal that's what is expected for a second meet up because you're just getting started let me share if you're willing uh let me share my advice work in a ritual i thought about titling this video like the importance of rituals i don't know if that would have been interesting um outside of the context of like doing a second meetup and then a third meetup and then a fourth meetup but really what this is about is the ritual because so much of community building is about the rituals and when i'm saying rituals i'm not talking about ceremonies with like fire and stuff or i'm nothing extravagant i'm talking about just the little things that a group of people do that become the things that everybody can know and expect so like an example in us baseball we sing the national anthem at the beginning and then we have the first pitch and in us baseball we we just know like that's that's just well that's what we do it's what makes us baseball fans it's what the things we do make us who we are and the who we are as a a lot of times about what communities we belong to so another example much more relevant i hope um for the meetup that we ran at codecademy headquarters in new york city we did this thing at the beginning that immediately gave everybody a chance to see in some way who was there i called it mimi's um lisa i'm sorry to make you go through this but for everybody else who didn't go to the new york city headquarters meetups we would say raise your hand if you're brand new and then like the brand new people raise your hand if you are regular and then regular people i'd say raise your hand if you just came from work and then you could see like okay well there's people here who are like have lives outside of learning raise your hand if you're at work you could see who was like an employee at codecademy so that was just a ritual it was a thing that the new people were like oh okay i can see what's going on here and the regulars were like oh gosh here we go again but like they knew what to expect it was it was our thing um and then it was break and go go learn and break up into your um javascript or css or html group so it doesn't need to be an introductions thing it can be your thing um but my suggestion is to put together your thing for your second meetup and stick with it find your ritual the thing that you're comfortable doing every time and you do this so that your regulars and your noobs can know what to expect every time for your second meet up and beyond thanks
