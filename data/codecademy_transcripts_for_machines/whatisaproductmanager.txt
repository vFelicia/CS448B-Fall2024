hi this is Pat twopoint with code Academy I'm a web developer based in Washington DC a product manager can seem like a straightforward role but if you don't know what it is or want a little bit more clarity you've come to the right place the truth is is that there are a lot of moving parts and even I didn't know what it was before I really took a deep dive so in this video I'll discuss what a product manager is what is their main focus what are their concerns and how do they get the job done sound good who's with me so in this video we'll cover what are the three main themes that a product manager has on their plates the first is going to be the highlevel focus the turning an idea into a reality competition and the overall course direction next we'll move into stakeholder management which means working with the heads of the company working with customers and clients and then finally working with the team we'll wrap up by talking about their last focus which is product success the minimum viable product or MVP how to measure the efficacy of that product and then honing the product so that it's even more successful before we get ahead of ourselves we need to do a quick definition of what a product manager is so if a product is something that makes a company money in some way then a product manager is someone who is in charge of this moneymaking venture now this could be a physical product line or a piece of software or a video game or even a service that's on or offline product managers need to work with three main stakeholders to accomplish this company executives their team of managers designers engineers and support staff and the target audience the who the product is even for this is what a product manager is it can be confusing to separate product managers from project managers and I'll link a video below that goes indepth as to what a project manager is but for our purposes a product manager has three priorities highlevel focus stakeholder management and overall product success you see depending on how complex a product is product managers will need to break up the construction maintenance and oversight to their subordinates and usually those are called project managers but you can think of a product manager as analogous to the captain of a ship they're in charge of the direction the ship is headed but a product manager can't be everywhere all the time so project managers are there to facilitate a number of things that need to happen for a ship to both stay afloat and actually complete the voyage let's talk about the first theme here of the highlevel focus for a product manager and specifically how do they turn an idea into reality so times change and so do business models but some business models don't necessarily change but the product model might put another way the way that we do business today is a little bit different than the way we do it in the past but you know there are just certain products that will never change take take food for example a hundred years ago it would have been a foreign concept to have someone show up at your door with a bag of food you ordered 20 minutes ago from a phone that you communicated to another company through the thin air that's that's pretty crazy so product managers have to translate the spirit of the business model into something that can be bought but there are technological realities and challenges and benefits so a product managers main focus in the high level is to take that that product idea and turn it into reality given where they are at this point in time but that comes with competition competition is the basic premise behind our current freemarket economic model but there are very few places that a product can enjoy protections from competition from someone who things they can do it better than you or faster than you or even cheaper so product managers have to distinguish their products against competitors who might be doing the same thing or something similar this also means making it viable to the target audience if there's no one who will buy the product that a product will have a really tough time being a commercial success which means that the course direction is going to be really important the primary focus of product managers is big picture and where is this product going so while they may be involved in the lower level operations they need to stay as highlevel focused in the operations as much as possible that's because they're plotting the course they need to make adjustments to the product as the nature of the business and product evolves there are some factors that a product manager needs to take into consideration the things like clients and partnerships coming and going realworld factors like economic recessions or growth customer and market feedback competitors regulations and legal compliance there's a lot of things that goes into it but the course Direction needs to be the focus of the product manager because they have to see the whole field see what icebergs are ahead and where they need to speed up or maybe even slow down there's a lot going on there so once they're highlevel focus is set a product manager needs to work with the stakeholders and that could mean a lot of things but in some cases that means working directly with the heads of the company product managers translate the desires and concerns of the executives of a company into priorities for project managers to focus on they can also push back against some of these executives to stay on track if there is an addition or a subtraction that might deviate them from the course product managers are typically the ones that push back on that the truth is is that companies face a lot of challenges and staying viable in an everchanging market and and sometimes impulses are fears however wellfounded by the executive team in the short term can derail the product term so product managers walk a fine line between making things happen and stopping things from happening that could imperil success the next group of stakeholders that product managers work with are the clients and customers products are ultimately tested by who they are designed for and in order to improve on the success of a product a product manager must measure the success of the product so this could mean soliciting feedback conducting reviews and listening to customer bases or clients to understand their needs better sometimes how a product performs in real life is different than what was anticipated by a research and prediction so by working with who the product actually ends up being for and getting their feedback can help a product manager make smarter decisions about the direction of the product lastly to accomplish this the product manager needs to work with their team because a product manager is highlevel focus they have to delegate a lot to the team to work on and this means they have to take into account the team's different realities constraints concerns maybe the company needs more employees or specific skills to accomplish the goal this can mean hiring but it could also mean letting team members go product managers day to day is about finding the balance to get the product to market again the focus of the product manager is the overall direction of the product and working with the stakeholders but we measure the success of a product manager by the product success in order to do that with as little friction as possible oftentimes companies will make what is known as an MVP or Minimum Viable Product this means that although is nice to have features are sidelined while only the essential features are built for the product launch this can seem like a halfhearted attempt in product development but the goal here is to determine if the product is viable at all based on the customer feedback the clients and the market realities the thought behind an MVP or Minimum Viable Product is that if the product can't succeed with all the bells and whistles of a fully developed product it won't succeed with them so if we're talking about success we have to talk about how we measure success to determine if an MVP or a fully develop product even succeed we have to set up measure contextually relevant for our product because it is possible to measure a product by the wrong metrics thus generating a false sense of confidence either in the product success or even the products failure a product manager has to set what those metrics are because not all products are alike the goal is to learn from the mistakes as well as the success but we can't do that if we don't know when we succeed or when we fail so once we've measured the success or the failure of a product the product manager then takes that feedback and works with the company and stakeholders to expand or contract the product maybe even change the course direction so it ultimately succeeds sometimes product failure can be more insightful than initial success product managers are tasked with making a product successful and that might mean tweaking changing the direction nearly all products of the market have gone through iterative cycles of making the product better and thus more competitive because a product manager made course corrections along the way this is Pat with coke
