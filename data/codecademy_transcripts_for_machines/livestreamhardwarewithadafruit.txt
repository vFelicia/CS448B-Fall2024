cool all right and we are live hello everybody my name is sunny and I am a curriculum developer here at code Academy and before this I taught CS in the classroom and for the last year and a half I worked on ton of courses extremely proud of including sequel content using datasets from Warby Parker twitch the met hacker news some ml content such as the handwriting recognition and the street easy multiple linear regression lessons some C++ content such as the Harry Potter sorting hat quiz that super psyched about but the course that is dropping today might be my new favorite thing on code Academy before we get it sorted though let's spam and chat where is everybody from where are you from and also if you're feeling it let's add a fun fact about yourself what's a fungi about me my favorite food is barbeque eel there's an error arlynn from India hello Jean from France New Zealand from the United Kingdom Pennsylvania Netherlands Blair's for you Georgia London hello Kelly hello Gregory hello David hello Mary Joe hello spots night from Chicago so how many people are we at right now 110 cool as we're waiting for people to jump in the stream let's go over some the cool stuff that were released over the last few weeks we released log code on April Fool's Day so my buddy Josh is a frontend engineer on the grill team and I cowrote this chorus for April Fool's on Wako this esoteric programming language that's inspired by internet memes and cats so right now it is a easter egg course meaning it's not part of the catalogue you have to have the URL so go google you know code CAD me learn law code and you'll find it so please go take that our suite plus plus community challenge also wrapped up also concluded it lasted the whole month of March we Eric from Cali and snun from Turkey have teamed up and made a super beautiful recipe terminal app and they both got a cook yummy hoodie and I'll do we know who no deliver to their doors another course shops include learn R which is a programming language and software environment that is used for statistical computing and research and we also released learn C sharp this is super awesome a widely used language a generalpurpose language also focus not o P released by Microsoft so go check that out cool hello you serve Anthony from San Francisco Jennifer Charleston South Carolina hello Toronto Toronto Sudan greetings from Pennsylvania fun fact my cats are featured in our vlog course yes and also my two my cat babies pypy alfafa are internet memes our memes are course like still can't believe it anyways you're not here for those courses so today I'm super super super stoked to announce that we're finally releasing our first ever hardware course so whether interested in electronics wearables robotics IOT whatever this is the course for you this is something I really wanted when I was a student in college and I'm super happy that we actually got this out and for this course we actually teamed up with Adafruit we're not even start with Adafruit so when I was in undergrad I well wrapped around underground I actually joined the startup in Columbus Ohio called neo kinetics and this is this story actually didn't even tell the more in PT so shout out to them and we had to deliver this MVP it was basically for Assaf engineers with two cofounders and we basically had to deliver this MVP that was essentially a motion sensor exercise game for patients with parkinson's disease for the columbus hospital and as we're like you know research as I was researching for like what's text at what tech do we use we landed on csharp and the Microsoft Kinect okay and I kind of like fell into a rabbit hole weird setting you know do we use SDK one or SDK two so they are you tubing no worries just the same stayed stay in the stream you don't need to know too much for this stream but anyways as where I was researching Microsoft Kinect I came up the found this company called Adafruit right and at the time when I was undergrad you at least I did all I mostly only hear about due√±os and raspberry PI's so when I was researching about Microsoft Kinect which was this super stateoftheart a vast relatively lowcost motion sensor that was originally developed for to be at gaming accessory for the Xbox 360 and my X Box 1 so we're did we know we're looking at the SDKs for that choosing deciding on which one we found out that the reason why Microsoft even released the opensource the sort of software development kit for Microsoft Kinect is because native through back in 2012 Ashley did a hackathon open source hackathon where they basically did a bounty so any so they released this sort of hackathon for $3,000 and four of the whole world if you're able to hack the Microsoft Kinect you'll get this money prize so that's when I decided that's when I was like oh wow there's some companies super special on there like pushing that boundaries of opensource and Microsoft eventually actually did release SDKs as well as you know it's cool now to see like how its Microsoft Kinect it's actually integrated with their cloud platform so it's really cool to see like a you know a hardware company have such a big impact in the whole tech industry so this is definitely dream come true we actually cover this course with Lamar and 2pt as well as many other team members on Adafruit it's definitely a dream come true cool so can we use a tofu fried we know so a tofu is actually a company that sells I guess they also sells oh dude we knows but a tofu release a language called circuit Python which is what we're gonna work on today and you can actually program Adafruit devices in the hell do you know platform that I'll do we know IDE which is just calling it out there you know so this story you know hopefully I don't think L'Amour and Petey are watching right now but I'm probably gonna share with them to see like oh wow like so much has happened in the last four or five years you know so many things come around and we're working together with my you know my heroes I guess cool so today to celebrate the course we're also running a promo so if you subscribe to a pro annual subscription you'll actually receive a circuit playground Express today only so go check that out go check your email so which coding language are we using hello Elijah so we're using a language called circuit Python so let me scroll down real quick so today I'm going to demo some of the content in this course as well as a project so circuit python essentially expire on plus optimized for hardware it's a branch it's a fork a derivative of micro Python it's a programming language designed to simplify experimenting and learning to program on hardware devices it makes getting started with low cost microcontroller boards easier than ever before so the goal here is to actually build the best introductory chorus into Hardware programming because to be honest there's only two type people that meet people who absolutely coders who absolutely love hardware programming and also people who either haven't started or are intimidated by Hardware programming so if you have some Python knowledge this should be super easy for you if you have no experience no worries it's actually really easy to get started and this course will start with learning how to line up colors with circuit playground Express using buttons and there are three different projects in this course biplane plant care as a sort of automated plant system where you measure the temperature the moisture level the the light value as well as the 88 drum machine okay so these are super super cool projects okay so before we go into more depth let's actually let's just get started okay I'm gonna show you a quick runthrough of maybe like the beginning of the course this is actually is a pro exclusive course so what is circuit Python so this little video yeah wouldn't you skip this let's just a few seconds a few seconds we know we boom we hit you with a video and this is a little more by the way she is almost like the face of the DIY hardware space definitely leading figure even when I was in college everybody looked up to her so next we have the setting up by the way this right here is a circuit play rock express this little circuit board right here okay it's $25 it has memory it has licensors life sensor temperature sensor motion sensor aceleration sensor a double tap sensor it can play sound it can play audio files it can play basic tones if you tell it the frequencies and the duration you want to get the tone it has buttons so you actually supposed to beat this way okay back in so I'm gonna hold this upside down has two buttons button a button B has a slight switch right here a reset button it has cap touches along the edges seven of them which is basically like that you know it detects human touch it has neopixels which are these sort of revolutionary very stateoftheart LED lights where you can literally give it the RGB value red green blue values and we'll just play any colors you want super cool so circuit pytho hey hello Katie great question so circuit python is a programming language to be followed by Adafruit and circuit playground Express is the the circuit board the board this little circular device and Adafruit is a company that developed both of them please you know feel free to add some questions so he's it easier to learn Python after learning circuit Python great question so actually suggests if the perfect way is actually learned some basic Python so I'll say learn printing learn if statements and loops and then getting to circuit Python but because we want to make this course the best reductive course to hardware there there is actually no prerequisites for this course right because circuit python is essentially Python and place some more stuff cool so setting up so here are some items in the course where you test your USB download the circuit python from this file it's already downloaded and I plugged it in to my computer right here through a USB and after we played it in there should be something called a circuit PI Drive the volume or disk drive whatever you want to call it appear on your desktop right here it's all caps circuit PI an inside circuit PI there's two files well when you first actually load in the circuit python you start so you'll only one file the boot underscore file.txt a text file and inside it there is just basically some meta information about the version of the circuit python that you have not too important but the next file next to it the code a PI a Python file is the most important file so the code opcode PI actually controls the circuit playground Express okay so anytime you save it the board actually restarts it keeps running this file over and over again okay so in this course we're gonna basically update the code inside this file so that we change whatever this does so Anju Larsen if we sign up a pro annual membership today what was being thrown in so you if you sign up for pro Nia subscription today subscription today prescription I'm not sure what this is Ashley what you'll get in the door to an extra circuit playground Express mailed to your door okay cool so let's get started to show you a little preview of the course here we have a brief intro circuit playground Express is a perfect introduction to electronics and programming it has a built in USB support meaning you can plug into programming then the program just shows up no special cable or adapter adapter required just program your code into copi on this board and take you on the go and here in this course we're used circuit Python okay all right could this work as a Raspberry Pi hmm it's a great question so Raspberry Pi is essentially a mini computer whereas it has its own operating system right whereas this right here it's actually not a computer this is purely a circuit board okay which way is easier to get started I would say probably this right here and then you learn Raspberry Pi or do we know okay the reason why this was made was because we're trying to make it as easy as possible so what the learning difficulty of learning curves I always have with power programming is learning about the tech specs okay learning about all the different parts that's on each circuit board so right here we actually made a super super cool visualization shout out to Nick that's another CDF here who actually inspired me to go check on learn to Co a great course essentially you can hover over different parts of the bore and learn about the different parts right here we have an on button a green LED indicates that circuit breaker is powered right here this is upside down by the way okay here's a real red LED here are oh I'm sorry whoops oh sorry about that everybody so right here green on LED indicates the circuit pretty brown Express is powered on here is the d13 the red LED use for basic blinking this is usually sometimes used for the holo version of the hardware version of hello world right we get into blink to test it to debug it here are the neopixels along the edges here we have a push button be a push button a a reset button speaker cap touches along the edges cool there's actually two ways to to output sound one is through this little builtin mini speaker and the other way is actually you connect the a zero cap touch the a zero sorry the pin to a real speaker so you don't want you know you annoy your neighbors with it okay so after you learn all the different cool parts that come with this little board we get into our first programmable exercise so we'll learn about neopixels how to make these lights up here okay so neopixels are a revolution revolutionary and ultra popular way to add lights and color to your project these full color RGB lights red green blue lights at the controller inside the LED so you can just push the RGB RGB data to your device and LEDs will do all the work for you so they're programmable and circuit playback Express has ten of these okay so ten different lights inside each neo neo pixel there are actually three LEDs the are the G and blue and each LED is controllable by the circuit next to it which acts like a brain so to do this with code we actually first have to import the Adafruit underscore circuit playground I expressed library import the CPX which stands for is circuit play guy express GPX cool and all the neopixels can be lit to the same color specified using the CP X pixels dot fill function ok here's a function with the Perthes set of parentheses and the color that we want will go inside this parentheses right here so it should give you an example red is actually to 5500 okay are sorry rgb2 5500 and 0 means fully off 255 is fully on right so there's 19 to 50 2056 numbers so if we want to make all this colors of the circuit board Express circuit playground Express red we all we need to do is do this function here CPX top pixels fill parentheses inside inside this parentheses is actually a tuple of the RGB values so notice there's actually two sets of parentheses a little tuple RGB value that's been closed by the parentheses right here cool and to turn all the neopixels red forever you actually need an infinite while loop they repeatedly execute the code inside over and over again right while true the code inside is executed once Wow true yes it is true I see you again again again it's just basically an infinite wild cool so Gregory what would this course practically prepare me for so that's actually a great point so if you're into for something I almost always believe in is you know people always say is practice practice practice is sometimes practice can get you know you'll burn out right you know sometimes when I use a lot of other other platforms we're just you know Joe Joe you with you know a bunch of code challenges over and over again you definitely start to get a little bit bored and sometimes what I like to do when I'm learning to code is try to use the same language for different things so Python for example you can build a terminal program you can do machine learning NLP which ii learned you could with ltk with NLP you can do pandas for data manipulation data retrieval you can visualize data with matplotlib and these are all Python right you can build a web basically like a web developer with python with django and flask and you can do this right here which is robotics hardware wearables electronics circuit python so I usually try to use the same language in different light I tackle it from different angles so that I'll always be building interesting stuff and not burn out bored oh and this is what death will make if you do this you'll definitely become a stronger programmer okay so let's try this out in this exercise we're gonna light up the circuit playground Express first thing first let's import a module we already did let's click run very nice turn green so to light it up forever we'll need a while loop that will never end so let's add a while loop while true remember in Python in tation is very important unlike a lot of the other languages so I've added two spaces right here one two and inside the while loop let's pick a color so span and chat let's do a color first one give me a color everybody any color come on chat cool let's do that how do you pronounce this word cyan cyan cool cyan RGB ok so 0 255 255 right here very cool so while true let's add that in we're gonna use the CPS stuff pixels dot fill inside I remember we to do a 2tuple is this 0 255 255 I think so cool hit run it passes so now we actually want to move the code from the code Academy coeditor onto the circuit playground Express right so how do we do that the download button this time harm your computer keep oh whoops click the run boats down a long time keep okay we down it to add a level voter right here whoops let's to leave this one let's try one more time download keep whoops open and finder cool so this is the file we want we're gonna be dragged into code pi let's delete this one there's actually a easier way to do this I'm going to show you how later code pie cool save it cyan you can't not really see this in this I guess this is a green screen behind us that's why you can't see the little bit glitchy but all the colors appear it in cyan can you move a little to your left please yes sorry about that wait left or right this way cool awesome now that you've downloaded the code how long will it continue to run it will actually run forever until it runs out of memory a battery but because it's powered by the computer actually will never run out battery so if you actually do this with a if you actually add a tripple battery a triple a battery pack right here it will eventually run a battery but we're using energy it looks like a lightsaber eightzero cool alright everybody so now I give you a little quick demo there's a lot of more to this course let's do a project real quick okay we're not gonna get into the size switch the buttons amb let's just do a little well Rodney dependently up the computer if you have a battery pack yes so you can plug the USB the code will still be on the board you put a battery pack into it let's go play a battery pack and there we go cool alright let's go back let's show you a cool project that we can do so there are actually three different projects in this course a bike leg and we actually handpicked them cuz I usually like to have them sort of triangle you know the trio of projects at like cover different a wide variety of projects topics so the first one is by Clay SEC one is a plant automated system where you measure the temperature measure the moisture level measure the light value you plot it you pay said I see the the temperature variations during the day and the last one is a drum machine using fruits so today our from our Bach and Hannah buddies on Academy team basically told me to do the bike project okay so let's do this real quick it's actually the first project in this course before we get started let's to leave this works basically you actually don't see the code cool all right so the bike light project it's your first day as a hardware designer your first task is to create a customizable bike light for the guy from Brooklyn New York a delivery man that relies on his bike to get you started on your research your boss left a circuit playbacks press on your desk there's numerous inputs and neopixels for lights how fragile is this device it's actually pretty decent I've been carried in my pocket for least six months now dropped it multiple times still fine crit Zoe is in the chat cool create a customizable bike light for your client you will look at how you can define colors in code and use that to make some flying missions with neopixels what are you waiting for let's get started so here's a sigma disclaimer do not use at your soul by plane this is actually pretty strong but just in case you know you should have your to find them back not sure what's the New York law for this but more the better right cool so first things first listen for the module that we need so Adafruit underscore circuit playground Express there are actually two ways to program a circular bearings for us one is using this module this library with a bunch of functions in it the CPX functions but it's not great for a memory management force it's not great for the more lower level computing that you want to do so there's actually another set of functions that you can learn a little bit later about if you take this course so you have more control over the analog pins okay so circuit playground has 10 builtin neopixels the neopixels are number of clock counterclockwise from 0 to 9 for example to make the needle pixels read every base to do a live look so i actually skip this and when i did the lesson demo this is actually a later exercise but instead of using the CPX fail function you can actually specify individually each how each which color to give each of the the neopixels right so I'm still doing CP exfil blah the color for all to turn all of them to a single color Li do basically 10 of these index serie give it a red color index 1 you give it a blue color index 2 you have a orange color you know make a rainbow whatever you want okay so this code so this code right here we'll turn all the neopixels to red and this code right here specify only the neopixel index zero take off the outer parentheses so this co right here actually specify it to turn only one of them neopixel but in neopixel index 0 to red ok so two different functions a couple with it cool so there's two way to do this one is to do I'm gonna show you that the longer way to make all the colors into red remember I just showed you you can either do this to 5500 is right oh I am NOT a fan of these hotkeys are really small so basically you can do like two three four five to nine so right here I made if I you know let's do the circuit board Express I made six of the neopixel into red but if I want to make all of them read you can refactor your code to just be when I showed you in the lesson CPI stop pixels dot fill cool hit save download the code Oh we'll just keep this window of this code into the circuit board this go got pie and now the whole thing is red cool let's continue check this box check this box check the spot where you factored the code got it to the board red lights your pure very nice so the on and off switch the second phase so now you have something working you show your product manager the prototype this little scenario we can't blow more I came up with great work the lights are nice and bright but that will mean that the batteries were drained while the Bicas part the Quarrier is making deliveries can we add can we add an on and off switch this will conserve battery so it lasts all day so let the phase to begin before I move on to the part 2 anybody have any questions so we just got the whole neopixels all the neopixels to turn red cool no question so the circuit playground Express has a slight whistle I switch right here right underneath the the reset button inside the while loop so actually we can use a slide which to make an on and off button basically we can do slice which is the left will go read your side switch to the right it's it turns off okay so inside the while loop let's run it if same a conditional statement that turns all the neopixels red when CPX is on its left so wow it's true if CPX switch it's true so you can't even do this way or you can do it before you go to chew and we're gonna end this the code on line five to make it inside the if statement okay I'm gonna click Save next let's add an else statement that turns all the neopixels off so if CPS not switch it go to true would travel to the red else one we're gonna turn to off and how do you turn it off well you just do zero zero zero a tuple of three to put zeros safe is it possible hello gaming gamer is it possible to add external Assessors to it absolutely you can actually connect cap touches to fruits to other sensors yeah go check on the Adafruit comm to see a bunch of stuff that you can do with this with external sensors capacitive touch these things around on the other edge Marielle sunny may even cover some of that maybe ya public Zoe cap touch ya shout out to Marriott Zoe cool let's see if this worked so save download I almost want to show you how to do this the easy way but well move this into the circuit by volume or drive delete this cool loaded the code onto the board so let's see right now it's on let's turn the slide switch and now it's off on off slide switch on slice switch off very cool cool so you show this to your client part three you show this your client he loves it was but he asks is there any way I can make it blink so python has a time dot sleep function from the time of to use it you must first add this live code to the top import time actually you start doing him for Thomas to from time in course okay then to make the program holder sleep and this actually allows to use a sleep function which allows us to hold the program for an excellent number amount of seconds or sleep the program for X number of seconds how do you get the free hardware I'm not finding that when I go to the sign up page so you should get an email little cute girl you should get an email today this morning on the details how to do it yeah and Alex right here we'll put a link in the chat so you can sign up for this yeah let us know what you think let me know what you think now if you take the quiz cool so we added the sleep library and now let's change the code so that it turned the neopixels read sleep for fun 0.5 seconds and then we turn the neopixels off okay so let's do this when a slice which is to the left when I turn it on turn it red they're gonna sleep it beside the parenthese when it is 0.5 number of seconds and then I'm going to turn it off CPI stop pixels fill cool but yes let's test the blinking click download to download the code app I see let's download it I messed up I should have definitely showed this earlier how to change the setting of your download button delete it change it to code up I cool now we're good let's see sighs switch whoops just absolutely hit the reset button let's double click it you see this cool so something is a little weird is happening it's not holding for 0.5 seconds okay let's go down so why is it blinking like the way we wanted to blink off blink oh well let's walk through the code one more time so inside our code we actually turn the neopixels read slept it for 0.5 seconds and then we turn it off and the loop ends and we go back to the top again okay the wait after we turn the neopixels we never let it hold for sleep for sometime after we turn it off for the blink we actually never let a holder sleep for sometime and a while loop go back to the beginning and the neopixels turn read again that's where you see this weird not consistent blinking can you see this okay so this actually is super telling at stake and all it is is we add a sleep function after so so this is actually really interesting and this actually I didn't really you know connect the dots but when you're developing hardware when you're doing hardware design the code is actually a lot shorter right like the software part just with the software development part is actually a small part of it l'amour tell told us this when we met went over to the office and it's usually really hard to pinpoint we do software debugging compared to Hardware debugging it's actually a lot tougher to find that error right you got a zero this is a hardware problem this is a software problem they're actually two separate world of things that you got to check for and that's why we left a sort of a bug scenario scenario for you to exploit let's save it one more time download keep cool let's move it to circuit pipe delete this Giroud up high cool here we go on ah ah do you see how it's more consistent not like this faster on I like longer on and a shorter off it's a slight consistent on sleeper 0.25 second Oh a second very cool Bryant looters off Todd big but when you plan to add more advanced opposites ooh chocolate so I think we're working alright right now Zoey and Nick are two fellow C dubs I think soon next kill a month okay within the next couple of like before May I remember I saw the yeah we'll see called don't don't be afraid to jump back answer that or Zoey or Nick there we go Sonny's right we're cool sorry about that very cool so now you learn how to do this you can add more you can do a rainbow color you can do a faster blink if you press a or just slower blink if you press B so hopefully you know some of you will sign up for the course take this course work on the code a little bit and then send us your projects and if it's really cool will actually show this to the world by adding your project to the last step the last check point of this project very cool so in your fruit so code Academy XA tofu is finally happened wanted you know a hardware course on code kami years ago before I joined the team it's just been a crazy you know it's almost like the last year and have it's almost like dog years you go through CDs it's been a blur but super super happy to see this on our platform any questions any questions Hardware related whatever you later career related code can be related this is your time if you join this if you join the stream a little bit late if you sign up for a pro subscription today they in your plan you actually get the circumflex press in the mail for free kyun anytime anybody questions questions questions my name is it law so Ryan gamer my name on ticktock is blah your username on the tick tock app who will sit on the Iron Throne actually I actually didn't get to watch Game of Thrones last night because I was polishing this but tonight I'm definitely at lunch at first episode thank you thank you one vtec can you program with std what's SCD standard I'll do me no code STD not sure so yeah you can actually program this the circuit playground and the circuit player I express using out doing a ID not sure if that's a question so if I set up a pro what other extra things can I learn from the above free courses right so our pro course is currently our pro membership currently offer a variety of different courses learn Python 3 machine learning and every course will have projects and quizzes that you can happen to see for example icy pond supplies every single module every single lesson has three different products that accompanies it so that's like an easy project a middle project and a difficult project there's also a CLL community a slack channel where all the Poorna learners can help one other to grow to debug to to answer each other's questions to to be motivated what is the simplest programming code to start learning hello Carlos I seem to hop in a different one that's a never get far as I feel a bit overwhelmed interesting so this is actually a very common thing you're gonna feel as you know so Carlos are you a are you a are you selftaught programmer are you in going for a CS program or are you in a boot camp before I can answer this like before I can help you I need to learn a little bit more how does this compare to Raspberry Pi so this is actually not a minicomputer does it have like WiFi we connect connect to where as Raspberry Pi is basically its own little mini computer with this operating system for a hackathon actually at KU kami Marielle Zoe to my teammates here Ashley worked on a welcome bot for our code camis main interest for office basically when you go in we're still like trying to debug that right now but you know when you go in you can actually hear an mp3 file of suave our team members saying hello welcome to cope get me in the morning it's basically this sort of like a breath of air you know or like this sort of I guess it's like this prayer before you get on office sometimes like when do your unless you're not having a great day sometimes your own set you selftaught so Carl stop talk call so this is actually a very common thing especially when you're selftaught is protamine is basically like the CEO of information it's always expanding expanding and growing evolving right so to keep up is one thing but like to even get started learning is a completely different a very tough thing to do right it's like same thing as you learn when I say like same thing as you learn German or Japanese what I would do is try to program as much as possible it doesn't happy you know you gotta find your own personal learning style right like for some people it's like code a little bit every single day for me it's like I do these sprits where I just go ham and just wait I just like code nonstop for a week and then just rest for a little bit yeah it's an interesting thing I don't I think just tap try to you know emerge yourself with as much learning it's possible on different platforms on multiple different various different plans to figure out what your videos the best who frees you to code kami like this interactiveness and also meet people and actually another thing that I'll say is do this it's hard to get those small wins and those big wins in programming when you're doing it early on so you know build your own little program super early on and also try to find a team that some so actually we had a an on site sort of like a meetup event a week ago where actually somebody asked me that and asked me like what was my biggest win and my biggest win is probably when I made something real when I worked at neo kinetics where just for people like people here at Co kami actually hops more time on this a little earlier people like you think I've worked really hard at code kami but we didn't know it's before it go get me ice so pretty much so my soul you know teaching and even before that when I worked on neo kinetic steam for for three and a half months it was just I cut it I cut off social media that cut off it was just literally for 34 months nonstop working and that and I think I learned more in those 34 months that I've learned in my whole first two years of college outside and you you know you shut out to author who taught me who like mentored me and taught me a csharp taught me just you know there are definitely moments where it was definitely not struggle there or like we slept and then computer lab but now looking back I still got one more of those in me you know you know I stood it was just a really good time and I learned so much because I had this sort of mentor it was a little bit older than me and yeah so another question oh you're all gonna do other streams on this hardware at curriculum I'm not sure if depends on if people take this course who knows if you like it to you this will has snow give us feedback share our Twitter share on social media and if you like it we might do some others to cool stuff later Carlos for sure yeah just keep doing it if it's easy you'll be boring telling you I tell everybody list if it's easy it would be really boring you know the one reason why I got in tech is because there's your sniffing amount information to learn it's you slowly get into it and and I I really don't like that you know the phrase like fake it till you make it just just learn it if you don't know it just learn it don't ya that's not and it builds up everything you do builds up and that's another thing can I go freelance with Pro yes yes how fast so if it depends on what you want to do hello Katie this is a question from Katie freelance with Pro so depends on what you want to do for I think the low the lowest level entry for the tech industry is probably web developing did Alice this sort of entrylevel junior level positions and I'll say I've seen in CL community the SAC channel community like there are people who found a job after 10 8 8 to 10 months but with that you have to network you have to connect the people you got to have a thick skin and then thanks again right thick skin is for to reach out to people in this case like you have this level of trying to hit this level of quality okay army 95c spec I'm a sysadmin an infrastructure guy and have always been Durst and programming touch some of your free courses well this possibly be a good transition is that support hardware currently yeah absolutely I think this will be a great and super fun and like course to get into Python right circuit Python Python they hopefully will spark and this I always tell people this like everything build on code Academy are this points you can build a game you can build a webpage you can build a data visualization but it's all constrained by this sort of monitor and when you see your code come to life and hopefully you know it lights up this light up your inner fire similar to like you know when you open up a Lego box for Christmas when you're a kid and hopefully you're like okay this is actually not too bad this is actually super addictive super fly super magical please please share if you work on this course please share us like show us what school stuff you build they're actually so many different things they can build with this so alright everybody so this yeah so sunny you keep you keep answering questions so I'm I'm Alex I've never done any hardware stuff before but I was watching sunny stream and so I wanted to so I know Python a little bit and so I want to play around with the colors so you get the colors to change every time so it's Donny you keep answering questions okay I'm gonna I'm just gonna I'm gonna see see what what else we can write this so this is a kind of shame that I always that we personal yeah so keep asking questions I will I don't do this so it's telling my idea is that okay what's have a variable for red and then each time through this loop increase that variable by one mmhmm interesting so you basically set so the RGB value g/b value you set the art as like a bearable yeah increments like throw some green there call that's cool and then we'll also do do you want to explain what modulus um so you know we could so what so on line 14 oh and I'm like way in the way so live 14 you see a little percentage symbol if you haven't program in Python or some other generalpurpose prime modulus symbol it returns to remainder so it finds basically we're dividing read the variable by 255 and whatever is a remainder what is the leftover is returned okay so for modulo 245 to there's a remainder of 0 so it zeroes return 5 modulo 2 yeah so the idea here is that we're gonna start red at 0 every time through the loop red is going to increase by 1 so it's gonna get more and more and more red and then when red hits 256 it's gonna go back down to 0 so we're never gonna have anything more than 255 and the idea here is that you're signing show me how to show me how to do this yeah so if I download it yeah yeah we can show them the school yeah let's keep answering questions though call so you basically move whatever it's downloads yeah cool army 95 CSC spec there's so many options out there have not so many programming options and I've not picked a path on which language I want to dedicate my state up yeah so this is actually a very interesting thing I actually always tell me about just don't we always have this grand vision like hey I want to be you know I want to master this programming language I think just when you start out learn try out test out you know dabble in multiple different languages figure out their domain that you want to you know want to work in don't care about you know how much money you gonna make don't care about any of that what makes you enjoying like what makes you get you going what like makes you tick right whether it's game development whether it's making data visualization interactive data services is a 3d game developer it's a 2d game element do you want to do in unity or a VR or AR or do you want to do it for HTML based like a web browser browser based video game you know do you want to build a GUI app a desktop app do you want a bit build a mobile like figure these things these things out first and then you know dabble a little bit make sure that's the right one and just double down on that but before you double down on like a single language I would say just try out different different things you don't know what's your favorite what's your thing to try um let's see Emily said how is a deferred different from Arduino is it better Wow so so so so I'll do you know has been around for a while and Adafruit actually sells this again different words start to play toys for us I think we said a fruit from Emily yeah yeah so you know for even when I was undergrad there are basically two companies that are like the pillars of hardwood space do you know where as bait pie and if it became kind of like came around underneath and start gaining momentum but basically for me I'll do he knows they're razmik I were always like super difficult to like to get started on right and it's always intended like I remember you my web apps lab we've built door unlocking well Gino back the day there was no tutorials really online like two to five of these sort of how to get started and Adafruit came around selling raspberry pies manufacturing and Reno's and selling stocking different circuit boards and the reason why they came out with this is that they want to make the easiest the most easiest perfect way to get you to get started so they build its circuit board and they build they develop this program in which go circuit like that so it's basically a little easier and also a tofu's our neighbors they're eight blocks away also located in Soho yeah that's a good question yeah there's a ton of computer occupy definitely worse to open to what kind of support will be available when I'm attempting to learn this so so that's a question from a are you tubing like how to how to get help learning this I think one of the one of the things that we offer with the pro subscription is access to the CLL which is a slack community where people can post questions or talk to each other about what they're working on the sunny put on a the C++ what was it called a community challenge where people worked together so that's a good space that we're trying to make that where people can work together and help debug each other's projects things like that yeah and don't forget the forums to and Facebook as well nick says okay sunny so my idea was see if this works I don't know I don't know if the green screen is okay so we should actually I don't think that's working so I changed the code here too so this is kind of a good example of how this kind of hardware we can help teach Python where what I'm doing now is I took out the the blinking look at that blinking and so I'm just making this loop increase red by one each time and so as you as a result over time the color the color won't change where it starts where red is zero and then eventually red will get up to 255 cool and just to make this laser can we do yeah we can do that yeah so this code is basically doing this right here so let's just focus let's just zoom in on these three lines okay yeah and even even this line where we create red cool right so red starts at zero so when the program starts and again my face is in the way which is annoying red is zero green is 100 blue is zero and then as the program runs red increases and increases and increases which change the color over time yeah so I don't know I love this sort of hardware stuff because you know even if you've never coded before in Python this is a cool little example of how variables can be used right cool yeah should we try we should try make all we can do random let's do okay we're like a little bit over time one last little demo so we're gonna first I don't know how to get a random number in Python let's look it up that's just yeah but let's let's check and also I'm gonna like make us smaller because we were huge my face is constantly in the way of this keep answering questions sunny is do we also get a mentor great question Katie so so I'll say in the CIO community you should just always ask questions anytime you have a bug in under confused by any sort of topic and we also have something called code coaches you might just have to Google this cooked which is code Academy that and they're also like I think by our by half hour sessions where you can like we'll do a oneonone session video chat with a expert any domain how did I I thought code kami explanations were not that y'all got to leave code sunny how do you any sleep it's just sleep for sleep 0.5 yes bro what I already upload code to the adafruit so you basically download actually you don't even need to download a code if you just want to do this off platform all you do is open the circuit PI all caps open that drive and inside you'll see a code a PI file a Python file and any time you make a changes and save it it will actually start the board it will just keep it constantly run the board so let's see there we go there's our random random color every halfsecond is it's kind of cool that's right okay yeah so this actually kind of art might be a little bit hard understand yes remembering inside the fill function there are actually two three three different numbers like a tuple just formatted code so it's like you have the first one right here mmhmm second one right there that third one right there and they're each so we're basically randomizing each RGB of each value yeah so our value the G value each each one of these is a random number random integer between 0 and 255 ok cool anything else dummy I think that's it cool yeah so life Sonny was saying we've got this promotion today only if you subscribe to pro and you fill out a form and I'll post the form in a second on in the chat but we will ship you what are we gonna ship we're going to ship the harsher itself to your door if you yeah Pro annual but go check your email good and there Yelp there's a custom support help forum go through and I think we're only doing that for the first 200 people that that fill out that form I think so so yeah but this last last I checked there's still a lot more to go so go sign up now if you want to do it don't wait till midnight yeah huh cool cool good job sunny thank you everybody if you have questions please keep coming and we'll see you see you later yeah all right I
