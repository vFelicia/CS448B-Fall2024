uh i always remember when youtube was down for like like a day that was terrifying oh yeah yeah all right well i think uh we are live now for sure so welcome jack to another episode of our series of recruiting tips and trips that we've been doing every week with a different recruiter code academy today is your time to shine so why don't you go ahead and introduce yourself a little bit of background yeah no thanks betty for having me and for doing all these uh yeah in terms of who i am my name is jack kraznevsky that is just a gobbledygook of a last name but it sounds easier when you say it i'm a business recruiter here at codecademy i've been a recruiter literally my whole career even before i graduated college um working on everything you know under the sun in terms of everything nontechnical to technical roles uh doing international staffing and all that stuff and yeah no i've been here what here at code academy now for six seven months so yeah no and one of the big things for me though if it wasn't readily apparent by the topic of this is culture and values i think it's really crucial that someone has a good understanding before they join an organization as to what you know their culture is what their values are and how they can you know add to it or if it's right for them all right i think my uh right off the bat i'm already wondering um how often do you come across candidates that mention that i mean i'm assuming that when you are doing phone screens uh there might be some time for them to ask you questions how often do you find candidates that worry about that say hey yeah i'm worried about your values or i'm worried about the culture i'm worried about the things that drive this company the mission yeah actually it's really funny um literally right before this someone asked me that question during a phone call um it comes off i'm gonna say probably comes up about almost every single phone interview we have we as recruiters have and it comes up usually during some hiring manager screens that we do it is always at the forefront of what candidates are thinking about in terms of they want as much insight as possible into what that team is the way they phrase the question usually differs though but it's all the same thing it's usually around what's the team like um how would you describe the team dynamic what's the culture there the values don't come up as much but they always kind of hinted like oh like what are the things that drive the team forward what are like the guiding principles um so i'd say it's almost a daily occurrence and if there's a day that doesn't happen i grow concerned because that means like what has happened right but it's always usually uh interesting when someone actually says it at the very beginning the conversation because we do save time at the end to answer any questions but people sometimes go out to pads like i want to know what's this team like can you tell me more about the team the dynamic who this reports to how many people are on the team and how do they all work together so it's very common so does that all fit into that category of culture missions values if somebody asks you oh what is a typical day uh there the company like or oh what's uh what's your favorite part about working with your teammates or so i'm assuming that those those are all kind of like in that category of like trying to gauge what it's like to be a teammate at that place no and i would say like it sounds silly but the typical day one is also does really well felt fall into you know that culture piece right what is the culture of this organization because if someone responds with well we're all up at 5 00 a.m we're working till 8 o'clock 11 o'clock at night um that usually shows that you know that's you know the type of culture have that's the work environment they have their early birds or they stay up late kind of thing um or in terms of where people are sometimes located or just the habits that the employees have like oh i never log off we we're all online like the moment we get up kind of thing um and if that's not what you're looking for that's a great way to understand like okay their typical day to day doesn't line up with me because you know xyz maybe i have to take care of my kids in the morning or at night you know i'm doing night classes um so it's you know all the falls underneath the culture because the values help drive the culture of the organization like those north stars that you follow and everything kind of trickles down from that so if there is a value that is kind of leads that culture in that direction of like oh hey we are people that like we don't rest until there's perfection yeah you kind of have that like oh yeah we literally might not rest until there's perfection kind of thing like we put in the blood sweat now so then we can rest once it's you know launched um so it all ties into the overall culture and the worklife balance is ties into it as well as even just you know what's your favorite part if you cannot answer that question honestly and quickly uh that means maybe something's wrong with the culture there or if the interviewer like you know you're talking to uh says oh you gotta let me think about that and they don't go well i love so many things right after slightly concerning because there should always be something gets you up in the morning as an interviewer as a member of that team right um and all those pieces kind of like almost like lego bricks stacked together to create the full holistic picture of what the culture is and what the values of the organization are i mean now that you're mentioning uh things that people say um now i'm curious is that um is there like a code is there a way for the learners watching this or the people that will watch it in the future is there like a little bit of a code of how to translate what people say like you're in an interview and you ask what's the culture like there like what's a day like and somebody says oh we are all very perfectionist and we really like to do our work well does that mean we don't have work boundaries and expect a slack dms at 7 30 pm and your weekends by the way are forfeit is it is it like do you feel like there's like a common language where some people can get some cues out of those or oh we all get along really well as long as you follow the rules so whereas like that's good for saying we are very strict and things or like listen to your boss is that is that like is there things that help you decode this kind of uh taglines i guess yeah no there's definitely those little things that should prompt followups because just because someone says my favorite part of company is x or you know we work like why you should always have a followup question ready to go because it's an interview it's a conversation more than anything as much as you know the company's interviewing you you're interviewing them to determine is this a place i can see myself being at myself contributing to so as much as if an interviewer asks you a question they ask you a followup same thing for them this is your chance to ask followups of now let's use that like am i going to get a slack at 7 30 at night 9 o'clock at night am i expected to pick up the phone if they call uh at any point if someone's like oh yeah like you know my management styles i expect a hundred percent for my employees don't be afraid to follow up like what does 100 look like for this role right uh when you know let's talk about the overall like for example are we doing you know what are our sprints looking like um you know and sorry start tying it back to the position right not just make it come off unfounded where it's like oh that's a little i'm gonna take his word that we put 100 in or her word that we put 100 in but let's dig into that what does that mean for this role are they maybe the expectations being a bit more lofty is actually there's a bigger position than i know that i'm actually interviewing for are they expecting someone who can do way more than i'm capable of and am i being potentially stopped for failure but then on the reverse side of things there's the positive things if someone says we're extremely collaborative or that we strongly believe in you know the mental health of our employees follow up like what does that mean what is good what does effective collaboration okay and your team look like um or you know what does a good worklife balance look like because a lot of companies do say and i think you know anyone watching this would say they probably heard oh we really do cherish worklife balance definitely in today's age of the pandemic there's a lot of mental burnout a lot of people are probably focusing on that um and if you can't go well how do you empower your team or this role to make sure they have a healthy worklife balance what does that look like to you and if they can't give you like a concrete answer or their philosophy start having additional bob questions of okay well this is what my thoughts are have a dialogue about it i mean that's probably tough for um a lot of learners i know that they are the career switchers or they're trying to break into tech for the first time and i know that with being a beginner or applying for junior roles there comes this sense of urgency where you say look any job like whoever picks up the phone that's the company i'm gonna work for and your bar is very low because you just feel like uh you have a bit of impulsive syndrome maybe you don't deserve it you're not ready um so anyone that gives you a shot you're more likely to say yes uh what's the etiquette um if you're thinking as a beginner and say well you know i don't want to do anything wrong i don't want to shoo away from this this job maybe it's the only call i'm going to get all month um what's is there what would you say is the etiquette of like okay you said that followup questions are good uh in your experience talking through a recruiting process how much can you ask or how far can you ask followup questions before you're maybe crossing a line that's gonna you know reflect the recruiter as well and actually that's it's funny that you mentioned that like for people looking to break in their career because that's actually why i wanted to do this topic is because i think people are afraid to discuss culture they're like i would just be happy to be part of a team you shouldn't be thinking that way you should be thinking about the longterm like okay maybe you'll be happy in that moment maybe the first three four five six months right but eventually it's gonna you know that the culture the values they hold themselves to could be detrimental to not only your mental health and potentially even physical health but also the longterm expectations of your career right a good mentor if you don't have that could be you know could be a negative towards your actual growth but been when tying it back to the like how far is too far when it comes to followups is the twoquestion rule i have to say it is like asking two followups if you don't feel like you're getting quite your answer um because if you don't think that culture makes sense for you as much as you may want to work for that company or like this i just want that x amount of experience just so i can break in is that just me detrimental though that experience right um let's say the you know you are going to be rolling the dice potentially oh man i'm gonna do some really good things that in a year from now i can be x y or z you shouldn't be asking that to yourself right so when you ask these questions it should be i don't want to be leaving this company here that should be the focus so if someone goes uh oh yeah our we're trying to work on if they're very transparent we're trying to work on our worklife balance here um you know that's why we're growing so much asking oh you you're growing so much uh what does your worklife balance look like right now or if they go oh we don't really have um a common one you hear is hey what does career growth look like for this role and they go oh we don't have that defined yet that's a great place to ask a lot of followup questions because this is your chance where i think to say there is no negative lying across in that you're showing that ambition but also always keep in mind that they are still interviewing you if this is a company you really want to work at everything you've heard sounds great but there's like that one thing that's lingering like in the back of your mind like oh i didn't get exactly what i wanted don't be afraid to ask at least two followup questions of okay what does career growth look like for this role and they can't answer well this is what my thoughts are on because i'm looking to potentially be this in six months or then following up with how can i work with you to develop what career growth looks like i think that would ensure the interviewer like oh this is a person that's ambitious knows what they want um without coming off potentially too pushy make it a collaborative kind of conversation um but it is a very fine line to walk and i would imagine it's also negative um if you're too complacent maybe is that also a red flag like if you're interviewing somebody so on the other side of the spectrum people that might be so uncomfortable maybe some secure with uh their own skills they say well you know i the less i say it's kind of like talking to the police right like nothing can be used against me if i haven't said it um is there also a negative of if you are too quiet or not asking questions or what the recruiter could also say ah this person doesn't seem to have the ambition or the drive or the interest they should have asked me more questions so is there also should should all learners also be worried that okay you don't want to be too pushy but if you are too complacent that's also going to hurt you yeah i would actually say it is very possible because ask any interviewer if someone doesn't have any questions at the end of the conversation that's usually like a huh they had no questions for me um but if they don't you know if you're very reserved like i'm afraid to ask about like the culture about the values of the organization because i'm afraid if something comes up that i'm afraid to kind of push back on or to ask further about it will only negatively affect me i think it's always important to you as a candidate to know these things these potential issues down the line or potential things will get you even more excited about the role right because there are some times where you know given a certain job market you may actually have multiple opportunities going your way and those little things actually might benefit you more like oh i remember um you know this person said this and that because i asked this one question and then that informs your decision at the end so it is very possible to be too complacent but also i wouldn't say from an interviewer's perspective they're like oh they didn't ask me too much about our culture that's upsetting it's usually just one of those things like oh yeah we didn't have as much of an engaging conversation maybe or that you might not be the same they might not think to you the same way um when it comes to a potential interview selection okay we have a higher xyz can it showing that interest in the organization and its culture is crucial because i think a lot of technical organizations are now focusing a lot more on their values and their culture so it shows buyin but also a desire to add to the culture um i feel like it's similar to what um similar to what javanese said last week when i was asking her on linkedin and she said well i mean i'm not gonna nix anyone for having a bad linkedin profile but uh it doesn't add to your application either right yeah like if you are a zero it's not gonna take points but it's not gonna give you points and other candidates might have more points than you it's sort of um i guess at this point don't ask yeah it's sort of like yeah that okay you didn't ask me any questions huh but you could have maybe you could have asked some questions and get some extra brownie points i guess like uh yeah show that you're because i mean i think uh corrupt me if i'm wrong but um i think that one thing one thing that people forget is that interviewers a lot of recruiters you also have your todo list basically like okay we are interviewing for this position we has these requirements you know this description so you're also not only your recruiting in the sense of you're trying to see this person meets the requirements but you're also trying to figure out how this person will add to the company and how they will fit in the overall company and how they would fit in teams and all this right so like at the same time these kind of questions might also give more of an insight for the recruiter to to understand the kind of applicant that you are the kind of candidate you are right it gives everyone more insight it's to go back to everyone's favorite test the sats you get you know if you don't swing for it uh you're more than likely just gonna get zero points if you get the answer right you're gonna get more points you don't lose points for for getting if you get it wrong you totally lose points though that's it it's very impossible to ask the question in a negative like a negative way of like because you also don't want to come off entitled because i think sometimes it is easy when you're focusing on okay how can this organization contribute to me and how can i also contribute to them it's easy to come off like okay what can they do for me uh and that's where you start getting into those you know negative points but it only is in your benefit because the most crucial thing is you know that ad it's an ad to everyone to the team that you're potentially gonna join as well as your professional career um i think it's so crucial to ask questions around how can i add value not just in terms of my skill but in terms of who i am as an individual being able to bring your authentic self to work every day because that's one of the other things about a really good culture you should be asking about can i be me at that job right and can i will i be respected and will i be able to by bringing my authentic self to work contribute to the culture here can i join an erg group or bring in you know suggestions around events that we can do uh can we you know themes when it comes to a hackathon or even just you know just a slack channel that maybe didn't exist until i joined right um and you'll never be able to know that unless you ask the right questions around what is what are the values of the organization how does this organization you know how can this role add value to the dynamic of the team um and if you don't go for that if you don't kind of have that more i'd say altruistic uh tone in terms of those questions where it's like how can i add while also you guys helping me out in terms of my skill set as a young professional within this field i think if you just kind of come from that more selfish like i just need experience so i can become you know x y and z later on in my career that's you want to avoid that but that more focus like how can i add is really crucial so i guess you can rephrase any questions that you might be thinking about ahead of time like okay i have my phone interview at 3 30 today you write down some notes um so i guess you can try to rephrase that any questions like for example you might be wondering about how often people get promoted or how much career growth there is in the role that you're going into so i guess uh using that has a guiding principle of like i want to contribute but also see how the company is contributing to me then i guess instead of asking directly hey uh when was the last promotion an engineer got you can ask something like what are the career growth opportunities at this role or like i guess you you're just trying to rephrase everything in that kind of dichotomy of definitely and i think phrasing is so crucial because it is such a delicate topic of values and culture and also gorgeous development right um but it's all about the phrasing and i would even say not even like tell me about the last promotion on your team but just tell me how you facilitate growth on your team because growth doesn't have to be just promotions it could be personal and professional growth or just skill set growth of course um and you know having someone that's because i like to say the best way you can get an understanding of the culture is the double check between the you know if you spoken to a recruiter and a hiring manager looking for that consistency in terms of how they speak to the culture if they come off two completely different things that means those two teams may have different dynamics because that's the other thing we're seeing with remote cultures is each team is starting to have a little bit of a different dynamic right um but being able to look for that consistency being able to you know kind of touch on you know okay the higher manager chat is that chance for you to really dig deep into let's focus on my growth or like the dynamics of that team because say it's almost like a filtering process like oh okay the recruiter has told me that this is what this organization's values and culture is and i like that i like everything i've heard now this time range is like oh this is the real true like second level deep of what this is and then during that like virtual onsite or whatever that happens in the future physical onsite that is like oh now i have the clearest picture so you should always think of each person as an ambassador towards those values right the further you get on it's not just asking the recruiter up front it should be at the front of your mind and definitely having some questions prepared write them down ask your friends what they think the question like of the questions do they sound too probing do they sound too uh too softball are they just gonna give you like cheesy answers uh or do they sound just right or if your friends are in the technical sphere how would you answer that question do you think this is a good question to ask answer of the pamphlet yeah the corporate conflict so um all right so let's say that uh let's say our learners are thinking about this and they're like okay yeah so culture is important mission values driven everything important okay uh i want to find out more about this in these companies do you do you know of any resources in particular that that people can use or like things that you could be mindful of like for example if you go to glassdoor and you look at reviews some people are going to have really bad reviews you know they exit the company in very bad terms and obviously they're going to have one out of five stars right i guess you have to take that with a grain of salt uh other people have good reviews i guess um how do you look at some of these resources like glassdoor or like reaching out in linkedin what if you reach out to someone that is having a bad month they're like oh don't come work here you know blah blah especially in bigger companies i have can have thousands of employees um if you only go by the word of one or two people might be you know might you might be actually not picturing not having the whole picture so are there resources online that people can use to research culture and mission or and like what are the caveats of doing this yeah no it's definitely one of the tougher things for sure to kind of research because you have a lot of skewed perspectives glassdoor is a skewed perspective of a company's culture because you have almost like a tale of two cities you have the best of times and you have the worst of times both potentially literally right on the same page and potentially the same role and potentially even the same manager it's like what happened here right um but then what i've found is a great resource in terms of the culture of companies so linkedin has a ability for you to kind of search employees of that company if you just look at the people there and this sounds kind of stalkers but seeing how active either leadership or like you know just any manager is on linkedin in terms of talking about the things they're doing the things they're participating in or how they're being an ambassador for the organization is a great way to see how engaged some folks are with the culture because it's one thing for an anonymous review it's another for someone to use their professional profile to talk about the company to talk about like hey i'm representing you know generic tech company number three right uh at xpanel those folks are doing it because they're really passionate about their organization and seeing if there's a lot of those individuals usually shows that it's a very engaged culture these are people that want to talk about what their company is doing i've seen some folks in my network who are you know on diversity equity inclusion panels because they really strongly believe in what their organization is doing around diversity right um and you wouldn't see that from someone who really did not like their job and like the values of that organization because it would be very strange if their company didn't celebrate diversity uh and they were on a diversity panel they probably wouldn't put themselves up to it there is the potential but they probably wouldn't do it right um so there are some fun little ways of seeing who's on there without having to send a linkedin connection or anything like that you can just stalk the anonymous side of the internet throw your linkedin profile on anonymous and just look at some people that are at that company um and then also just seeing what the company's um you know social media accounts are doing uh you can even sometimes find employees that are at that company that are talking about or even retweeting or liking some of the statuses that the company is putting out on their social media brands because they're bought in but also just always be mindful of the people that drink the koolaid so always go into with the critical perspective so that's where you get the holistic picture of looking at glassdoor looking at what people are saying social media um if you get linkedin premium you can also see turnover rates and then also then that all ties back into the interview because being well researched is you know always great don't be afraid to bring up uh i wouldn't say never directly quote a negative uh glassdoor review just because you don't know who that who you might be potentially quoting there uh but just trying to do like a synopsis of like hey i've noticed that a couple people have talked about you know leadership seems indecisive right can you just help me understand that so kind of that more like not directly targeted question like hey i've seen this because it shows you've researched uh because that also then ties back into you know you know so it said your research so it's a generally bad etiquette doing a full interview to mention hey i heard that uh you know your company did this i saw this in the news the other day or i saw this article like i'm worried about how this is affecting the role or like are you are you going to be in business in six months like i don't know like so it's a you it's a usually bad etiquette to frame so if you're in a interview you say well i'm worried that what this person's statement said goes against the mission or values or you know this one employee was tweeting about this or something so directly quoting that kind of stuff is usually a nono you want to be a bit more discreet or be more general in the sense of hey i've seen negative comments online or i've seen certain discussions online and and i want to learn more about this or that i guess you bring up a good point that i actually missed on was to see if there was any articles online about like a company's culture so that you bring up a good point of like if there's articles that negatively reflect like something has come out about an organization something was said by exemployee how do you address it you just have to be blunt with it they probably are expecting those types of questions to be honest like okay yeah we know that article exists let's talk about it but be careful of the pr spin uh oh yeah that was only you know we've taken care of it it's never gonna happen again um so just be very mindful that um more than likely those interviewers are prepped i would like to say if you're interviewing a company where there's been a i mean this might be off time but a scandal just be cautious um because maybe it's a really big company that you really want to work for because you know it's going to be great for you what you're going to feel in terms of fulfillment when it comes your role like i have never i've always wanted to work for ex organization but they just had you know a scandal kind of thing uh but just be mindful of that somebody got fired for having a bad uh yeah some bad comments they got put on administrative leave how are you handling that situation what are you doing to correct it but then also usually be prepared that those are gonna be prepared statements probably i mean in your experience how far do you think somebody can mold because we keep going back and forth and you're interviewing them they're interviewing you um i'm assuming that there's like a tug of war of trying to mold yourself to fit the profile that they're looking for so you get hired and at the same time not mold yourself so much that you're not yourself anymore right that you're just trying to fit the uh the the the round peg the round hole uh so how far do you think that that somebody can push it when it comes to neglecting things or ignoring things or red flags so maybe they're not totally dragged red flags so how much can you like give up i would say you would say like are there things that you can just say yeah maybe that's not so important to me or or well the brand like if i put this company my resume i'm set like two years i survived two years here i'm gonna jump anywhere i want um yeah is that how far can you push it really like in your experience is that is that a bad thing like to begin with you know i've actually heard ken say oh yeah i toughed it out for x number of years at this company because i knew it would be good for my resume that also speaks to the type of character that you are um in terms of what values you hold yourself to that's a like oh wow you're able you put yourself in a situation that you didn't like just so you can get your next job what does that say about us potentially and how you think of your role going forward right like what's going to make us potentially any different in a way even though we may be a better culture that's for you and you can add to but then that also ties into culture fit versus culture ad you're trying to as you said put that square peg into that circle hole where you're just trying to fit in right you're not your authentic self i think bringing your authentic self to work as much as possible super crucial um so it is very possible to bend and contort yourself to a culture but as much as that is great that like okay i'm setting myself up for future success think about what that's going to do in terms of your job satisfaction you may end up being one of those negative glass door reviews potentially in the future think about your job satisfaction your career satisfaction because i think looking back even at my career i have tried to do culture fits right where i'm like i think i can if i'm just here for you know i can make it like if you'll set me up for success but did it really like that's what it ends up becoming like yeah it probably helped immediately after but did it really help me long term did i grow in terms of the skill set as much as i would have liked um did i grow as much as i would have liked as a person right because trying to get yourself to fit a culture could potentially lead you to feet have some form of i don't say chip on your shoulder but almost like some you know some hesitation or some pessimistic views on just culture in general where maybe you won't be able to contribute to it going forward because there's a lot of sarcasm a lot of cynicism going around and someone that has a lot of sarcasm sarcasm can exist without being pessimistic um but i think you know it's so crucial that people are able they feel they can contribute to an organization's culture because that's how you're i'm a valued team member once you start contributing above just what your daytoday is in terms of like you know lines of code in terms of product shipped but in terms of the joy that you bring to your team members the events that you help your team you know conduct uh and throw heckman you can be the trivia king at your company and because you didn't do that any others maybe your trivia game's weak um but just being able to do that will let one you'll have better connections going forward no matter what those people like oh my god i love working with them like i you have now a network of referrals because you built true genuine friendships i don't ever also i should say i never liked the phrase oh we're all family here uh because it's just that's maybe the lines are getting too like you're dissolved between professional ideas yeah but being able to have strong friendships that you have people that you're willing to hang out without after work or have you know experience extracurriculars with um or discuss you know whatever pop culture topic is your fancy um those people will always remember you going forward so that the tech world is surprisingly small sometimes there are people that there are x number of companies and you'd be surprised oh i remember like six years ago like oh my god i remember you you were the trivia king of you know our squad that's a gateway in if you're not if you're just trying to fit in just go through it no one will i don't think no one will remember you they'll be like oh yeah i i think i think i remember them they i don't remember i don't have any negative feelings like that's not a glowing referral if that ever happens right um because recruiters do go okay i see that this person worked at this company with you if someone applies for a job do you remember that nick i i don't think i do that's you don't want that to potentially happen so culture hat does have great ramifications down the line where people will remember you people will be like um like even if it's your immediate team or the whole company depending on how large the organization is because you can stand out in a small team you don't have to be an extroverted person to stand out a small team or large team if your efforts are noticed for however you like to express your values and add to the cultural organization it will be notice and people either in that squad team or whole company will remember you going forward so that if your paths cross in the future it can lead to future opportunities versus i just got i did six months in x company and now i'm set for life yep you might cross paths with them again in the future when looking for another opportunity they might not remember you or they one of those people that become a youtuber because like x whatever it's like yeah that's a it becomes a title like being a former employee of these companies like x whatever like that's a that on its own so it sounds like yes you can mold yourself but what are the side effects and how much are you willing to sacrifice for that fit it's kind of uh it's kind of the situation it's like if you can avoid it and find a job where you don't have to do those things it's going to be better for you in the long term it's going to be better for everybody so yeah you can pull it off but like at what cost it's sort of like do you want to go like did i just waste a year two years of my life and you don't want to ever do that you know time is too short i like this goes back to a great little anecdote i had from a physics professor back in the day where he just and it's not this is not physics related but he just simply said we all spend our life thinking of the next thing after where we're currently at right when we're in high school we're looking to graduate to go to college when we're in college or looking to graduate to go into the workforce when we have our first job we're looking for our second job we never enjoy that moment we're in and it's so crucial to definitely when you're a young professional definitely with how the landscape is consistently changing that if you have the skill set you want to find an environment that you enjoy being at the moment that you're not thinking six months from now five years from now i'm at another company right okay you want to think of like uh tomorrow i'm doing this think a little bit more me it's always great to plan for the future but don't go i just want this done with so i can go on to the next thing it should be i really want to enjoy this i am here for the long haul kind of thing and if the next thing is that i stay here that's great if it's not whatever but it's so crucial to enjoy that time you're in to not have those like i just wasted five years of my life at this company you don't want to talk about it it's kind of like yeah i was just a stepping stone whatever yeah i couldn't it's a but i mean culture and mission and values these intangibles are sort of like a bit emotional they're a bit hard to describe it's not it's a spectrum more than a black or white like you have them or you don't so i would imagine that when you are interviewing for a role in a company there's there's probably like part of you saying well i don't have that but obviously i'm trying to grow i'm trying to be a better professional so uh it's something that i could get into right right something that maybe at this role i will learn about uh so how do you when you're interviewing how do you know how much of it is your own fit and how much of it is you growing into being a better human being a better professional you know you're better in your role like how is that how do you know if if that's okay yeah this company is not what i'm looking for or something like well i've never experienced this before it's like trying new you know new food it's like well let me try it out let's see like can you can you go with a mentality of like the recruiter tells you yeah this is our role this is our growth opportunity this is how we do mentorships this is how we do mental health and stuff like maybe some of the things you're like well i never thought about that or i never cared about that or maybe i don't i don't need that but maybe i maybe yeah i will i don't know so like can you do you have to go with that mentality of like also being open to because like you say it's a culture ad which means that you're the the companies also and your coworkers also adding to you like right it's a twoway street and that's the beauty of it i think you know one of the favorite things about culture maybe being to some people's existence is that culture is not measurable it's not as as much as we try to objectify it where it's like okay this is like this lines up perfectly kind of thing it is a very subjective field it's a very uh feelings driven field as much as we know the definitions for our values uh and what defines us as professionals on this team it is very subjective we can each interpret a word different differently uh connotation versus uh denotation is a fun little concept but i think what's super crucial is yeah it is a twoway street because you're going to be a you know as long as you're open to the culture of that organization it's going to potentially change you as a person if you know and same thing with you to that organization so just because like an organization has some type of value that maybe you disagree with potentially doesn't mean you can't change the culture there or they can change you uh and don't feel like you're flipflopping either because that just means you've been exposed to different cultures different uh facts different information but it's you know you also have to be open mindedness uh sorry openminded as well um because i would imagine i mean i imagine that a lot of people uh especially when you're talking about tech and and i mean this might be wrong for the rest of the world i know that learn we have learners all over the world but here in the us with the way that some views are very polarized sometimes people might be thinking you know they already go with a mindset of like well you know silicon valley culture is this way or that way or like you're already going and i would imagine that that's something that the recruiter will also pick up on when they're talking to you the candidate they will also see that you might have some preconceived notions so that you are expecting things to go in a certain way or raw play a certain way so i guess it's also important when you go into these interviews to go with kind of like the beginner's mindset of let's just see what it is for what it is let us leave the preconceived notions on the door and just find out what it is for what they tell you as much as the factfinding mission for the company for you it's also factoring a mission for you to them and you know to kind of tie it all back to codecount it's about approaching it with a learner's mindset because we all have our assumptions when it comes to certain companies certain industries go in there wanting to learn and you may find out that's not what you want right and that's fine uh if you know you can be open to like oh you know they you know they they work on you know west coast hours or you know one of their things is we're all family here blood sweat and tears kind of thing and i'm like i don't know if i want to burn out like that's not what i'm looking for but then you kind of find out more oh no that's what that really means or you know you ask someone about like hey like tell me about you know you know that perfectionism uh piece these are all super cliche values by the way but it's one of those things where it's like what what does that mean for you in your daytoday and they respond and you may have that assumption like that to me screams this that if i submit my code and it's got one issue in it i might be on the chopping block where in fact it's like oh no that just means we strive to get better we strive to be perfect we know maybe it's an unobtainable goal but the fact that we strive nobody gets five out of five push yourself no one gets a five out of five um we get 5.5 out of five actually we go beyond right but it's so crucial because even sometimes we read some of the values i mean looking at a career plan you go i don't even need to read the definition i know what that means and you hear it in practice it goes oh that what that means in action and sometimes you even learn like oh no i thought this company held those values deeply close to chess i mean it's all over their their company page everything that they send out is hashtag this value or that value um and then you talk to the person like oh yeah culture is a big part of our organization but we don't like those values there that doesn't really mean that much and that may speak broader volumes overall company but it will also show you like oh okay so maybe i was concerned about some of these values but in fact it won't affect my daytoday as much as i thought right uh it's gonna be like when it comes to peer recognition awards okay now i see it like we'll get the you know we persevere award right it's you know like that's rewarding and it's not like oh yeah that value exists because we are under an onslaught of pressure and we you know it's tough times ahead kind of thing it's more of like you know every job every company every role uh every team has its ups and downs and being able to work together through that is what we do and that's how it all kind of ties back in because you may first see then go what does that mean um yeah okay well my last question before we go into the q a is um we've been talking about culture and how to fit in it and what it means and how to discover it and how to sort of measure it or understand it better uh what do you what is your thoughts after doing recruiting and for so long having this experience with going through all the candidates what are your thoughts on companies that pride themselves in their toxicity like for example uh you talk about let's say i'm not saying that they're toxic but for example you look at a spacex that have a turnout rate of like a year and a half or two years like people just burn really quickly burn out really quickly because they have really long hours it's a lot it's a lot of pressure you know they're launching rockets so things need to happen in a certain schedule right so you hear about these companies that might have a really high turn rate of their employees but that everybody has that kind of mentality of like yeah we'll be here all night and it's very collegelike mentality of like we just get the work done because it has to be done uh no balance nobody needs the work life balance what is that um what are your thoughts in this kind of more toxic cultures and like some people are actually looking out for those cultures so like what are your thoughts so somebody says no i actually want that i actually want to work at this company because they have 20 hour shifts no and that's the thing that's totally fine that's the beauty of it right culture is something unique to everyone just because it's not my cup of tea it could be someone else's it could be that someone that wants to work those allnighters get stuff done you know maybe just like go crazy in their day they might see a company that has a very different mindset of like hey our hours are this to this and that's if you are on after this time what are you doing they may find that culture not for them and that's the beauty of it right culture helps you understand uh and the values of the organization help you understand like is this right for me because would you be happy to let's kind of flip it a little bit that person that wants to just you know work those allnighters would you be happy and satisfied working for a company that doesn't do you feel like you'd be like all right i'm trying to ship something and no one's responding because it's 3 a.m and no one's online right yeah would you be happy at that company or would you be more happy with the company that has that same mindset right whereas like we're all in this together they're all pulling late nights but then that does open up bigger kind of worms of what is a healthy culture in general which we'll kind of avoid for now but that's important is this what you want and is that going to give you the same job fulfillment and satisfaction if you kind of are able to contribute to that culture and i don't say just fit in but contribute to that culture and add to it right um okay we all work long long hours and all that stuff but you know maybe you know we we put the blood sweat into tears now because we want the you know those quieter times after or maybe there's peak seasons and stuff like that because i mean the hardest the hardest person to know is yourself uh how do you know i mean maybe you are like yeah i'm a hardcore i want to do i want to do those allnighters and then you know you start the job like three months down the line you said you know what i miss my bed so do you have do you have any tips uh partying thoughts on how people can maybe understand themselves a little better like try to frame their thoughts a bit better so that they when they're searching for this culture and these values and they know themselves a bit better so that you can you know have that contrast like what you want what you need what you enjoy versus what the company is offering so some of it is learning by doing right sometimes you join a company whose culture is just like oh yeah this isn't for me you learn what you don't want right and then you something and then sometimes it takes the right companies like oh my god i don't even know this is what i wanted in terms of the type of organization like oh my god i had no idea i want to be a part of a missiondriven organization sometimes those things just organically happen that's one of the gambles of one's career is sometimes you think you want one thing where you like oh no this is the type of culture i want and then you realize oh no it's not because you've been exposed by it i like to say look back at like you know what you it's gonna sound so cheesy but what are your core values what's your work style things like that start asking those questions early but also during interviews see what those companies are saying what those individuals are saying to you during the interview process to kind of piece together you know am i similar to this person in terms of personality and can i see myself being a part of this company's culture because i'm similar to them so almost reflect yourself on someone else um but then also just don't be afraid to ask questions just of yourself of okay after the interview going can i see myself working there can i see myself adding to that team um so just be consistently self reflective um if you want to avoid that learning by doing right because there's nothing worse than joining a company's going to go yep not for me this is too slow paced or uh you know this team structure is not for me i'd much prefer you know a smaller you know structure or maybe i might i prefer when there's a whole bunch of us so there's a bunch of people who can bounce ideas off of and sometimes learn about doing and also networking asking people their experiences is another great way to determine okay does that sound like what i like or does that sound like something i could add you know my authentic self to yeah i guess that goes back to what we were talking about earlier researching seeing what people are saying online maybe i mean it's a big part of interviewing i know that i've talked to uh other recruiters at code academy that keep you know beating the drum on hey you know don't be afraid of reaching out to people that work there don't be afraid to reach out and ask questions see if you can network with somebody ask them what they think what they do uh you know and i guess that also kind of gives you more of a window into what the culture and the fit is gonna be like and the value the and those missions that the company is working on all right uh does anyone in the chat have any questions for jack today because we are in our q a and i would love to ask him some questions if anybody in the audience have questions i think so far somebody was saying that yeah their bar is very low they have a compelling resume i've been too broke to stay in comfort uh so i guess that ties back to what we're saying is like sometimes you're not too worried about the cultural fit because you just need a job um you're willing to sacrifice and also weigh your own life situation that's an important piece we're kind of speaking from a little bit of an area where you can have some options if you wasn't never jeopardize your own physical wellbeing for you know not taking a job if it's that type of situation you have to do it that make because that aligns up with what you need as an individual to feel you know fulfilled right if you are in a situation where it's all or nothing go all in and you know this is an ideal situation is that you don't have to but there are some times where we as individuals have to compromise on our career aspects but know where you can compromise is culture a place that you want to compromise or do you want to compromise more in the hard skill area like okay maybe this job is you know not going to push me as forward in this term you know certain skill set as i would like but the culture is great right um or maybe this a company whose name maybe won't help lead me to my next big role or something like that understand where where you're going to you know you know what do you really want and then also where you want to compromise without just trying to fit in just like like you know just making it work uh someone asked if politics is off limits when you're interviewing i'm assuming because they said that they are in brazil their current political climate is pretty intense in my honest opinion it reflects a lot in work environments so politics selflimits i'm assuming that means you the candidate surfacing those or i'm assuming that's a tough question just because yeah i guess it's a kind of raising their concerns from a political perspective i'd say politics shouldn't play that much into it unless you're working for a missiondriven organization like an organization whose sole mission is this one thing and it aligns with you know a political way or or doesn't right um i'd just say if it's you know like a government organization or something like that i don't know this is a very very touchy subject but i would say if it's that you really want to work for a missiondriven organization that aligns with your values not so much your politics just your values and maybe their political you know meaning is one way or other just make sure it lines up with your values um organizationally it's a little bit dubious because organizations try not to be that political at times yes so this person is concerned about things so political but also i guess social and you know things like homophobia vaccinations all the requirements like there's a lot of topics nowadays uh that play into what you know people see themselves working at and i guess the kind of workplace is there like a general etiquette for these sort of more touchy subjects like is there a way of bringing this up during an interview in a way that it won't throw off the interviewer i'm going to say that's tough like if i was interviewing with you you're asking me questions i was like we're the last five minutes like hey fella you have any questions i go like um i'm a little worried about the vaccination requirements like her academy or something like if i ask that question would just we just kind of like take a step back like is there like a good way of asking any sort of political socioeconomic or social in general questions without making it sound awkward or negative or pushy but i mean this definitely this is all relatively new topics let's be honest right so i think the beauty is i don't have an answer right now because i think it is very awkward in terms of it's very recent you know kind of been pushed to the forefront a bit um but there's just the way of almost kind of tying it back of i just need to make sure this is of add of value to both me and your organization just try to focus on the team versus just you as individual to try to frame in a little bit of a nicer connotation right versus like giving give me give me kind of mentality or just give me an answer phrase it like so from the team's perspective maybe phrasing like that but it is this is all very fresh territory i am so sorry i don't have the best answer for you i mean i know that sometimes you can just ask you can phrase it in your importance your own framework and say well this and that is very important to me can you speak a little bit about how the company fulfills this mission or how the companies fits into this one area right like maybe somebody's asking also what happens if you feel like you've been led or manipulated during the interview to fit a role and and when you start you find out that it's not what they said it was like is there i guess the the real question is how how can you tell how can you tell that yeah painting all the rainbows for you because they're just desperate in hiring somebody for that role yeah i was actually insane because a company will always try to give you the best version of themselves during the interviews at times right and the tough thing is that's where you have to marry it with your research right because as much as you're interviewing them that's also your time to research and kind of see how it all lines up if something feels fishy if something doesn't feel quite right in your gut identify what those feelings are what doesn't feel quite right write them down try to formulate them into questions so that let's say they do move forward with an offer you have questions for them but the concern i can imagine the followup being well what if my questions put them off of me but they go like oh they're not bought in and stuff like that um the big thing you have to say is frame your questions i have gone through all the interviews you know i really enjoyed everyone i spoke with would love to just ask you know x y and you know z just because i think it's gonna give me a better understanding of this role and how it fits into the team and or what this team is about right and how they operate it's definitely a doozy because you don't want someone to be like what were we not being authentic during our conversations what you don't think we're i never said that we are yeah it's like you never said that kind of thing if they get defensive like that that actually might just be a flag in itself right if they suddenly go on the offense for your you know questions that you that are legitimate um because yeah if they suddenly go in then maybe they aren't selling you know selling you their version of their most authentic person what the company is and how it operates all right last question that comes from me how do you distinguish what is values mission and culture of company with the perks they give you so like if the perks are things like we have paternity leave we have long potential leave we have uh perks for fitness we have perks for books and study we're going to pay for your credits so you can get an mba so how do you separate what is culture from those like does those perk speak to the culture the company you're applying for or are they separate should be seen as separate things they they usually stem from the culture right there's something that motivated them to get those perks but sometimes companies just put those perks just to keep up with the industry like oh we've seen you know all sudden a company may go from having you know very limited pto or just your standard accrued pto suddenly unlimited that's you know probably just a sign of them keeping up the times um so things like pto usually probably not culture but if they have things like education things of parental leave some companies have a phrase on their company pages where it is underneath like what we offer um and then sometimes they even tie into their values uh because we believe in being lifelong learners we provide this educational uh perk or for example because we believe in worklife balance we have these different perks that focus on that unlimited pto great paternity leave and maternity leave plans um you know you know after x amount of time be able to take you know sabbatical or even someone's like we're about coming together we do big company all you know big company meetings out in you know uh camp in the woods like that that sounds fun and exciting but also it kind of ties into their culture but i like to say anything that's kind of like monetary focus always kind of be focused on where is this coming from and does this tie back to one of their values right if they have an educational you know like let's say they have a tuition reimbursement plan that is a flat out just straight up perk but if they tied into the reason you know we are lifelong learners we believe and we do a tuition reimbursement plan because we want our employees to continue to learn whether it be a new uh degree or a new like see how it starts tying back together that is an example of that it is in fact a part of their culture if it's just there for the sake of being there it's just a perk it's just there because they're trying to be competitive within the market so look what the company's values are and then go right to the berks page and see what's going on see if there's any overlap um but it is very easy for companies like this is our culture it's a list of perks yeah free food free things free time free everything like who doesn't want a free who doesn't want a foosball tournament every friday actually that might actually be an actual true example of the culture because everyone there is really into foosball or they just happen to have a foosball table there and uh no one plays on friday right so actually like oh are there still foosball tournaments on friday now because of pandemic but if someone's able to come up with a virtual foosball tournament on fridays bravo to them that that means it is import an important part of their culture all right got it well thank you so much for stopping by today on the live stream thanks and any parting thoughts for anyone that will watch you in the future uh always remember interviewing is a twoway street it is so crucial that you give them the best interpretation of who you are both as a professional and as a person but also you get the best understanding as to what the role entails in terms of the skills required of the position as well as you know the company's culture that you can potentially add value to do you see yourself being there and being able to be a part of whatever they do going forward so just always remember it's a twoway street and you know and never never try to just compromise on what makes you you uh and what's most crucial to you
