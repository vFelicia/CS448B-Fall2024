be fun i know i'll sleep all right all right so three two one okay so we're live great so everybody can see us now on youtube now and in the future i guess whoever is watching us live now welcome everybody for the next episode of recruiting tips and tricks we're doing this every week and hopefully we share information that is relevant to you looking for a job or maybe just exploring jobs in tech if you're wondering about uh you know interview etiquette review of resumes cover letters linkedin platforms in general um what to do what not to do what things to avoid to give you a better chance that's why we do this every week and this week we have will with us so we'll introduce yourself tell me a little bit about your background yeah sure thanks for yeah so my name is will rudy i work here at codecademy as a senior technical recruiter um here i mainly focus on supporting some of our engineering teams uh as well as some of our devops and product teams but uh background has been in technical recruiting for the last couple years i uh live in boston originally from the midwest but uh boston's been home for the last 10 years and so worked at a couple different kinds of companies i started in an agency i was working at uh chewy.com when they moved up to boston i was their 42nd employee there which was a lot of fun um worked at a couple startups worked at some larger ed tech companies and uh you know wanted to come to code academy because i really believe in the mission i was actually a learner years ago i was a technical recruiter i thought it'd be a good idea to learn what i was talking about a little bit more and uh probably not going to hire myself anytime soon but uh it's fun to learn a little bit and uh i've picked up my code foundation since i came back so um all right it's a lot of fun dropping uh dropping the knowledge right from the beginning guys you heard it uh he was researching i mean not researching but you knew about the the place you wanted to work at before you applied for it i think that's like uh one of the pro tips that we are always sharing here every week is if you are applying applying to a place make sure that you know what they're about make sure that you know basics of what they do because it's just gonna make you look better so today's focus uh with you will is we wanted to talk a bit about linkedin and the role that linkedin plays in jobs i know that a lot of learners here especially if you are is your first time your career switcher is your first time applying for a job you might be wondering how much does linkedin matter compared to a traditional resume a traditional cover letter or some people might think well you know do recruiters search for candidates on linkedin or is this just a showcase place where i share it like do i share this or do other people share with it so let's just get started and um i'm just gonna start with a really basic question which is will can you tell us a little bit about the role of linkedin when it comes to its place in the traditional application process of having a cover letter having a resume linkedin how how does linkedin compare and stack against the others yeah yeah so i definitely think it's a you know you want to kind of cover your bases and kind of work at a couple different angles so the resumes and the cover letters are great when you're being proactive when you know that there's a company out there that you know you're really passionate about you'd like to work there always great to have those ready to go but the nice thing about a linkedin is it's there maybe a little bit more as a passive resume in a sense because there are technical recruiters like me at every company out there that's hiring software engineers or they're working with an agency to hire software engineers and the main place that a lot of us go to look or at least to start when we're searching for new candidates is going to be linkedin obviously we'll be going through resumes and cover letters as well but usually um especially for very hyperfocused roles or specific experiences we are being very proactive and going out and looking for those types of folks and so having a linkedin it just is going to give you a lot more options and so it's definitely my first place to start it's not the only there's other sites out there but in terms of just you know again being that place to start and uh kind of get my feet wet is why i learn a little bit about the role um it's it's imperative and there's not really a replacement at that at this point okay and do you uh when you're looking at these linkedin profiles i know there's a lot of fields so you can personalize on linkedin so you can have a banner image like a splash at the top you can have your profile uh i'm assuming that all these things sort of like make your image to that recruiter and you know i hate to say it and a lot of people think that's unfair but that first impression that you get from someone uh you're trying not to be biased towards that but i would imagine that putting more effort into linkedin it's better than putting less effort into your linkedin right because i've seen some very bare bones yes yes no for sure for sure it's definitely you know the first impression you're exactly right it's it's the first thing that i see as a recruiter and so i think it's definitely just a place to let your personality shine you know that's not to say that you need to have a loud and verbose profile you know if you are more of a minimalistic person then it's totally cool but at the same time i would definitely you know be thorough and you know adding those banners or a picture if you're comfortable you know those things just help personalize you because you know at the end of the day you know it's it's a peopletopeople kind of relationship and so the more that you can kind of just let yourself um you know be highlighted and showcased uh it's gonna be helpful because at the end of the day you know you being yourself and the company being themselves if that links up you know that's really kind of what would be perfect and and so i really don't think you know trying to do too much uh would be to your benefit you know it's definitely just a good place to let your own personality out whatever that looks like and this uh does things like for example i know that uh a linkedin profile might show you the activity of someone on linkedin how much does that play a role when you're looking at a profile because i know that some people create the linkedin and they just kind of it's kind of like a go and forget it they just make it and that's it it's going there like that's that's influence does that influence your your take on a candidate when you see that maybe they're more active on linkedin or they've had references added there or they have uh you know different uh i think uh what's it called when when someone kind of like vouches for you recommendation recommendations so so do all those things also matter or you're just looking for general information when you're looking i think they definitely help i really try to get a holistic view so um you know usually some recruiters will start at the top some will start at the bottom but those recommendations are always really helpful because they're essentially living references um and so i always appreciate when people write them for me vice versa if i have a great experience i try to write them as well it's definitely good practice um to help your fellow job seekers out in terms of being able to if you have recommendations to share them but no i think when i when i come across a profile that looks like it hasn't been updated in five years it's probably not what i'm gonna spend a lot of time looking at and so um usually when i go there i'm looking for you know the relevant information recent experience and then you know breaking down some of the key things that that i know our company is looking for and kind of basically trying to see um just where that is and try to find candidates that have enough of the pieces that could be you know a potential fit because at the end of the day you don't need to have you know every single piece of information about your background on linkedin if anything it's probably best to you know focus on your strengths and so you know when i'm looking at profiles i'm looking at you know not only companies and longevity but also you know what kind of projects have you been working on you know are any chance that you have to give some kind of ownership or if you've you know really led something those are the things that really kind of stick out and so i think when people take the time to at least you know put a couple sentences add a couple uh you know bullet points to to your careers not only will it set you up for success in the future but once you do it once you know that experience isn't going to change too too much so it's just sort of that living record and so it's it's easy to do it ahead of time than to try to play ketchup and uh as a recruiter since you like you mentioned you go through uh resumes a lot um i would imagine that it is a good practice for people especially in tech roles to maybe include a link in their pdf cover or like resume uh to the linkedin profile so maybe if it's a developer or somebody looking for a technical role maybe even to their github repos if they have github repos what is the how does linkedin compare to personal websites i know that some people to showcase hey i'm a web developer so i made a website because i it's what i do how does that compare like is that is that better worse or just about the same level of like how does that compare to oh my linkedin kind of like not great but look i made these personal websites and here's what i really showcase who i am yeah i think they're complimentary i think you definitely you know having both would probably be my preference and i definitely will always click on a link to a personal website for a software engineer that i'm looking you know that came up in one of my searches because you're right it's a great indicator of what someone can actually do i think when i look at a linkedin profile i'm looking for a little bit more of a history versus maybe uh what's going on today or what's been built most recently because usually when i get a role from one of my hiring managers they give me more to go on than just you know a tech stack they're asking you know someone that's had experience you know breaking down a monolith into microservices or you know someone who has been you know a lot with product integration work because usually especially with companies you know at you know a couple hundred or even you know as low as 100 i would say they're going to have enough specialization where the recruiters have a very specific goal in mind in terms of what they're looking for and so i think a linkedin profile is great to have you know the history there but a personal website especially for those web developers or a product designer or anything that would be a little bit more frontend or userfocused it's always great to include you want them to kind of be complimentary as i mentioned because it is great usually if you're a candidate especially if you don't have maybe as much work experience any sort of personal projects will definitely be you know a benefit to your overall candidacy because at the end of the day it's a it's an example of the work even if you don't necessarily have the you know years of experience that uh you know historically is what people are looking for i think what other candid uh not kind of what other guests here on the video live stream said in the past was that uh a poor linkedin profile won't necessarily take away from your application but it doesn't add to it and if you are competing against another five or six strong candidates uh you need every every bit of help that you can get so yeah you know no one no recruiter at least a code academy recruiter won't look at your linkedin page well well this is not great polish polish so we're gonna move on like they're they won't do that but at the same time you're missing another opportunity to showcase who you are and your work your history and why they should pick you over other candidates so i feel like it's one of those places where it's like yeah it won't hurt you but it could definitely help you so you sure it's true yeah especially if you know if you are you know you're happy in your job maybe you're casually interested to hear what's out there it never hurts to have a linkedin profile that can just you know have options because i know that you know as a software engineer or as a technical recruiter you know you're going to get messages and some of them will be interesting some of them won't be when codecademy reached out to me i was very excited i wasn't necessarily looking but it obviously worked out and i was thrilled so i think you can surprise yourself when you take a little bit of time to just keep that linkedin up to date because it's how people like me are going to find you i would agree that um a linkedin you know a less robust linkedin profile probably won't hurt your candidacy but it really cuts down on the chances of me being able to find you because usually i'm looking for a very specific you know boolean search of key tech um pieces that i know we're looking for in terms of a full stack engineer or a backend engineer and so if you don't put any time or effort into talking about what you've actually been working on you know key languages and frameworks you're probably not going to come up in my search and so that's what i think you can really do yourself the most good is to just highlight that experience that you know you feel most confident about and then eventually a tech recruiter like me or will find you and it'll be a great fit but uh if you don't put anything on there it's gonna be really tough to locate you so what are the basic building blocks of a good linkedin profile are we talking about uh keywords or is it like hashtagging or just normal keywords uh are we talking about uh certain sections of linkedin that should be filled out like i know that it's a biosection a short description there's sections where you can highlight links and when you can you know link to your resumes and all the documents and so what are kind of like the main building blocks of a linkedin profile that will make it more discoverable for people like you recruiters and more likely to be heading searches right yeah so i would definitely say and this is kind of one thing i've just you know always recommend to candidates and i think it's very applicable to this and that's be confident about what you know be honest about what you don't and be very willing and excited to learn if that's what you really you know are interested in doing because nine times out of ten it's going to be very rare that you're going to have every single thing a recruiter is looking for and recruiters know that we're not expecting to come across someone who has every single piece but if you have the main components like for instance when i'm doing a search for a full stack role here at codecademy we have a react front end and so we also have a lot of ruby on rails in the back end so i am looking for someone that has both ruby and react now if you know ruby react in a handful of other languages but you know perhaps ruby and react tend to be the most um comfortable for you that's where you're the most confident that's what i would recommend you highlight and i think a couple years ago maybe even you know 10 15 the whole jack of all trades idea was something that was really sort of kind of you know much more i don't know maybe applicable to some of the roles in my experience companies are looking for specialization so it's good in the beginning to get a lot of exposure but what i would definitely recommend is really highlighting where you feel most comfortable because at the end of the day those are the recruiters that are going to find you and they're the ones that'll be able to set you up for success in terms of being able to go through the technical interviews and so i've talked to candidates over the years and you know they had a lot of languages and a lot of frameworks listed on their resume including the ones i was looking for but at the end of the day it wasn't a great fit on either side because it just wasn't really where their strength lies and so i would definitely focus on you know the work experience you have in terms of your key languages your key frameworks but don't feel the need to list all of them i would really focus on your top couple because those are the ones you're going to need to use in a technical interview you know once you get through the door so definitely there i like the recommendations i always look at them um just to see if it's you know past managers if it's peers because usually if it's a senior level role there might be some mentorship opportunities or responsibilities and so if someone has a recommendation from a peer like that it's something that'll stand out that i will flag to the hiring manager and so when you take the time to invest in in those linkedin profiles and we're only talking 20 25 minutes it's not like you have to write a book um it's just very helpful and will set you up for success maybe not right away today but you'll be surprised especially as you gain more experience um how many more folks will start trickling into your inbox and whether you're looking or not it's great to have options and it's good to just have some experience talking to recruiters i would definitely recommend have some conversations when they come through because it'll give you great practice for when you actually do talk to a company you want to speak with so um but the only way or one of the main ways that conversation will happen is if the recruiter can find you so um really highlighting those key frameworks and languages um talking about leadership and ownership you know those are some of the simple you know specifics i would say but uh but a little bit of time can go a long way especially in terms of you know the roi over years of how many folks will be able to find you so i imagine that uh the way that the search works at linkedin uh when you're writing uh your descriptions or you're writing these fields those become key words right and um it's interesting that you say that you you might want to be a jack of all trades but you need to be focused on something because i you know you often hear the recommendation that you should try to hit as many keywords as possible because when you have all those keywords then you're more likely to show up in everyone's church but it sounds like at the same time you're saying that showing up in everyone's shirt search might be uh what might play against you because the you you might show up in this in this research and there's recruiters and recruiters and they would just say well yeah great i found you but you're not what i'm looking for um so so yes you got them there but they're not you're not really going to that extra step of actually getting called or actually getting messaged right right right and that's where i think playing your strengths really comes into play because yeah you might be able to show up in a lot of searches but you're realistically probably not going to get through a lot of final round interviews if you're trying to cast such a wide net so usually today you know someone focuses as a and when it comes to software engineering you're either you know front end full stack back end and then there's some fun infrastructure stuff these days too and so i definitely recommend having the experience and really highlighting what you're trying to what kind of job you're trying to get you know if you want to be a full stack engineer make sure your resume and your linkedin profile is touching on both front end and back end experience if you're looking for a devops position make sure that you have you know some basic you know public cloud infrastructure work listed there you know aws is a lot of places but azure google cloud a lot of those skills are applicable and most of the time if you have some experience with one you'll probably be able to kind of ramp up in another a little bit more easily and so i definitely recommend you know it's in the best interest as a job seeker to have the highest percentage of conversations based on your experience and so if i would just you know i would rather have five conversations that would lead to four finals then 20 conversations that maybe lead to two okay and i would imagine that the way you look at linkedin is different if you've already had a wrestleman first like i know that uh i've talked to people before that said well i look at that resume and i have like ten seconds six seven seconds to get a resume uh if it looks if it sparks my curiosity and there's a link a hyperlink to linkedin i will click it just to get like a better idea of this candidate so does it change how you look at a linkedin profile when you are doing that has the first step looking for a candidate versus when you're doing that has a feeling after looking at a resume is that do you approach a linkedin profile differently yeah i think when i'm doing you know just some heads down sourcing and just sort of looking at a lot of profiles i definitely focus on the keywords because one thing that happens when you're using a linkedin recruiter is they'll actually populate as highlighted words when you look at a profile and so i can get a quick glimpse at a candidate's just how many you know how many hits you might have on a specific resume at first glance and if you start seeing a lot of that highlight you kind of start reading a little bit more detailed and so i definitely think you know again they complement each other i definitely wouldn't recommend having either a resume or a linkedin but um i do think that it's helpful to just show the exposure and get a little bit more of a variety in terms of where you're actually seeing some of this interest come in because it's great to be proactive and send your resume and cover letters out there but you'd be surprised at who might be able to find you there's definitely companies out there that especially today with software engineering they're hiring remote engineers left and right and that's not something that happened you know three years ago so i think right now as a software engineer or you know soontobe software engineer you're gonna have a lot more options than you even think but the only way again you'll have those is if they can find you yeah the i want to switch gears a little bit and i you mentioned that um recruiters reaching out to candidates on linkedin now i've seen messages before my linkedin i have it on my phone and it will pop and say you know you have a notification and i never know what it is if somebody mentioned me in a post or if it's someone said something or if it's one in my inbox um is there is there an etiquette on how long or how fast you need to reply to these recruiters or like what's kind of like the opportunity window like if you if you're looking for candidates and you see somebody you're interested in you message them and say hey i'm with code academy i'm interested blah blah do you want to talk how how many hours or days do do they go by before you just moved on on the search and it's too late for this candid so for me i think it's it's you know once i send that message what i will personally try to do is make sure i have like a followup cadence coming and so i'll usually try to send one or two messages per candidate but in terms of when they reply back to me you know the sooner the better the sooner they reply i usually try to have that conversation within you know 24 to 48 hours and then if that conversation goes well they'll be into process and would technically be you know less than a week away from a final so it's really up to the candidate and so a lot of times i'll have messages coming back you know a few days or maybe a week later and so i personally don't hold it against a candidate or really focus too much on whether it came back you know a day late or a week later um if their reply comes in and they look like they can still be a good fit or you know would be interested i'm just going to be looking forward to having a conversation so i don't think the timing matters but it's in your best interest if you are interested in the role to reply sooner than later i guess i guess if you're actively looking for work you should have the app on your phone and be able to uh to get on top of that uh rather quickly um how does it work i know that you can have profiles in different languages on linkedin and i guess this is more of a question of some companies are large enough that they are sourcing from all over the world or they might be able to hire from different parts of the world here in the u.s sometimes it's not unheard of of companies choosing from canada for example which is technically abroad uh even though they're neighbors so um how does it work in terms of these uh these profiles that might be in different languages so maybe people are you know students that are trying to get jobs in the us or they're trying to get work visas uh do the keywords on a search for recruiters work the same or get automatically translated or or if you're looking for a keyword in english it would only highlight the profiles that have it in english that's a great question um i'm not sure just because i don't have a ton of experience sourcing internationally most of my career has been very boston based and so mostly u.s focused i will say i do see translations come through quickly on linkedin so i think sometimes if i were to you know potentially click on a profile um i will see it you know be translated into english so i can read through it but also realistically you know i think it's just um it would if you're looking for jobs in the us you know i think you would definitely you'd be encouraged to to you know be identifiable by those kind of companies as best you can but other than that i don't know exactly if the uh the po if the keywords will translate but uh that's a great question i will show you yeah i know yeah no i'm curious because i know that a lot of our learners are all over the world right and and i always i always like to remind everyone that you know when we talk about recruiting and we talk about practices of recruiting we are talking about them from the point of view of the us and you know recruiting happens at different levels all over the world uh for example i know that in some countries it's typical to include your profile photo in your resume and in the us that's not the case so there's always all these little details and caveats so um i always like to remind everybody that um you know that's why i'm asking these questions like okay if i'm if i'm in europe and i'm planning on trying to get a job in a u.s company how that works well realistically like you said if you're trying to get a job in a place that speaks english you would want to maybe have your wrestling english uh and your profile translator i know that linkedin makes it really easy for you to have your profile in different languages so uh that i guess the the general rule of thumb is have it in english if you can you should definitely get uh yeah i think you will be more identifiable and i think yeah folks will be able to come across your resume a lot or linkedin a lot more easily have you seen any uh kind of like obvious or mistakes that should have been avoided on any linkedin profiles like i know that i'm sure that you go through volumes of linkedin profiles so there must be certain mistakes or certain things that keep occurring and are just reoccurring mistakes that you wish people knew to avoid is there any like top three or something that you could that you can think of there are things that are like don't do this yeah yeah i know that's a great that's a great question i guess the first one might be a little twofold but i mean spelling errors are definitely ones that will pop out the most especially if you mis use the wrong form of principle so principal engineer is al just for future reference so when everyone's later in their career that's a good one because that does come up quite a few times um other types of uh errors that are usually made i would say maybe and it's not something you necessarily need to capture on the linkedin profile but you know sometimes you know there might be a gap in your work experience which is totally fine life happens that's not a deal breaker but i think at least having an explanation for what that looks like not necessarily on linkedin but for the recruiter if they reach out to have a conversation i think that's one thing i always notice i do go through the history just to see okay this then this then this and so if there's a little bit of a gap it will be picked up but again it's not a deal breaker but just be ready to sort of talk through that um assuming that you're comfortable there lastly you know um germany actually one of the recruiters she told me that you can get a little creative and uh people that have had a gap for cobit uh well maybe they lost their jobs at the beginning of the pandemic and then now they're looking for another job and they have that gap in their experience she said that uh people get created with it and sometimes they will set things like uh you know uh travel in the world uh for eight months or you know took a sabbatical or you know covet layoffs like some people like apparently some candidates have started to list kobit has uh has a gap reason so i'm sure that you can get a little creative oh yeah oh yeah no i i definitely can you can get creative there and like i said it's not a deal breaker i just would definitely be ready to kind of chat through what that looks like a little bit um and then you know lastly i would say it's definitely good to have a picture if you're comfortable but i would definitely also be aware of you know the kinds of pictures that you might be sharing of yourself and so in terms of you know you don't need to be overly professional but you probably don't want to be overly casual either and it's a fine line between that and you obviously a culture or a values of a company or a little different when they're uh you know small and more startupy versus you know a large you know big enterprise and so knowing your audience and knowing a little bit about where you're trying to get that job i think you can kind of curate your your profile a little bit to that as well and so i think that also depends on the industry you know some of the expectations there i do enjoy working in tech because i'm very comfortable in tshirts so um i i i definitely think you know having an idea of of your target audience is is also an important thing because sometimes if if there's a little bit of a disconnect there um it's it's it's a little tough to kind of get over that initial initial bump would you consider something to avoid uh when some people list that experience in the linkedin profile things that don't that barely qualify has experience like sometimes people like i said you know we try to get creative and highlight our or our profiles because we're trying to land jobs and you might see people uh highlighting certain volunteer work or certain things that they basically don't really they're not relevant maybe like if you are a developer and you say that you have experiences in a different field something uh is that something to avoid is that something that you can that you should be comfortable sharing as well what do you think yeah that's a great question and i actually i had this personal experience because i wasn't always a recruiter i was a bartender before i got into the recruiting game and so i had that on my linkedin profile for a little while and then eventually i gained enough experience and i think my career transitioned to the point where i just decided to remove that not because i was embarrassed or anything but because it wasn't really relevant to what i was doing now and what kind of future career i was planning to have and so i definitely think you're you're right there fede in the sense that hey there's a place for volunteer experience on the linkedin profile which is also a great place to add some of that stuff but i will admit sometimes when people get a little cheeky with some of the experience listed it doesn't exactly it doesn't do you any favors i think it's also good to be honest and if you know maybe some some dark humor is how you're honest that's totally fine too but at the same time i think just knowing that audience and you know knowing what really is going to help you land the job and it's not about just making sure there's no gap so you list something that's not very relevant or maybe not work at all i think it's much more important to just you know focus on what you know you really do bring to the table and kind of what you're targeting to get next and you know at the end of the day i think that that's the best yeah i feel like as some people um it's easy to forget that you are being judged on your experience and your and your ability but you are also getting judged on your character and who you are as a person because at the end of the day you will be working on a team with other people and who you are as a person matters just as much as how what you can do as a professional um and i i suppose uh trying to get a little too cheeky or a little too uh not too trusty on certain things like the way you share on your profile that oh it does also shine in a light on the on the kind of candy that you are and it might just it might just deter the recruiter from from saying well this is a person that would fit here like we'll add the value that we're looking for for team in the future right right and at the same time there you know there's definitely going to be cheeky companies out there to you to use the word one more time that maybe we'll really enjoy that and if that's who you are at the end of the day i definitely just would recommend being honest with the profile like don't put a suit on if you're not a suit where don't you know try to make your linkedin profile look like someone else's that you saw you know that you want to try to emulate let your own profile speak for yourself and that's what i try to do that's what i think a lot of other people who maybe don't overthink it and just really kind of let it naturally occur you know that's the best case because at the end of the day you want to be your authentic self because if you're not you're probably you know going to be setting yourself up for a little disappointment even if you get the job because they're going to be expecting you to be someone who you've been performing for the last couple months and so definitely just highlight your real experience and be yourself both in terms of you know the type of profile you create and the way you describe yourself because there are a lot of companies out there i think there are certain strategies that will give you more options that are going to be a little bit more applicable to just a larger group of companies but if you prefer to be you know an odd duck and just look for those odd duck companies just being on duck that's totally fine too but you know you might have a little bit of a limited options there and what do you think about um i'm sure a lot of people that will watch this video are beginners or they're junior they're looking for junior positions or you know software engineer one depending on where you work and how they call it different companies call it differently um these kind of uh candidates you often struggle to get their foot in the door because they don't have relevant experience and and they struggle to showcase what they can do without that relevant experience so what are your thoughts when you look at a linkedin profile and you see that there might be no relevant experience if you're looking to source somebody in a junior role or maybe uh what are your thoughts on them listing volunteer work has relevant experience yeah so i think it's the whole chicken before the egg thing right and it's it's it's very difficult it's something that's been in existence for a while you need experience to get the job how are you going to get the job without any experience and so i definitely i've seen it a lot and i would say you know in terms of what to list on a resume you know especially these days i see a lot of people highlighting their open source contributions which i think is helpful um especially whether it's a github or whether you have been participating in some of these other type of development initiatives having links there especially you know for me to share with my hiring manager obviously i'm not going to be evaluating the code but if i see that it exists it implies to me that this person at least has enough desire and drive to be proactive and go a little bit above and beyond and so i'll usually share that and if it's great code the person you know the engineering manager will see it and then they'll let me know hey i know this person doesn't have a ton of experience but this looks great let's have a conversation and so i think listing some of you know that type of work um even if it's boot camp stuff you know that's applicable it shows what you can do and i also think that you know as companies continue to grow they're gonna have some some difference of uh priorities so some quarters they might be a little more focused on seniority sometimes maybe they're looking to just build up a few other teams and they'll be able to hire more you know entry level or software engineer once and so i think having the experience that you do have listed and really focusing on some of that extra work that you've done is is going to help you get your foot in the door it's going to be difficult i i'm not going to you know i'm not going to sugarcoat that but um taking the initiative there and another thing don't be scared of contract work i was a contractor before i had a fulltime job and it helped me realize kind of how i was going to start building a career and so especially as software engineers or product designers you know there's sites out there that like upwork i've used i've seen before and so there are places out there that'll offer you some contract work that maybe isn't going to be the most interesting but you do a couple of those boom you've got a year and a half two years of experience and then you're you know potentially available for a midlevel software engineer role and so it's tough to get started but once you do it'll start to snowball and before you know it you'll have that year or two that'll help you kind of get more feet in the door so it's it's always tough in the beginning it'll get easier i promise it's just it sounds like uh it sounds like uh like you were saying it's a holistic view of the candidate and uh i know that uh i like to remind everybody watching this that when a company is looking for to fill a role they have sort of like a mold of what they're looking for right so you're trying to fit that mold but at the same time uh there's always wiggle room and they if you hear back from a recruiter or if somebody hits you up on linkedin or whatever it is that means that you've shown enough that they're interested in having a conversation with you so sometimes you have to trust yourself and get over that um impostor syndrome that a lot of us have saying you know i'm a fake or i don't really know i didn't get formal education on this or i didn't get formal training on that um i know that sometimes and volunteering work uh like you said if you can showcase that that work is yours or like at the end of the day like if you just list some random project that you worked on and it's not clear what your role was in the project it's not clear what your responsibilities were in the project it's less likely to help you and if you can definitely show you know i was in charge of this i wrote this code this is what i did right it always so like don't be so afraid of the labels right like it's not a fancy company it's not a fancy but but it is experience and it is showing what you can do right right and just getting getting a few of those early reps um you can become a lot more selective once you get some of those out of the way so it's definitely good to especially right after you know when you're initially starting as a as a software engineer take take some of that initial experience you know have you know try to have fun but really just know that you're kind of paying your dues a little bit and you'll be surprised at how selective you can be in a couple years because software engineering is a ridiculously indemand skill set and it's not going anywhere and so i think anybody who's on that path is is doing themselves a great service it might be a little slow out of the gate it'll pay dividends if i was better at math i would probably be a software engineer what about the what about the opposite what is what is the uh the etiquette per se when you are actively looking for a role at a company maybe they have some open roles that you're interested in and we often talk about researching the companies that you want to work for and trying to build your network trying to reach out so what is sort of etiquette if someone let's say we have an open role in a backend engineer and you get a message tonight from someone on linkedin saying hey i see that you're a technical recruiter at code academy and i'm interested in these roles i want to talk more about this is it like what's the line of being polite and inquiring on a of an interesting work versus not being polite or like you know doing it wrong and taking away from that chance yeah no i mean i definitely think you should be as proactive as again you feel comfortable with but i think also be realistic and so if you think you're a great fit for the role and you are a great fit then feel free be confident reach out to that recruiter i get sometimes engineers you know with a with a linkedin request like a friend request or a networking request and so sometimes they'll include hey i saw you know this particular job would love to hear a little bit more about it if you think my background could be a fit and i always you know will click on the resume that they share with me or just click into their linkedin profile and take a look and if they you know could be a fit then i'll definitely have that conversation but what i would avoid is you know potentially you know maybe spamming uh some other recruiters in the sense of going for roles that are just really far afield and that probably aren't going to be you know within your wheelhouse for you know a little bit of time at least because as much as people like to say hey i can learn really quick there you know there are certain things at companies especially at that you know some mid to definitely at senior level where they won't be able to take a risk on someone having to learn that you know they're going to be waiting and looking for someone who really can kind of hit the ground running and so definitely feel free to reach out to recruiters but you know just like you don't want them to waste your time i would say you know don't be overly zealous if it's uh not really a great fit okay i mean that's fair i've always spamming if you if somebody mess if you message someone and they don't get back to you within an hour don't message them again and give them some time they're busy don't okay so so it's totally fine but just do it with do it we're always in the context of there is a time frame there is an interest and you don't even know if the role that you are interested in it has been filled or if it's in the last stages or getting failed so always with that with a kind of like grain of salt or saying you know you can try but there is no guarantees and you should always keep that in mind that there's only so much you can do right exactly definitely you know apply on the company's website and then the next step maybe yeah reach out to one of the recruiters if you see them especially if you maybe have a connection request with them um you know i think building your network you know maybe as a another last takeaway is definitely something you know i i definitely accept a lot of uh you know linkedin requests especially folks that i've previously worked with or candidates that maybe i've had conversations with maybe they didn't get a job but it's a small world and i've definitely spoken to people at you know several companies and they've kind of you know been able to follow me where i go places and vice versa and so um there is a nice symbiosis that can exist between recruiters and engineers and so it's just a matter about kind of finding that right fit but uh keeping your options open and being honest with yourself i would say and have you ever come across anyone that might be a bit more sales when it comes to their online privacy i mean in the last few years we've seen leaks data leaks you know social media leaks so i i can imagine that it's not out of the realm of possibility that some of these candidates say look i don't have social media and i don't have a linkedin either because i'm trying to limit my footprint online um is that have you come across anyone like that or like do you think that that would be kind of like a a harder candidate to scout or to to get like what happens if you are that kind of person that is more you know worried about your private online it's really not something that's you know you're not going to end up on some amazon mailing list whether you give your recruiter a cell phone uh so i i definitely think you know as you feel comfortable you know sharing is is probably the best way to go okay um i think i apologize i think youtube just told me that there was like a slight gap there in the answer maybe for like a second or two i think you didn't miss too much information sorry everybody uh well i think i i asked a lot of questions today you've shared a lot of good uh insights on how recruiters think and what recruiters are looking for when they are using linkedin as a tool for scouting candidates and communicating with them so do you have any general thoughts or anything that you would like to share before we pass to the q a no no i think uh i think that this is a a fun conversation for me it's it's nice to sort of think about you know the day to day a little bit more um i think i would just really bring it back to to being honest with yourself and putting out that honest persona because you want canada you want companies to find you where you can be yourself vice versa i think i've seen too many times where people try to perform in a way that they think the company is looking for it doesn't end well you know even if the job does that they do get the job they don't stick around very long so it's in your best interest to just put your honest foot forward and the companies that you know you'll want to work for and feel comfortable they'll find you and vice versa you know if you're proactive i think you'll be able to find them too you know it's interesting that you bring that up because uh last week we're talking just about that about how far you can mold yourself to fit a certain role or hit certain requirements or or musthaves and how far you can mold yourself to that before you're sacrificing who you are as a person then you're gonna have a bad time uh i think this comes often with tech with the big tech companies the fang companies where people say well you know i don't care if it's a six month burnout rate i don't care if people get in and out of there like a revolving door the moment i put that in my resume that i've been there for 18 months that's it dan's done deal i'm gonna get a job whatever i want and uh it seems to it seems to be a big problem uh in tech where people might be willing to put up with a lot or might be willing to say yes to a lot of things during a recruiting uh you know uh process even if they are not okay with the compensation they're not okay with the hours they're not okay with how company does a or b just because they they just want to have it on the rest of them so i think it's interesting like you said you know you you have to also keep in mind where you're going to work and why exactly exactly that's why it's always best to be yourself easiest rule okay easiest rule well i'm gonna look at the chat see if we have any questions here that we might have missed during our conversation i'm gonna scroll up um let's see okay yeah so one of the first questions was just wondering about you know how to make a perfect linkedin profile i would imagine that there's no perfect linkedin profile depends on the role but uh uh if you want to maybe uh summarize like you said before some of the main areas to shine in your profile i think you mentioned uh recommendations from other users being important yeah so in terms of you know really high level takeaways definitely the recommendations are helpful um especially because it's a it's just a living reference and so i think for recruiters and you know future hiring managers it's a great sort of insight into what you kind of would bring to the table or some of your past experience um i would also recommend being concise when you're describing sort of your your your best characteristics or strongest strengths because if you end up casting that really wide net and listing a million different languages and frameworks you might get a lot of you know recruiters reaching out to you but they might not be really a fit for what you want to do and so definitely highlight you know the key you know strengths that you bring to the table as well as any opportunities that you've had to really own a project take the lead mentor some other engineers those are some of the kind of keywords that although i'm not necessarily including in a boolean search i'm noticing when i'm reading kind of next to all the languages and frameworks because a lot of times especially the company like codecademy you know we only have you know 220 people that work here so people tend to work on multiple projects help out in different ways and so when you have the ability to be flexible like that um it's just gonna set you up more for success and so the recommendations um i guess also lastly you know the picture if you feel comfortable i think is great but that's a personal opinion i think it's everyone's specific you know preference but to help personalize it you know i think we live on screens these days which can be a little tough and so you know i always hope people know i'm a person on the other side and not some robot sending spam messages and i think yeah vice versa it's probably helpful when uh you know the recruiter can get a sense as to to who you are as well do you uh i think linkedin has like a way for you to take exams and it kind of like adds those to your profile i guess those are nice to have too if you want to yeah i would say nice to have not a need to have you know i think i know that hiring managers i support will like you know we'll look at aws certification a little bit more um strongly than a linkedin certification now i think that could change over time but yeah definitely nice to have it shows initiative if nothing else but i wouldn't try to you know over emphasize linkedin recommendations at this point compared to what other kind of work you've done okay i see uh javier uh looks like you have a spanish name so i guess it makes sense to this question we have a user asking what are the recommendations to ex to expose your profile to other countries did you did you say companies are hiring remotely so i think this comes into uh javier um just to remind you uh remote work doesn't mean overseas work a lot of times companies are required to have certain uh you know there's laws like labor laws that require you to have work visas and other paperwork so um remote works sometimes uh often times just refers to the fact that you're not in a physical office more than if a more than that you are abroad in a different country but uh just in general i think we touched on that earlier where we said well if you're going to work on a country that speaks a different language than the one you're using it's probably a smart idea to make a profile in in that language right yeah i would definitely agree with that and then one thing i'm pretty sure a lot of people know about this but if you are looking for new work there is a little toggle or a little button you click on linkedin that says open in new opportunities and that allow once you click that it allows you to list some positions that you're interested in list locations and so in terms of javier's question if he's looking for you know specific countries he can list those specific countries and that's where his profile would populate in terms of where the recruiters would be looking for and then there's always also just the opportunity to list a little like personal couple sentences about why or what you're looking for and sometimes there you can really set yourself apart because if you haven't know what you're looking for or have a specific goal in mind and can sort of cav um kind of deliver that succinctly it's helpful because then the recruiter can get a sense as to oh this is a candidate who i could maybe consider for this position so knowing that you can open to new opportunities have that little um adjustment that's a way to definitely kind of get even further up the pecking order in terms of you know sometimes recruiters if they're you know really under the gun and looking for a you know need to kind of engage candidates quickly who do you think they're going to start with it's going to be candidates that are open to new opportunities because they know they're active and so i think being able to toggle that when you need to um especially listing the countries that you are targeting to work at definitely is uh is a great place to start great uh yeah javier is just saying thank you for the feedback yes my mother tongue is spanish yeah i i sounded like it javier so hello um i know that um so like i was mentioning the labor laws and stuff is it is this something that you need to mention in your linkedin uh let's say that you are uh from spain and you want to work in the us and you actually do happen to have a work visa for the us maybe you obtain one is that something that you should list preemptively in a linkedin profile has available to work in the us or is that something that it's more adequate to mention in a in a conversation facetoface like would a recruiter look at a profile if they don't see that skip over because they assume that that person is not qualified you know able to work in the us yeah so it's a great question i think it probably does differ a little bit country to country company to company but in general i would definitely if you have that um certification that authorization definitely listed it's not going to hurt you to have that listed usually also you know there's only certain things recruiters can ask in terms of like location compensation every state in the us actually has different laws um and so there's only there's some questions that i could ask in new york that i can't ask in massachusetts which is odd but it's they're there and so that's what it is yeah usually location isn't too much of a deal breaker but i think you're going to set yourself up for more opportunities if you you know either list your authorizations or you know target you know your open and new opportunities to specific um countries just because you know it'll be it'll be the most realistic option to hopefully get you so i guess if you're confident i mean it comes down back to privacy again like we were saying before uh if you're confident comfortable sharing that publicly on linkedin on your profile say i'm authorized to work in the us for example i'm authorized to work in colombia i'm authorized to work in japan um i guess if you're comfortable saying that out loud in the on the internet uh then definitely it's not going to hurt you right to add it in your bio so like yeah uh and like you said i think that was a great tip um you when you say on linkedin that you are open to work you can list the countries that you are targeting so that is a big big tip that we got there uh let's do one more question so someone here asked projects that would you would recommend doing to impress recruiters so i guess it depends on the role that you're applying what frontend backend devops full stack it will depend but uh are there um when you're looking at a project from a candidate to try like the first screening what are the things that basically set apart a project that is just to a project that showcases someone's ability so so yeah so the way i'll answer that is definitely focus on github when it comes to software engineering and it's not because it's just because a it's it's applicable and you'll be able to highlight your your specific experience but at the end of the day if i look at code i'm not going to know what it can do but if i go to your github profile and i see you've been active for the last x number of months or x number of years to show that you have been hands on the keyboard and really applying some of the knowledge you've gained from either a boot camp or some online courses maybe it doesn't you know exactly translate to real work experience but you know github shows you the the shaded squares with how many days you were active and how where your commits came from and if i go to a github profile and i just see it lit up with yellow and red and orange i know that person spends a lot of time on their keyboard and i know that they could probably be able to pick something up a little more quickly so i wouldn't worry about like this is one project that every recruiter is going to love i would focus on doing the work day in day out not and you know just a couple hours or whatever you can afford to do but when you show the consistency that's when you'll be able to apply to a hiring company that hey i can be committed to a longterm project i'm really passionate about this and here's some examples of of what i could bring to the table so i would definitely say it's more about the scope and the consistency versus any one particular project okay there you have it uh just focus on consistency and i will plus one that because uh actually one of our moderators on our community on discord got a job recently and the user wasn't even applying for jobs he was really involved in a lot of open source work and a lot like you look at his github and he's extremely active like 800 commits in the past year or something like that like extremely active and basically people that he was collaborating with online they said hey where do you work at he said no i don't work i just selftaught developer and they said excuse me and they started they started you know referencing him and sending him to recruiters of the company say hey my company is hiring my company's hiding here you go and he actually landed a job even not asking for one he just kind of like was so consistent and so active in communities that other people noticed how consistent and so definitely for sure consistency just going to show that you you do it because you love it and you're going to keep doing it i think okay so all right we will answer this question before we close off uh we've been here for a while uh last last question very last question is in your experience how much how much age matters for a computer especially in those years of job loss or changing due to covet and and i think there's some legal requirements on this too like i'm pretty sure that h is not a way you can't discriminate based on it i'm sure that but i guess it does i can imagine companies being a bit more leaning towards one side than another but i know that a code academy at least in particular uh you can speak to this i don't think that age is a factor oh no not at all i think it's more i'm looking for people that have you know the specific experience for what we need you know today and so if that comes in the form of a you know 17 year old prodigy or an 18 year old prodigy or a 65 year old retiree who just picked up coding i don't care if you know react and you know you can work with some microservices like at a pretty high level i'll have a conversation with you and so i don't think that age really plays a part and i think in terms of like some of those gaps from covid as long as you have you know something to show for it like if you you know had some down on your luck time and you know you needed to you know take some time being able to talk about you know i did took this opportunity to either study at a boot camp or to work on this personal project i think you can really kind of cover your bases a little there and so i wouldn't worry too much about you know ageism or you know people worrying about gaps on resumes as long as you have you know you've been proactive you're working on selfimprovement and you know eventually i think those those uh those resources will pay dividends and you'll actually be able to really kind of get where you want to go um i think sometimes when people just get a little defeatist and then start just not putting any emphasis on their linkedin profile letting it kind of go by the wayside those are the profiles that you know you come across and they don't really make a you know they don't really stick and you usually go on to the next all right well i say it every week and i keep saying it i'll keep saying it is don't selfselect yourself out you have to let the recruiters be the ones that say no like if you don't you know you have doubts you don't think you have the right experience the right knowledge or you don't fit well or my age or my experience or my my volunteering work just just put yourself out there and let the recruiters be the ones saying no because if you you you will tell yourself no 100 of the time so you you gotta sometimes get past that well thank you will so much for today uh thank you for sharing all this information i'm sure that there's a lot of people walking out of here today thinking all right i'm going to go spruce up my linkedin better make it look good so thank you so much no problem fat it was a pleasure thank you for having me all right and everybody i'll see you next week we are we continue to do this every week so i'll see you next monday on another recruiting tips and tricks live stream
