biometric technology and in cyber security coma has also worked in financial services in leaders leadership capacities at both Morgan Stanley and ey formerly earnst and young hi coma thanks for joining us great to be here and thank you for having me yeah so I wanted to start by asking you what do you think the most important soft skills for Success are in the tech industry specifically that's a good question I I think that um a power skill that never goes out of style is communication that often times you'll be called into explain things to audiences of varying degrees of Technical acument and experience and the worst thing that can happen is that maybe you feel like you're explaining something in a way that makes sense to you but it's not Landing for the person that you're trying to explain to lots of times you might be called in to communicate what's happening with the particular project perhaps it's a crisis where you're trying to explain what happened what the remediation strategy is what's the path of getting people back up and running or explaining features of a particular project that you're working on so people can understand why it's important how it's important and how you might consume information and make sense of information may not be the way that everybody else does so being able to work intentionally on communication skills when you're thinking about a workplace that is remote and in person or hybrid intergenerational people with different abilities and different gifts that they bring to the table it really is critically important to continue to refine communication skills because how you show up to different audiences is often times maybe a little different and being able to navigate those Landscapes can pay dividends and your ability to add value and support growth and support other people on your team in their own professional Journeys and their own growing Journeys I especially think also empathy leading with empathy um we we saw that the pandemic shifted a lot of norms in terms of how we work with each other what we're dealing with how we show up to work so I think that's also really making sure that you're showing up in a way that people find you to be authentic and invested in their Career Success um sometimes something as simple as just making sure you check in with folks on a regular basis making sure you're having oneon ones but those are places where it's in critically important to make sure that you're you're leading in a way where you're showing up for people they hopefully experience the real you and that they feel like you're invested in their success yeah yeah definitely and I think you brought up a great point which is just how much the pandemic has changed all of this um for people I wondered if we could talk about why there's an need for professional skills right now especially one of the peculiarities that came out of the pandemic although remote work is not something that is is relatively new the scale at which people were introduced to work remotely changed a lot of norms in terms of working with a team that may not be geographically close working with teams that are located in different countries with different cultures different time zones how do you you how do you get to know a team that you've never met in person um how do you work with a boss that you may never get to see um or you may see maybe twice a year so those are some things that that require sort of a reexamination of professional skills because a lot of those Norms that people with more experience in the workplace might have developed sort of fall apart uh something as simple as how do you do a job interview if you're used to showing up in person how do you do it remotely what are strategies to be able to put your best foot forward when you're not in the room with someone if you're used to working remotely how do you show up present in an environment where you're now interacting with people in person where you might be used to a different environment of re uh interacting with people remotely so it really is critical because what happens is when you have those gaps gaps sometimes create misunderstandings or the ability to not assume positive intent and those misunderstandings can fracture teams and personal relationships and professional relationships so now more than ever is critical to invest in those skills because those can be the make or break aspects of a team being able to deliver on time to be able to remediate things to be able to make sure everybody feels like they're included and that that became very difficult especially post pandemic in an environment where a lot of folks were not used to these Dynamics now being disrupted and how do you keep people together and motivated when the Norms that you might have been accustomed to are no longer the Norms of the professional environments that we're working in now right right um speaking of which I believe that we are having a bit of a technical difficulty connecting to the correct YouTube stream so we're gonna pause our conversation I feel like we were on such a great uh train of thought there but um just one second while we try and figure this out um I wish I had the statistics on hand but a lot of times those folks wind up leaving their roles because they don't feel like they're prepared they lose faith in the company they lose faith in their own abilities and then they go somewhere else so that's that's sort of a a misstep that can be easily remedied by investment in helping that person convert into that new role and give them the tools to be able to be successful on day one um I think another place where there's there's gaps is just you know critical and strategic thinking that it it's sometimes very difficult if you're used to being in an environment where you're focused on sort of the Tactical to be able to step back and be able to velop that strategic view how can you communicate the objectives of a companying to ways where your team understands this is how I fit this is why I'm doing what I'm doing and this is how my work fits into the broader hole and that's that's hard to think strategically when you've been used to a more sort of tactical environment and thinking about not just what's happening on my team but what's happening in the company what's a competitive landscape that we're working in what are other people in the space offering that we don't have just trying to to sort of wrap that rigor around those types of analyses is not something that comes naturally it's something that is practiced but it's the good news it's something that can be learned so just like a new manager doesn't have to magically have everything on day one these are skills that can be learned these are skills that can be practiced and as people evolve over their careers that will change in terms of their familiarity what they need to do and the new skills they need to acquire as they go along those Journeys totally and I think what is interesting is that it's not always like formally taught okay here's how to be a manager here's what to do when these things arise so often um like even from my own experience you're sort of just like observing how other people are and see like trying to emulate the parts that you think are successful or just you know uh maybe you have a mentor that would be an ideal scenario um who who teaches you these things but yeah a lot of people don't have that um and I wanted to ask you looking back at your own career how did you develop professional skills well it's a combination of I would say practical uh I would first I'd say um a combination of just learning courses that talk about leadership looking at different now blogs books uh opportunities to think about leadership as a discipline not as something that you have or you don't um mentors and people who could tap me on the shoulder and say I don't think that you handle that in the best way right and that's important to have people along the way uh you can call mentorship or your own personal board of directors where you can sit and share things and say hey I had this meeting and it really went badly so have any of you been in that situation and if so here's how I approached it would you have any insight on how to handle it differently and also being able to have people in various stages of their careers be able to give you that type of feedback because you're not going to learn it all on day one I remember looking at um I think it was a a corn fairy article on leadership and it's not about being a know it all it's about being a learn it all that you're going to be constantly learning and you're going going to be stepping into different environments with different types of people from different backgrounds you're not going to have everything on day one or day two but if you're open to learning and you have that growth mindset of continuous Improvement then it's more about being that learn it all because you'll at least be open to say okay this is now a gap and I need to fix it now how do I go about fixing it with the combination of stuff I might be reading podcasts that I listen to or just being able to have a trusted Mentor who's been there done that and say hey I kind of didn't do this as well or maybe it's hey I did this really really well how do I continue that aspect of my own leadership journey and how I want to be known so some of it especially when you're in the na the Navy you're kind of coming into the Navy as an officer with the expectation that you'll be managing people so part of that curriculum is very intentional but a lot of it was on the job with the mentor who would be able to say as you know me at the time as a junior officer like ma'am that wasn't exactly the way I would approach it and trusting that that person has my best interest at heart to be able to help shape and guide me so that right I don't make that same mistake again yeah yeah and I think um for other people like I think it's important to remember that you might have transferable experience from other jobs you've had you were in the Navy of course that's very specific but like even things like working in food service or Child Care there's stuff that you pick up about communicating or time management that um is really valuable so you shouldn't discount that just if you're absolutely yeah the the type of relationship management that somebody who is a Frontline person in retail has to do imagine the type of Crisis management that somebody who is working on a floor of a retail department store when it's during Peak holiday season there's a backlog stuff is is out of stock and you have to deal with that person represent knowing that you're represent both yourself the brand and the company because they're not going to see you know isolated say oh well well coma it's going to be whatever the big retailer that you're working for is well you know I had a very bad experience so those are of course transferable skills and I think that regardless of what you're working on or where you're working what type of Industry that you're in you're always practicing relationship management you're always practicing aspects of leadership you don't need to have a massive team to be able to practice leadership you're always leading with empathy something as simple as saying hey I noticed that you're a little down what's going on that's leading with empathy because that person again could be having a bad day at work they could have a parent who's sick they could have a you know um an issue with dropping their kid off at school but being empathetic leading from a place of empathy and trust versus huh look at you late again that's that's not a way of solving that problem and I think that to your point there's so many valuable Avenues to learn those skills and then it's about refining those skills and then applying them to the environment in which you find yourself yeah yeah um for people watching who maybe are in the process of looking for a new job maybe they've even landed some interviews and are going out on interviews um what are some ways that you can like talk about or showcase all of these transferable professional skills that you have um my opinion is what's important is being able to have concrete examples of how you're able to use one of these power skills apply the power skill to the particular situation and affect a better outcome because of your participation in that conversation or in that situation whether it's being able to communicate strategic priorities to the team so that they're more effective and more engaged that they're able to get projects done on or ahead of schedule because you are able to communicate effectively translate those strategic requirements being able to manage up and manage down um perhaps it's a situation where somebody on your team came to you and said listen I'm really unhappy with my role can you help me and being able to help that person through feedback through performance reviews be able to say okay here are your strengths here are the things you need to work on here's how we can align you to different experiences so that you are continuing to Forest those goals so it's really important to have those those stories at the ready that demonstrate the skill how you applied the skill the situation in which you applied the skill and the favorable outcome that you were able to facilitate because you are able to do such a good job with that power skill um I know that for me it's it's important and I mentioned communication because uh there are very few things that you don't need to work with somebody else to actually get done and being able to communicate to various audiences is is a really critical skill um being able to to understand and analyze things to be able to figure out so the what went wrong and how do we fix it is also a very valuable skill and the ability to I think be a team player if you're going to be working on a team being able to find a role contribute to that role and again a lot of it is are you able to articulate the skill show how that skill was applied and show the favorable outcome that you were able to support by virtue of you being able to properly and efficiently and effectively apply that skill yeah yeah um so interesting when you were talking about communication I was thinking you know at skillsoft at code academy we are remote we people all over the place is there anything any strategies that you use to make sure that there's clear and effective communication within your team especially being distributed around the world yeah it's it's tough um sometimes you know in certain ccum cases you're going to you have to sacrifice time zones sometimes get a little in my case a little bit earlier if you're if you have time zones you know in Europe or or Asia but I think some of it is you have to be very intentional yeah because once upon a time you could depend on ohy you want to go grab a coffee oh hey I saw someone on the way to the the break room maybe we should have a chat or just be able to stop by somebody's desk and or office and be able to say hey can I just drop in in chat I think with remote work you have to be very intentional about communication whether it's scheduling a half hour standup or a 15minute stand up however you want to do it scheduling weekly meetings with your direct reports and maybe biweekly meetings with their direct reports you have to be intentional about those Avenues of communication and especially as you become more senior to an organization people may not feel comfortable just knocking on your door you might say oh I have an open door policy but then is somebody really going to knock on it right so how do you facilitate either groups or informal chats or you know forums where people can access you in a real and authentic way and not feel like they're always on display or I have to tell them about this amazing project that I did because no it's about getting to know people and I think one of the difficulties with being in a hybrid and remote environment is that if you're hybrid sometimes a tendency is for the in office people to get more attention than the remote people sometimes if you have a completely hybrid environment perhaps folks who are in favorable time zones to your own time zone get more of you than folks who are in time zones that might be half a world away so those are aspects where I think especially now intentional communication whether it's you know Zoom or or slack or whatever it is that you have to be very deliberate about it because those incidental opportunities for contact have diminished especially in a place where most of us or many of us are not working side by side in the physical environment with people for whom we depend on a lot of things to get done so really for me the biggest thing has been the intentionality not that you don't want to speak to people all the time but I don't I can't depend on popping into the coffee area and then seeing the person that I need to talk to or being able to go around the corner and pop by somebody's desk because I'm in physical proximity totally totally um I did want to there was a question question that is relevant to what we're talking about in in the chat um someone is asking how do I upscale my abilities to get a remote job what tips could help us um I'm assuming that person is a job seeker and is is hoping to to succeed in a remote environment so totally along the lines of what we were just discussing right so I think that because one of the Tendencies and of course there's a lot of sort of changes in thought is with a remote worker how do I make sure that they're going to be able to get their work done how do I make sure that they stay connected to the rest of the team how do I make sure that person doesn't feel isolated so I think in terms of the interview process perhaps discussing the ways that you intentionally working with if you're a current remote worker looking for another remote job or uh you know in a in a situation where this may be a new remote opportunity the ways that you as a potential candidate intentionally stay connected and intentionally stay informed and feel comfortable working with minimal supervision because of course you don't have that person who pops byy and says hey how's how are things going do you have any questions about this project so I think those are very important skills to be able to articulate and then examples about how you've been able to to apply those skills to stay connected to stay up toate to stay in a place where you feel like you are able to get the relevant information that you need to do your job and feeling comfortable that if you're if you're not getting that information demonstrating that you're the type of person I like to call it polite persistence to be able to go out and find that information so that you have what you need to be able to get done what you need to get done yeah absolutely um I'm also curious from your perspective as someone who has interviewed candidates for roles before um what makes someone stand out it can be such a stressful thing no matter the circumstances but especially when you're in a virtual setting um yeah anything that jumps out to you or or things that you look for it goes back to the examples yeah that it's it's tough when somebody presents a particular skill or an experience and they can't speak to it in a concrete way right where if they mention a project that they've worked on or they mention a specific goal that they achieved being able to say things like well this is the goal this is how we set the goal here are the things that led to the goal here are the things that maybe were going to trip us up along the way and here's how we all came together to be able to keep everything on track if you're not able to provide relevant examples to speak to the items in your CV and your resume that you've that you provided it makes for a much more difficult conversation because often times there's obviously going to be the technical aspect of are you able to demonstrate this specific technical skills that are requirement for this job but also if there's additional skills like um those technical uh projects may require um being able to distill business requirements be able to analyze particular things it's not just the tools that you use to do it but it's the how in the process so being able to articulate that effectively and then connect that thread and connect that storyline is going to be really important um different interviewers may have different areas so if it's technical interview obviously you're going to want to emphasize that aspect if it's behavioral emphasize that aspect if it's a case study a lot of it's going to be sort of the process to which you go um to to arrive at determining what a feasible answer or approach could be but in all those situations it's important to be able to connect those dots and connect those dots in a way that tells your story and builds your brand and articulates why you are the right candidate for that role because without you that project might not have been is successful that person might not have been able to realize that outcome so it really is about how you're able to tell that story provide relevant examples and articulate that as a reflection of you and why you're you're the best candidate for that role and why you'd be a great value add to that organization or that team yeah um we got another question from our viewers that is relevant um what tips do you have if you've only done skill training privately but have never worked with it on the job um like how would you come up with an example I guess if you never had a um technical job before maybe that goes back to what we were saying about transferable skills right I think so if I understand the correction um of the question you it it may not be that you have had the experience but you can speak to if I were to encounter this problem here's how I would go about solving it so it may be less about the fact that you have a whole don't think you have a whole you may think you have a whole in the resume but it could be that okay I haven't done this specific thing but I've done something like it and here's how I approached it or even though I haven't done this thing based upon my experience and my understanding of the particular problem you want to solve or the specific here's how I would go about it and then you tell that story that connects to dots because I think one of the things that we have to be careful about is just because you haven't done it doesn't mean you can't do it so if you have the skills you have the training you have the will even if that particular area may not be exactly what you know they may ask you a question you think oh my gosh they threw me a curveball I've never done this before you probably have the building blocks to be able to solve it or be able to approach it so you know calm that little nerve that's probably saying oh no I'm about to blow it take a deep breath and draw on the pieces that you have that you could solve the puzzle if you were presented with the puzzle rather than focusing on on the fact that o I've never seen that puzzle before you probably have in a different flavor but you can approach it of well even though I haven't had Direct experience with this based upon my knowledge and experience this is how I would go about it yeah that's great advice filing that one away um I am curious Switching gears a little bit um what do you think the key qualities of an effective leader are so one of my favorite books is called Unleashed by Francis fry Dr Francis fry and Anne Morris um Dr Fry is a professor at Harvard Business School and an is sort of a professional like highlevel organizational strategist and and change agent they also have a podcast called fixable so you can tell I'm I'm a pretty big Fang girl of these folks um but they talk about this concept of a trust triangle and that it all begins with trust and in that trust triangle there are sort of um three main components um one is logic sort of do I understand where you're going with this authenticity um are you showing up as the real you and I'm just trying to remember the the third one I think it's um um empathy but it it's one of these situ ation where if you lack a piece of that triangle then people aren't going to be able to follow you they're not going to be able to experience um the real you and they're not going to understand kind of where you're going with where you're going if that makes sense so I think that those are critical elements where if you're able to show up as the real you and are you able to show up in a way that is um authentic that people feel like that they're experiencing you that show up with empathy that you're invested in their success and show up with logic where they get where you're coming from they understand how you put together the dots then that will help you be more successful I think the other piece of of being a good leader is admitting when you're wrong um you're you're never going to get it right all the time if if that were the case then you should be picking lottery numbers and you should be beating the stock market but if you're in a place where you can accept that there's going to be times when you didn't get it right it goes back to that learn it all are you a note all which means I have nothing to learn you can't teach me anything and I have to be right 100% of the time or are you a learn it all where you recognize that at various stages you might not have gotten it right so how can you gather the knowledge to be able to get it right the next time right so those are places where I think in terms of just the basis of leadership it's not about you know putting on a fancy outfit and getting in front of people and of course public speaking could be part of it and as you get more more senior organization you may have to make presentations in front of smaller teams bigger teams larger organizations are you doing like Keynotes are you going to be in front of cameras you going be blasted so all those things could happen but fundamentally in my opinion it comes down to those those those three things um that are in that book but I I found it really resonant because if you have this triangle you have logic you have um empathy and you have authenticity if one of those pieces of the triangle falls apart you got a problem and I think it's one of those things to your point that people people build that up and people might think oh I have to act like this person right you don't you can take elements of what that person brings to the table but you're you you're a unique human being with a whole whole bunch of gifts and a whole bunch of things that you do well and a whole bunch of things that you don't do well and that is okay and then being able to build a leadership style that speaks to that will help you feel more confident in your leadership and help you navigate challenges and and sort of build that resilience because things are going to go wrong projects are going to get messed up code's not going to work um you know things are it it happens but I feel like if you've got that triangle then you can build the resilience you can build the problem solving you can build all those things but also remembering that you don't have to be like anybody else you got to be yourself and that's the authenticity the empathy and logic if you're trying to act like this person out there that person out there maybe there things to emulate like wow that person really commands an audience well that person's really able to distill things in a way that multiple people can understand but you got to be you you you have to be you and adopt your own leadership style and your own way of of showing up for people don't try to be anybody else be you yes I love that framework and just to reiterate that book was called Unleashed yes by Dr Francis fry and an Morris so if anybody wants to go check that out definitely do um sort of related I was wondering like what things people can do when they're at like an individual contributor level um to take on leadership opportunities um like what would that even look like for someone who maybe is at the start of their career um it doesn't like leadership doesn't always have to be this like big splashy thing yeah it could be oh I'll take responsibility for that piece of that project or I'll take responsibility for you know investigating something new that we might want to look at so some of those things can be very small but very impactful and it helps build your confidence and your tool set so that you feel comfortable taking on more responsibility or more opportunities to do things so I think it's an individual contributor there's always ways of finding small pieces of puzzles finding small opportunities to sort of take charge of something and sort of be responsible for driving it to the the goal that you've set for yourself or set for the team but it doesn't always have to be massive that as you start sort of those skills there could be places where you feel comfortable being present being a leader and some places you're like nah you know what I'm good so really being able to find that balance and I mean some folks are very very happy being individual contributors and that's and being selective about what they do in terms of cross functional leadership is there a particular working group or an initiative where you have to pull together a bunch of people solve a problem and then that working group goes back to what they were doing but you've had that experience and opportunity to do something with a group of people who may not be your direct managers but you're taking responsibility to lead a particular team or group in in pursuit of a goal so I think as an IC there's lots of opportunities to do that and perhaps it's just a matter of picking something that resonates seeing how that goes and then kind of reevaluating and say okay how how did that go do I want that experience again do I want something different or you know what that was really great and I'm just going to focus on on the stuff that I need to get done and maybe in six months I'll look for another opportunity to do that yeah yeah great apologies for my dog barking he's still working on his communication skills hopefully oh we we can't we can't hear it great um there was another question from the chat that I wanted to ask um which is how can you get better at your communication skills as an introvert very relatable I think yeah yeah um I I mean I I would say some of it just has to do with picking and choosing where you choose to practice those skills so you don't become depleted by pretending that you're an extrovert when you're not um it could be in a meeting giving like setting a goal that you're going to you're going to articulate a few points or if you feel uncomfortable about being in that meeting and you have a good relationship with the person who's leading it maybe checking in with them to say hey there's a couple things that I'd like to bring up in this meeting but sometimes I don't feel like I can interject or join the conversation and working with that person develop a strategy where you feel comfortable becoming part of the conversation without being you know overcome by anxiety that you're in this situation and now you don't feel comfortable being part of the conversation and I also think that it has to do with again being authentic to yourself if you're not an introvert maybe you're not going to be the one who's talking the most but where you choose to engage you're able to create the type of insightful opinion or being able to be impactful to the conversation so you don't feel like the spotlight is always on you but you do feel like you can pick and choose where you want to participate but recognizing that you don't have to feel obligated to participate so those are I think a few things that might be sort of nearterm strategies that might be able to help because you know for an introvert you know that's part of your gifts that's part of what makes you special so trying to pretend that you're an extrovert is exhausting and anxiety inducing so being able to pick and choose where you want to interject and perhaps if you feel good about the person who's having the meeting you say hey look there's a few things I'd like to bring up how can we create the space where I can bring those up and feel like I can be you know authentic without feeling anxious yeah and if I can plug a book um there's a book called quiet the power of introverts in a world that can't stop talking um by Susan Kane and it's very popular um so maybe worth checking that out too I will put that on my list yeah um we had another question that sort of is similar to what we were talking about about being in a interview being in a doob interview and um talking about uh past experience that you've had um but is there any way to convey that like on a resume or CV and I can repeat that question if it wasn't clear so talking about a past experience and if you don't have on the job experience oh um I think I'm trying to think uh if you're early in your career and you don't have specific on the job experience um maybe if this is somebody who's recently finishing you know an academic career maybe it's just highlighting relevant coursework relevant um topics that you discussed uh you know things like that if your if your work history isn't that long then you could highlight areas or coursework that you've done that you feel like articulates things that are necessary for the job that you're applying to so at least it demonstrates that you have some sort of experience with it even if it's not specific practical experience um that you might be able to to demonstrate that you have the aptitude if you were able to apply those skills um also if there's any opportunities to become you know a book involved in like side projects or maybe your own projects where you might be able to explore certain areas or or demonstrate certain you know specific technical Concepts or or um Frameworks that you'd like to use on the job maybe small side projects might be able to help where you can demonstrate here's how I went about solving the problem here's what I built and even if it's not something that's in Market or is is a product that is out there you at least went through the intellectual rigor and the discipline to create that that that project and that can also showcase your ability both from a technical aspect and from a problem solving aspect that you know how to solve problems like this and you solved a hypothetical problem like this and you're able to discuss it when you get into the job interview so that you have something relevant and applicable that you can bring up yeah and and another plug we have so many projects in the code academy um library that you can start doing and for exactly this um so definitely check those out if you haven't um great okay I think we are just about ready to wrap up coma was there anything we didn't talk about that you think is important or that you would want people to know well I think when you're going into a job interview believing that you can get the job and having the confidence to present your best self can go a long way that if you make it past sort of the gatekeeper of the hiring manager or the the software that you know sorts things into piles of yay and nay um just show up recognizing that you can do the job you've got the confidence you've got the abilities and maybe you don't have everything but being eager being um you know showing those no those learn it all qualities and being genuinely interested in the company and the role that you're applying for can go a long way in terms of communicating the enthusiasm that you have to be part of this team or part part of the company even if there might be one or two things on their resume that may not allying to their job description because remember a job description is the perfect world in a perfect world you would have this purple sparkly unicorn that has all these qualities and um is able to just do all the things and and Achieve that Master like obviously if they had the purple unicorn they wouldn't be looking for somebody to fill those roles right so just because you can't tick all those boxes if you think you can tick enough of those boxes and you have the aptitude to demonstrate the enthusiasm and the willingness to learn that can go a long way so I would say don't count yourself out if you see something go for it have the confidence when you're in there to demonstrate why you're the best candidate and why you think you can make a difference and even if you don't know everything or don't take every box that's okay the enthusiasm the willingness to learn and the the genuine interest can go a long way so you don't have to be the sparkly purple unicorn just get in there and do your best and eventually the right opportunity and you will align I love that I love that thank you so much coma for
