hi my name is Stephanie I'm a software developer based in Baltimore and in this video we're gonna go over what exactly is scrum how it's used on teams and what makes it effective scrum is a framework that teams use to operate and organize the work that they'll be doing it's the framework that teams follow to make sure that their work is best suited for achieving their goals before we go any further I want to quickly go over some roles you'll commonly see on a basic development team first up is the product owner who determines the products direction this person identifies what features should be prioritized and how the product should grow based on the business needs the product should address next is the developer developers make the magic happen and write the code to build out the features they'll work with a product owner to determine if the business requirements are realistic and how long they would take and lastly there's the scrum master this person makes sure that the team members are adhering the best scrum practices so that the team is working effectively together and benefiting from scrum principles already so we've covered roles in scrum now there's a notion of an artifact hang type these are the last few definitions we're going to go over and then we'll see how they all tie in together you can think of an artifact as anything that can represent the team's work and its progress towards their goals the main goal of artifacts is to give transparency so that team members are all on the same page on what needs to be done a product backlog is just a list of features user stories and bugs that are slated to be incorporated into future iterations of the product it's largely driven by the products business requirements so you'll generally see the product owner maintaining this backlog I'll drop a link in the description below for more information on user stories now the Sprint backlog is a list of tasks that the development team has agreed to tackle these tasks are taken from the product backlog and will take the product closer to the team sprinkle for more information on sprints feel free to click on the link of the description so the product increment is the next iteration or version that has all the features that were promised by the ended Sprint the next version of the product must be at a point where it's ready to be delivered to use this part can be a bit vague since what you perceive as complete may be different from what I perceive as complete that's why every team member needs to have the same understanding of what state the product needs to be in in order for it to be considered done for that sprint for example if my team's goal was to make lemonade for a lemonade stand does that mean that our sprinkle will be complete when we've made enough to serve 50 people or 1000 so now that we've gotten all our definitions out of the way I'm gonna go over how they all interact with each other and that's through ceremonies ceremonies are just meetings that are held on a regular basis throughout the Sprint the overall purpose of these meetings is to make sure that the team is on track for meeting their goals during backlog refinement the product owner will tidy up the team's backlog which is kind of like a laundry list of things the team needs to complete in order to meet the team's objectives as a product owner goes through each of the tasks they'll trim out the ones that are no longer relevant update the ones that address a change to business need and prioritize them sprint planning is where the team will review their goals and determine which ones to tackle for the upcoming sprint then they'll pull the items from the backlog that speak to the goal and commit to the ones that can be achieved during the Sprint this part can be a bit tricky since it's a little difficult to gauge how long it takes for a task to be done if we end up under promising and overachieving then we can always bring in more tasks from the backlog if we end up over promising and under then the leftover tasks will get cleaned up during backlog refinement the Sprint is when the developers get to work on the tasks in the sprint backlog don't forget there's a link in the description for more info on sprints during daily standup team members will take turns to stand up and talk about the things that they had completed in the previous day plan on completing over the course of the current day and if there's anything that is preventing them from being able to complete the work that they are slated to do I actually used to dread the ceremony because I initially thought it was a way for the team leader to micromanage me and make sure that I wasn't slacking off and so I felt a lot of pressure to take on more than I could handle but quite frankly I missed the whole point this ceremony is more about being transparent in order to help each other move roadblocks so that the team can reach their goals by this point this friend is pretty much over and Congrats your team has a new version of the product so it's time for the team and anyone whose work is impacted by the product to gather together and demo the new features during this time the team reflects over the last sprint and identify highs and lows things that went well and things that could be improved honesty is incredibly valuable here because we all have room for improvement and it's important to recognize what the team can do better in order to be more effective during the next sprint the point of the retro is to explore what happened during the sprint with the impact it had on the team and what can be done better next time actually the scrum master can help facilitate this meeting by helping the team compile two things that the team agrees to improve and what the team will do in order to make these improvements of reality these improvements can be anywhere from adding the task number to the pull request so that the reviewer can easily look up what the pull request is solving to introducing pizza Wednesdays to boost team morale every team has a unique dynamic and the nature of the project may also vary so things that work well and one team might not work for another but that's what's great about scrum it's flexible so that teams can take the parts that will best work for them and improve their productivity I had a scrum master that was coaching my team and another could currently and he had two different styles for our team's the other team was able to incorporate all parts of scrum right out of the box and thrived under a more rigid structure however my team found that we needed a looser structure particularly around how we were committing to our tasks so we ended up adopting a hybrid of scrum and Kanban for more details on Kanban I'll explain further in a separate video linked in the description below you'll often see scrum and agile used in the same context but they're not the same thing scrum is a structure that a team will follow whereas agile is more like a perspective that your team adopts to develop quickly and incrementally it's kind of like defensive driving the practices you follow to drive defensively is like scrum and safely driving on the road is like agile if you'd like a deeper dive into agile we've got a handy video linked in the description below and that pretty much sums up scrum
