check i'm refreshing the page on youtube it says waiting for code academy does anybody see the the stream is working it should be it should be live okay i see a live now great well welcome everybody we are live on youtube from all over the world we are hosting today the women in tech panel for june 2021 and i'm here with our panelists i would love if everybody can go around the room uh introducing themselves and giving me a just like a twoline background on who you are and what you do sure i'll start um i'm marielle i'm a senior curriculum developer at codecademy um i've developed content across the codecademy platform and more recently focused on data science curriculum and business solutions i can go next hello all i'm califort i'm a senior devops engineer at codecademy um and i focus on monitoring infrastructure continuous integration continuous deployment all the fun things that go on in the background of a production website i can go i'm shirley i am a software engineer at co academy um i work a lot in the front end mostly on the core learning experience of codecademy um so if you've ever taken a course there that's that's my domain um and i come i'm a boot camp grad and i used to be a fashion designer i can go um i like marielle i'm also on the curriculum team at codecademy and also work on data science and data engineering content so we worked together a bunch and before go academy i was a teacher a math teacher and then also worked in farm like biostatistics so i'm julia i work at a software startup in detroit called autobooks i used to be an accountant part of autobook's offerings includes accounting software so now i work on a development team for accounting software hi everyone my name is mackenzie patel i am also an accountant but for honeywell aerospace and i'm currently the chapter leader for the phoenix crypto code catholic chapter um hi everyone my name is i'm based in georgia and actually lead the ai and machine learning chapter in georgia and wc i'm also a founder and cto of my own startup which is called alartec and i do ai stuff there as well i'm sanam and i'm a software engineer at codeacademy i also work mostly on the front end and i work on features that keep our learners engaged i'd say my background is part formal education part selftaught i did a minor in computer science and then everything else sort of learned on my multiple engineering jobs all right well uh thank you very for going around i think we got everybody yeah so the format of this panel is very simple uh i was hoping that both our panelists from code academy and the panelists that come from the community will have some questions on their own some topics they want to discuss so i hope that my job it will just be to pass the mic from person to person and be in the background learning with everybody else in the audience and i would love to get started with an icebreaker so i think i would my first question to you would be why did you think that participating in this panel was a great idea and who do you think that this panel is going to be benefiting the most and why should everybody in my opinion be attending this panel listen to you i know that i heard as the marketing materials were going out for this event i heard from some people in the community who i'm familiar with including a lot of men in the codecademy community so i think it's great that they are deciding to take time out of their day and listen to the stories of women in the community and i think it will also really benefit women like me and mackenzie and shirley for example who have all transitioned careers or planning to transition careers or you know are not doing what their educational background is in um as part of a technical role since uh so many women miss those opportunities while they're young and in school yeah i think to add to that too it's i think especially when you're sort of on that path and you're learning it can be hard if you don't have a network of people already in the industry who you can ask questions to and like sort of learn about their experiences so i think it's really valuable to just get people women especially who are in the industry and just hear their stories and hear their experiences and somebody else that wants to join in i'm sure that you all have some opinion on why this is an important conversation to have i think it's an extremely important conversation to have that's why i wanted to start with this one yeah um oh sorry sophie um i mean big plus one to what everyone else has already said but i i would go as far as to say like this is valuable for everyone to hear not just women right because if there are issues that still need addressing which there certainly are you know awareness of them is that first step towards resolving them so this is a it's a great learning opportunity for people both in and out of tech you know women men everyone yeah um and i was just gonna add i think there are a lot of different jobs in tech that people aren't aware of and so just being able to see people see people's different paths see people's different jobs and learn about them creates a picture for like what you could do um and maybe provides direction towards building building towards a goal that you didn't even know you had so i think it's just useful to see people learn about their work learn about their experiences and then maybe you can build your own experience off that yeah exactly and i think this panel is just going to be very inspiring so i'm personally super excited for it especially you know if you're still in college or a young or a new grad you're not quite sure what you want to do after you graduate or with your career i think i'm just really excited to see again as soon as i like everyone's path and you know what you could potentially do with your career yeah i think that's a good really good point uh it's a good balance between um it's not just a women in tech panel it's also just a tech panel and like you know we have to be aware of both that we want to spread awareness and we want to talk about the difficult topics but at the end of the day when you see other people that are doing the things that you will wish you were doing is really inspiring you say okay well if they did it i can probably do it too right um so who i would love to know in our code academy side who has the first question that they would like to cover today or the first point of debate i would love to hear um i can start off just curious if anybody here has had any experience on like if you've been on like reddit or stack overflow or some other kind of online community speaking about tech working with others if you've ever felt the need to change your profile or alter it in some way so that you don't appear to the general public as a woman yeah that's a great question i think i went back and forth even when creating my stack overflow profile whether to use my name whether to use an image whether to include anything that would vaguely relate to gender specifically for that reason um and i i kind of decided it was more important to me that there was visibility so i went forward with my name that's brave i can piggyback on that i'm not very involved in like different communities like stack overflow and like reddit and things like that that people in tech are but um for me i have like an ethnically ambiguous name and so i actually once joined a community for like professional development for women and was like messaged by the founder and asked if i was a woman because of my name so i think like that's something that can happen to people based off of like their gender but also just like unfamiliar names as well um that's something that like we can all also be aware of yeah i've definitely had to make adjustments in the past i'm a pretty active redditor and i use discord very actively as well um i find myself on reddit often having to like change the way that i write like change my voice so i don't come across as overly feminine just because of the responses that you know that's gotten in the past uh and on discord i've had to change my profile picture multiple times because i was just getting uh unwarranted dms about my appearance which is delightful always yeah that's what inspired that question for me was having to change my discord profile image because of uh just the number of unwanted uh dms yeah yeah it's unfortunate uh it's an unfortunate state of things of of the internet i suppose i think that you bring up a really good point uh you know when i saw when i first heard about the profiles problem and how women have to change the profiles and protect their identities online at first my first gut reaction like i was think a lot of guys have that reaction well it can't be that bad or like come on it's probably just like one or two and then you start thinking about it and you realize it only takes one to ruin your day imagine if you were getting multiple every day or like so i think it's it's important for everybody to take a step back sometimes when they hear these things and these problems and realize that one it can be too many already if this happens once and it's not happening once it's happening all the time so i think this is like one of those instances that really brings you so like open gets you to the door of like oh this is an issue and then you start digging through right and you realize that there's a whole host of issues this is not a single incident it's not like a oneoff that happens online then you start finding out that there's an entire list of unending problems that you have to tackle and you have to deal with so i would love to hear uh if there is any more of these instances or examples you can bring up that that would be great too yeah i actually have an example of this and i think there was a problem with like multiple different people or instances of that but also i think multiple platforms like i had this one particular spammer or like troll person that was just following me across several different platforms just pretty much harassing me from like instagram to twitter to even good reads and i was like really on goodreads so yeah i think it's definitely like someone can start trolling in one platform but it doesn't just end there like you can keep blocking them on everything but you don't really realize how long your internet trail is so you just be really careful because some people are just really um tenacious about just like following you and yeah just causing harm that's really unfortunate does anybody else have something to add to that no we can move on it's fine uh i actually saw this have you ever blocked somebody on instagram and it asks you if you want them to block not just that account but if they create any accounts in the future yes like imagine having to build a feature in a social platform where if you have to block a user because they are harassing you they said somebody thought you know what we should not just block this user we should block all the future accounts because we know they're going to do it again and again like yeah it can get really bad okay let's try to move on to maybe some happier pastors here uh do we have any questions or topics that you want to cover from or some other panelists um i would love to hear our second topic yeah i had a more positive or upbeat question so in what ways yeah and what ways do you think uh working in tech as a woman has actually improved maybe since when you've started and some examples would also be great the floor is open whoever wants to take that question first go ahead yeah so i think um as we're seeing more and more women in tech the general like awareness of maybe like microaggressions right of these preexisting issues in the technical the tech culture um like people just have become more aware of them and because of that like i mentioned earlier like awareness of an issue is your first step towards addressing it like i've so i've been in tech for oh my gosh eight years um it's always fun to realize just how long it's been and i think when i started there wasn't much in the way of like training on microaggressions or on how to interact with people which sounds silly like you wouldn't think that you need to train people on that but as awareness increased the recognition that trainings like that did need to exist increased um and so now i think every company i've been at in the last few years has had some sort of training about what microaggressions are how to avoid them how to deal with them when you encounter them so i think there have definitely been some major strides in improvement i'm just going to add that i think i mean i'm just speaking from my own experience um but i was like 18 and i just like was in university uh i was the only girl in my badge there were like 10 guys and only me and i was really intimidated but then um the head of our department is a woman and then she really inspired me to be you know like okay they're they're men there so what i can you know i can stand out and it actually worked and she's done it for multiple people as far as i know and yeah i think that's a plus i also have been in tech for like about six years um to piggyback on what kala said i think there are a lot at every job that i like switched into there have been sort of more women and i think as the tech industry as a whole has become more open to like nontraditional backgrounds and pathways into tech like that has benefited a lot of folks who maybe like growing up were excluded from you know being talked about as like going into tech like math and engineering were so kind of male dominated and always portrayed as very male dominated and i think like the fact that there are so many different resources to learn and that you know now it's very like public that you don't need the computer science degree to work at a lot of the larger tech companies like i think that that has helped just diversify the field overall and i think in terms of just culturally and politically we're in a moment where people are more open um and more like aware that they could have implicit bias and unconscious bias and so i think that all of that kind of that awareness also sort of helps that it's not necessarily that you meant to discriminate but you know we all kind of grew up in this society that's shifting and now we're talking about it more and i think that that helps i think it goes oh sorry mario sorry i was going to say that that reminds me a little bit of the culture of sports a bit uh like if you are playing a sport and your coach tells you hey you're doing something wrong like if you're playing tennis and you're swinging wrong the racket somebody's going to coach you and tells you and everybody accepts that that's that's what happens you're trying to get better so you get coached and you improve you don't just look at your trainer and say well you know there's no problems here i'm just gonna keep doing and i think it kind of mirrors a little bit when you were talking about like if we realize that we have these biases and there's these problems to work on it it's we should have that mentality of like oh well i'm just gonna learn i'm gonna grow and i'm gonna get better i'm just gonna improve and move on to another place that is better for everybody not have this sort of like forceful mentality of like well there's no problems here we never had a problem and like i don't need to change like it's very interesting because in some things like sports you would never see somebody watching their team and saying well they're perfect they should never change ever like they're always like they need to train more they need to practice more like why don't we have that mentality with issues like this too where it's all about learning and getting better at these issues that sometimes to be fair they've never been covered for decades so to be fair to everybody is like yeah okay you didn't know great but we're gonna get to a place that is better now in and that's i think that mentality of growth and improvement is what's really gonna drive us to a better place you know like everybody's just being willing to be part of the conversation and learn what do you think they say everybody i was just gonna say um i think i got into tech so i got into tech maybe three or four years ago um i think at a point when a lot of women were really just starting to get into the field more um and so i i started out with a lot of peers who were really new to everything but one thing that i've noticed is that there have been an increasing number of women in more senior positions over the past few years and i think that that makes for an easier situation because you start to see the pathways forward um as you're gaining your start um i know that there's an engineer at codecademy who was particularly inspiring to me as i was getting started at codecademy um and having her there i think just made it easier for me to feel like i can do this you know this is this is a place where i belong you know you're gonna force me to unmute you if i if i don't see people starting to jump in i want everyone to participate in these conversations don't make me meet you yeah i had another question that um muriel really reminded me of um you mentioned that there was um a woman at codecademy who you looked up to and i have something similar where i work um there's a woman who is like uh you know she definitely like knows her stuff really well like she's one of like definitely one of the top like knowledge people sorry the words aren't working but um you know she's one of the smartest people i work with have ever worked with um and she's been a huge role model to me in like acquiring technical skills so just wondering for the group maybe who's some of your um who some of your role models in tech are who are women pretty similarly like most of my role models have been people i guess within my own realm of existence you know not necessarily someone i'm watching from afar but like my own peers um it's i find something like there's just something really great about getting to know someone personally and getting to understand their story and you know working with them means that you can help to support each other so all of my role models are like my past peers uh so i won't call them out by name um but yeah it's i've been really lucky to work with some incredible women over my career take inspiration from them yeah i'm relatively newer to tech i only started getting into cryptocurrencies uh less than a year ago but one of my first onramps was this group called shifai which is a defy educational program for women and that was sort of one of the first things that got me really interested in crypto and the woman who runs that her name is maggie love and she is just so smart about all things crypto and defy and that was just really big a really big inspiration for me because i don't think her background i don't think she's a developer but she is just so inspirational and knowledgeable about this space that i just really look up to her and i was like you know what i can do this too so um that was often one of the big influences and then i'm also part of this other group called shi256 so there's a lot of women in crypto groups that i'm a part of and it's just really heartening to see that that's there and that it exists and new ones are being started all the time so i think i just got in a really good time and yeah there's a lot of role models sitting on space i want to hear from the people that don't talk at all surely i'm going to bring you in the spotlight here say something thanks for coming i i wanna i wanna i wanna hear your opinion okay i think so i i've been in the tech industry for about three to four years and when i first started my job i think uh my first job uh one of the most important things for me was that there was a woman there that i really looked up to and we became really close um and i think it's for me and for a lot of people i've talked to who are in the industry especially women i think it's really important to have a supportive group of coworkers that you can just relate to talk about things with and i think um especially when you're entering it and you're new and it's everything is sort of scary like it's it's really valuable to have role models and mentors who have been in the industry that can share their experiences and you can share your experiences what you're going through um and i do and i do want to say that i think at co academy we have a really great supportive group of engineers uh curriculum developers women in tech and i think that's really valuable great thanks sure um i'll call you out again in like five minutes don't worry if you don't beat yourself i'll keep an eye on you uh okay so i think uh julian mckenzie you both had a chance to ask a question uh niger do you have a chance to ask your question yet yes actually so we just talked about how like being around uh women in tech is really empowering and um well maybe some people are like where do we you know find these people and uh did you uh when you were learning and acquiring your coding skills or whatever where did you find this moment to connect to and how can we do it i can answer that one um so i managed in computer science and math and then i like majored in econ and i moved back to dc where i'm from and was sort of like okay how do i get a job now with like little bits of information and through these three different areas and at the time and back in like 2015 there was it felt like there was this big push to like get women into stem and so i kind of just looked into like what groups um existed there are a lot of meetups like i joined women who code dc's chapter and i think more than anything like that community just sort of like taught me that oh there's so many people getting into tech at like all different ages and i think i felt like i was behind because i didn't major in software engineering i didn't do an internship in the summer at a tech company and then there were just so many people who had kind of maybe switched careers and were like working in tech at good companies or you know we're switching careers like later on so i think on top of being like a good place to go and kind of like practice your skills and just even hear of what companies were hiring in the area it helped sort of solidify like oh i can do this like plenty of people are doing this everyone's background is different um so i think that was something that was really helpful for me i similarly to use uh sanam i also i was like a math major in college and so i had this kind of technical skill set or at least mathematical skill set but that didn't doesn't really translate into like tech jobs necessarily um and so i actually my first my first longer term job was as a math teacher um and i did that for four years also in dc um and and i had a lot of really amazing super smart female role models in that job um but i also really saw how like there were these really really smart technically skilled women who were being paid like we were there was definitely more women than men even on the in the math department i think we were like 10 women and two men or something um but really being underpaid uh in our roles as teachers compared to other men and women with the same skills who were working in tech um and so i ended up my path was i ended up taking classes and enrolling in graduate school to learn more technical skills and i even enrolled in a graduate school program it's called applied statistics for social science research because i was specifically interested in the social sciences and like education um and i think that also that also attracted a lot of women um but as we went through the program together and saw how people were graduating and getting these jobs in tech and um and able to still contribute for example to education like working at codecademy is such a dream because i get to still work as a teacher but actually like build more of my technical skills and get paid what i think those technical skills should be paid um which is you know a separate problem teachers should be paid way way more and that's a totally different thing um but i think if you can find things that you're interested in um and slowly kind of turn those use that as like a a way to kind of wind your way into a tech career i think you meet a lot of people on the way along the way i also joined there's like a our ladies uh group that i joined in um new york city and went to some of the talks and like met people and networked through that and that was another really great community of women [Laughter] our brains are working at the same level this is amazing i love it all right there we go go um i was just gonna i was just gonna shout out the code newbie community which i think um for folks who are especially i think interested in web dev but um they have they have folks across the spectrum of tech uh it's it's a really welcoming community i think for um people of all genders and it but it was started by uh suranya barak who's just like a phenomenal person and she's i think a great role model uh for any any person getting started in tech woman or man or any other gender it's i i would definitely check out the code newbie community on twitter as well thank you for the shout out yeah i was i was almost gonna say the same thing but not quite so not only we step on each other but we say the same things i wanted to follow up on what sophie said about role models and i think what caught my attention was you said you were surprised you went there i was like wow 10 women and like two men and like why was this surprising why do we have this this idea that like well you know it's probably gonna be all guys in this room like are those stereotypes are we imposing that on ourselves or like is it because we've seen it like growing up we've seen like what the people are in the room usually are and that's what we expect i mean i can speak from personal experience and i think uh others in this room have probably had similar experiences like i didn't have a single female math teacher and i was a math major in college from ninth grade up through college not a single female math teacher and for those that are not in the u.s ninth grade is about what age so like uh okay so since you're early teens uh wow that's that's really surprising i think you know what i'm thinking about it now and i think for me my first math teacher who was a female was probably in college like sophomore year college is when i finally came across one so so you think are you all you know we have all of you here so i want to hear everybody's opinion is it is it something that happens a lot do you feel in your personal experiences that you've seen that you expect the room to be male dominated because we've seen it everywhere and it's just sort of like a norm you don't wish she was there but it seems to be prevalent everywhere i know there's statistics about how many female ceos we have how many people and like higher levels of management but i think there's a difference between reading it in the new york times the percentages and seeing it every day when you go to work when you go to the doctor when you go to you know like whatever you um i would love to hear your opinions on like how you experience this in a day to day or year to year i'm just gonna go first um so i grew up in the middle east so uh yeah i saw that mostly like all teachers would say oh you're good at math uh that's that's strange like mostly boys like math so it started from a very young age and then uh when we actually like got to choose our major like uh yeah not a lot of uh females were interested in this and so in college you know when you see i just said like i was the only girl at college so it's i feel like it's both i don't i think it's there it's not imposed or something yeah you know one thing that the human brain is really good at is identifying patterns um it's so good at that that it sometimes identifies patterns where there aren't any uh in this case though i think that's what it is right like you see or are told so many times that this is a men's field or like this conference is attended mostly by men and it's it just becomes something that you expect um i think this is less and less the case these days um you know like as the importance of like uh diverse representation is being recognized uh but because we've seen these patterns for so long it's a bit ingrained to have that expectation i think it's also pretty industry dependent so i was thinking about this recently like the more established industries like for example accounting or medicine i think they have made more strides in terms of equality with women just because they've been around for a little bit longer like when i was going through school like i did have quite a few female accounting professors and even at my job now like over half my team is women and like all the managers in my group are all women so i think i'm just sort of used to that but then when i started like getting into crypto and looking at tech it was just not that way at all and i think maybe that's because tech is just such a newer industry like accounting was a thing in like you know the 14th century whereas tech has just been very recent so i'm thinking no maybe it's like a time issue is all but you know that doesn't mean like i'm we shouldn't wait like 500 years for women to get equality in tech i think like we should definitely fast forward that a lot but yeah i think it's very just like industry dependent i i also want to add like i remember when i was making the switch um to check or thinking about making the switch it was definitely something i was thinking about i was sort of nervous i think and i think that when and i'm not saying this stereotype is true but i think that a lot of people have this stereotype of what it is to have a job in tech which is you know you work at a really huge company in the silicon valley and you live breathe eat uh tech and i don't think that's necessarily true but i also want to call back to what we were talking about before of like just there are so many spaces in tech and that is not the entire tech industry especially as more and more industries like sort of go into tech and need technology need the internet um i think that there's just so many different aspects of technology that you can be in and it's not just the one maybe stereotype you have in your head of what a software engineer or what a tech worker is i think that's a great point about sort of what we kind of used to maybe assume made like a software developer and what that job would be like i know that i was guilty of kind of just assuming that like to be a software engineer you had to be good at math and i've seen some people write about that in the youtube comments i was good at math i was always in like advanced math classes and i thought oh okay well their jobs in tech let me do a software engineering minor two because i'm good at math and i don't think that you need to be good at math to be like a good software developer i think we have so many folks here who maybe don't have that much experience with math and cs and are great developers on my team um and i also think that like when like the software engineering field in general is just so much more collaborative that i than i thought like we have to have great communication skills and collaboration skills and i think when i used to picture software engineers i thought of somebody like working in a dark room on their computer like all day just like having tasks working on them for like four days straight and just like handing them off and i think like in agile development and kind of at every company that i've worked on the culture is just so much more kind of working as a team so i think just these types of panels are helpful to kind of share what it actually is like working as a software developer on a daytoday basis because i think more people are interested in working somewhere where you're problem solving but you're also like sharing and working with others and giving feedback and you know um i think one also another point sorry that i'm rambling was when i was applying to jobs initially i think there's this big push of like sharing side projects and i think like that is something that now like as a company like we don't ask people to like share their site projects for example because like we recognize that not everyone who's a good software developer is programming all the time outside of their job um so i think that that's something that's important for kind of employers to keep in mind as well that you know not everybody is going to have this portfolio that's filled with side projects that they worked on and when you kind of demand that of people you're excluding a lot of people whether it's like parents whether it's people with kind of nontraditional backgrounds i think that's a really good segue oh my god it happened the third time it's it's just like uh okay i just wanted to push back again against this idea of being good at math because and i mean i'm sure that sophie has a feeling has a bunch of feelings about this also but um when i look at someone like for example my husband who did not go super far within math he never did math in college um but he uses linear algebra in his daytoday and he he still keeps telling me like i'm really bad at math and i'm like no you just think you're bad at math because it was probably taught to you in a way that didn't work for you but at this point you know he has to solve really complicated mathematical things on his daytoday basis and he does it well and i think that that's kind of what you end up doing in the case of a lot of technical careers you know it doesn't it's great if you have that mathematical background but you just need to be able to problem solve and a lot of it is just sticking with a problem and working with others as sonoma pointed out is one of the things that helps you the most i have two quick thoughts one is that i 100 agree i i thought i was bad at math for like my whole childhood and it wasn't until i had one really amazing class in college that i realized that i liked it and that i was good at it um and it wasn't i don't think that it's a good at math bad at math like dichotomy at all i think i mean at least in the us and i'm sure it's true elsewhere like the education system is not really built in a way that mirrors what the real world looks like so the way that you learn math when you're in high school is like not really the way that you're going to apply it in a job in the future and so you're not going to be given like 10 algebraic equations like asked to solve them or given a derivative to calculate or so i don't know but you're not gonna have okay in in real life you're gonna have a a problem that you have to solve and you need to figure out what tools you can use to solve it and and mathematics is really like a toolbox that you can tap into to solve those problems and the only thing i honestly i use very little of what i learned in my formal training in my everyday job what i use is like the problem solving and the the research skills to like figure out which tool to use um but it's not really the same tools that i learned how to use um in school i'll stop there isn't that like a running joke like anybody that's going to college you always get asked how much of what you learned in those four years and those six years of ago how much you actually use in your job and everybody will say five percent if it gets to that like i don't remember any courses from anywhere before senior year and if it's been like a while since i graduated i don't remember anything from all four years like i don't even i couldn't even point in the book where it is um and i think that's a great segue now to talk about um i know we've talked about how tech is not one thing a lot of people say i want to get a job in tech and that sounds like there's like one place one door one desk where everybody goes and applies and puts the name and that's just not true right and you're all proof of that all eight of you here have different backgrounds working differently and it's all tech so because tech is just everywhere now uh so i would love to hear from all of you how you see what you do in tech in the greater image of if you were somebody that is 17 16 and you're thinking well what am i going to do when i'm 18 when i'm an adult should i study in college do i self teach let me self teach myself should i go for this part of tech that part of tech how would you navigate that maze that it is finding a job in tech which means a million things and everybody does it differently so i would love to hear from our parents and career gaming also from a community panelist what do you think that is if you have to explain to somebody that is 15. hey i'm in high school how do you navigate this how do you shop if you will for your perfect career in tech how do you find about this um i think that there's i think one of the good things about tech is like you know even if at 15 you have no idea what you want to do um or what you want to do is very different from tech and you land on it later it's like never too late to go into tech so if you start with some kind of technical education or none um or you're worried that you're you're choosing like the wrong skills to learn or something i think you could just throw that idea out the window because you know you can always learn more skills later you can learn skills um on the job sometimes like i do um so i think something is like i think people get really bogged down sometimes and it's like where do i start like what should i do first and like i think the answer is like what is interesting to you like what sounds like it could be fun or even if it just sounds like easy to get started just to get you hooked i feel like you know there's maybe not one correct way to start but um you know i think online learning like through codecademy is really great um or if you have any like local meetups here in detroit we have a code boot camp called grand circus that i've done free classes through where i've gone precoded times like in person and done code workshops and stuff just so you get like your feet wet with something meet other people who are interested in it and just learn what you like before you commit to trying to like learn a skill that's what i would say um okay i'll go next um so i think i would tell them that it looks nothing like the movies you're not gonna become a hacker at all um but honestly i think the main question would be are you good at coding rather than what should i do with coding because i think coding is like it's fun i'm not saying it's not fun but i think it can be really frustrating and dealing with that frustration i think is the main key like if you will become successful for programmer or not so i would be like okay go arm c and then if you survive pursue coding that's my advice okay so i think we already have two in the camp of you should get your feet wet and try it out so test run i guess that's why you test around your cars right dealership uh okay so test it out and see if it's for you and can i get a quick answer here for one question which is if you're bad at math should you run away from tech no no no no no no no no everybody agrees like that's just blatantly a lie that when people are like whoa you have to be super skilled at math and physics and whatever like that's that's just not true right and okay just wanted to check just quick quality check here okay so that's something can i add something i at least i think that and this is related to the math thing that like i think a lot of people think that coding is extremely like analytic analytical and you have to be like i don't have to have like insane technical skills but i would also push back in that and say that like i personally think coding is extremely creative and like if you come from a background where you love art where you love problem solving if you love anything related to just like being creative and thinking about problems and thinking how to do something i think like you are extremely prepared to be a coder and like you could be a really really great coder even if you're not doing that but i think that's a common misconception because i think coding is actually extremely creative there's so many things you can build with it so many things you can do with it and it's like sort of an endless opportunity and that's what makes it fun that's what makes tech fun that's why people want to work in fun and deck right i'll give the fun story that my mom has her her undergraduate degree is in art from risd um i think like sculpture design or something and then she taught art for a number of years in high school and then she ended up with a phd in computer science like writing computer programs that and now she does a lot of like art and computer science uh work that blends those two fields and there's so much overlap um but probably the issue probably the issue is also coming from the fact that when we say bad in math what does that even mean like math is not math is not three lines but have you seen these books in math like i've looked at math books and they go it's a lot okay the tech that we built today is in a lot of complicated math like what does that even mean you're bad at math why what type of math what kind like you know i think that's part of it right yeah exactly because i think you should be good at problem solving and that's why people get confused like they have to like do you know calculus while coding no you just have to like solve problems and like basic logic that's it yeah i thought i was bad at math for the longest time because i couldn't do mental math in my head like whenever i was at a restaurant i just couldn't do the tip of my head and i just felt so inadequate but then i realized wait i can just have a calculator and then i was able to do like calculus and and like differential equations and all that stuff so and i think one other point about um tech is that if you want to get into it you don't have to be a programmer or developer or anything like one thing that i found is that you can do like community and tech which is why like we're all here today it's what fede does like a lot of tech companies like they want to have really strong community leaders just because it makes the community better for either if you're learning or using a product or something like you don't have to do you can do something nontechnical but still being a tech company and get that atmosphere and get that drive as well so yeah or like finance and accounting just like different functions um so it's definitely like way more than you can do than just hacking okay more opinions on getting into tech and how to navigate the maze that it is i think uh some people in the chat were saying that it might come down to mentorship and connections like sometimes if you have somebody that works at tech in some capacity uh they will help you because i mean like you here right now right i'm asking you these questions if people around the world have this chance of just being here in this room and say well i like computers like tech but i don't know which part i like the most so how to prepare for this like so i feel like mentorship might be a big part of of getting into into it do you agree it can be if you have the opportunity um mentors don't just like grow on treaties unfortunately but if you have if you know someone who's in tech who you have a good relationship with then absolutely mentorship can be a great pathway a great way to navigate the massive and confusing world of tech um and what else did you say uh community um we were talking about community yeah yeah like i i think there's something really valuable in a community right like i'm relatively active in the codecademy community discord server and one of the things that i enjoy the most about being on that server is like watching other people like noncodecademy staff interact with each other and like help each other figure out answers to their questions whether they be technical or career oriented like it's community can be super valuable and super important um in navigating this field for sure okay i mean it's kind of like career counseling at this point like you know how you look at real cancer in your last year of high school like they tell you oh there's all these majors you could do engineering in 10 different things which one fits your profile right kind of like yeah there's like 100 million ways of doing tech uh marion sam you have anything to add to this um i i think just that uh i mean like i said the code me community was really important to me as i was getting started so just to echo again how incredibly important community can be uh and you know also obviously mentorship like you mentioned and like i mentioned earlier having a mentor within codecademy was incredibly valuable and i think um this has been brought up a few times but just starting with what you're actually interested in and also what your current background is you know i i kept thinking when i was getting into tech i was starting from you know nothing but in fact i hadn't i had several careers behind me already and those contributed to the direction that i went in tech you know having a master's in education means that i not only know tech coming in after you know going through a boot camp but i could figure out really innovative ways of teaching that tech and you know knowing linguistics and having that background meant that i actually really specifically understood how languages work so when i came across programming languages i was like oh these are just languages this is just another type of way of working with you know essentially nouns and verbs and adjectives and all of these components basically work together in the same way um so really start with where you are and your interests don't start by saying okay well i'm starting everything completely over so that's one piece of advice i would definitely put out there another thing i'll add to that with like kind of starting with what you like for me a big push of why i got into tech was it felt like every single kind of company in industry there was going to be like tech jobs in that industry and so i'm someone who's very interested in like education and social impact and like i do a lot of like refugee related volunteering and so like in all of those worlds there's places that tech skills are needed and so i kind of thought more of tech not as i'm inherently interested in programming i'm not and i feel like i mentioned that all the time at work as like an example that like you don't have to be someone who just like loves to code um but for me it's like a skill and i really enjoy the teamwork aspect of it and so that's kind of like why i'm still here six years later but it's for me it's about developing the skill set and experiences that then i can go and use at you know like a company or nonprofit that's like doing work that i care about and so that's part of how i ended up at code academy is you know we're working to make kind of tech education more accessible um so it doesn't necessarily just have to be this like i'm passionate about programming so i'm coming into programming okay okay so uh we have we are at the tail end of this believe it or not it's already been a while uh i wish we had like a day to talk about this i feel like we have a lot to share so i'm gonna go through some q a and because we have about 10 minutes left in the event i'll ask you all to be brief if you want to answer some of these questions whoever wants to jump in feel free open mic uh one of the questions is have any of you gone through coda academy or do you have degrees so i guess the question is are you selftaught or do you use degrees to get you where you are now i started out on codecademy sorry that was my very beginning i i didn't get a degree in computer science like i said i had a degree in linguistics i have a degree in education but i went through the flatiron school boot camp to become a full stack developer anybody else i did the sql course on codecademy when i started my job because i had never had any exposure to it and people were teaching me at work which was super duper helpful but when you're learning something in the context of work sometimes your understanding of it can only be applied to like what you're very actively working on so reaching for outside resources like that can definitely help to like broaden your knowledge in the way that i would imagine you know maybe having a computer science degree would but um definitely glad i didn't get a whole computer science degree i feel like stack is selftaught at any level like once you get a job you're gonna have to selfteach yourself like if you want to stay relevant you have to um can i get a show of hands on how many of you use a formal education degree to get your first job one two kind of like four of you meshish okay ish so as you can see in the audience uh they're watching live uh it seems like there's a lot of your self driving and self teaching that you can do and it's not gonna stop you from being in tech all right question number two let's uh go through these um what has changed for you in tech because of the pandemic has it been an improvement stayed about the same or has it been difficult being in getting being in it or getting into tech because the pandemic what do you think i think the tech industry very easily lends itself to a distributed workforce so it's not been a big change for me personally i did change jobs in the middle of the pandemic which was interesting uh doing all of my interviewing over zoom but apart from that i think it's been uh easy breezy it's it's not been terrible at all are you heard of here first folks easy breezy than the pandemic get a job in tech and the next pandemic will be okay not the pandemic itself but working in tech during the pandemic okay i will not minimize the impact of coca 19. yeah yeah no i'm talking about yeah of course we're talking about jobs in tech yeah i just want to add like i know like the pandemic was horrible for all of us but i think um it gave us i mean people in tech a chance to show how important we are like you know i feel like maybe some people were kind of disconnected from the whole the whole like development of uh tech and now they have to use it so you know i think it's better for us and i want to add uh for people with like uh social anxiety i think uh has been great to you know just get into it okay awesome yeah and just watch that real quick i think because of panda real quick yeah real quick everything is very simple in terms of like meeting up with new people online like before it might have been conducted in person but now like i can just message like anyone be like hey we have a quick coffee chat online and so it's just way easier to network that way i think great all right this question is sort of connected to it but not quite um they want to know uh they're going through a boot camp and they feel overwhelmed what advice do you have for someone who like me who doesn't have any experience in coding and how not to let impostor syndrome get to you and that's the big word imposter syndrome a lot of people have it in tech so for the panelists that have gone through a boot camp uh what do you think of uh i can answer that i think that uh personally imposter syndrome is something that is very common and it never goes away i think i still feel it sometimes uh you see people who are well established and there's always going to be someone better than you at everything in life um but i think to answer the question about like not uh about going through the boot camp i think that for me i think it's really important to remember why you wanted to do this in the first place and whether that's like taking a step back and just like taking a break from it or just like doing something that's fun and like reminds you like why you love coding or why you want to become a software engineer i think that's really important because it's really easy to just get burnt out when you're looking at the same we're trying to solve the same i don't know like loot problem five times a day so i think it's just important to take a step back and like just remember the big picture here and remember why it's fun why you love it i'll quickly add i didn't go through a boot camp but i think that like this feeling of being overwhelmed is really common in tech because there's just so much that you can learn and so it's really easy to feel like you just don't know enough um but i think one thing that i try to remember is that like everybody has like everybody is in that same boat and some people like are better at hiding the fact that they don't know something and some people are like like me come into the room and are like i just don't know this i feel uncomfortable um but if you just keep in mind that like tech is changing so quickly that everybody's gonna have to keep learning and not everybody is and everybody is not gonna know the next new thing um then i think maybe that feels a little less overwhelming to try to keep up i don't know yeah yeah uh somebody in the chat was asking what's in boston syndrome that's what happens when you just feel like you're not good enough that you are fake that maybe you shouldn't be applying for this job you're not ready for the job or like when you're already in the job you feel like maybe your manager is gonna realize that you're not so smart or like you don't know what you said you knew and like you just have this anxiety that you're just not good enough for for your role or and i think that prevents a lot of people from applying for jobs a lot of people are selftaught and they feel like they're not ready to apply for jobs and they spend a year learning things like so so that that's what's uh impossible is about you can read online more about it last question that we're going to cover today what advice and i think this goes for the community panelists more what advice do you give to someone with social anxiety wanting to get involved with the community and learning to code with others yeah i'll take this one first uh you can just don't i know a lot of our communities like make ours and mine uh we have discord communities like specifically for our chapters so for that that's a little more anonymous you don't have to show your your face or talk live during meetings i think that's been helpful for a lot of people because they'll interact maybe collaborate on a project but there's a lot more anonymity that way and then you can sort of build up from there maybe like talk during a meeting or something like once you're comfortable something to add to dealing with uh social anxiety and participating with others online when you are yeah i also said that i think it's more common in our community in general like people who are in tech so um you're not alone uh and yeah as uh mackenzie just said you can just type no one's gonna force you to like show you show your face or something like that you can basically just chat and we'll get to know you that way and i would think that if your anxiety is ever about like people being rude to you or judging you or telling you that you don't know enough about something um the great thing about internet communities is you can just block them um so yeah don't be afraid to do this somebody's if somebody's a jerk to you online like in like coding communities uh just remember that that reflects on them entirely and not on you at all thank you yeah i think break that barrier break the ice go to an event see what it's like just even if you just lurking in the back don't say anything just see it and hopefully you can kind of warm up to it slowly no no no stress okay so we got about a minute left we are at the end of the talk so i'll just give you the floor to you the panelists and if you want to make any final remarks anything you want to say any encouragement and advice everybody get in tech get in there i know that is very exciting times to be in tech right now so uh whatever you know the floor is yours i can give a piece of advice um i think for once you are in your tech job in terms of kind of trying to battle imposter syndrome this is something i learned from colleagues on my teams is like they kind of consistently keep track sort of their contributions so on different projects of like varying things so that you can kind of go back on that and be like look i contributed all these things to the team because in a particular moment where you're struggling through a problem you sort of feel like oh i can't do this thing it's supposed to be easy um and so it's it's nice to be able to kind of step away and be like wow we'll look at all these great things that i've done um and as you grow more senior in your career to continue to like make the field more like to improve the culture then it's like your responsibility kind of to lift up other people from marginalized communities and share their successes and accomplishments anybody that wants to add any final words are we good i think we're pretty good thank you everybody for joining in the chat what were you gonna say i was just gonna say don't hold yourselves back from a tech career all right yeah don't hold yourself back you can just go for it you can do it yeah you can do it everybody can do it all right thank you everybody for your time today it was a lot of fun i learned a lot i hope that our audience online learn a lot and i really hope to catch you
