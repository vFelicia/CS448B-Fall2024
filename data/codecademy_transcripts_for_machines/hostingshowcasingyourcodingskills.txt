hello my name is Farish and i'm a californiabased developer and in this video we're continuing off of my previous video on how to build a portfolio and we're gonna dig a little deeper and go a little farther and talk about hosting and showcasing your portfolio in in a way we're gonna talk about marketing yourself so let's get started to start things off I've created a wireframe example of a portfolio site and in this site I'm gonna mention what to include that potential employers and clients might be looking for then I want to go over finding inspiration for your portfolio site and what looking for inspiration I'm gonna discuss the potential mental traps to avoid also these sites are a great way to market yourself they don't talk about LinkedIn if it's available in your country as a way to market yourself and showcase your site I'm gonna go over hosting your site via github and if you like using traditional hosting for the same result lastly I'm going to discuss some options when you want to host something that isn't just plain HTML CSS and JavaScript let's head on over to the wireframe I'm over here at figma calm and figma is a wire framing site to help you make mockups it's free so if you're ever curious about wire framing I would suggest checking it out so I'm gonna start off by making disclaimer here this is not a discussion about what your site should look like but more of what I believe it should include if you're intimidated by looking up other developers portfolio sites there's nothing wrong to make something as simple as being Illustrated here the point is to get something up and running as your skills grow there's nothing wrong with then changing your site to demonstrate your latest skills so let's start by exploring this wireframe and as you can see here this is my intro or home page I did include a home link obviously you should have one there's not any major information here I just mentioned a couple hobbies and not much else you could treat this like about page you don't have to follow this style right whatever you're comfortable with now if you notice here I have a contact link and I have a contact page and what I recommend is that you don't use your regular email account because when this is on a publicfacing website you're gonna hit with a lot of spam I would create a separate gmail or hotmail or whatever you prefer for this now if you want to put your phone number that's perfectly fine I would recommend getting a new one from Google Voice it is a free service and if it isn't available in your country I would use a messaging service like whatsapp or telegram and be sure to include which program you're using and what is your ID and don't forget to add any social media accounts you're heavily active with now the next page is the skills section and let me tell you the story which has always led me to say put your strongest skill first so I have a friend who is a senior level Ruby on Rails developer and he likes to put his skills in alphabetical order he had applied for a job and got a email back from the company that said that they felt he wouldn't be good fit he was kind of in shock because he was more than qualified for the position so he emailed back and finally got a phone meeting with their technical recruiter and the recruiter told him you posted CSS HTML and JavaScript before Ruby on Rails and the recruiter thought that he was employing that Ruby on Rails was this wicked skill level always place your strongest skill first if it's Ruby enrolls do that and even if it's not your strongest skill if this is the job you're applying for I still would put it first and let them know that you feel your call fight for the job show confidence even in your portfolio and resume now let's talk about your portfolio as you can see I have a portfolio link and I'm gonna go ahead and click on the profile link page and what I did here was I had taken screenshots of a couple sites no I did not do these sites I have my own but for demonstration purposes I would do the same thing and that's that's how I would approach it but I would put a couple screenshots of the site she done I would usually include at least three projects that's a good number to me I feel it gets things across I would go by order of difficulty your most advanced project first along with a couple others and as a beginner you may not have many options but you still want to show some growth then lastly I have a github link and I would make sure that's on there and I would also have a notable projects list and what I mean by that is if you have like six summer projects pick your three best ones and have them there and you might be asking isn't the same as the portfolio yes and no the portfolio links to the actual site sometimes Tech recruiters don't care about looks or seeing the actual site they're gonna find out within your code what you can do and they don't always have time to go through your whole github so you want to kind of guide them to your best projects I feel this is a really good practice for you and don't worry as a beginner they're not expecting that much they just want to see if your code matches what they're looking for now let's talk about finding inspiration for your portfolio site and how that can lead you into an imposter syndrome trap and as you can see I'm over here at Google and it is really easy to search for developer portfolio inspiration here let's take a look at one of the sites I've found and do a walkthrough now I'm over here on Matt's site and it's a really nice site and if you notice in the beginning he has a little introduction like I did in the wireframe and if we scroll down some more he gives additional information here it talks about his experience you scroll down some more he shows his skills levels and there's a lot of information here and this is a point where I don't want you to start getting intimidated because you can't fill it up as much as this guy has one thing I want you understand right here is that you're not competing with them when starting your portfolio nobody expects you to have the level of information that this site has the role trap is when you search for inspiration on Google usually the better sites come up first you expect these sites to be better than what you can produce in the beginning what we want to avoid is letting imposter syndrome and fear cause you to avoid starting your portfolio site so keep that in the back of your mind when you're searching for inspiration you expect the best to come up in the search results don't let that ruin your confidence because you're not at the point to achieve something similar use these sites to search for what you can achieve in the future and also for potential informational ideas to put in now I'm going to talk about two other resources you can use to find inspiration for your portfolio website and we're going to start with dribble I'm over here at dribble and it is a community / social media network for designers I felt it was important to show you this site because even though this video is about portfolios you can find a lot of inspiration here there are a lot of cutting edge trends to be discovered and for example I'm going to click on this site over here and it has the look and feel of industrial design using CSS grid and if you notice the designer put an email address Skype and telegram ID here so as you grow and experience this is also a great place to market your skills now I'm going to search for a portfolio here but I'm not going to go into each one of these the idea here is that you should click on a design that catches your attention and see what ideas you can borrow from it now let's head on over to the awards website I'm over here at the awards site and I will have a direct link to this interval in the show notes below unlike durable this is a competition site websites are submitted to be scored and reviewed but the reason I'm showing you this site is as an additional resource for inspiration and there are different categories to search through I happen to be in the portfolio section and this designers website has caught my eye so I'm going to click on that and see what it looks like up close so in this first section of this website the developer has contact information and social media if I scroll down a little farther you'll notice a list of projects and links to them and if I go past the project section he has a list of his skills so I'm gonna go back to what I stated earlier these are some of the items you should always include with your site and as you progress in your skill level don't be afraid to submit some sites here I'm working on a project that should be completed by the end of the year and I'm gonna submit it here and the reason being is I believe the design is competitive and I really have nothing to lose the worst thing that can happen is you don't get award so what if you get a high score or award that could be career changing now we're gonna talk about marketing yourself and showcasing your portfolio on LinkedIn so I'm over here at LinkedIn and the first thing I like to say is whatever you're planning on a career choice how you're gonna approach it etc you should make a LinkedIn page for yourself unlike other social media platforms chop myrrh cumin is heavily integrated here now I'm gonna use my profile to cover some of the items you should do on here and something you shouldn't do which I actually did so starting off you will know is this contact info link and when you click on it you'll see that it has my website email address and Twitter handle that's all good but let's talk about my mistake here my website isn't up I pulled it off the internet about 6 months ago before the making of this video now I've been working on revamping it but life happens and you get sidetracked because you're too busy and one of my biggest issues is I never really liked my site I just needed something up and running back around 2015 I shoulda never pulled my site down I shall lift it up and maybe at worse putting a new site coming soon message or popup I created a big hole in my portfolio and profile because I pulled my site down that might have been more vanity on my part but it's something important to remember now I'm going to point out a couple other things here first in this section there's an introduction area and as part of this area there's a option to include some links on here I included my most recent video for code Academy a start up event where I was featured as a guest speaker on react native and one of my older YouTube videos as you're starting out this would be a good place to put links to projects you have worked on don't worry about the skill level in the beginning just show that's your coding now the other item I like to point out is this section that's a little farther down here you will see some recent profile views and search results and this is why I stated earlier you should start your LinkedIn account now even if you're not ready to put your portfolio up I get about three to five recruitment messages a week and these are opportunities that won't exist anywhere else now in case you're wondering what is triggering these search results really I mentioned to make sure you have a list of skills in your portfolio you want to have those same skills listed on LinkedIn these search results are happening whenever somebody searches for react developers in the LA area so when you update your portfolio consider to update your information over here skills and links to recent projects can get you help found in this system now let's go on over and talk about github and some hosting options no I'm over here at github and I'm already assuming that you know the basics of get if you don't don't worry just visit the code Academy course on using the command line and get now to set up your free site hosting all you have to do is make a new repository and with that repository you have to name it a specific way your username which in this case is Farish cash plus dot github dot any files you push to this repo will be available at the URL your username github dot IL to demonstrate this I am currently pushing an index.html file to this repository now I'm going to hit reload and we can see the file is there now I'm going to go to the address bar and type the name of the repo as a URL now I'm gonna go ahead and type Farish cache dot github dot let's give this a moment to load and as you can see I have a very plain text web site here the good news is github is now ready to be used to host your portfolio so the next thing I like to discuss is what if you want a little bit more control and maybe your own domain name along with the email address well this is where web hosting would be used instead let's talk about that some over here at my web hosting service and the area I'm ian is called the cPanel and I have some items blurred off for privacy reasons but what I really want to point out here is the item called email accounts as long as I own a domain name I could generate as many email accounts for that domain as I like that's part of this service and this is a major advantage over github since github doesn't even offer email as a service and if you care about branding and maybe what would be considered to be a more professional look having your own domain name and email address is an advantage over github pages and Gmail in this regards but let me emphasize this this is based on your goals and your budget considerations in the beginning there's nothing wrong with not spending money and using github in Gmail especially when getting started now github and web hosting is great for hosting websites that are just vanilla HTML CSS JavaScript and maybe some jQuery what if you need to host something more advanced let's talk about that so to start off one thing I like to point out is that once you get into more advanced projects you're free options start to become limited and in case you're wondering couldn't you just host react and few GS projects on github well you can but if the project is more than just a single page app additional complications can occur and sometimes all this extra work is not worth it especially considering the other options out there so I'm going to start with the front end right now and talk about Search Search is a site we use for our react intents of course it is free and it is easy to use you just run the npm command to install surge and then you go to your project directory and you run the search command in there search will give you a URL for your project you just have to link that URL to your portfolio and then you're done now two sites that are so long to search is the net liffe I and Zeit both are free and they both offer a similar type of deployment experience and I do think this is easier than dealing with potential issues using github pages especially with multipage applications using reactive UJS now with back in or full stack free choices become very limited yep Heroku which allows you to have five web apps and these apps will become suspended after not being used for 30 minutes so when somebody visits your app there'll be a delay due to spin up time now there's firebase which is owned by Google and firebase offers free database and hosting service firebase will give you limited bandwidth into space but it should be good enough for most portfolio use cases then there's Amazon Web Services and they offer a free tier for one year and this is basically a VPS virtual private server and this requires some configuration to use now there may be other free services out there but I'm listing out the ones that are wellknown now with these services there is some configuration involved and it can be complicated at times so in this case when you're setting this up you're learning deployment at the same time now if these free surfaces do not offer enough for your situation you should consider getting a VPS one of the more popular providers this digital ocean and the reason being is that they offer templates to help set up your VPS now I do believe if you're gonna go into this direction you should take some time to see if you can learn how to do your own deployment it is a great skill set to add to your resume now in this video we covered a lot so let's do a recap here now I'm doing a different kind of recap for this video and the reason being is that you know we went over five sections and there was a lot of material I covered in this video but truth be told I could have spent hours on each section and the main goal here is to give you some sort of guidance and a path to follow if you're unsure what to do but even if you don't agree with what I suggest maybe it makes you uncomfortable signing up with a LinkedIn or going on to your Bowl in the word site and putting your material out there do something it's better than doing nothing and that's the most important message I can convey to you in this video now if you have any questions make sure to leave a
