all right we're we're good to go well I am not seeing oh there we go see participants that opened watch you a poll opened and then we will hello puts them in chat chat everyone everyone give it up for Kenny who is uh who's doing his third straight session here I need to know that krazeeeyez that's that's the reason why but like I'm glad to be here Andrew says yeah I know he keeps following me around Oh find out and why man so many participants from so many different places this is so cool how are the other streams are people coming from what we had Swift and CSS going on yeah so coming in from CSS and remember people from all over the world from the UK and all in the u.s. New York Brooklyn Queens Jamaica Oklahoma wow that's just pouring in from all over yeah no this is this is great um Minnesota school any miss Emma hello Minnesota's so everyone's saying I appreciate it so same thing as the other sessions if you have questions later on will answer questions in the Q&A panel if you want to take some time right now to take a breather get some coffee we'll wait for a few more participants to show up maybe we'll start in a minute or two yeah Kenny maybe if you want to show them where like which course the to get into the course that we'll be starting it yeah sure so I I went through the the course page itself already but if you need help getting there go to a catalog and here this will show you our entire site all our listings and for today we made this special course and it's called learning from home conference once you click into that you'll see the only course available there for today if your if we continue to see a lot of people interested in this we might continue to populate more and add more so definitely let us know I'm gonna click in so that that right now I've made 6% progress today you'll love to see it in a teacher 6 days out of the way but that's because I've reset my progress just to make sure that everything is a blank slate today that is not indicative of my preparation as a teacher just giving you a hard time getting I some questions have to be answered Alex and so I sorry I skipped the step and I jump straight it's a JavaScript I'm gonna go back on one web page and once you go to the syllabus tab you'll see the collection of all the courses that we have available for today and so I'm going to the third one here that's build websites introduction to JavaScript it's JavaScript right yes and then I'm gonna click on the first item here which is an interactive lesson called introduction to JavaScript no not Java please do not click introduction to Java to separate things and once you do that you should land on this page called introduction to javascript titled what is JavaScript alright it's 135 how about we get started with Mike did you want to say something before you go yeah just wanted to say hi everyone I'm going to kind of be in the background I'll be off video in a minute but I'll be helping to answer some Q&A especially if we get really busy but I will definitely yield to the experts you have with you Alex and we're going to take you through all the materials so just wanted to say hi and hope I can be of some service in the background and be immensely helpful like thanks oh one more thing this questions come up a lot so we are recording all of these sessions throughout the day and we'll post them all to YouTube they'll probably go out Tuesday we just need some time to like get everything together and but you'll we'll email you with the link so if you're if you're not you'll you'll get access to not only this one but other ones in case you're curious to check them out hi again thanks Mike hi again everyone just introduce ourselves in case you're you're joining in for the first time or maybe you're coming back from lunch I'm Kenny I'm a curriculum developer here at cook at me I've actually worked on the introduction to JavaScript course though hopefully we'll get to the material that I've actually written this is stuff that my colleagues have done a great job on and I'm really excited to have you here yeah and I'm I'm Alex I'm also a curriculum developer I've written a bunch of the kind of data science II curriculum so some Python stuff I'm currently working on our courses I ran the first session with Kenny on kind of creative coding using Java Script so I definitely have some JavaScript experience but I don't have a ton of experience in it and using it like a strict web development way like we're gonna be doing during this session so uh Kenny's definitely the goto uh for this one I think alex is sawing health cell phone a little bit short there but we've gotten some chance of p5 from DD in the chat I stab you back I just posted the link to the session again we haven't gotten started yet so you need to acclimate yourself go right for I like Mike I will also be trying to answer questions in the chat as as we're going but I will also try to talk to Kevin so thanks Alex most of this is going to be about you guys alright so we're gonna learn JavaScript today I can't guarantee how far it's gonna be part of making a website and so it's gonna be part of the journey that you will go through if you're very interested in web development and we're gonna get to learn a little bit more about the language today for one of the first questions there from Lila do you think it's no good learning lots of things at once CSS HTML Javascript it depends I think it varies from person to person if you have the aptitude to juggle multiple things at once then that's in your persona that's something that you used to for myself I like focusing on one thing at a time so I've often done like back when I was learning web development I've learned HTML first and then I've learned CSS if you can call it that and then I jumped into JavaScript Alex do you have any thoughts on that yeah I think I think it's interesting I think HTML and CSS are pretty different from many other programming languages because they're more of like a markup language more about like form rather than that function but I think one of the one of the interesting things if you're just coming from work Swift that workshop that we ran I think you'll see that there's a lot of similarities between that and JavaScript and so I do think that actually it's it can be an OK thing to be jumping between these different languages when you're a new learner because you can kind of see the similarities and differences and you see that really there isn't a ton of difference is at least on the beginner level between all of these languages like you could definitely take skills that you learn in this in this session and apply them to our Python course or swift course all these other courses so it's kind of fun to drop around between languages sorry I lost audio for a second but yeah we're gonna be jumping around and to answer Jonathan's question and maybe Ashe code leh to JavaScript is used for a lot of things and you'll probably primarily see it with web development so making websites interactive if we were to think of the website as like the human body we when you start off with JavaScript that sorry start off with HTML that provided the structure like the bones of the operation and then CSS is more like the clothing or the skin that you put on the appearance that it takes up and then JavaScript will be the muscles things that make it move make it pop make it interesting so we'll be talking about that today where someone no coding experience sorry I think you've come to the right place coke atom it has a lot of great beginner content and this is no exception what does javascript is one of my favorite course I'm biased because I've helped write it I would put plenty for it yeah I just answered that question to you and I said hi thon but there's a bad place to start one thing that I tell people is kind of like look at outcomes like if you can and sometimes that's hard but if you can figure out like what the heck is like Python even used for what is JavaScript even used for like if you can somehow get a sense of the outcomes of these programming languages then maybe you can pick one that like a lines a little bit your interest for example Python is typically a little bit more like data science you oriented and so that's why that's why it fit that's why I recommend it to people because it's like oh it's the stuff that I'm interested in is more like data oriented as opposed to design oriented so if you can find outcomes that's sometimes temples yeah that's a really good point Alex there's also uphold that ELISA open up thanks ELISA I was seeing responses slow in do you want to say a few words anything before we know ask you guys a lot of you guys are firsttimers some of you used it a few times before comfortable with the basics okay one expert in here here to mentor others thanks for the support and let's see where you see jobs reviews on a website mostly they're never seen it used anywhere until today okay that's great okay making a full application awesome so pull there but there's a lot of interesting responses will definitely cater to the beginner audience and we'll see how far we can get with this and again it's about you guys they ask your questions if you don't get to fun content well we also have a lot of different resources like our forum we have a discord channel so without further ado shall we Alex let's get started let's do it I'll be reading the narratives and will be progressing from there if you don't want to hear me listen and you want to read on your own feel free to meet me I won't be offended I probably won't even know that you did it yeah what is JavaScript last year millions of learners from our communities started with JavaScript why JavaScript is primarily known as language of most web most modern web browsers and it's earlier xscape a bit of that gave it a bit of a bad reputation however the language has continued to evolve and improve javascript is a powerful flexible and vast programming language now used for increasingly complex web development and yacht since javascript remains at the core of web development it's often the first language learned by selftaught coders eager to learn a bit we're excited for what you'll be able to create with the JavaScript fundamentals you gain here javascript powers the dynamic behavior on most websites including this one in this lesson you will learn introductory coding concepts including data types builtin objects essential knowledge for all aspiring developers make sure you take notes and pace yourself this foundation will set you up for understanding the more complex concepts you'll encounter later ok so that's just the introduction is there any questions that we can get to before we actually get started let's take a look any use for JavaScript outside of web and mobile so there are actually full scale applications if you have ever used slack this interactive chatroom app they they built it using something called electron that jas so while it's not a full web browser and it's not fully mobile but there are mobile applications it's its own full application and in its own right so you can definitely feel built full applications assets how does UX user experience play a role in HTML CSS and JavaScript there's a lot of different factors going on there right because in order to have a good user experience all these things must fit in together and provide a good flow for learners sorry for your users so click through your site and use it at the difference between JavaScript and PHP that's a that's a tricky one because they're both kind of website related right yeah I don't wanna model the waters too much PHP right now but that is a good point if we get to if we have enough time later I would love to look up some documentation some comparisons and why one might prefer another though honestly I don't have much experience with PGM my very basic understanding with it and again I don't have a ton of experience with with it either is that javascript is more clientside meaning like javascript is running in your web browser and PHP is more serverside so talking to like more of the backend stuff but again it's like a very high level description yeah so Alex so what knowledge must you have about HTML CSS and JavaScript to be able to be a web developer let's see I think that largely depends on maybe the job that you're looking for if you want to be a frontend developer that seems to be the major skill set that you might look into we just talked about PHP so that might be part of the toolkit you want to use as well depends on like whatever job it is that you're applying for and what is it that they're ultimately asking you to do also those sorry I was answering a another question I put you on the spot it's okay I think I answered it but we can you can definitely return to any of these questions later on as well and we're gonna ask can you explain a little bit the differences between web developers software developer and software engineer so I think again it goes back to the job description at hand web developer is very much specific to working on applications on the web so websites web pages maybe even know let's keep it so that for now and then a software developer or software engineer is a bit more broad you can work on applications that aren't limited by the web it could be maybe important on something on the server size on the backend they say so depends it's just like broader definitions of how you would categorize jobs yeah is it possible to find a job after completing one of the career paths did you just answer that I didn't maybe Mike yeah the career paths are one of the like feature or one of the products that cook at me that are kind of the longest the longest tracks that we have Mike I don't know if you uh if you want an answer but yes good question um it really it depends on so many factors of course but I would say you know if you're a totally beginner and you get through the career path you know and a good next step might be to check out a site like up work to get some to get some experience freelancing take on some projects you can get paid for them and then you know after you build up some some experience it might be easier to to get an interview and get a job from there thanks Mike where do you code JavaScript to make a website we probably won't get into that specifically today we'll just be learning JavaScript as a language how to use it how it's do stuff for us but you can include JavaScript into a website using something called a script tag so if you followed us back from the CSS webinar we had a style tag that we added a CSS to then we can also link out differently using a link tag to a stylesheet that was in a separate file all together and the same sort of idea applies for JavaScript where we can link to a script and that's gonna get stored in a different file and had that file interact with HTML and potentially CSS that's going on in the web page and website yeah we did that a little bit in the EP 555 session if you were if you were in that but very briefly that's how we were able to get the final solution right Alex that's right are we doing additional projects in the zoom session we're just writing through the course in case we need to leave early people trying to make it to the projects I have no guarantees though um it just depends on our pace how do we feel at the time what are we going through what see can I learn enough with Codecademy Pro to get a job coding I think this varies I think that you can definitely learn a lot but a lot of times employees are also looking for practical experience as well so like Mike mentioned with freelance experience I've also been told that working on different projects and finding different things that I can apply my skillset to to show employees employers excuse me that I have the skills I need for the job is also incredibly helpful almost yeah I think I've been having a portfolio or a github account or something is uh is really important to being able to show that you've that you've put these things in the past or that you can't produce things and I think that's something that we try to do later on in the end our paths and code Academy is like start working on projects outside of code academy on your own computer and so getting you comfortable with working in your own environment so then you could maybe you know create a portfolio or create a website or do something like that that you could show that you could show people when you're applying to jobs Jonathan the difference between Java and JavaScript two separate languages I I don't have much experience with Java but it's related to working on the backend if I'm right yeah I mean so I think that Java is used to write applications and not necessarily like web applications right we're really worried at least what we focus on in the JavaScript and all of our JavaScript courses are like making web apps or web applications ends you can make Java applications like you know you end up with a with a Java file that you can like sense your send your friend and they can double click on and it will open up on their desktop right and so it's like that sort of application rather than a website or something like that yeah Aman had a good comment about the difference between Java and JavaScript is the same as the difference between a car and carpet sort of idea I guess it is annoying if they're so similarly named well it's like they based name off right because John was so popular back then and so when they introduced JavaScript they wanted some connotation with this super popular language and I guess that connotation just never really laughs it's good question answer a few more before we get started with coding unless you guys just want me to keep answering questions to just totally fine Bobby yeah maybe we can ask any chat whether you want us to like get started on the lesson itself or keep answering questions because I feel like we can okay everyone everyone's alright so and the first thing let's Russ let's let's start with the second exercise which is the console ok the console is a panel that displays important information like errors for developers much of the work that the computer does with our code is invisible to us by default if we want to see things appear on our screen we can print or log to our console directly in JavaScript the console keyword refers to an object a collection of data and actions that we can use in our code keywords are words that are built into the JavaScript language so that the computer will recognize them and treats them special one action method that is built into the console object is the log method when we write console dot log and we'll be doing this a lot through our course by the way what we put inside the parentheses will get printed or log to the console it's going to be very useful for us to print values to the console so we can see the work or see the work that we're doing and here's a code example of console log 5 and that will print out 5 this example logs 5 to the console the semicolon denotes the end of line which statement although in JavaScript your code will usually run as intended without a semicolon recommend learning the habit of ending each statement with semi clones so you'll never leave one out in the few instances they are required you'll see later on that we use console.log to print different types of do different kinds of deal ok and let's take a pause for a second there any sort of questions anything that's lingering on people's minds before we get started on the checkpoints a little better I didn't move it to the side but I just made the antic the text a little bit better but that's that's gonna have pretty good yeah okay let's get started a lot of times I do like checking out how the code snippets look in our code itself and how it prints but in doing so it's probably gonna solve the first checkpoint for us so if you're following along chances are you're not 5 but we can try it out regardless run it and notice that 5 pops up so this code example that was right up here at the top was telling us the truth okay now that we did never lie to you you should just always check on your own just to gain that experience for yourself ok let's see another thing is you'll probably notice that I'm not clicking run instead on I'm on a Mac so I'm pressing a command return or command enter that just saves me a little bit of time and another disclaimer I haven't really bad habit of leaving out my semicolons Alex I want to put you on the spot because I think you do too yes so if you if you want to see that semicolon consistently remind me in the chat otherwise I will forget and we'll just continue coding I hope that's okay as well any one of the things that I thought might be good to show is that here on these lessons we have the console right there on the right side in code Academy but if somebody is programming off of code Academy what is the console how do you find it all that sort of stuff yeah it's a good good question um so we'll dive into that a little and the easiest way that will apply to most people I'm using a Chrome browser but if you right click and scroll down to this option called inspect click on it and then I'll open up a panel that'll display multiple things and two things I guess we can focus in on are the elements tab at this right here the very top and it has a whole lot of information this is the basic HTML structure of our site and it includes all the IDS classes attributes if we scroll up a little bit we'll see that we've included a script tag like I was mentioning before and then in the head like we were talking about in the CSS webinar you'll see a lot of relationship like shortcut icons and we'll also have a lot of style sheets here on the bottom the question at hand though about the console is right here and there's quite a few warnings here so I'm just going to clear it there's this option to clear the console right here which is the circle with strike through it and doing so will clear the console and we can do the same thing that we were doing in our text editor that's on our site using this console so even if you're not on coke at me let's say they're on Google home page Oh Google Google if you're allowed to do that what curse did it's crazy and I do the same thing where I try to inspect the page even though I don't have a web browser like we did for the code Academy site if I click on the console tab I'll clear my warnings again and I do console that log five just like we did before should see five popup and the same idea there or I just pressed enter so run the code so there's no Run button here but pressing enter will run yeah so similar idea I mean really but what code Academy is doing is just kind of like making that whole process of like having to go into this menu and lock up all this stuff right coke Adam II is nice because we have the output right there but you know we're not doing anything fancy you could be writing JavaScript in the in the real console as much as you want yeah great point offs so going on the next line long number representing the number of weeks you've been programmed this is gonna take some math it's like let's say for two years and make it easier for myself each year is 52 weeks so I should be constant logging like one on four I did the semicolon in for you guys five and 104 and I got a green checkmark which means we're good to go all right let's take a pause here yes and let's through some questions yeah there's a question about what's the difference between return and console dot log I might be getting a little bit too far for like functions and return and all that stuff but yeah so let's stop briefly return because a keyword that is used for functions and a function is like a collection of code that does a specific task that executes a whole bunch of code at the same time we have returned we won't see it print it to the screen but the computer is going to know about it because it's done that computation and it's telling us okay after we do all these steps after we do all these calculations give this value back so as developers we're not privy to that we can't see that directly we can save it somewhere we can store it we can print it out later but console.log is really helpful because it allows us to directly see the the output that becomes a bit more clear I know that's a little hand wavy but once you get to functions you'll see the the start distinction between the turn and console.log how about how about print we had a question about that they're both referring to the same things in this case for JavaScript truth be told while I was trying to prepare for this webinar I I've gotten used to writing Swift and their syntax for printing out values that the console is actually called print and so I've been writing this a lot it's just like a and getting an error so I think this is a good segue into what an error is by like printing and console logging for JavaScript is talking about the same things while I have you here and while we have this glaring red text at us yeah it's telling us something's wrong right like red text not good and if you ever need to debug something look at this spectrum it's actually really helpful I mentioned that trace back trace is just how to find where in your code that's giving you the error so in this case I'm seeing that it's coming from this file Holmes /cc user workspace introduction to JavaScript console slash fjs notice in the top left corner here you have apt is which is the file that we're working on and it's telling me that it's on line 4 so this thing about print one two three zero one eight reference print is not defined so in JavaScript we don't have a print statement and that's how I was able to remember that console.log is the way to print things in JavaScript not print nice clear that way and it's gone okay any other questions you think we should bring for the table Alex yeah so I think last one on console dot log if the user doesn't see console dot log then why do we why would we want to use it oh I love using console dialog for a very quick and simple debugging when we're writing a lot of code and it's not as simple as just two lines of JavaScript we're getting it's a hundreds and maybe thousands of lines of JavaScript if we need a just pinpoint one thing where we know something weird is happening then we can add a console log statement check that the values are correct we're not correct and fix it according pretty much cool all right yeah I think let's go on let's do it okay comments so programming is often highly collaborative in addition to our own code sorry in addition our own code can quickly become difficult to understand when we return to it sometimes only an hour later for reasons it's often useful to leave notes in our code for other developers or ourselves as we write JavaScript we can write comments in our code that the cut the computer will ignore as our program runs these comments exist just for human readers comments can explain what the code is doing leave instructions for developers using the code or add any use other useful annotations there are two types of code comments in JavaScript a single line comment will comment out a single line and is denoted by two forward slashes preceding so you'll see an example of that there where the first line prints five to the console is the comments itself and constant that a lot of f5 is our code you can also use a single line comment to comment out after a line of code so notice it looks a little weird with my screen full Emacs that way but zoom out a little bit you'll see console that log 5 semicolon and then the comment goes after the code which also is completely valid the other type of comment is a multiline comment a multiline comment will comment out multiple lines is denoted by the forward slash with an ass with the asterisk that follows it to begin the comment and a asterisk forest latch to end the comment and you'll see an example of that right below you can also use the syntax to comment something out in the middle of a line of code so we took a look at that console and that we have a multiline comment but it's used just in the middle of the console log statement where ignored is ignored is yeah followed by another comments that's that's still print this five let's take a second right through a bunch of text yeah people are notice people are noticing that commenting and JavaScript is the same as some other languages definitely a lot of languages use similar similar comment structures where let's see there are these forward slashes or in Python and are both of them are using hashtags for comments so you'll see similar similarities between different languages so that said comments are super useful I a lot of times just a debug code but yeah so though what the narrative said at the very beginning of it being highly collaborative and allowing other programmers who are working on the same project with you to know what your intentions are what their intentions are things that still need to be left things that need to be done later on comments are immensely useful so we'll start practicing with some of the code comments and I'll check in with you guys me afterwards but the first thing is that it asks us to practice adding some code comments and to the right we've been provided with the beginning of the book catch22 by Joseph Heller and asks us to on line one write a single line comment that says opening line so right here I would just add two forward slashes opening one actually before we do this this is a good opportunity to show you what our personal error messages for why you're not passing a checkpoint how would that look like so I'm not gonna had anything yet but I'm gonna run the code and everything prints out just fine there's no error like we saw before for the JavaScript interpreter but we do see a box that has some red text on the bottom tells us that asks us did you write a single line comment using two forward slashes so these two different error messages are completely separate where we're running tests on your code through these steps and these checkpoints just to make sure that you're writing your code right and then any errors that pop up in that right side panel is gonna be errors that are related to syntax most of the time that the JavaScript interpreter as it reads your code and like makes sense of it if it stumbles and there's something wrong they will let you know okay so I'm gonna do it properly this time around I'm gonna write it so two forward slashes opening line and I'm gonna front it and notice my red X is now a green checkmark I'm pretty good about myself of that I wanna can people as I'm as I'm typing out questions can people hear me typing in the in the chat I don't wanna I don't know whether I should be muting myself as I'm answering questions okay excellent I will keep myself unmuted so I can continue to talk to Kenny as I type anything great sweet and then for the second checkpoint or sometimes you'll hear referred to as steps and more used to it as checkpoint so food singalong comments are great for adding context to your code multiline comments are African best suited to prevent a block of code for running however both types of comments can be used for either purpose use a multiline comment so that the consonant log statements on lines 4 through 9 are commented out so I'll start if you ever need a hint you can click on those and it tells me the syntax can which forward slash with an asterisk that follows and immediately I see all my text is kind of grayed out okay but I know that I need to end it and chat real quick should it go online at the end of line 10 or at the start of line 11 does it matter either one I'm seeing 111 all right does it matter don't know both let's let's figure this out okay so I'm gonna I'm gonna just run it I put it at the I love it because that's the first response I saw and yeah all of it was commented out so let me see if if I remove that and I put it at the end of line 10 that also works as well so it just depends on preference on style what you have been working on previously how your comments have looked before keeping that consistency it's often things that may feel insane as you work through your project and things don't Paulina and here's a good question about comments I think I know the answer to but you probably know for sure is when something is commented out does it still run in the background or use resources as if it wasn't commented out is there a difference or resource wives between commenting out and not commenting out things it's interesting I I don't actually have too much insight into that as like as far as what the interpreter does with it I believe once it reads those two forward slashes or the slash asterisk it's kind of just ignores when it keeps running through until the end so it's probably adding a little bit of text adding a little bit of space to your project but as far as it affecting the interpreter and the run speed I don't think there's any substantial yeah I would guess that it doesn't do anything with it just because if there was like a syntax error in that in that comment and I was trying to run it like real code then you could have like bugs in a comment and then you know that might screw with the with the interpreter in some way so I would guess that it just reads it as text and doesn't do anything with it yeah yes thanks for that great question okay I'm also a really big fan of shortcuts my way or like hockey is so if you guys are on a Mac if instead of writing forward slash every single time you can to the right use come and /and noticed that my cursor as it is at the very end of it and it still commented out the code for me okay I believe on Windows it's like control forwardslash for those on Windows if you can fact check me on that I also use that as a means of like commenting out multiple things at a time sometimes instead of using multiple the multiline comment so I can highlight both lines and command /ice and same idea here so if you guys are into shortcuts really helpful things too man thanks for the clarity a confirmation guys on Windows appreciate it well I think that's really up for comments let's go on to the next list for folks if you're if you're not passing the like code Kadim e checkpoints for some reason there's a wait and you want to continue on the lesson with us there's a way to get the solution codes you want to demo that real quick Kenny sure I'm gonna go back yeah I saw some I don't want somebody had an error and I feel like rather than uh rather than trying to debug it right now it's might be easier to just like go onto the next lesson yes so also if you guys are ever stuck in your code like is completely broken no idea what's going on this reset workspace this repeating arrow will allow you to set the status of your code to our initial sort of default code that we've provided for you guys okay I think there is two ways I'll show you the hard way of how to do it where I'll run my code run my code again and then this panel this little text pops up with a light bulb icon and I can click view solution there's very encouraging text to say that no way I want to keep trying but if I've gotten to this point I might just want the solution to the entire exercise so keep in mind though when you get the solution it doesn't give the solution just for the single checkpoint it gives the solution for the entire exercise yeah that's just because of the way we store files so keep that in mind so I can do that and awesome it looks exactly like it did when we were doing it together I'm gonna reset this exercise again just to show you the easier way you're not stumped but you're short on time and you want to follow along with the live stream so here in the get help panel there is also a solution tab that you can click and the same light bulb will play appears and get solution code that's the same thing and so in this case just give me the solution so that we can move on and I'll run it again and it does the same thing yep data types now this is when we start getting into how like the underlying concepts of how JavaScript works and how it interacts with date information data types are the classifications we give to the different kinds of data that we use in program in JavaScript there are seven fundamental data types one number any number including numbers with decimals so that includes four eight one thousand five hundred sixteen or twenty three points for two strings which is any grouping of characters on your keyboard that can be letters numbers spaces symbols etc they can be surrounded by single quotes or double quotes that we prefer single quotes some people like to think of strings as fancy word for text as a lot sometimes they'll just contain sentences or like words that you want to include that you want to be printed out boolean this data type only has two possible values either true or false and keep this in mind they don't have quotes once we put quotes around them they become strengths so boolean czar true or false it's helpful to think of boolean as on or off switches or the answer is to a guess or no question or no this data type represents the intentional absence of a value and is represented by keyword not without quotes undefined this data type is denoted by the keyword undefined without quotes again it represents the absence of a value though it has a different use than we can talk about that a little after I finish I want to keep going just so that we've round out six symbol a new newer feature to the language as singles our unique identifiers useful and more complex coding no need to worry about these for now and then seven object objects are collections of related data the first six of those types are considered primitive data types they're the most basic data types in the language objects are more complex and you'll learn more about them as you progress through JavaScript at first some types might not seem like a lot but you'll soon observe the world opens up with the possibilities once you start leveraging each one as you learn more about objects you'll be able to create complex collections of data but before that let's get comfortable with strings and numbers so here in the example we have console.log and it's logging location of coke atom a headquarters 575 Broadway New York City and then we also console.log 40 a number in the example above we printed out a string so that whole collection of characters right here that is the strength that is wrapped between the single quotes our our string isn't just a single word includes both capital and lowercase letters spaces and punctuation careful on that guys on some of our tests we expect very exact strings so like missing a period or not catalyzing a letter that can cause you to go into an error and we'll see that later on okay after that printing of the string we have console.log 40 so then we print the number 40 and we didn't use quotes okay take a second now let me talk a little bit about null and undefined they are they do have their own distinct differences we can think of no as like it says the intentional absence of values so we don't want anything assigned there whereas undefined for from saying it's often like the default value that gets assigned first for it accepts another about okay and that becomes a talking point for variables for JavaScript one of the quirks that you'll find as you start developing is that once you declare a variable but you don't initialize it you'll instantiate it you don't provide a value straight off the bat it just has a value of undefined whereas no you need to assign that back you need to sign the absence of a value no to that so that gets cleared up a little bit more with variables and with a symbol honestly I've never used it before so this day I know I've seen the documentation write it it creates like a very unique string in my mind but it's often like very situational and all while this really is but I've not really run in so many situations where I've had to use a symbol before we got a couple of questions about null in other programming languages I know in Python it's none with the capital and okay what is like what has it been Swift I think it's nil nil is a common one null is used in other programming languages as well so you'll see this you'll see this concepts all over the place but you slightly slightly differently any other questions no at some discussion about like the single quote versus double quote difference for Strings why do you what do you prefer why do you prefer it what do you think the difference is oh if I'm gonna be totally honest I I just like using my shortcuts and so like if I'm typing things away it's perfectly valid and I think it's more acceptable to write the multiline comments here such but because I am lazy I can't just like highlight all of this and then I can change I was a lot for me everything well what I'm used to before is just highlighting everything and command or control of /and comments it out and then I can toggle back to work between yeah sorry sorry the question was about a string Oh is a single quotes versus double quotes and like why I think you've said that the this standard is what's like the recommended uses it single quotes or double quotes yeah great question so this goes back to style guides so we've been talking a little bit about remember that line of like should I add this on 10 should I add it on 11 and we both found out it doesn't really matter it's one of those same kind of questions where it's like if we're using single quotes throughout our entire project let's stick to single quotes if we have to use double quotes or we're using double quotes throughout let's stick to double quotes in our course we actually we're using a Google gogo Google's JavaScript style guide so I'm just gonna quickly look that up and you'll notice that the first link is just that Google JavaScript style guide other people prescribed to like Airbnb is a style guide some companies have their own style guides and it just lets you like write code faster because you don't have to think about you don't have to think should I add a single quote here or double quote it comes almost automatic and it's kind of expected for what you're writing for that project but if we we try to do this notice that it's it's the same thing both prints hi one case that I can think of for when single quotes and double quotes matters is if you have like an apostrophe like I'm hungry and we can tell off the bat that there's something weird about the syntax highlighting right the string is supposed to be yellow but I'm getting some sort of orange here and the reason for that is that our interpreters and is looking at this and thinking well I is just it's single single character string and the way to we get rid of this situation and continue to use our posture fee is using the backslash which is called the escape character so it's telling the interpreter to ignore the original attention of what the quote is just treat it like any other thing it's not special in this case but then once it gets to this ending um single quote that it's that's the that's the part that we industry so here I can type I'm hungry but before without this it goes back to this syntax error but I'm missing cow parentheses after which is exactly right but it tells me that line four is messed up somehow yeah that kind of comes up a lot in data science II things where if you're like loading in data from a different source and you can't really like you know cuz it because in this example maybe you would change that sentence to I am hungry or something but if you're ever working with data where things are like very fixed sometimes you need to know those little quirks of the language to to get around stuff so things like that are definitely kind of like the annoying part of programming where you're like oh my god why is this like not working it's because there's this there's a silly apostrophe randomly in my code that breaks everything I didn't know that was such a point or yeah it's like so you like loading its table and you know it will have like pre you'll like loading the spreadsheet basically and the columns of that spreadsheet will be already named for you sorry I was dealing with this recently where the columns were a date but the date was like four slash what's today four slash 10/20 and so that slash was really screwing things up and like I couldn't change the column names and it was just a pain in the butt I just called me out on my lack of semicolon so I'm adding those back in but also to go back to the some of the escape sequence and they used of like double quote single quotes here we have double quotes because I know I wanted use an apostrophe am I in my string so I can type I'm hungry and both of these will work I'm just gonna comments out my first one type I'm hungry and that works if I add the xscape sequence here it's gonna also be okay like it doesn't read it that said I hope we covered to get amount of questions I want to get started with the first checkpoint and let's take a look for what it's asked some of us to lock the string JavaScript to the console so if you guys are following at home you probably did this already I'm gonna type it out and it wants to use single boots log JavaScript I'm gonna purposely get this wrong I'm gonna add some coal I'm gonna purposely get this wrong just as demonstrate that our tests sometimes are a little bit strict and if we're asking for a very specific output it won't pass so I've lower cased JavaScript okay and I'm gonna write close this error message and I'm gonna run and in my output look it says JavaScript but the error message that we are providing for you guys is did you spell JavaScript correctly so because it's missing because it's not capitalized that s not capitalized it won't pass our tests and something to be aware of as you continue to use our class so I'm gonna fix that now when I capitalize JavaScript because that's what they intend it and run the code and checkpoint on line to log the number 2011 semicolon for y'all and 2011 shows up awesome I haven't been clicking on the hints but if you guys are coding along at home feel free to do that they are really helpful to give you just maybe a burst of inspiration or some sex reminder if you're stuck on something okay with line 3 print whoo I love to code hash tag code Academy and I want to point out here that code cad me does not have an additional hey it's not code Academy it's code Academy so I'll get tripped up but let's see this console log the number of people that uh that don't know that yeah and I'm gonna just copy and paste here make things easier for myself so I don't mess up because I work here and I shouldn't be getting that wrong the foolproof way of getting it right yeah who loves a code hashtag Academy and online for we're gonna print the numbers floating number twenty eight point four nine oh I did it again told you I was gonna do it I clicked print instead and it's that print is not defined sorry okay uh console.log code twenty someone in the chat said I thought it was code Academy and it worked for them so maybe maybe in the test we wrote an acceptance if we get it pass for code code academies and so many people do that yeah I think so I think this was like a coverage okay so I liked before it go but like for other things we're likely not gonna look for all these in this fillings and we're probably gonna meet the exact output so just the heads up for you guys might not happen every single time yeah so we we did it with a lesson exercise for I'm gonna take a look at the the check again Jonathan Krueger I'm just jumping around but I see you're getting an error if you look at that era specifically it tells you that something is happening on line four and it's not expecting that token so maybe you are missing a ending multiline comments I think that might be what's going on there Alex if something comes to mind anything that you saw that pops up I'm sure I'm not getting a ton of similar questions so I think we can move on I'm trying to keep up with the questions that are being answered in some QA cool let's see an honest attendee why do you have to put console down lock every time so yeah code sometimes is just extremely literal if we need to tell the computer to print stuff if we just put it on the screen it's not gonna know that's our intention we have to explicitly tell the computer I want to print out JavaScript first then I want to print out 2011 then I want to print out woohoo I love to code hash tag code Academy and then print out 20 dot 49 so all of these are sequential orders that we tell the computer to execute and then it shows up in our terminal that brings up a really good point about like the ordering of the console log statements and notice that when I switch the ordering of like the last lots of code to the very end it also prints to the very end and you guys might notice that I've been adding white spaces here just even though the instructions tell me to do on specific lines on line 2 or line 3 line four javascript is actually pretty lacs on white spaces so these sort of spaces between like strings and parentheses and tabs or or new lines and all of this will still do the exact same thing it's just again goes back to like style guides and how your project should look it should have some sort of consistency so that you understand and more importantly other people understand what to do when they're working with you on your code is there a way to reduce the redundancy of repeating console yeah but it's it's more advanced stuff I guess so let's say that we were up to the part where we can store functions in variables what I would do is something like let will console not locked without the parentheses and then I can do something like prints and let's just remove all these to come and notice that this works this is crazy and we've kind of shortened it out if I want it to just have it like print just key I can do that as well but it's again like normally you wouldn't see this normally it's not done according to how companies do it and how the people have styled it so something that I would recommend but to answer your question that is a potential wait I've never seen that before yeah it's like it's a little hacky yes it's cool nonetheless just like quirks that you can do with JavaScript yeah I will say that that will probably break some of our tests some of the like code Khadem e tests of trying to get the green checkmark if you do stuff like that man I'm in sorry for confusing you I will try not to do any sort of confusion anything's to confuse anyone but things happen it's alright let's keep going let's keep the momentum operators basic arithmetic often comes in handy when program so math stuff an operator is a character that performs a task in our code javascript has several builtin arithmetic operators that allow us to perform mathematical calculations on numbers this includes the following operators and their corresponding sentence so addition is plus subtraction is minus multiplies an asterisk star divided forward slash and remainder is the percent symbol sometimes you'll see remainder as modulo as well and they're both referring to the same thing we can work through it later on the first four work how you my guess so we'll see the use of addition subtraction multiplication and division and to check our math against all of it we can just copy and paste that code directly in and write seven four eight three no way back for them note that when we console.log the computer will evaluate the expression so all of this all these lines of code are called expressions inside the parentheses and print the result to the console if we want to print out the characters three plus four you would wrap them in quotes and then print them as a string so if we didn't want them to calculate and we want to print out three plus four exactly I would put quotes around them and notice that in our console it says three plus four so that's a way to get around that if you don't want them to you don't want the interpreter calculate the remaining operators sometimes called montolo returns a number that remains after the right hand number divides into the left hand number as many times as evenly can so 11 modulo 3 equals 2 because 3 fits into 11 3 times leaving 2 as the remainder so both we've referred to that as the remainder operator as well and this is really helpful for when we are trying to decide whether a number is even or odd so let's see if we do 2 to 3 modulo 2 what do you guys expect to happen to show up in the terminal before I press Enter okay ones are probably gonna catch up so I'll just run it and you guys are exactly right once I'm seeing a lot of ones from very specific people good job so that is exactly right because 3s are two fits into three once and it has a remainder of 1 so when we do stuff like this something modulo 2 often times we're trying to figure out if it's an even or odd number if it returns one then it's an odd number if it returns zero then it's an even up okay kind of talk through a good amount of that let's take a break again for questions and see what you guys have thought of us not a ton of questions one about the difference between remainder and divide okay if you show just another example and then other than that I think we might be able to move on well so let's change the number there from 5 modulo 2 and also 5 divided by 2 let's see what happens so in the first one 5 module 2 it's an odd number so we get 1 and then for the second one where we divide 5 by 2 we get 2 point 5 because 5 divided in half is to come off our scholarships yeah I'm answering that one right now pretty Alex okay that's it I'm gonna continue on with the instructions and seeing what we can do about using our para thematic operators in our code and clear this out in the console in a consonant log at 3.5 to your H this is the age will be when we start sending people to live on Mars so one of those and I want to add two point five to that and I get in three and a half years 31 and a half so that's one will be going to Mars or to that and on line two on a new line right another a console log inside the parentheses take the current year and subtract 1969 this is how many years it's been since the 1969 moon landing okay so let's type up another console log and two years 2020 one nine six not run it again 51 years since then continuing on create another console that log oh and I guess the shorter way to do this it's just like copy console log into your clipboard if you don't want to keep like semicolons okay gotcha guys yeah let's just do that and inside I want to divide 65 by 240 65 5 to 4 and some white spaces in there and just to show you against and we get zero point two seven awesome which is what our text test expected and one last console log multiply zero point two seven seven zero eight by 100 that's the percentage of the Sun that is made up of Helium assuming that we can stand on the Sun we'd also how much chips is that right does anyone know in chat what's the question that's the percentage so like if we could stand on the Sun we'd sound like Chipmunks because that's the percentage of the Sun that's made of hue just like would it be that we're breathing helium in after the fact this is totally not coding related maybe I should go back to penny I wonder I guess it's a question I can pose to each fad I wonder if it would be useful to show how this relates to webdev like do people want to jump to a project and show and like watch us connect it to a HTML file or do people want us to continue along with the lesson except that was a question that we just thought of like this is already we're following along but uh how does this relate to web development mmm connect I don't know if this is like massively throwing you off your game but uh but if you have a project in mind that would be an easy thing to show let's see this is gonna require us to do a little bit of navigation because I didn't fully expect this but hey let's roll with it let's see what this goes so let's go back to code CAD me and I'm pretty you can you could even go into the p5 project and we could just edit the code in there oh well I want to show it directly as how it relates to a site rather than like the dirty element canvas and I think that's a good point though but let's um go through the catalog and we'll sort by language here JavaScript okay notice that we have a bunch of skill paths a bunch of courses and the one that I want us to go to that it's gonna be directly related is the dog and we will we will post this link in the chat yeah and but it's pro only um ah let's do let's do um about this so let's just do a little bit of hacking we're starting to speak not really but well show you how the console at least works and how we can type in JavaScript to manipulate that a little bit so let's take a break well continue to use code Academy we're on air let's do that and I like using so this is for you guys who are into web development very common tool and edible using the the inspector element so let's go here and I've clicked on the arrow with the box that is used to select a specific element so let's focus on this and in here maybe click on it in our righthand panel like this and close out of this you'll see that it contains the text inside so this is more or less like basic HTML manipulation and what we can do is actually change words and titles and strings around so instead of calling it arithmetic operators I just want to let's say I want to name it how to add and subtract cross enter notice that this text will change it's not gonna persist though it's not gonna last because once i refresh this once my internet catches up to me refreshing living in all these scripts that are happening here but you don't say that once i refresh it goes away so I'm back to earth with an arithmetic operators it's gone and so that's kind of just the first step in realizing that these elements these elements in the HTML document can be manipulated so when we talk about these sort of manipulations oftentimes we're talking about something called the Dom or the document object model and all these elements live inside the document document object model and what we can do is typically it's a like including a script in here you can interact with the Dom in the console of itself so I'm gonna go back for a quick second just so that I can get like the name of it and I have something here I have the class of the h1 element so something that I can do with JavaScript is I can access the document itself and notice that when I type in document the whole thing highlights that's because it's referring to the entire document object model it's not and what I can do is search for this and I can get element by class name and what I had before and this will kind of look very similar to console that log right we're calling regret we're getting an object we're getting a method behind it so console for being the object log being the method in this case document being the object and get elements by class name being the method only make this a little bigger for you guys getting kind of lost not gonna lie umm we'll return back but I just wanna for those who want to satiate their thirst like how what development works and how we can interact itself let's do a sneak peek and so once I do this and I add an argument we'll see that we can select this very htmlcollection this part of our document and I can assign it to a variable so let's title and title is going to be that collection we'll get further along into the collection types later on like arrays and dictionaries sorry raising objects but since it is a collection I just need the first element in it and I can do title 0 and I can do another thing called inner text so notice that this auto populates as arithmetic operators and what I can also do is we assign that value using javascript to be something different and notice that even though I didn't have to interact with that element in the HTML document I was able to do that directly using javascript so great so we're using javascript to like basically talk directly to the HTML so we're using javascript to grab certain parts of the HTML and then change it and kind of the point is that like all the math that we were doing Kenny can you I don't know of what string casting necessarily looks like but can you set that that title to the results of 1+1 yeah let's do it so JavaScript I think is a bit lenient in this and which it allow it to happen another language is very strict or it's like typed meaning that if the value was already assigned as a string then we're gonna keep it as a string and throw an error but in this case Java scripts like oh we can do whatever we want we can coerce and change types really merely so in this case we set the title of inner text to 1 plus 1 which is 2 and you see that right so I want right so kind of and again like as you're watching this don't worry too much about having to do any of this we're just having them trying to demonstrate how Java Script is connecting to websites but you can imagine right whenever you're buying something online and it's showing like okay you super order total and this is your tax and let me like add those two things together to show you the the total amount that you're paying for like that addition is happening over in JavaScript and then it's gonna send that result over to the HTML just like Annie just did you know set the title of this thing equal to one plus one and it kicks out too yeah great point Alex yeah it's it's all connected and once you get even more advanced so if on your computer screen I'm gonna exit out of this but in the top right hand corner notice that I have my picture my icon there and that's specific to who I am it's not gonna show up for you guys it's gonna show up a little differently in which case it would be because your profile picture is saved to some backend and they're taking that value and subbing it in for every differently for every single user once they visit our site there's a lot of different applications with JavaScript so we're just pointing out a few things that might stand out to you some things that might not even be thinking about that javascript could be responsible for yeah I mean it's definitely a tricky thing when trying to teach this because it's like you know we're doing addition you know it's like how can this possibly you ever ever be like related to making crazy websites and stuff but like understanding for me you kind of have to have faith that the skills that you're learning here eventually will be like translating into making a cool cool project because this is at least what I felt when I started to learn programming of like how is any of this connected to anything irrelevant but then the further that you get into it you start to see like okay this skill that I just learned I can immediately see like how this will apply to a website later on so it especially at the start you just kind of have to happy bit of faith that it is relevant yeah it's one of those things like he has to learn how to walk before you can run right so starting off we're learning how to walk first and later on you'll be going on beyond what we just did with that Dom manipulation and running full force making web applications but it does take time it does take effort and tenacity and willpower yeah and like we certainly do not expect people who have never coded before to like be able to open the console and grab this element from the DOM and change it like right on the spot right that's why we start with these kind of easier like isolated examples and then eventually you can grow up to a B to be a Kenny and just open the open the console on stream and uh start changing the Dom so alive all right cool it sorry Kenny I feel like I totally disagree derailed us but I think no no I think that was a really good helpful like insight into maybe the end product and said because like you mentioned before when I started off doing all this stuff and I was learning to Academy I didn't fully understand why I was doing all this stuff and I think had someone like showing me example of the potential applications that we can use it for it could give you like a good insight into what an end goal might be and something that's a you want to strive for its might for sending all those helpful links by the way see ya or can fizzy and check what we do now Kenny do we want to keep going in the lesson do we want to like twelve minutes less I want to go through some of the questions I think we lost a good amount of people so if there's like anything I can look into before maybe people seemed excited for the lesson in the chat so check it again but yeah what you came here from concatenation to show us some cool stuff let's move on okay string concatenation operators aren't just used for numbers when a plus operator is used on two strings it appends the right string to the left so here the code example is below so we can contaminate high and yah hyah and then whoa whoo and also quote I love to blank code notice here left a little special space the interpreter is not going to do that for us so we have to again be really explicit what we want to see printed out okay this process of appending one string to another is called concatenation notice in the third example we had to make sure to include a space at the end of the first string the computer will join the strings exactly so we need to make sure that the included space we want is fine to make sure to include the space we want it between the two strings and here's a few examples of that explicit string being provided where we have one with a front space one with a back space one with no space and one with a middle space and just like regular math we can combine or chain our operators or operations to get a final results so notice here we have one two three four five separate strings and we're concatenating them all into one okay prints one two three four I'll show you guys this is very much slightly going to be our last exercise so let's maybe another quick pause let's see our well for this session sorry guys not too mean like this is the ultimate end but like we're closing in on our okay let's see what type okay not super related but I'm noticing at the the last question asked by anonymous are you able to specify what a type what type of variable is and in JavaScript we cannot specify a time it's a very loosely typed language I can assign variables to a string and just so we can see that it's actually working string and then once I've reassigned if I want to be three I tried printing out again the council doesn't give me any sort of error like we might see for Swift semicolons chase I'm working on it I'm working on it it's a bad habit okay notice that yeah like I said the interpreter treats it just fine like oh you declared a variable you want to assign a new value to that variable hey okay no problem but for something like Swift maybe you guys have come to this webinar from that webinar well remember that typing is really important when you declare a variable to have a very specific value like a string type or a number type or a double type that must be the same type of value applied throughout so that's one of those quirks about javascript that either you come to love where you come to hate depends on what context you've used it on yes okay some confused why is there so much connection between HTML and JavaScript mmm I guess I want to answer that question from Joseph before really like doing what we had intended for the instructions and like I was saying before HTML provides the structure and if you guys were in our CSS webinar our session you were able to see that we were able to take CSH tml and style and make it look nice make it look pretty make it look presentable otherwise you might not be attracting the users that you need to go to your site so to provide funding or to click through stuff to buy stuff people are interested in super plain things for that without the functionality of JavaScript some people might not actually be interested in your site a lot of things that JavaScript allows you to do and making it interactive let's say we're creating some sort of shopping site when you click on an item and you add it to the cart HTML and CSS it's not speaking care of that that logic is being handled by the JavaScript that you write so you'll probably notice that from HTML and CSS we're being very declarative we're saying do this do that and not doing much including like any sort of logic in there once we move further with JavaScript you can add conditionals we can it's things to account for many different situations one of them being like a shopping cart like I mentioned and adding that to the car doing the check it out all of that stuff requires JavaScript yeah detecting events right when you click on something and something happens that's usually uh that's usually JavaScript and doing all that sort of stuff okay Kenny a good question I saw a little bit ago was we've used the term like oh the interpreter is doing this the interpreter is doing that what does what does that actually mean oh it's uh thanks for calling me out it's basically like your web browser and how it reads your code and spits out information so the engine sometimes you'll also hear about as an engine the interpreter the engine that is reading the JavaScript is a little different from browser to browser so the implementation for Chrome is different from Mozilla so the name for it I think are different I believe chrome uses something called the v8 engine and then something called SpiderMonkey so if we go to this other site that love using can I use which tells me like what exactly is supported in different browsers that's the reason for it the implementation of how this interpreter this this engine this piece of software that is being used to read the JavaScript code is implemented differently across different problems so you'll notice that for Internet Explorer it's partially supported like if I want to use the the keyword let in declaring a barrier but it supported across the board for our edge Firefox and Safari but once we go to like mini opera if a user was trying to access my site and I had used the keyword let in that project in that website they would not be able to see that variable and they would get some sort of error it's interesting I wonder so this is a question for me as somebody who is not super into web development like why did use different interpreters what's the what's the benefit like why can't we all just use the same one too yeah that's good no idea I think it's also about like a market share kind of thing like if your browser is able to read or detect run JavaScript faster slower that could be some sort of differentiating factor so I think it goes more to like business there but yeah if we have one standard and just draw from it which is what Akuma script is this is going a little far into the weeds but all the standards are coming from there and the implementations there differently by done differently through browsers cool all right I think we only got four minutes left yes Oh Kenny if you want to start wrapping up all right I think that's about it if you guys have any additional questions in the chat I don't love to just like provide resources at this point so I know we got up to exercise six out of ten or so exercise lesson but there are general questions or go to the forums that you guys can go to a lot of resources even though I haven't shown it can be done through a quick simple search online so one of my favorites is Ocilla development network and sometimes I'll just look up things that are related to JavaScript so if I forget how to JavaScript declare array I can search setup and then I'm like directly to the website that can be additional supplement material for you guys as you work throughout courses a lot of these questions maybe even had something about string concatenation it's one of our more popular courses so there's a good chance that someone asks a question about it already but if you also want to add to those questions and see what other people have to think about it that's also a fantastic resource I know Mike was posting a chat started posting a link in our chat about discord so there's a lot of different resources out there for you guys if you're just worried about getting started with a language I know Alex I mentioned Python I talked about JavaScript I think one of the more important parts is just getting started yourself acclimated into this environment I'm posting the link to the our scholarship page so I mean I was surprised in our first session how a lot of people didn't seem to know about the scholarship that was going on but if you have a dot edu or dot k12 email address then you can get a couple of months of pro for free by filling out this scholarship form if you're a student and don't have those email addresses dot edu or a dot k12 email address there is a forum in the frequently asked questions section and we should be able to help you out anyways the scholarship is we launched it probably a month ago at this point and basically we are giving away Pro for students and teachers until the end of the occurrence we were so we're giving it for 90 days so if you jump in there now you should get a good maybe 60 days worth of pro so yeah that's a good resource if if you want to get some free grow I'd say that I'll post it again and look in the chat here but for those who are asking if we're done yeah we are but there is a wrapup session back with ELISA and Mike and so you guys go to that webinar just like say thanks really for joining us it's been really fun
