all right all right let me um let's hit the button all right yeah uh youtube says that we're live now so uh welcome sunny to another episode of code academy live and we like to have these conversations here where we are you know asking you some questions learning about some of the products and some of the offerings that code academy does some of the innovations that we do every week so here you are you want to introduce yourself tell me a little bit of what you do at code academy your background cool yeah so hey everybody my name is sunny i'm a senior curriculum developer at codecammy and i'm based in brooklyn new york i currently manage the curriculum free team and you might know me because i wrote a lot of the learn c plus learn swift learn sql courses and also help shaped our data science path and computer science path um i'm mostly here now echocam i've been here about four little over four years i'm mostly here now to empower people on my team on the crypto free team and also be a hype man for for things like cocamy docks which which is what i'm here today to promote this our newest product feature fun facts about me um i was born in shanghai china moved a bunch when i was a kid you know from germany france eugene oregon kent ohio and now in new york city my first how i got it coding i started cs in in college um and then did an internship at this tech startup called jack threads and kind of that was like a very eyeopening experience and have been uh doing tech related stuff ever since um during my free time i like to play dota i like to read product startup books and i like to tinker and build uh things outside work wow that's pretty cool so it sounds like you're pretty involved not only with teaching code but also writing code like doing things with code in general um is that kind of like how code docs sort of came to be like you were just looking at resources looking around and said you know i wish there was a better way yeah i mean i think the the idea of code cabinet docs has been floating around the company actually for a few years um and it's really similar to what you're saying just like you know me building stuff and kind of and not just me a few other people on the team too just you know we're kind of tired of seeing very inconsistent coding documentation um on the web you know some languages like swift's or reacts are very extremely solid their official documentation whereas other ones like you know javas or sequels or c plus felt you know a little bit outdated um and not interactive enough or not beginner friendly enough um so we kind of started building this doing an internal company hackathon and the project then was actually called codepedia inspired by wikipedia um and that kind of grew into that we built the prototype the team loved it and then we launched mvp i guess v1 and then more recently v2 last month and v2 was more focused on uh you know contribution leaderboard uh highlighting the authors for each entry and so on um that's right yeah i guess for the for the viewers who who don't really know what code county docs is um so kogami docs is basically an open contribution coding documentation for all popular programming languages and frameworks um it's our we like to say that it's our our dream was like it's built by the community and it's maintained by codecademy um right now we have about 718 entries live across 18 different topics so javascript and python and 89 of those entries are actually created by devs and learners around the world which is pretty exciting so i'm going to share some links in the chat for people to check out but these three entries oh wait what there's 265 character limit so wait a second let me do this one by one you hit the limit in the chat yeah sounds like it um so so the very first one is the functional programming entry created by amelie from amsterdam this one so the three i'm going to share are all created this week okay here's another one it's a java hash map one and it's created by anusha from india and also factory pattern um a general entry created by bernard from england i think that those three showcases just like the potential of cocamy ducks awesome you know um i'm actually curious you were talking about codex and how it came to be like the v1 and the mvp and stuff um what was some of the can you speak a little bit about the guiding principles of this like i know that you said that the you know documentation online for certain languages is pretty inconsistent it kind of was a little frustrating so how do you tackle a problem like this like how do you go about okay the idea is we want better documentation and then actually for what we have today this really cool website is really well you know the design people can contribute all around the world how how does that process go from like nothing to what we have today yeah um so how to start from zero to one um i mean first i think that even during the hackathon we're trying to pinpoint an area um in the in the coding journey where every developer like we're essentially before we even have the idea you know we're brainstorming with different things to tackle um we want to be part of we want to build something that's part of the conversation um for every single developer around around the world you know how stack overflow is for you know answering questions there's um you know vs code is for for the for the code editor and we thought coding documentation is very much an often overlooked market um and we you know um w3 schools most of the web docs they've been around for 15 years they have deep roots in the seo um but something that people don't don't really know about is that w3school is actually the 136th most most visited sites in the world right so we knew there was a market there um so so is this one is this a process where you're kind of like you you think like a user like where if i were to use this myself yeah this is the things i would like to see oh absolutely this is definitely something that we're building for ourselves uh and for us and after we pinpoint it okay let's let's give coding documentation a shot we just literally just brainstormed all the different ways that we think coding coding documentation could be improved um and in our dream world you know we're talking about very high quality content very beginnerfriendly content with breadth and scope most of the coding documentation that we see only focus on one two or three or sometimes less than five languages frameworks um and we're trying to build something that's a little bit more scalable one thing we also really like on the team is interactivity um so you know when you when you find what a function what a method or function does you know what the parameters are you also want to see different examples different example code blocks and also we include this which we're trying to include at the very very end of every single entry something called a code byte and it's basically you can click um press play and then you'll actually see the output of the of the example code um that's pretty cool a lot of people are very visual right like you you explain the code but they will look at it like well i just want to see it like in action i want to see the code actually so that's really cool feature i mean exactly that sounds like one of those features that kind of like really make the whole experience a new take it takes it to a new level yeah and then i would say one last thing um it's searchability um even within the the the product itself um this is inspire inspired by um the ipod and also airbnb this sort of a three threeclick rule um so hopefully down the road um we'll get to a point for kokami docs where you know within three clicks you can find exactly the answer to your question um that's like a dream the dream the dream world nice so since this is a resource i know that we have a code academy other things like cheat sheets for example right when people are going through our coursework um what would you say is kind of like the prime time for a new learner to start exploring these kind of things because sometimes documentation can be very daunting and if you don't know a lot of coding uh your background is a little shaky you go to the augmentation pages and they're really thick a lot of text a lot of you know verbiage that you understand so it's it's co it's code academy docs like the way that it's getting built on the way that it's it you know it's adding new pages every day it said would you say there's something that people should jump on like at the beginning of the cutting journey should you first get a bit of background like what's kind of like the optimal path for someone that comes to code academy to start exploring this yeah i'll say cooking docs that the target audience is the day seven learner or the date the week two learner to advanced learners so the minute that you start trying to build something on your own and you're like oh i forgot what this um what for loop does for in python uh in c plus plus what a list is in python that's when you can look things up and instead of jumping out of the ecosystem and you know go find other coding documentation we thought why not just build it uh ourselves yeah no i i know that um a lot of learners sometimes they will have this kind of like feeling of like i'm not good enough like i don't know enough to ask this writer questions and stuff right so sometimes people it's almost like it's stopping them from going to the place like hey there's this amazing documentation place but they just hear the word documentation and think there's no way uh that's probably not for me right like but it sounds like the way information is being you know presented and the way everything's organized is very beginner friendly and it's it's almost like a tool that you want to learn alongside to use alongside your own coding journey like the better you get a documentation the better you get right like you're getting better as a developer you get has a documentation yeah totally uh and this is probably the reasons why even in colleges uh boot camps and also even on codecammy we teach people how to use google to search for um answers to your coding questions all the time right um yeah so there there's a pros and cons to this i'll say i'll say this is probably why seo is such a big um big player for for for for for things like hook emmy docs um just because all the other players out there have already have a strong roots in the seo business um over the last 15 years um right and that's that's that's a hard thing to beat right now for good gaming okay so let's say that um let we've been talking a lot about like the front facing or like the the first touch experience that you get with code academy docs uh let's say that we have a user like you said week two week three uh they need some help in kodakami docs they find help and they go oh you know what this is really cool i would like to contribute myself as well um how how was the thought process behind the way that code academy was building code docs and color gaming docs to to enable the community and everybody else to also contribute to these pages yeah we try to do a couple of things and one thing we try to make the process of adding entry and editing entry as seen as easy and seamless as possible so one thing we actually add in the v2 uh product feature is building and edit adding an edit button for on on top of every single um codecammydocs entries so on the top right of every single entry they see every page you see you should see and edit this page on github so if you just click that um it'll take you directly there so this helps people who are new to github people who are a little bit overwhelmed by open source um you know version control systems to get over that little hump um and one thing we actually did when we first brainstorming you know what do we do we do build cooking docs internally like inhouse or do we do it over github i was pretty bullish on using github because you know i think cocamy docs is actually a very good like almost the perfect um first open source project that you can take on it helps you you know get used to um you know how to make a br and things like that um how to merge your pr get you know just get just do the get some reps in wow yeah that's that's a really good point i know that a lot of learners you know you build things for yourself that we always say hey you need to build things with people and version control git and github they get really really scary really fast uh if you've never used them before so i'm assuming that the idea is people you know if they like what they see and they want to contribute like is there is there a world in which people contribute to code docs more than they use code academy docs like they basically say well i'm just looking to contribute an open source like i don't really like look at the pages i just like building the pages because i'm assuming that it's kind of like the same wikipedia right like some people they just write articles they're not really consumers they're just contributors right yeah um i mean that would be that would be awesome um but right now we have we have a team of internal maintainers like i think christie and brandon probably in the chat right now they're they're they helped me with maintaining kokami docks but i'll say for most these sort of uh open contribution sites what happens is like the sort of 90 10 or i forgot the numbers like 90 10 22 rule or whatever where only the two percent really contribute and most of them are just the users um but we are trying to build out a community of contributors who um we're just you know i think the dream world for this is that down the road in 10 years in five years um there are tens of thousands of developers worldwide who can you know make this better and better every day yeah because um i was asking because uh i would imagine that one concern most people have is okay i want to use code academy dogs but what's the quality of it if anyone can contribute to this is what i'm consuming true not true it's a best practice right there's a lot of concern about form and you know if you're teaching me this way of a for loop is that the only way is that the best way i want to be a good coder right so uh maybe you can explain a little bit what's the process like behind the scenes to ensure that code academy docs you know has the good a good level of quality and consistency and it doesn't you know i'm assuming that not every contribution not everyone can just dump whatever they want in kodakanidox it goes live right totally um yeah quality is something that we have a really we try to have a really solid grasp on for for for every single entry that comes in um so right now um we have a style guide in the in the repo where everybody can check out and sort of understand how we look at things how we view things how we review things and our maintainers such as christine and brandon and steven and kyra and a bunch of others what we do is we usually try to do two rounds of reviews for each single entry for every single entry um this is the first time we ever tackle something like utc user generated content so this is all like you know sort of new area for us but um i think two rounds of reviews have been doing it pretty well for us but we look at everything from formatting from technical accuracy from plagiarism um to typos grammar pedagogy and things like that that's pretty cool yeah um okay we've talked about how it came to be how it's running how you go through the review process what would you say kind of like to wrap it all into one big concept if you are a user at code academy and you hear about this like in this video somewhere else you might be thinking well why should i contribute to this like what is it in it for me right like um why should anyone care about contributing to open source projects or to contribute to documentation in general right uh do you have do you have like a thought about like if somebody asks you well why should i care like why should i take my time in contributing to this yeah i mean first of all i think it's just fun i think that's that's you know that's why open source uh community is such a such a big community is because when you're collectively building something together um it's it's just it's just a fun it's at least for me um you know to see something grow from nothing to even now it's only been a few months i already have over 700 entries it's something like almost um yeah very very very rewarding um and also you're building something that a lot of people see for example i think today i just pulled the stats um you know after the initial hump i guess the launch hump we're looking at looking at about 4k to 6k weekly active users for cogami docs consistently over the past eight weeks so every single entry that you build there are going to be a lot of eyeballs on our current most highest traffic topics are javascript c plus html and java so if you're writing those entries you know you we're talking about a lot of people checking out your your work um the total cumulative distinct users as of this morning is 95 000 and i know a lot of people say that it's kind of cumulative users total users kind of a benedi vanity metric uh and not necessarily what we should pay attention to um when when you know when we try to inform our product strategy but we are about to break 100 000 distinct users this week or next week so this is a huge heartearned win for the team uh leading indicator that something's resonated resonating here with people um so i'll say that when you're part of something you know that's growing and sort of uh um you know something that started from scratch a few months ago i think it's just very very very fun very very rewarding and also number two i i think the biggest reason why i think some people should should help out with this uh on the learner's side is that there hasn't really been a single source of truth um for for coding documentation right like you know some some current document sites focus on languages some focus on um you know uh you know data science machine learning you know python packages some focus on you know the official documentation only focus on one thing or two things so here we have opportunity to build something that's very that has breadth and depth um and because it's open it's open contribution it's it's actually easier for us to maintain and to keep it updated right because because frameworks you know things get um new people ship new new new versions all the time but to have this sort of single source of truth um yeah i think it's it's something that um people should um aspire to for and help out especially and also a third reason actually i just thought of this on the spot but i think when you're writing something it's probably the when you're teaching something it's probably the best way to learn something that's what people always say um so when you're writing when you're learning a new new new topic or a new concept and you go to code gaming docs and realize oh this is missing i think the best way to do is try to write it in a very concise you know clear clarity but not losing the um the brevity um and try to teach it to people right i think that will help you sort of um really uh submit your your learnings totally agree yeah so to summarize basically is because it feels good to be part of a team bragging rights you go to people like look at this i wrote this article so bragging feels good to be at in a team bragging rights number three it helps you learn as well like by trying to teach us to somebody you find your own gaps in your knowledge like oh i don't know how to explain this like maybe intuitively you understand how it works but how do you explain it right like it makes you better too yeah that's it's kind of like the trinity yeah of uh learning to code i guess it's like you're part of you know you're collaborating you get to showcase your work and you also get to increase the depth of your own knowledge at the same time so that's pretty cool yeah um well do you have any parting thoughts we've been talking here for like 20 minutes 20 some minutes uh do you have any maybe you can give us a sneak peek of some features coming up to go to academy docs in the future or you can tell us a little bit of what the future holds for this project yeah i don't think i can share too much about what we're going to build in quarter one but um next week next friday um we have a session another session on this but me i'll be joined by two people on my team christine and brandon who who have been helping me with cooking me doc the last few months um and we're gonna review a couple of one or two or three who knows poll requests live and teach you how and sort of show you how we look at um new entries on code chemi docs but i think that'll be super fun so i highly recommend people to to join and also um there's so many ways to contribute to people give me docs and that's something i've you know if you're watching this right now um not only you know should you check out cookie cocaine docs find find problems with it edit entries ad entries but you can also help promote on your social media you can also um give us product feedback those highly um yeah something we'd really look forward to yeah and i'm also here to answer any other questions in the chat too uh awesome yeah let's check out the q a uh yeah so this is the part of the live stream where we take some questions from the audience anyone watching right now live if you have questions for sunny about you know anything uh kodakami docs related documentation house bill how you contribute any other questions that you may have now it's time to drop those questions in the chat uh i know that we had a couple already one of them i feel like you already answered which is um you know what's the incentive to freely write the good documentation from code academy i like the nuance of what's the incentive to write good documentations in code academy so we're talking about what's incented to just contribute but like what's the incentive for someone to contribute good content right like not just brevity like oh this took me like 20 minutes submit the pr good to go like what are your thoughts on like people actually contributing quality work yeah i mean i think everybody should be have a pretty high bar for this especially in the in the very beginning whatever bar that you set will be the bar that people feature the first the first hundred i always tell people like the first 100 docs entries will set the bar for the next 10 000. um so that's something to think about especially if you're early adopter you're early user of kogami docs try to make sure you know the stuff early contributor i mean try to make sure this stuff is solid read through the documentation and also just remember that you know when you're writing something like cookie docs hundreds of thousands people will use it you know in the next year or two right or possibly even millions so it does have a sort of a splash effect um if you're writing good compared to you i mean definitely don't um you know add in inaccurate information that's like number one thing to expect for um but the good part i'm going to say though for cocaine docs is that it's always evolving similar to wikipedia anybody can add an end entry same thing with kokami docs right it's right even if you do you know make an error and the maintainers did not catch it another user can you know we see this across in the last few weeks you know people picking up bugs and reporting not only reporting them but also fixing themselves yeah that's a good point i think it's something that a lot of people complain about or uh will think that like the first thought on an open source project is oh you know there's no quality control and that's not true like you can see open source projects all across the internet where all kinds of people from all over the world contributing and and it does work because someone's mistake gets picked up by somebody else right or uh someone's error or whatever like it's it's just kind of like the blob the mass right it's keeping it together right so and it's also an incentive for inviting new friends to go to academy docs because the more eyes on the docs the better they get right the more contributors the more people that contribute to it and use it the better it gets so it's a win for everyone uh let's see another question um somebody was wondering if code academy docs will ever be paywalled in any way yeah i think for killian yeah i think it's going to be free forever um that's just how we we set the ground rule for this and and i think i really try to make sense you know really try to document that you know this should be a free resource from the very getgo um it's just how the market is for for coding documentation every platform most platform every single actually i can't even think of one coding documentation that's not free um think of coming in automation as the sort of the the reference guy the reference menu for building your ikea ikea furnitures or legos right um this stuff uh it yeah it's it's gotta be great um yeah and another way how we think about it from the business perspective is um when we're trying to beat big players right now like w3 schools and mozilla web docs they're they're almost like the craigslist of of um of coding documentation right um and you know hundreds of people companies have tried to take down craigslist over the last decade nobody was able to do so um and fundamentally for that sort of marketplace um it's you know buyers go where sellers are sellers go where things are being sold and same thing and we look when we try to frame that with cocamy docs too is that um people are looking for free content you know this is how people are finding coding documentation is through google people are going to places where it's easily accessible it's beginner friendly and where they can't find answers if you have a paywall it's just it just doesn't make sense from the business perspective if you're looking at other competitors and it doesn't make sense for contributors either right like um like you were saying one of the benefits of contributing to code docs is is that lots of people are going to see your content you can flex like you can contribute article after article and then go put it in your restaurant put in your personal website or something so like this is what i did around you github if it's a paywall now people can't see it like you give them you're giving the links to protect the pages right so it also decentralizes people you know the average person from coming and contributing right it hurts the that feeding as well of content so it makes a lot of sense what you're saying uh let's see here at 130 huh you're saying i was just going to say our philosophy here too is also just give more to to gain more um so we're building an awesome free resource for everybody to use and hoping that you know if you do need if you do uh um blocks you create but if you do want to dive a little bit deeper you can go check out the cooking course awesome all right so since we're at the time i'm going to go through one more question and then we're calling it a day for today let's see there's a question here that said will code academy dogs add more topics in the near future i think that's an easy question oh yeah absolutely um so check out so this is actually something that you all can do if you're watching right now go check out github issues um in the github repo so i'm going to send out the github repo right now in the chat um but there are tons of topics that we still don't have right now such as r such as um django uh flask all and any machine learning uh packages and libraries we we actually don't have um so there so there are almost endless things that um you know um that we're looking for really uh so take a look at cocaine dots at the existing entries existing topics see what's missing uh even within the topics itself there's still tons of concepts functions methods libraries that that are still needs to be uh filled in so so take a look at those first but github issues is a perfect place to re to to request for a new um concept or topic but also you know if you're if you want those doers go in and just make the edits yourself and make those uh add it into yourself yeah i mean it sounds like uh kodakami dogs is not limited to languages themselves like some people might think of this as oh that's for javascript or for python but like you said libraries and other tools that are like coding related like that it it's a home for everything it's a onestop for everything right like if you're thinking of if you really like as obscure library that you use on javascript a lot like they said there's room for that too right totally all right that's awesome well i think uh yeah thank you for stopping by today and like you said we have a demo next week you're going to be here with a couple contributors i've been building uh code academy docs for a few months now and you're going to be doing a demo on how like you're going to be reviewing some pr's live you're going to be explaining how to contribute to the camera docs yeah yeah just to show you show everybody the whole process let us know too um feel free to shoot me a peer message if there's specific things that you want to see um at the next week's session and hopefully we can we can add that into the programming all right great well thank you for stopping by and i guess i will see you all next friday at the same time i believe 1 p.m so see you in a week all right good weekend everybody and that's the live stream all right
