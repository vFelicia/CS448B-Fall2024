click the button going live okay and we're live so thank you for coming harlan we always and thank you everybody for coming in this is our second event on interview tips and tricks that we've been sharing uh with our learners trying to bring about a bit more knowledge on interviews how to prep for them what what technical interviews are about and everything that you should know if you're about to apply or if you're trying to get into tech with us today have harlan ginsberg and please uh go ahead and introduce yourself and tell me a little bit of what you do at code academy hi yeah and and welcome everybody super excited to be chatting today uh so my name is harlan i'm part of the talent team here um and so i focus on essentially hiring folks to join our product organization our data org um and engineering work as well so uh i've been here for six months did we start the same day actually maybe i started the second week of march i wanna say like the eighth sometimes i think i did i think i did as well yeah so i think we started the same day so it's been about six months uh cohort buddies yeah exactly cohort buddies and uh yeah before this i was at a very early stage health tech startup where i led the entire recruiting function um and prior to that i was in the ad tech space um also overseeing product data and engineering there so i've been doing this for some time already um but loving codecademy of course wow okay um you know not a lot of people grow up thinking i'm gonna i want to be a technical recruiter when i um was there anything specific that drove you into this role yes so i when i was in college just got like a general business degree didn't really know what i wanted to do with it didn't know what options were there for me um and i was at a career fair i met some folks that were in recruiting but on the agency side of things sounded pretty cool so i did that for a while and i actually after like nine or ten months got such a bad taste in my mouth um just from the process the experience i wanted to get completely out of of recruiting in general at the time i was interviewing for other jobs and so was my wife and we were both going through some awful processes and we didn't have great experiences and i was talking to one company and they said you know we'd love for you to join us and be a recruiter and i said you know what if i can do this and make the process just a little bit better and actually make sure that people are having like a good time um or at least you know don't walk away from the interview thinking wow i hate those people um yeah then you know this could be an interesting avenue to take it down and i just love the intricacies of it i love meeting new people every single day um and so yeah i'm i'm very happy now so for uh i'm sorry if i missed it before but for how long would you say that you've been doing recruiting just in general four years more professionally um in college i was doing some like work here and there but it was obviously i was still a student so okay four years so i'm assuming that in four years you've seen a lot of candidates like a fair amount it's fair to say you've seen the entire spectrum from really good candidates strong applications to the poor ones the ones that could have done better and i'm assuming that from your perspective seeing them come and go you probably have your own thoughts where you see candice where you say you know what if he had or she had prepared this a little better or if she had known a bit more of that or if they could have demonstrated this a bit better uh they could they would have been fine like from because from their perspective it might have been a very stressful perspective you know process like i'm applying really stressed out from your perspective you you have sort of like the ability to to look at it in hindsight and compare them with all the applicants you've seen for the same role for a similar role so i'm curious to know when you have these candidates like is there like um a baseline like if we're talking about all learners a code academy and they're thinking of applying for the first technical job it's like okay i've learned with code academy i've gone around i think i'm ready i built the portfolio what is this sort of baseline that you would tell people say look these are kind of like the check boxes that you sure you should make sure you're that you're checking every time yeah that's a really good question so from like a very base level perspective if you're going for let's say your first job actually as a developer or data end whatever it might be i think it's really important to remember to talk about projects or things that you have worked on where you've actually been able to utilize those tools or showcase your skills because at the end of the day you can list a bunch of different tools technologies languages on your resume but if i don't have a definitive answer of whether or not you can actually back up that work whether it's through like your github or some other way you can showcase your coding or the work that you've done through portfolio or whatever it is i don't actually know right so like that's that's what you know they always say like it's hard to get experience when nobody will give you that first chance it's hard to take that first chance on someone if you don't actually know what they can or cannot do right so it's it's more than like obviously you should be putting a lot of work into your resume if there if there are areas on your resume where you can actually say like i've utilized this tool or this language to work on x y or z here was the outcome right like here's what happened because of that um i think that'll sort of set you aside from the base level perspective because again anyone can just kind of write whatever they want on their resume but it's our job especially as that first person that you'd be talking to to say do they actually know their stuff um and should be this person showcasing your work yeah i've heard that before that it's really important to showcase what you can do like that's why you know portfolio projects and things like that what about a bit things are a little less technical a lot of people i think uh when they're applying for technical roles um they feel really confident about their the tech skills like programming languages and frameworks but they might be a bit more shaky or concerned about how do i demonstrate you know cheese the typical keywords like yeah how do you demonstrate that you work well with a team like how do you write that in a resume how do you explain that or how oh i deal well with conflict or i'm i'm a solutions focused person or whatever like is there in your experience have you seen like what are the best ways to showcase that like saying you know go about showcasing your soft skills because those are important too right yeah absolutely and every company that i've worked at if you are the most talented engineer they've ever met but you're not someone that's going to really add to the culture i don't like this culture fit i i think culture ad is what we're looking for right someone that's going to really be a part of what we're doing here and be passionate about it and it's hard to write that on a resume right like as far as i'm concerned saying things like i was able to collaborate with x y or z people departments to achieve whatever goal it is or to build whatever product or ship something i think that's a great way to start on your resume right because you know you can't say i worked with melissa and we worked really well together like on your resume like you can tell me that in the phone call um but you know you have to be conscientious of it's a resume and we're going through so many of them so saying things like who you collaborate or not who you collaborated with specifically but like the departments the other engineers from the perspective of like conflict resolution you know you can say things like hey worked on this particular product or worked on shipping this something went wrong i worked with x y or z folks we fixed it we put it out there and that led to whatever it is right so it's it's hard on a resume because you only have so much space but some of those buzzwords like i try to stay away from buzzwords because if you say too many buzzwords it feels like you can actually do anything but things like you know collaboration things like actually working through a conflict solution driven like those are all important things and then if it's enough to catch our eye we'll say okay like let's have a conversation with this person and then we can dig in deeper i'm curiou you know now that you're talking about restaurants i'm actually curious do you have like a mental map of what the perfect resume is like okay if if you ask me what a resume is i will tell you there's a name at the top and then this relevant experience there's a big block of relevant experiences a big block of education usually unless you have a lot of experience that an education is kind of like mine or no you might have like a hobbies like interest general interest and then usually there's like another section that is something like skills and then people list things like teamwork and word and excel and like you know things like my windows linux or whatever like if if you had to give me the wireframe of what a resume looks like especially for for somebody that's applying for the first time job or they might not have really want experience and they're thinking well is it fair to add projects in my resume it's fair to mention this how do i mention this should it be a new category another category like what is the like a good uh wireframe for somebody that might not have a lot of professional experience and they're trying to get the first job yeah i think that's a good point and i think it's especially important to remember that your resume when you're going after your first job is going to be very very different than your resume five ten years down the line whatever it is right so definitely name some contact info right whether it's email or number right like we gotta know how to contact you um i've i've seen people put their like exact address and i don't think that that's very like necessary you can put like the city or the town or the state or whatever but i've seen people put like the exact apartment number i i don't need to see that um unless you want to share it of course that's fine um but then of course like education is really important if you're just starting out right projects are crucial because i was just talking about like it's important to showcase what you've actually worked on that project section is great i also think it's helpful to hyperlink usually people do it at the top uh your linkedin github if you have i think that's great um because your linkedin right like you can write so much more than you can on your resume you can showcase more things you can hyperlink different things there and you get obviously it has has work on it so i think that's really important and then like any sort of relevant work experience if if you have it i think that's great if not you know it's totally fine um a lot of technical resumes will list the actual languages tools things that they use either at the top or the bottom i think most people do the bottom i think the bottom is probably best because when i first look at a resume i'm more interested in the substance of it i'm not as interested at first right in the tools if you're writing about all your experiences and you're saying what tools that you're using in those experiences i think that's great i think a lot of people are hesitant to just put those keywords in the actual sentences and say this person's not actually going to read this they might just control find and try to find these words at the bottom so i think that's fair i i don't do that but right like everyone does this differently so i think uh sometimes they do that because the the servers like there's some automated uh some companies will do automated like wrestling and stuff right so you're trying to hit keyboard so that you don't get denied by the system yes rejected by the system if you are gonna do that i think it's totally fine to put at the bottom don't i just maybe this is just a pet peeve of mine but if you're inserting those tools and languages in the actual substance of your resume you don't need to bulb them i don't think it looks great from a like aesthetics perspective um i've seen a lot of bolding especially lately um but yeah i like to see hobbies i like to see like whatever you want to put on there because at the end of the day we were talking about some of those soft skills if you're going for that first engineering job and your resume is super tech heavy and then you put in there like oh i love to ski or i love to play sports like that gives us an insight into okay this person's not just sitting at their computer all day right like they're they're doing stuff they might be interested in whatever club we have here at codecademy right like we have a soccer team that might be interested in that so like i don't know if it's like a perfect wireframe but i think in general adding those things and putting your own personal touch on it is i think great is it a is it a myth that you only look at resumes like six seconds no i mean six seconds is a lot i i try to give more time right but it's it is hard when especially for like an entrylevel job hundreds sometimes thousands of resumes and you want to get through them all and so six seconds probably not most definitely less than a minute okay yeah because i know that there's a myth it's like you know six seconds ten seconds like basically they're gonna look top down and if that's nothing catches your eye within the first few like seconds of scanning text it's kind of like out um is there a way is that i mean knowing that that's the process knowing that someone on the other side that they don't have any pet peeve against you it's just like you know they're just going through a lot they're just going through volume is there anything you can do on a resume to make sure that that the person stops even if it's for an extra two seconds somebody just going through and go like oh wait like that extra you know attention or that extra intention intentionality that makes someone want to schedule a call with you is there anything in particular that tends to work better than other methods like you said bolding letters doesn't work okay so what works so if i see those hyperlinks at the top linkedin github whatever portfolio you might have i'm automatically more interested because i know that i can find more information there right if i have to go searching i'm probably less likely right like you need to sort of spoon feed that kind of stuff to a little bit um if it i mean if it looks clean right like use your judgment if if pretend that you're on the other side of it right you're like okay i have a hundred of these to look through in the next 30 to 45 minutes of my day and my resume is kind of scatterbrained and all over the place like are they gonna look at mine over someone's who is like very clean crisp like i'm not saying it needs to be perfect it doesn't need to be like you're going out for a job at a bank or anything but like make it look nice okay and what about the myth of uh some people worry that when they're contributing to their repos on github it keeps track with those green dots of like your activity over the past month or something is that something like obviously every company is going to be different and every company is going to go through the process differently but in your experience is that really some people obsess over this like i need to make contributions every day so that it is a very active is that a thing honestly for companies i've worked at it has not been but i can see that being a thing i can see that making sense especially for like first job i can see that because let's say you've been an engineer for three or four years you have plenty of work to back up that you know those particular skills but if you're going for that first job and your github repos like the only place where you have code then i can see places being like okay they're contributing quite often like them they must want this or they must be really really excited again like maybe if you haven't contributed in like six months i'd like be curious but i don't think that that would stop me from reaching out to someone if i'm honest okay um but i think everyone is different and you mentioned the hyperlinks to github and linkedin so you're saying that if if if a recruiter is interested in you uh they might be interested in looking at more information like in the background stuff so so it's not just about sprucing up your your resume you need to make sure that places like linkedin like so these places work because some people think like ah linkedin you know they don't actually look at it they don't actually that doesn't actually matter are you saying that in your experience it does matter more more often than not that you should put some time into making a good introduction in your linkedin put a good photo there could put up some text add on your experiences yes it it 100 um it is still the top tool that recruiters use to find talent um i think it has its flaws right every product has its flaws but it is a really great source of information and it can set you apart from others another thing that's great about linkedin is you can have people endorse you for certain skills and you can have people sort of write references for you and what a better thing like there's nothing better for me to see i'm i'm looking at someone for whatever role it is i can see that people have backed them up for whatever tool whatever language and that they have former colleagues or maybe former classmates in this case saying like wow it was so great to work with them in in our boot camp and we were able to work on a project together and they did a great job they were great to work with i then have from your it's not your resume but from your linkedin before we even chat i know that you're a good collaborator i know that you can work with people well and so you know make sure it's genuine right there are people out there that are like oh i'll endorse you for leadership if you endorse me for whatever like that's that's fake that's not real but there there must be people that you've worked with or that you know maybe you went to class with that you can endorse each other for certain things that that are real and i think that benefits everybody okay yeah that's totally fair i mean i just it's just i was just curious because i know sometimes people like yeah that doesn't really matter it does not we don't know um so i just wanted to hear your take on it yeah um what about what about templating for resumes like you go to google drive and you click new document and you can actually template it for wrestling and they look really clean really well organized already you can just replace the laura ipsum with your stuff yeah is there is there i'm not gonna ask for the benefit but is there a drawback of using a template or is that you just don't mind like do you look at a template or like oh they didn't put the time into writing their own resume or do you just say you know the information is here it is what it is the latter for me i mean it's hard to come up with you know exactly how you want it to look and i think google has some decent templates i think word has some decent templates um use them but if you're adding the right information in there like even if you are using a template you're still putting a lot of work in there because you're putting so much substance on that resume so i don't really care about a template i know like for example my wife she's a creative she would never use a template right like it's a it's up to you as long as it showcases what you can do it's clean looking and it doesn't look lazy or sloppy then i think a template is totally fine they make them for a reason you know have you seen any templates or any breasts where maybe they try to cram so much information that they do the font really small or they start eating spaces they don't let they don't allow enough space between paragraphs between titles uh i'm assuming that when you keep nervous you keep talking about making it you keep talking about making it crisp making it clean looking so i'm assuming that those are things to avoid is there like a top do you have like a quick talk through it was like this this and this look really bad in resume avoid at all cost even if it means writing less words yes so bolded letters 100 um i think yeah it's it's hard of like there's some where at the beginning of a resume there's a huge it's almost like a table chart of like it takes up more than half the page or half the page and it just lists all the technologies before i can actually read about you and what you've done if you're gonna do that put it at the bottom try to make it smaller i mean i'm not here to look at like a table chart of what tools you say you know because that doesn't give me any substance um and then like you know if it goes more than one page i'm not crazy about it like i think that's fine um but just make sure it's not fluff or it's not like supremely like double triple spaced or anything like that like have it make sense just just make it make sense like use your best judgment but avoid the bolded letters in that big box at the top of just a bunch of tools and languages because that doesn't give me anything okay so no bolded letters put the technologies at the bottom what about something else some other cardinal sin you've seen of resonances like avoid that one too like maybe fonts i would i would imagine that you start using very stylistic fonts that make it harder to read you said you only have like a minute to read a resume like if you can read it you're probably gonna you're more likely to pass on that's fair i i've actually very seldomly come across resumes where the font is so crappy that i can't read it but i would say like that's that's a very good thing to keep in mind like okay and it doesn't need to be crazy colors of font either like black and white is fine you know what about uh restaurants that extend beyond one page is that a big nono i i think it depends on if you are putting stuff just to put it like if the font is huge and you've triple spaced things or you've double spaced things like you can bring it down to a page because again we're we're going through them in less than a minute essentially and especially if it's your first job out of school or out of a boot camp like i don't expect much on there to be able to say this merits more than one page um but if i see one that like it's a goodlooking resume there's substance on it and it's longer than one page i'm not gonna i'm not gonna be like oh it's longer than one page toss it out like just again make it make sense okay how does okay another question about restroom is how does a resume change if you are going for let's say does it change a lot considering that's your first job so if it's your first job you'll have a lot of experience behind you does it change a lot the fact that you might be applying for a technical role in maybe the web development part of a company or in the data analyst part of a company or in the design part of a company does the feel that you're applying for change the resume a lot or it just changes the contents of it and mostly it's just all the same yeah highlighting your teamwork highlighting your you know projects yeah i think for that first job it should relatively stay the same except for the content right so like if you've worked on projects that are data analytics heavy but also some web dev heavy but you're going for an analytics role put that solid information that that relevant information to the top and highlight that you don't have to get rid of the other stuff because i think that's also important but if i'm reading a resume for a data analytics role or an analyst role and the first thing i see is web dev stuff then i'm going to say like okay they might have the foundational knowledge for this role but is this actually the role that they want or do they want a web dev focused role right so you don't have to take it off just prioritize it right like okay top to bottom it doesn't matter all right makes total sense you gotta know what you want to know um i would imagine that um copy and pasting restaurants and stuff like do you do you think that people have to tailor the rationales to the company that are playing because i would imagine the covered letters yeah but the restroom is do you actually have to tailor a much company to a company if you're going to be applying for 100 companies or resumes relatively stay the same is it fair for a candidate to say look i need to save time because i'm applying for 400 jobs in the next week i'm going for like eight hours a day of applications yeah absolutely it is because as far as i'm concerned applying for jobs is a fulltime job it's a lot of work assuming that most of the jobs that you're applying to are of a similar title and a similar level you're really not going to need to change it if at all right it's only if you're applying to a web dev job and an analytics role right like that's the difference here um obviously the cover letter needs to change a lot or a decent amount but the resume itself like if you're just going for a bunch of frontend roles like should be similar or probably doesn't need much change at all okay fair enough do you have any general advice that you would like to share because i think i i asked all the questions i could come up with as far as resumes are concerned yeah hello restaurants are applying for jobs in general i don't know do you have any any tips like if i were applying for my first job i came and said harlem i'm applying for jobs uh give me give me something that will give me hope is it uh what should i be hopeless yeah hope is important i think number one is just keep hope alive because like it's going to be very challenging to apply to jobs and you're not going to hear back from a lot of people and when you do hear back a lot of the times it's going to be no and that's not a reflection of you it's a reflection of what the company needs where they are and does your background does your experience mesh with that do you know what i mean even now like i have a lot of friends that come to me constantly and they're like i don't even know why i'm applying to jobs i mean no one's seeing it it's like it's gonna happen you just need to keep chugging along and you need to keep doing it and try not to get discouraged um if there are roles that you are particularly interested in because you're gonna you should be applying to a lot of roles right like anything that sounds interesting to you you should apply to it because you never actually know what the role is gonna be like until you talk to someone there right like there's only so much we can put in a job description but let's say there's something that you're super excited about apply and then look up that company on linkedin and see who is a part of their talent team and i very rarely get um messages like this but if you apply to a data analyst role and you look up codecademy and you see who is on the talent team here you might not know that i'm the person responsible but you can reach out to a member of the talent team and say hey i just applied to this role i'm super interested are you the person that i can like talk to about this should i maybe be talking to someone else about this and listen everyone is busy i'm not going to say that we're going to respond to you right away but for me that at least shows initiative right and if it's 150 applicants for one sort of entrylevel web dev job and i get a couple of people that show that initiative like that's enough for me to say this person has differentiated themselves enough to the point where i know they're super interested about this job right and you don't have to do that for every job but if there's ones that you're particularly interested in like you might as well give it a go worst case scenario you never hear back but at least you should you know shoot your shot right like try it out it doesn't hurt talent professionals were on linkedin constantly and again we might not be able to respond right away because there's a lot going on um we'll see it at some point and they should respond fair enough fair enough i like it i mean differentiating yeah that's really tough i mean i can speak from personal experience that uh when i wanted to work at code academy i was contributing in the community for almost a year before before i noticed like you know just um i was browsing the careers page of code academy i was like yeah you know it would be cool to work here and then i realized like oh wow this role is open yeah and i applied that's like but like you know it says one of those happy accidents but you look back and you realize you were walking that path you were building the foundations for you to be a successful candidate way before you you submit the application everything i did in the past every relationship i build people i reach out to right so it's kind of like one of those things you said like hey find the talent team reach out to them it's sort of like you're trying to make your own luck you are you're preparing yourself so that if they do say okay i'll get you i'll give you a call you you you're ready you're ready for like you don't want to get caught with your emptyhanded i suppose uh if you get called back yeah um okay uh let's see if there's any questions in the chat i'm looking right now uh let's see a couple questions from one of the users one of them is how long did it take for you to feel comfortable applying while feeling confident about passing the technical okay do you get that question say one more time for me so how long did it take you uh okay so i think it may i think that they meant to ask how long it take it would take a candidate to to build up the confidence to apply for jobs and being confident that they're gonna be able to pass the technical so i know that this comes back to the impostor syndrome of like it's my first job maybe out of school out of a boot camp out of your selftaught maybe well if you're selftaught like it's times 10 the pressure of saying i'm not i'm not legit i'll learn this online whatever like so have you come across any applicants that failed that kind of impossible like they were having trouble showcasing like you could see in the resume or like in the paperwork you could see that they know but they are having trouble showcasing it uh do you think that there's like a way to break through that and say it's kind of like what you said before like should you shot like is there something you can say look you just have to go for it it's hard everybody struggles with imposter syndrome i honestly struggled with it until i came to codecademy so most of my career in life and i think a lot of people are the same and i think what you need to remember is that yes there's going to be people applying to a bunch of these jobs but you know what you can do right and if everything that you put on your resume is clear concise and correct and the company is interested in talking to you because of what they saw on your resume that should be enough confidence to say hey i got a shot here right like if you apply somewhere and the company gets back to you and says they want to have a conversation you've done enough to say this person without meeting them just by looking at some words could be a good fit to join our organization so and and that i think is the hardest part because getting across that line of oh i've applied and i'm waiting to hear back actually hearing back as far as i'm concerned is the hardest part because you need to articulate who you are and what you can do on a sheet of paper obviously virtual but like one page right to to me and the way that i would say to people is like that should be more challenging than actually going through the process because at that point you're just talking about what you know what you can do what you have done and that should be a piece of cake if you can articulate that on one page then you can say it to some folks that you would work with i think and it's easier said than done you know is this something about um for a beginner applying for jobs for the first time do you ever look at a candy and said oh you know they only have one project i was looking for three uh oh well this project is not i'm assuming that there is like some sort of quality to it where if you see a project that is not a template that they build on themselves or is there is it like um some delineation on what kind of projects like if you build one of these or two of these like it's not about volume it's the quality how do you know as a beginner okay this should be enough you know because if you get a lot of rejections you get 30 40 rejections from different companies you might start thinking there's something wrong with me maybe i need to go back to a drawing board i need to learn more maybe i just don't know enough that's why they're not calling me back yeah is there like like a cut off or saying look if you can build pro if you look you look at the job description and they ask him for these technologies if you can build a project with those technologies you should be good to go don't worry about it if it's one or three is that like a like a way of looking at it that you can know this should be enough as far as i'm concerned if if we're looking for specific tools and you say hey here's a project that i've worked on or here's a product that i've built using those tools that should be enough um let's say there's 10 applicants and everyone has at least one project some have two or three then maybe those are the people that we reach out to first right and i've never done that i can see that being the case because at the end of the day we're trying to figure out who has the best experiences for this job right and until you read into it like you could have only one project or one product that you've worked on it could be exactly what we're working on here so it's on us to actually read it through and to understand what you've worked on because you could have worked on three things and they could not be great or they could not be relevant at all right but if you worked on one thing and it's super relevant and it's really high quality and it's still making some head waves wherever it is in the you know universe then i think that's great so i i wouldn't look at someone and say okay they only have one project so like get out of here um but it really is on you know the talent function to say hey like you need to know what you're doing i mean and to be fair when you go through a boot camp one of these three months bootcamps usually you have one capstone project typically like they don't ask you to build 10. you don't worry usually it's like if you're doing like for example a full stack you're going to has a full stack it's a very thorough endtoend sort of project where you showcase the entire scope or you worked on um so exactly okay and those are the things those are great because we know how intense those are you know what i mean yeah okay there's another question here about open source projects how good do they look when applying is that something that recruiters look for so i would imagine that goes in the same category of just things you've worked on if you're on an applicant and you say okay what what can you build show me yeah open source one of those i wouldn't say that like we are specifically looking for or not for open source projects i think you're right i think it's about the same right like you can show something that you've worked on open source like it's totally fine most most people don't actually should like it won't be on their resume but it will be like on their linkedin or somewhere else like if you've worked on something that has those skills and abilities that we need and it's somewhere out there give me a way where i can find it okay i guess okay projects that sounds good to me yeah uh let's see any other questions okay so uh last question here it says if you're not in a junior web development anymore okay so i think this question goes about so we've been talking about beginners a lot so yeah my understanding is that the shift goes if you're more of a if you have one two three years of experience under you and you're changing companies i would imagine the shift changes from what you're showcasing your resume and the kind of stuff that you're showcasing um does your resume radically change changes between being a beginner and maybe being a like a junior or like you know intermediate three years yeah i think it does right i think when when that happens it's important to talk more about what you've actually been doing in your role than projects from or for example you know i don't know exactly when the cutoff is but you don't necessarily need to list your education at the very top of your resume if you graduated two or three years ago because i would rather see professional working experiences first do you know what i mean yeah no it makes total sense that when you're a professional you want to showcase that professionals i mean i would imagine that there's still room for you to showcase kind of like personal work but i would imagine that companies are mostly hiring you for what you you've been learning at the role professional role that you've been uh you've been doing totally totally but i also think like that personal work is important i've i've hired an engineer before that in their role they were using the tools that we needed but in their like personal work they were working on something that was like similar in industry or similar in function like still showcases it if it makes sense if you're proud of it and if it fits on the page yeah put it on there awesome well uh we've been talking for a while 40 minutes and we've done through some q a so i think at this point we're ready to wrap it up uh do you have any parting thoughts anything else you want to share with the learners before we check out just to stick with it it's really challenging and to apply for jobs to go for your first job it's the hardest one you know they always say like foot in the door right getting your foot in the door it's the hardest thing that you can do but make those connections talk to people people want to help people want to see other people succeed especially those that are just starting out so hit us up um and and not just like people within talent but like other engineers that you're interested in you know being in that role one day right like talk to them worst case scenario they never get back to you but some people will i'm sure they will we've i think i've done it certainly other people have done it and some people get back and they're more than happy to impart some wisdom and you know help out in any way so just stick with it try not to be discouraged because it's really challenging but you can do it i know you can
