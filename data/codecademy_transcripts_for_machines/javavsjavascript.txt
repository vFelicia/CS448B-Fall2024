what is up my beautiful people out there I am Brendan I'm a fullstack developer in Brooklyn New York and today I'm going to be talking about the difference between Java and JavaScript first off are they similar No I know it's hard to believe but they're actually not similar at all the only similarity they have is the fact that Java is in both of their names why do they both have the word Java in their names well that's the first thing we're going to be talking about in this video today their history their history is what intertwines them the most what else am I going to be talking about this video today well defining features of each language that will be mostly syntax I'm also going to be talking about what you could build with both languages and the current state of hiring in Java and JavaScript so without further ado let's get into it intro video goo pretty much the only reason I'm covering this topic today is because of the simple fact that the letters J a V a are in the name JavaScript aside from that there's really no reason to pick these two to compare while this video is Java versus JavaScript I could have just as easily created a Python versus JavaScript video or a donut versus Dorito video both words have the letters vo in them and both are equally delicious but the comparison doesn't really make any sense they're not even in the same snack category though they are both considered snacks the same thing can be said about Java and JavaScript they're both programming languages but they're not in the same category of programming languages though in recent years the things you could build with them have been converging especially with Java scripts recent breakout framework nodejs they are definitely vastly different but alas here we are of all the things that we're going to be talking about today that are considered similarities this is the one that intertwines the two languages the most their history first let's start with Java Sun Microsystems released the first public implementation of Java in 1996 Java was actually originally designed for interactive television which is pretty sweet but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry however it eventually found its sweet spot in dominating the world of serverside programming in a nutshell serverside programming is the part of an application humans don't directly interact with for instance the part of venmo that keeps track of your running balance and calculates her new balance when you're stingy friend finally pays you JavaScript was created by Netscape the company responsible for the first popular web browser in 1995 and was written in a total of nine days it was originally named mocha later renamed a live script and then finally took the name JavaScript and was to be a simple language that would be directly embedded in the HTML of a website just like CSS but whereas CSS added some formatting and color to websites javascript added some muchneeded dynamic interaction HTML CSS and JavaScript made up the trifecta of the web they powered website's HTML being the structure CSS being the decoration and JavaScript being the interaction for the first few years of its existence netscape reigns supreme in the world of web browsers but when the Seattle juggernaut software company Microsoft released its version of war browser Internet Explorer Netscape got a little scared because Internet Explorer was super popular this marked the beginning of what's referred to in internet history as the first browser Wars it would be putting it lightly to say that the Netscape people were freaking out so what they did is they approached the sun microsystems people the people who created java and they hash out a deal where they'd change the name of the language they'd be developing for the web browser called mocha to javascript under a license agreement in exchange for collaborating with sun to incorporate Suns programming language Java to run inside the web browser netscape netscape did this because it needed to throw everything it could at Microsoft in order to stop the onslaught so Java seemed like the new hot thing down the flip side of the deal Sun Microsoft agreed because it solved the Internet in web browsers as a potential future platform for Java apps next up let's talk about the defining features of Java and JavaScript Java is a statically typed language javascript is a dynamically typed language when you boil that tech lingo down it means that declaring variables in Java is much more rigid than the script let me show you what I mean notice how I'm declaring these variables in Java here I have this name variable up top and it is a string notice how I literally have to say that the type of value that's going to be stored inside the name variable will be a string notice how benchpress I have to specifically declare that an integer will be saved to benchpress and for my string array notice how this string bracket thing that represents that I'm creating an array and it's going to consist of a bunch of strings in Java you have to specify the types of values you're going to be saving to a specific variable not only that but once you declare that a variable is a particular type of data a string for this example it must remain a string for its entire lifetime for instance if I wanted to set the value of New Jersey legend to an integer 3 I can't do that in Java now compare that to JavaScript which is a dynamically typed language you do not have to specify the types of data you're saving to a variable notice here how there's nothing about a string being saved in name it's simply a variable name same with benchpress same with my string array not only that but in JavaScript variables can be reassigned to values with different data types so last name could easily be changed to a value 4 I don't know why you want to do that and again if you wanted to change that last name variable back to have a value of a string you could totally do that and JavaScript allows this yay now javascript is considered a prototype base objectoriented programming language meaning you're not bound to a code pattern like you are with Java meaning you have to jump through a lot less hoops in JavaScript than you do with Java for example let's try printing out a simple phrase in both languages here's a bag of cheese girls and Java we have to do a lot first things first you're forced to use these things called classes to do anything classes serve as reusable templates to produce objects objects are just these types of data structures we use in programming to store information we use objects and classes in programming to model reallife situations in our coding world that we're creating for instance every website has probably a user class or a user model that we use to kind of model what it's like to be a human being in the real world but on our website so for instance we would use a user asked to produce user objects to save in our database for our website so every user modeled after a real life you know me being a human being user situation I have a first name and you know I have an appearance I have a profile picture what do I look like on your website I have a birthdate and I have a password to log me in to use your website so back in Java when we're actually forced to create these templates or these classes in order to create one instance of a particular thing so for instance let's say we're creating a dog class so first we must build that dog Factory and then from that factor we can build individual instances of dogs which have you know generally speaking these same attributes but different value for those attributes dogs have different names dogs have different breeds dogs have different ages etc etc Java requires a lot of code to do something as simple as printing out here's a bag of cheese girls you'll notice that this red box represents this outer public class cheese curls wrapper thing this is what's known as the class declaration remember how I said that Java is a classbased objectoriented programming language classbased means that you literally have to wrap everything you ever want to code in in a class like this inside that required class declaration we'd then create another function that will automatically get called when our code runs then inside that function what do we want that main function to do we want to print out to our system here's a bag of cheese girls so the red signifies this kind of class required wrapper that Java code must be written in the blue box here represents the function that we'll get automatically called when our code is run and then what do we want our function to do well inside this yellow box we're defining print out here's a bag of cheese girls now you don't need to understand the actual syntax of what I'm showing you I just want to show you that there's a lot that you have to do just to print something as simple as here's a bag of cheese girls you have to jump through all of these different hoops just to do something very simple now if you're interested in learning what these words actually mean in the java language i've included a little dictionary here and we also offer a course on code academy comm covering the basics of java a link to that in description below as well compare that to the simplicity of JavaScript look at this no need to wrap this thing in a function inside a class wrapper we can just write the thing we want to happen in one line right here now recently JavaScript actually updated to include this kind of similar class construction that we see in other languages other classbased objectoriented languages like Java but in no way is JavaScript bound to this construction like Java is again you don't need to understand what's going on here you just need to know that JavaScript is much less verbose now what I'm about to say is a massive generalization and that's why I'm labeling it as such to all of my more advanced programmers out there before I get shredded to bits in the comments but in this way I think JavaScript is much more forgiving than Java earlier on in the process of building out an application why do I say early on in the process of building out an application because once you've jumped through all of the Java induced hoops one could also argue that Chavez lack of forgiveness means it's less prone to bugs in the long run compared to JavaScript in other words Java applications take a lot more time to get off the ground but once you've kind of set that structure up for your application the upkeep effort is much less compared to a JavaScript application whose initial time to just spin a simple application up is relatively easy relatively straightforward that being said the level of upkeep required for a JavaScript application increases as time passes to reiterate what I'm arguing Java it's always a slow start but it has a very stable future compared to JavaScript which is very easy to get off the ground but once you have it off the ground and you have this massive application the upkeep is kind of annoying here's a very popular question what can you build with Java and JavaScript the thing with Java is it never really came to dominate the desktop or web applications fear though it can be used for both now it does dominate specific industries and specific technology verticals including the Android sphere many massive industries requiring a very stable language use Java like banking trading the automobile industry Java can also be used for scientific computing and it's also used as the language for just generalpurpose programming of hardware like the Internet of Things like Raspberry Pi or a Sonos speaker or a refrigerator that's connected to the Internet things like this now JavaScript it was originally limited to the web browser it was kind of seen as a toy language in the beginning it went handinhand with HTML and CSS and these were just languages used to create websites originally it was used to add a dynamic aspect otherwise very static and boring websites meaning it was reserved for the front end of a website only the part of the website that a human being interacts with you know with their mouse and their or their trackpad and clicking on things and things would happen now that being said after years of opensource development there are huge robust libraries out there that can extend the capabilities of javascript including nodejs which allowed developers to finally use javascript outside the environment of a web browser and this has been the new hot thing for startups these days things like Facebook things like Twitter things like Airbnb they all use this no js' JavaScript framework to power their businesses and their technologies in terms of hiring Java is preferred in the computer science in enterprise business community but javascript is the new and fresh thing startup businesses like uber Netflix they're all making this massive push for javascript based technologies but large enterprises that have been around for years things like the banking industry the automotive industry Java is kind of your choice for those reasons Java pays better than JavaScript according to the website to challenge rocket now include a link to that article below Java requires more time to learn the ins and outs of the language compared to JavaScript that being said the technology world is definitely paying attention to JavaScript Java pays definitely more right now but who's to say that JavaScript developers won't be demanding the same amount of paid that Java developers get in the near future already folks so that is it for this video today that was a very highlevel view of the difference between Java and JavaScript but before I go I do want to kind of do a little recap here so in terms of history Java and JavaScript have a very intertwined relationship at the beginning javascript people needed to ride the wave surrounding Java and hopefully squash Microsoft web browsers Internet Explorer the Java people saw web browsers and Netscape as a potential platform for Java's future at the beginning both languages handle different things javascript was able to add some interactivity to websites Java was to be used for interactive television button workout they did eventually find their sweet spot in the form of serverside computing in terms of defining features Java is a statically typed objectoriented language meaning you need to be explicit with the things you declare and you can't change the values of certain variables you're also forced to use classes javascript has objectoriented capabilities but you're not forced to use those classes like you are in JavaScript what can you build with both of them well Java is better for larger scale projects and enterprise software because it can handle more data more computing it's more stable and it's currently used in the new Internet of Things movement JavaScript was reserved for the front end of websites in the past it went handinhand with HTML and CSS to kind of add some interactivity to otherwise very stable web sites semi recently you can now use javascript through nodejs to build applications outside the environment of a web browser so javascript is no longer reserved for the front end aspect of web sites you can now use it to build out the backend component of a website in terms of hiring Java still pays more but javascript don't sleep on JavaScript it definitely has all of the momentum at this time ok so that is it I will see you in the next one bye
