if not already possibly now all right i think we're live something happened on my screen welcome everyone uh we're just gonna wait uh a minute or two to make sure that we are fully live um jamie and i are going to be talking about the central limit theorem today and i'm very very excited uh thank you for letting us know in the chat that you can see us um so i am very excited for this uh anyway we are i think as usual streaming on a couple of different services but just as a reminder um we're gonna be keeping an eye on the chat in uh youtube so if you are on facebook or twitch or one of the other platforms that we are streaming on if you would like to code along with us and ask us questions or say hello um you can go to the youtube uh streaming and let us know that you are here by saying hello in the chat um cool uh so i guess we can get started today so i will share my screen today's lesson is gonna be heavy on the theory uh and there's we're definitely going to be doing some coding like we need some coding to get a sense of the theory but the focus is going to be on understanding some pretty deep theoretical concepts which i find super fun um but i think it can also be a little bit intimidating sometimes so um i really want to encourage everyone to ask questions if anything comes up that you are confused about um i really really welcome questions because it will help me keep track of what is making sense to people and what's not and we can slow down at any point and kind of recap things if um if anything is is confusing so uh again as per usual we're using some code that's available on our github for this streaming series if you want to download that code ahead of time you're welcome to there's also like a little simulated data set in here for this week's um this week's materials so you can find that if if you go to the github page and hopefully that is linked in youtube and other streaming services um cool i'm to open up starting cook okay so to get started um the first thing i want to prepare everyone for is i'm going to ask us to take on a couple of different personas during this lesson so we're gonna switch back and forth from the researcher perspective so that's somebody who is trying to conduct some research trying to analyze some data we're going to switch between that and the allpowerful perspective so we get in this lesson to be like gods or goddesses whatever you want to call it if you're if uh or all powerful in some way we get to like see things that the researcher would not get to see um and kind of imagine imagine both perspectives if we had all the knowledge that we could possibly have and if we only had the knowledge that a researcher had um the other thing i want to kind of set up here is up to this point we have been talking through uh summary statistics just basic descriptive statistics we looked at some data visualizations as well and um a lot of so that content is really useful for a lot of different types of research that you might want to do but i want to kind of separate what we're doing today uh from that a little bit and say so you could kind of imagine two different types of questions that you want to answer um on the one side you could imagine that let's say you work at a company like codecademy there's i think like 150 employees at this point and let's say you um you want to understand something about salary and demographic characteristics among employees and you have the data for every single person that works at the company that you're that you care about then you can just use descriptive statistics because the thing that you care about you have all of the data for but there are a lot of situations where you cannot for some reason collect all of the data that you need to answer the question that you want to answer and that could be for a variety of reasons it could be just because the population that you care about is really large like you want to understand trends between salary and demographics for all u.s adults and you can't you just cannot get that information for all u.s adults um that could be one situation another situation a lot of times in like marketing is that you can imagine you have a new feature for your product and you want to test it out and see if or let's say like it's a different color subscribe button and you want to see if more people press the green subscribe button compared to the red subscribe button and uh you want to know whether more people like all the future visitors to your website you want to know what all those people would do but you can't see all the future people that will ever access your website and in fact even among the people that you do sample you can't ever see what somebody would have done in another situation so if you show someone a green button you can't see what they would have done if they saw a red button so that's another form of missing data you just can't see you know ideally you'd like to show every person that could possibly visit your website the red button erase their memory and then do the same thing with the green button and like see all of those things and then look at the data but you can't always do that so in that case you need some other tools in order to understand something about a population about all the people that might visit the website or feel confident about it having only collected a smaller amount of data okay i've now i always do this i ramble a little too much at the beginning of these i hope i didn't lose too many people yet but hopefully that sets up kind of the motivation for what we're doing so um what i have here is a um a jupiter notebook i'm just gonna load a bunch of packages i i just copy this over every time i start a new project because i may not use all the packages but at least i have all of them imported um and i can import more if i need this uh hourly pay text file is um it's just essentially an array of numbers uh and this was simulated but what it's meant to represent is salaries in u.s dollars for theoretically all adult americans um it's like it's it's fake data but it's based off of census data so it's somewhat similar to what this would look like in real life um so i'm gonna go ahead and really quickly plot a histogram of this so we can take a look at it uh let's do like 100 bins and yes maybe 100 was too many let's do 50. um okay so it looks something like this uh which we probably expect you know there's this there's a spike at kind of a low salary seems like most people are kind of oh and this is an hourly pay or hourly salary um so looks like most people are kind of under 20 an hour there are some people between 20 and 40 and then it kind of drops off from there there's some from 40 to 60 and then like very few but still some people all the way up to 140 an hour in this chart and you can see over here this is like a a pretty big scale each of these bars um this axis represents frequencies so we have like frequencies and some for some of these bars of over three hundred thousand um cool so this gives us a little bit of a sense right now we're in all powerful modes so we're gonna pretend um in this in today's lesson we're gonna pretend that we're a researcher that's interested in figuring out what the average salary for all us adults is and then as the allpowerful being we can see data for salary information for all u.s adults so those are the two uh the two perspectives will shift between so right now we're all powerful we can see this histogram um and we can actually calculate the mean uh salary so i'll do that so if i do i mean hourly pay uh and actually i'll save this as mean salary and print it is this also big enough for everyone i realize click zoom in and i can print the mean salary okay so it's about 18 and 84 cents cool okay so we've taken a minute we're all powerful we know the answer to the question that our researcher is going to try to answer we know that the average salary for all american adults based off of this i don't know if this is exactly what it is um i think this data that i based this off of was from like 2013 or something so it might be outdated but it's approximately eighteen dollars and eightyfour cents we're going to pretend that that's the truth that our researcher can't know now we're gonna for a minute imagine that we are a researcher so um as this researcher we are going to try to answer our question what's the mean salary of u.s adults and we're going to do that by finding a sample of of u.s adults and calculating their mean salary because that's all we can do right we can find and by sample i mean like some subset of this original um of this original set of numbers right some subset of all the people that we actually care about cool so um i'm gonna actually hold on i'm gonna open up the final code and pull this over so that i can also see it uh because i just want to make sure okay cool um there's a few different ways to do this a few different functions that you can use for random sampling i guess for this at least in the final code i gave you guys i used random so i'll use that here um so i'm just gonna demo really fast what this random sample function does uh before we do any examples here so if i just had an array i'm going to call it arr um of a bunch of numbers like 1 1 2 2 3 4 5 6 6 7 8. okay i've got a bunch of numbers in this array if i say um if i say give me a random sample of array and i say give me a random sample of five numbers let's say oh i guess actually it requires a list it gives me a sampling of the numbers in this array uh so this first time i got 6 6 5 1 8. um one of the questions you might be interested in and actually i'll do this again so here's five different numbers interesting that i got the two sixes again oops let's try it again two sixes again wow okay that time i only got one so it will it will run this randomly every single time and we'll get different results every single time one thing you might be interested in is whether there's replacement here so by replacement i mean after it picks a number can that number be picked again by default this function does not use replacement but if you wanted to you could always do a quick google search to try to figure that out so i'm just going to demonstrate because this is also a coding uh demo so actually now the function documentation um all right let's try this again this was a bad demo uh sample python and we'll go back to all okay it's weird that the function documentation doesn't come up right away but here i guess is the whole random package so it'll be in here somewhere yeah there it is um and you can look through and see what what all of the parameters are it should say somewhere whether it is replaceable oh yeah sampling without replacement so it's not going to put anything back okay so we have this this sample from our array and we can see that we can do this in python so now i'm going to demo this using our full population so i'm imagining i'm the researcher and i'm going to go in and as the researcher i'm going to find a sample or a subset of people in this population and i'm going to collect their salaries so let's uh let's do it this way i'm going to call this samp1 and i'm gonna pass in what did we call it hourly pay uh actually okay just to make everything super super clear i'm going to say i'm going to resave this as something called population i'm going to save it as a list but i'm just saving the exact same numbers again so that we're really clear that this is the the full population and then this is going to be our sample so we'll sample from that population and i don't know jamie pick a pick a number how many do we want to sample from it uh 20. okay let's sample 20 people to start and then let's print out the mean of our sample and it was 17.24 interesting okay we could do this as many times as we wanted so if we do this again because this is random sampling we're going to get different samples every single time so i'll do it again we got something different i also think so i'll show you really quickly pissed stamp one um okay let's pick uh let's pick a slightly larger sample size let's do like 150 so we can really see it if we look at this histogram right of a sample of 150 people from our population you'll notice that it looks pretty similar to our original histogram that we made right like so our original one looked like this there was a spike around zero um then there was this long tail most of the the density of this thing was between 0 and 20 then 20 to 40. and if we look back at this we see kind of a similar shape right we've still got this low spike we've got some den some high density between 0 to 20 some like medium density from 20 to 40 and we've got this kind of long tail obviously it's a little bit sparser um but we still we see a similar shape and we see that this mean for our sample 18.65 is kind of pretty similar to the mean for the overall population and no matter how many times we do this taking different samples of 150 people from our population which let's see how big is the population can i do one on this actually don't know yeah uh okay that's three minutes well i guess this is not the whole population because it's not as long as it would need to be but you'll have to suspend disbelief so we've got like three million in here um we can imagine that the population is something else i don't know okay so but we we do see right that no matter how many times we do this we're going to get a sample that's somewhat similar to the population it's not going to be exactly the same it's going to be slightly different every time there might be different outliers that show up like this one randomly has two people i think out in this uh like over a hundred per hour category which is kind of surprising given how rare that is in the full population but sometimes just by random chance we'll get those people so okay and the framework that we're now going to take so do this one more time because it's kind of fun we're going to think about what happens if we do this a lot of times so now that we have pretended to be the researcher we've taken a sample from our population we have taken a look at it and seen that it's similar to the population but there's some variation in there sometimes we get a high mean sometimes we get a low mean compared to the population mean now we're going to go back to uh now we're gonna go back to all powerful mode okay so in our allpowerful mode what we're gonna do is we're gonna repeat this process a whole bunch of times so jamie what kind of uh coding technique do you think i should use to repeat this a bunch of times or what do you have any ideas how to how i could kind of go about that yeah so i guess if we want to basically repeat the same pos repeat the same process a lot of times we might maybe want to use some type of loop like have it automatically do it yeah yeah so instead of just pressing this run button a bunch of times and seeing what the output is i'm gonna use a for loop um and i could use a different kind of loop actually uh there's nothing i could use like a while loop as well um but i'm just gonna use a for loop because it's easy um and what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna say for i and range i don't know like 10 000. what this is gonna do is it's gonna repeat the process that i tell my that i tell python to repeat it's gonna repeat it 10 000 times um it see might seem a little bit silly that i have this like i here where i say for i and range 10 000 um i'm not going to use it for the purposes of what we're doing here i'm really just setting this up because i want i just want something to to happen ten thousand times i want to kind of like essentially if i was coding something else right every time this whatever code i put down here under the for loop would happen every time that would happen i would increase by one and it would or it would start at zero so go zero one two three four um right so like if i print four i in range ten print i and i uh and i run this i'm just going to get the numbers 0 through 9 because i is going to be 0 the first time then it's going to be 1 then it's going to be 2 and it's going to happen 10 times in total and it's going to print out the value of i each time but i'm just not going to use i because i don't need it i just need something to happen 10 000 times or a large number of times okay actually good coding practice is to never start a loop by repeating something 10 000 times because if you screw up the code uh then it can get stuck and like quit out on you so i like to start with like 10 and then we'll we'll iterate on this so i'm going to kind of grab my code from up here i've got population has already been saved and every time in this loop what i'm going to do is take a sample call it sample of some number of observations and then i'm going to calculate the mean of the sample actually i'm going to call this samp because another good coding practice is to not name variables the same thing as functions um because that can sometimes get a little bit mixed up great okay so i'm going to calculate the mean of sample but i don't want to just calculate the mean and just let it go i want to save it somewhere so uh jamie do you have any ideas for how i could save it yeah so we're probably going to want to save more than one of these because you're going to be iterating a lot so we could save it inside of a list cool so maybe we can make like a list outside of the for loop that is empty that we can just add stuff to it yeah so i'm going to create an empty list called samp means perfect and then i'm going to say samp means dot append which means append that value onto the list um and i'm going to append the mean of that particular sample so uh okay and now i'm just going to print out what this looks like after 10 iterations and we'll take a look at it cool so all of all of what we've done here is we've taken 10 sam 10 different samples of 150 each for each sample we calculated the mean and we saved that in our list so the first sample mean was 20.68 this next one was 19.35 then 18.66 and so on and so forth uh i see that i saw that there was a question about um memorize memorizing and knowing how the number goes so yes uh i think jamie responded but if you could clarify that question i would be happy happy to answer it um okay so all right so we've done this we've confirmed that we can do it 10 times and we can collect 10 sample means and now i'm gonna do it a whole bunch more times i'm going to do 10 000. i'm gonna run it i'm not gonna print it anymore because that's gonna be 10 000 numbers but what i will do is i i'll make an will of it this will take a second to run cool cool interesting okay so let's break down what this picture is telling us so remember that what we did as all powerful beings is that we collected 10 000 different samples each sample had 150 people in it for each sample we calculated the mean and then we plotted a histogram of them um when we plotted this histogram we saw that it looks kind of symmetrical part of the reason why i chose this data is because i think this is really a stark contrast to the population distribution which i think is interesting so like this population distribution i would describe as very right skewed right there's this very very long righthanded tail and most of the data is on the low end of the distribution but here and that's true right for all of the individual samples that we took all those individual samples are also right skewed but suddenly when we calculate sample means and we plot a histogram of all of the sample means we get this really nice symmetrical distribution and if we calculate the mean of all of the sample means it's going to be so it's like 18.82 about which is almost exactly the same as the the true population mean and maybe that feels i don't know to me that feels like it makes sense that the mean of the means like the middle of the means of all these samples is going to be equal to the population mean but it's actually like a super super powerful statistical theorem that is not i mean we take it for granted like uh what this what this means in like and i don't mean to use mathy terms but there's uh this is called a unbiased estimator so the mean is is called an unbiased estimator of the population mean which means that if you take a bunch of samples from a population and you calculate the mean for each one on average those sample means will be the same as the population mean but that's not necessarily true for for example if you calculate standard deviation or variance of a population it's almost an unbiased estimator but that's why there's a difference i don't know some of you may have seen this so there's a difference between calculating population standard deviation and sample standard deviation you divide by n in one case and you divide by n minus one in the other case and the reason for that is that if you divide by n it becomes a ever so slightly biased estimator um of the population standard deviation and if you think of something like the maximum of a data set which is another statistic that we might use so like we might calculate the maximum uh salary in each sample like that might be something that we're interested in if we count if we take the maximum of all of these population or all these samples and plot a histogram of the maximums it's not going to be centered at the population maximum so it's it's not true for all statistics that this lines up but for the sample mean it does and it's really really nice that it does okay so i guess the first question is why is this so valuable and the reason it's so valuable is that it allows us to understand uncertainty and uncertainty is really the key to statistics and inferential statistics specifically because again put yourself in in the feet of or in the shoes of a researcher um again i like that marketing example if you're like you're trying to figure out what proportion of visitors to a website will press my green subscribe button and you can only sample a thousand people you can only show the button to a thousand people and observe what they do you need to know how cert let's say you find that ten percent more people push the button if it's green than in the old version you need to be know how certain you can be that it's really ten percent and not negative one percent right like maybe in the population it's negative one percent but you just found in your random sample 10 more press that button and in this case right like if if you find as the researcher that the average salary is 16 an hour you want to know how certain you can be that that lines up with the population average salary if that's what you're trying to estimate you want to know how far off you could be and that's what this tells you tells you how far off you could possibly be because it gives you a sense of how spread out these numbers and how spread out the sample means are if you were all powerful and you could take a bunch of sample means of that size you this tells you how spread out they could possibly be um so i guess one of the things that i'll point out here um and maybe we intuit it but i think it's like a powerful thing to show is uh what happens when we change the sample size so what i'm going to do is i'm actually going to i'm going to uh make sure that we plot this on the same axis every time i'm gonna set plt dot x slim of 0 to 40. uh and i'll plot this again yeah okay so i'm just plotting this from 0 to 40 so we can see the full whole thing if i do if i do this again with let's say a sample size of a hundred instead it's going to be a little bit wider let's pick something lower really show it i'm gonna sample size of 50. okay so now we can see right this distribution when we took samples of size 50 it's going from the sample means are going from 10 all the way up to 30. here they're going between like 15 and 25 which makes some sense right because if you think about it if you take a bigger sample it's more likely to be representative of the population then if you take a small sample then you could have outliers that throw everything off the other thing that i won't demo here but that the other thing that can influence this the width of this thing is the amount of variation in the population so if the population has a lot of variation the width of this thing will be bigger and if the population has very little variation like let's say everybody's salary was around 20 instead of that spread out distribution that we saw before going all the way up to 140 then there's just going to be less variation in sample means by default right like if everybody was making 20 in the most extreme case then all of the sample means would be exactly 20. so however however much variation there is in the population will also influence this so what i'll show i think like a cool thing to see just to kind of verify it even is that and this is the the official central limit theorem that we're getting to now is that um we can basically describe exactly what this shape is going to look like mathematically without having done what we did here which is take all of these sample means i'm gonna plot this again but this time i'm going to i'm gonna grab some kind of this is again like a little bit i don't mean to just like pull fancy code and make everybody accept it um but i'll talk through what this is doing so on top of this histogram what i'm gonna do and i'm gonna normalize the histogram which means or actually i'm gonna switch to a disc plot um what i'm doing here is i'm i'm normalizing the histogram so here the histogram is going from 0 to 600 on the yaxis these are frequencies and if i were to say density equals true here or if i use disk plot and i'll demo that in a second all that does is it changes this yaxis so that the scale of this is such that the total area of this thing adds up to one um this is so that it mimics what's called a probability distribution function which you don't really need to know too much about right now but that allows us to compare this to kind of mathematical functions um and if we do dist plot here it does the exact same thing it also um puts what's called a oops oh yeah it doesn't take bins and also um oh it's sms bad it also gives you this kernel density estimation again not super important all you need to know is it's kind of like a smoothed version of this histogram so it's trying to like smooth out this uh this shape so if we do this um okay what i've done i'm gonna walk through what this code is doing or maybe jamie do you wanna walk through try to walk through what this code is doing i'm putting you on the spot a little bit yeah sure um let me just change some things okay okay so the where should i start from should i start from you and sigma or so i guess mu is just the population mean um i'll come back to this in a second so maybe start with this what is this lin space things so linspace mu minus three times sigma oh so i think linspace you're basically setting up like an interval range using mu and sigma um which i think sophie said she'll come back and explain what sigma is but basically it's going to set a range of values in a variable called x and then you're going to plot that range of values um and then what is stats.norm.p i think that's just like to like give a normal distribution with the given x and yeah give with the given range of values mu and sigma so i'll demo this part really fast actually i should have done just like 10 numbers um all that linspace does is it says okay start at 0 end at 1 and give me 10 numbers that are equally spaced so this just gives me 10 numbers between 0 and 1 that are equally spaced apart and all i'm doing here is i'm saying basically this is something that is not super important but this gives me a sense of how wide the xaxis of my distribution is going to be um basically i'm just saying like what's the lowest number i need to plot here what's the highest number i need to plot here in order to fit this on my graph and i'm getting a hundred numbers and then i'm going to get essentially the normal distribution version of this a normal distribution again is a probability distribution and all you need to know for right now is that it describes a particular shape of this distribution mathematically and so i'm plugging in all of those values that i just got between the two ends of that distribution calculating how high that line needs to be and i'm just using them to draw that line on top of my graph and when i do that oh it's because i did this again uh did i not save this sorry guys oh um sci pi import stats okay gonna run okay there we go so what you see here is i've drawn in black what's called the normal distribution on top of the distribution that we got just by taking samples of size 50 and plotting the um and collecting the means for each sample and what you see here is that it's basically the same thing so i've used like a mathematical formula to say what the shape can look should look like and then we've kind of proven what that shape actually looks like by taking the samples and what i've done here is i've drawn a normal distribution that has a mean that's equal to the population mean and a standard deviation that's equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size that's what this um double times sign means to 0.5 so taking something to the 0.5 power is the same as taking the square root of it so 50 times times 0.5 is the square root of 50 and then so this whole thing is standard deviation of the population divided by the square root of the sample size and we see it that if we take a normal distribution with those parameters again mathematical description of a curve it really perfectly matches up with what this this shape looks like and this piece the standard deviation of the population divided by the square root of the sample size this is what's called the standard error of the mean so um sophie uh you have a question from the chat which is asking which part of the like code you made was like the actual normal distribution was the actual normal distribution perfect i should have commented this out so this part here i'm just plotting the sample means this part here is where i'm plotting the normal distribution on top of it great awesome so yeah i think this i mean we're gonna run out of time for all the things i want to cover today but i do think like just taking a second to stop and look at this picture makes me just really happy it's really really beautiful because we've statisticians have like it seems like almost magically figured out these crazy formulas to describe things that seem i don't know hard to describe and um and it's really cool that that we can that we can quantify our uncertainty in this way okay so again coming back to the standard error piece so the standard error again is the standard deviation of this sampling distribution it's basically a measure of how wide is the sampling distribution and the sampling distribution again because i i feel like no matter how many times i i heard this when i was first learning it it like took maybe a hundred times of hearing this before it clicked in my brain um the sampling distribution we got from taking samples of the same size calculating the mean for each one and then plotting the distribution of the means the standard error is how is a description of how wide that distribution is okay all right so we've we've made it pretty far we've gotten some interesting things already out on the table now so we were in all powerful mode we made this distribution we saw what it looked like we proved to ourselves that the central limit theorem works um i don't even think i said what the central limit theorem is but we just proved it basically um without even using any math which is super cool the central limit theorem just says that this distribution is normal and that the mean normally distributed so it follows the shape the mean is the same as the population mean and the standard deviation is equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size that's the whole central limit theorem um you could do it with math or you could do it by actually taking all those samples and calculating the mean of each one okay so now let's go back for a moment to the perspective of the researcher so like all right back in researcher mode i should have put these in the final code would have been helpful uh okay so we're back in researcher mode and now we're not all powerful anymore we can't actually see what this distribution or we can't actually see the whole population so we can't take samples from the whole population and see what the distribution looks like but now that we have the central limit theorem we actually kind of can see what it looks like or we can approximate what it looks like so remember the things that we needed to plot that black line so to plot the blue histogram we needed to take samples from the full population but to get the black line all we needed to know was the mean of the population and the standard deviation of the population and the sample size other than that we didn't need any more information so we can approximate this if we have an estimate of the population mean and of the standard deviation of the population and we're going to get those things from our sample they're not going to be perfect we don't right we don't know what the population mean is anyway we're trying to estimate it um the sample standard deviation like i said it's going to be an unbiased estimator of the population mean if we calculate it with that n minus 1 on the denominator which we will but it's not going to be perfect we can still do it though so let's go back uh i'm again going to print the mean for our sample i think we still have a sample sample one somewhere in our or what did i call it let's see yeah we called it stamp one we still have a sample in here somewhere let's actually let's like calculate a new one oh that was a good one it was low okay okay so we have a sample let's calculate also the standard deviation of that sample and i'm going to save those things sample mean equals and populate or sorry sample standard deviation and we'll print them and we see okay so the the sample mean is equal to 16.33 the population or sorry the sample standard deviation was 13.21 um okay all powerful mode for a second let's remind ourselves of what these values r for the population so um print see v dot mean of population and also for standard deviation okay so what we notice here is that our sample that we took had less uh less variation than the population so the sample standard deviation was 13.2 the population standard deviation was 18.1 um so we're gonna under estimate the amount of variation in the sample the larger the sample we take the better of an approximation we're going to get here but we're going to work with it because it gives us at least some sense back to researcher mode so as the researcher we're now going to estimate what this distribution looks like so i'm actually going to grab this exact same code but now we're going to do this with the um we're going to do this with the sam just the information from the sample so we have our sample mean we have our sample standard deviation we're going to use a mu which is really just the mean of this normal distribution of the sample mean and we're going to use the sample standard deviation here and i believe that that sample had a was a size 150 but we'll just do one sample one that will tell us how many values are in there um or even i think even clearer is to say sample size equals that so we're really clear and then we'll put sample size in this equation and if we plot this we get this this curve um it's going gonna be i should maybe plot it on top of this so it's gonna be more s um or actually maybe less spread out than this it's going to be a little bit off from what it should be uh that's more off than i thought it would be or it's smaller oh oh oh it's because this was a sample size of 50. sorry ignore that uh let's redo this i guess with a sample size of 150. i know we're gonna run out of time but now this will right so this is our estimation of this is a little bit off pretty much because this this estimate was so off but what we can do is now use this distribution to try to estimate the plausible range of what values we might get if we could observe the entire population and take samples from it so the the reason why these two distributions are offset from each other is because this one we centered at the popul or the sample standard deviation this one we sent centered at the population standard sorry at the sample mean for this one at the population mean for this one so they they're off from that but the width of it is the part that we really care about and even though we were pretty far off on our sample standard deviation compared to the population standard deviation this the width of this distribution is pretty close to the width of what we would find if we were able to like be all powerful and see and take samples from everybody and so what we end up doing is we end up using this this distribution here to figure out or a plausible range that the population mean might be in and so we end up saying that the population mean is somewhere between like we think 12 and 20 or whatever like these points are and we can we can choose percentile so we could do like the second percentile and the 98th percentile to cut off kind of the tails of this but that's really all that a 95 confidence interval is and i can demo that super fast i know we're running out of time um but i also know that this is a super complicated uh a super super complicated process and like exp mind experiment so i think it's nice if we kind of stop here and get like three more minutes to talk about it a little bit so here we go all i'm doing here is i'm taking i'm trying to find like the 2.5th percentile and the 97.5th percentile of this black line um oops let's put stamp one here and i save this as standard error i saved it as sigma so this goes from roughly 14.22 to 18.45 and so if we were the researcher we would say our sample mean was 16.33 but we are 95 confident that the true population mean is somewhere between 14.2 and 18.45 which is accurate although it is really close to that upper bound which was you know a random fluke and that happens but this is the way that statisticians and data scientists use the central limit theorem to try to quantify their uncertainty about a sample mean without having been able to see the entire population cool so i'm gonna stop there we've got two minutes to spare jamie what do you think would be a good use of this time do you think there's anything that's worth like talking about i hadn't had a a good eye on the stream or on the chat were there any questions that came up i think we covered all the questions wait one thing i'm curious about what was the actual population mean because i'm wondering if it was actually within the 95 the population mean was 18.84 about 839. okay and so it was like just just barely yeah but it wasn't in that range we could kind of do this with another sample like if we i wish i organized my code better but uh it's organized better in the final version that is available on github but if i take another sample here let's find one that seems like similar to the population yeah that seems more similar to the population if we use a different sample where these things yeah so here this one we got a little bit closer in terms of standard error and pop and mean like our sample was more similar to the population and then that will give us a slightly yeah uh a confidence interval that makes that more comfortably includes the population mean um so again like the i think the thing that i had trouble conceptualizing for a really long time is that the central limit theorem tells us something about the shape of this black line but it can't really tell us we still have to make a leap there because we still don't know what the population standard deviation is we still have to estimate the population standard deviation using our sample and so it's not like totally magic that we can just recreate exactly this but we can get a pretty good read on at least how how much variation we can expect and i think that's that is the the true power um and i i encourage so there's um on codecademy there is a article on the central limit theorem that kind of walks through this again and so if you watch this series and you still feel a little confused or you still want to like go back and confirm your understanding i highly recommend that you read that article or look up on the internet central limit theorem and and read about it because i think this is one of those things it's like it's deceptively simple and also really deep and uh and i think even for me i learned it about like i said like a hundred times before i actually learned it so all right next week we're going to jump into actually using this central limit theorem to run some hypothesis tests and we're going to learn even more about how hypothesis tests work so i'm really excited for that um but otherwise uh thank you kevin for for that question kevin says i have a question why are there only so few people watching this is pure quality thank you i agree i well i don't know about quality but i'm having a lot of fun doing these and hopefully more people will find them after the fact but for those that are here you get the extra benefit of being able to ask questions and really speak with us personally so please take advantage all right with that i think we'll sign off everyone have a great rest of your tuesday and we hope that these are helpful goodbye
