hello my name is Stephanie I am a software developer based in Baltimore and today we're gonna go over what is user experience or more commonly known as UX UX is the part of design that is created to be meaningful and intuitive for users it adopts the users perspective and aims to answer the question how would a first time user approach this product it encompasses the part of the design from the search icon down to the animations that occur when a user makes a click there are many components to UX that will inform the design to enhance the users experience this is the user experience honeycomb developed by Peter morville Jesus UX hotshot and it pretty much lays down the foundation for good UX the honeycomb he developed identifies how each facet is important to answering the users needs given the product's technical limitations and capabilities while also driving business value it helps outline and build priorities for example in the first iteration should the product prioritize usefulness over usability have you ever used an application for the first time and you were able to navigate it without a guide you can thank good UX for that it can happen even when you don't even notice it it even starts as soon as you land on a website today a lot of websites have designed their loaders to be more user friendly so that the user feels engaged while the page is loading instead of feeling like they're wasting their time have you ever used something and thought why isn't it working and then for the next five minutes you get exponentially more and more frustrated as you wrestle with the application yeah that's probably bad UX it can overload the user with information as a result the user feels overwhelmed and skims over the information they're looking for bad UX can be particularly dangerous when it sends a confusing signal to the user and so the user ends up performing a permanent action they didn't want to perform one common misconception is to equate good visuals to good UX well it can be true that if you have a pretty design it can cover up some of the applications shortcomings but that doesn't necessarily mean that the user will walk away getting the MOE value out of the product like in the example menu here it is unique and pretty to see but it can be a bit confusing to others are the only options available what you see on the menu or are there more on the other half and how would you get to the other side do you have to swipe horizontally or in a curved pattern so there are a lot of questions that can't be immediately answered until the user experiments around so now you might be thinking okay if someone can pick this up instantly and know how to use it then we've got good UX but a particular design choice might not work in every case take these two types of menus you could argue that the hamburger menu is a better choice because it simplifies what the user sees but there are times when you can oversimplified the design and forcing the user to make more than one click can disincentivize them from using the menu actually there are many apps out there that initially employ the hamburger menu and then switch to the visible navigation believe it or not but their users ended up using the navigation feature when it was visible instead of hamburger style a large part of UX is knowing and understanding your users so in order to get good UX you're gonna want to go through several iterations of designing then getting user feedback then redesigning then getting more user feedback and so on and so UX determines how UI is implemented and together they drive frontend development for more information on UI or frontend development you can click on one of the links below and while you're down there you might as well just drop a comment or subscribe to this channel and you can even start learning on code Kadim e today thank you so much for watching bye
