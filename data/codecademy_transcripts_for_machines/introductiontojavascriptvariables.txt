in this video I'd like to talk about JavaScript as a programming language now the word script is part of JavaScript and you might think that it does not function like a regular programming language well it does function like a regular programming language in fact we've got variables that we can use there are functions and of course we have all of the various programming constructs so variables can be declared and initialized functions are considered to be first class functions in JavaScript I'll explain that in a moment and of course we have all of the various constructs of programming languages like sequencing decision making that's where we use the if then structure and we have iteration that's where we can Loop through or Loop over a collection of data now I did say that functions are first class citizens and what that means is that we can assign a function to a variable also we can return a function from another function so in this way functions in JavaScript are considered first class functions let's talk a little bit more about variables so variables in JavaScript work like variables and any other function and any other programming language variables are used to store values that's it also JavaScript natively supports three basic types now you may think that because it supports three basic types it's not a fullfledged programming language but there are variations on these so the basic ones are of course numeric string where we use double quotation marks and objects then we have constant variables now the constant variable type was not supported initially but now recently with the last version of ecmascript so version 6 they did introduce the const variable type so now we have a constant variable type that we can use meaning that once we've declared a const then the value that's inside of that variable cannot change during the running of the program literals work just like any other programming language they are either numbers strings characters of course strings are inside of Double quotation marks and just like any other programming language literals are used but they're not assigned to any variable as such let's take a look now at a short program in JavaScript and starting at line one we see that we can declare a variable all this means is that somewhere in memory an address will be picked and that address will have a label of X in it later on on line number two we can assign a value to that location so in this case on line 1 we declare X on line two we initialize it with the value of 5. on the third line we've initialized or we've declared and initialized a variable a string variable and then we will initialize it to the value of John then further down on line number four we've declared another variable and initialize it with a different word now you notice that there are two types of declarations here VAR and let and the difference has to do with scope we will talk more about it when we get into the demos so the vars are considered to be globally scoped whereas the lats are considered to be scoped within the curly braces and here on line five we see the cons that I previously mentioned in this case here days of the week will be initialized with a value of 7 and it is not supposed to change during the running of the program so JavaScript may not have all of the Power of a programming language like Java or csharp but it does have all of the features of a regular programming language and as JavaScript developers this is all we really need to get our jobs done
