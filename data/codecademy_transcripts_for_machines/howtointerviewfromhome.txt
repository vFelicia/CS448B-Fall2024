today I'm loving the chat I'm loving aim to see everyone through the chat that is incredibly exciting hi everyone well I see a hi Randall hello Randall okay so I've got you for 10 minutes I really just want to tell you a little about myself and about code Academy and then a little about what you're gonna be hearing today and the people that you're gonna be hearing from really are our focus today is on three things how to search for a job how to interview for a job and how to start a new job and they're all things that we've we've put a lot of thought into we thought felt pretty deeply about all of them both before coronavirus hit and then now afterward and in this whole new remote situation is just it's it's a new world and it's it's kind of incredible that we've only been in this new world for a month and a half or a month or so now because it feels like we've been doing this for a while it feels like we've we've been doing this a number of times we've hired a number of people through it we've interviewed I don't know well over a hundred I don't know hundreds of people through this right now my background so I went to school for education and it was always adult education for me I care deeply about education in all different forms who was always adults that I cared about and so I I first started working as a coordinator literally setting up chairs for classes and taking registration and making sure everyone had a notebook those sorts of things and just every job I was at just try to make sure that I was learning everything I possibly could at that job and you know growing and growing in terms of skill set and knowledge and experiences and I've been at this now especially in the startup world for over ten years I've been at it all together for 15 years in the startup world for 10 I was with what was a startup at the time JetBlue and got to be with them through some really rough spots in the beginning and just trying to figure out how do we turn this into a real company I was with a Montessori education company for a while try figure out how to make that a real company and I've been with codecademy now for I I guess about half a year I was at first a customer I wanted to learn about I want to learn JavaScript because I wanted to build a slack app and I just kind of fell in love with the product and said this is everything that I had hoped I would be possible in the world I mean the idea of educating not just the person in front of you but millions and we have millions of people who use our product hundred thousand we just hit that milestone recently who are part of our subscription Pro product which by the way we are giving giving out a number of those for free right now for people who have our kind of worst financial situation right now so you can get scaled up in in what I think are the most important skills for has been the most important skills in the economy that I think will continue to be our mission at code Academy is to help people build something meaningful I cared about that before coronavirus hit I care twice as much about that now because the world on pause right now and there is so much to build and all of us need to be builders and we all need to be making things and in trying to rebuild this world that we've put on pause and I'm openly stealing from a blog post by Marc Andreessen who's a famed enter capitalist if you get a chance read that he says things better than I ever could but we need to be building and our Java code Academy is to help teach the builders and that is a wonderful thing to get to be a part of and we our reach is incredible but there's literally only a hundred people as if they there are a hundred people working at code Academy that's it to have that kind of reach and the way you do that is by having the right people and being very very thoughtful about making sure you have the right people interviewing this whole job search thing it's very stressful I know very very stressful for you I've been there I've gone through all that it's also stressful for us because we need to make sure that we're finding all the right people because every every person that's here can help make or break the company and help make or break our mission and our mission is very very important to us so the people you're gonna be hearing from are what I I mean some of the best I have gotten to work with in my career people who have worked at a number of different startups that are very very good at finding the best talent they have a lot to say about how to find a job how to interview for a job and put your best foot forward and then how to start a job how to onboard I it's my belief that a job is made or broken in the first 90 days and you're gonna hear a lot about that as well I think all that's very important in Corona and all this was hard before coronavirus started happening and coronavirus and this whole workfromhome thing makes everything a little bit harder it's all very doable I mean I've Airy much believe that and I been very pleasantly surprised at exactly how doable all this has ended up being and I want to tell you one story and then I'll get out of the way man a man named Andy Stern era it was March 3rd and I know it's hard to go back in time here but March 3rd everyone knew about coronavirus it was starting to happen there were a couple of hot spots around the world there were a couple of cases in California but as far as we were concerned hadn't really hit the US it was in Japan it was in China was in South Korea I think it was in Italy bound to get may realize exactly how bad it was yet and Andy was flying in from Japan to come talk to us to come interview for a role that was the sole reason that he decided to come to us and he was in a hotel we're in Soho New York City in New York City he was in his hotel and office for making huh that's interesting we have somebody who came from a hot spot who's going to be coming into our office to meet with all of us and eat lunch with all of us is this a good idea and we like him he seems really interesting but how do we actually get to know him how do we do things like he was he was interviewing for an engineering role and there are things like having a whiteboard session for a you know you need a whiteboard session to work through your coding interviews how do we do that if he doesn't come in and it was a point where we're still all trying to figure out is this serious as this not serious how worried do we have to be and what we ultimately and it really was just all of us all the people that you're gonna be talking to today sitting around a table trying to think through every single aspect of it and trying to figure out what do we do and ultimately what we did and it was awkward and it was strange but we got a breather space for him that we which is a conference room that we rented out for the day for him to sit and we did everything over zoom and I remember and we put a lot of thought into okay we always try to get a sense of who somebody is so how do we get a sense of how do we target our questions just a little bit more to make sure that we really understand who he is and that whiteboarding well let's just really test that out can you see a white board through the camera should we be using an iPad and the and and work from that can you use a piece of paper we have to think all that through we had to figure all that out to get a sense of somebody and how do we give them a sense of our culture and how do we give them a sense of who worked here and whether or not he's actually going to enjoy being here because that's really important if you don't enjoy being at a company you're not gonna do great work so we want to make sure that you are gonna really like being here we end up doing things like I remember picking up the computer and walking him around the entire office on his zum just to meet every maybe 3040 people at the time and then he was completely down for it he thought it was strange but he was into it and he was resilient and he persevered through all of it and we ended up really getting a good sense of him and liking him and we hired it it was the first person we deal with here and he we need to hire him and he started midapril and then you have to get into the author questions of so and by this point we were all actually working from home but we had to get into the the issues of so how do we give him a great experience I mean we're a very tightknit group so how do you make sure that he knows everyone really well and he has relationships with everyone because everything's about the relationships you have and how do we make sure that he knows everything that he needs to know to be really successful his job and all that we had to think through as well if you look at the inside of Carrie and Maria's apartments right now they're just filled with swag that we're shipping to all the new people we have and computers trying to figure out all that and and how do you create those relationships one on one so that's gonna give you a bit of a taste that I could keep talking about Andy forever I'm so happy he's here and I'm so happy to go through that process but we can tell you a little about what that's like on our side but also based on that what you should know in order to stand out to people like us to recruiters people are trying to figure out whether or not you make sense whether or not you have the skills and whether not you make sense for that that company I want to leave with one bit of advice because I can know that the people that you were going to be speaking with are going to give you a lot of advice and if you are like a lot of our learners you're probably only sitting there with a pencil and paper or just trying to take notes on absolutely everything and I completely applaud I think that's great the major advice would have for you is instead of trying to vacuum up everything I think them find three things three piece of advice in here that are really really impactful for you that really really matter out of those three just commit to one make sure that you do exactly at least one thing because I want to make sure that this is really productive for you and think about yourself is mining for gold through the rest this morning because again we're gonna give you a lot and I want to make sure this is really useful for you now I'm gonna check in with you again at in a couple of hours so I'm gonna be part of a Q&A later on and at that point I want to know from you what is that one thing that you're all going to be doing what's the one thing you're taking away so I think that's it I think I'm also out of time so Alisa once you take it away tell us a little more about what we have in store today I'm very happy thank you so much Randall for this we'll talk to you soon all right everybody it is time for me to share my screen and give everybody a heads up on what else we can expect for the day and we are present really great so again today is the second event in our and Coke ad amis learn from home series we're calling today interviewing from home we just heard from Randall vector our VP of people and we will see him again later today so today's agenda you already heard from me we had that great kickoff from Randall next up we'll be preparing to find a job online with Madison and mia biscaia these two are technical recruiters and before I share too much I will hand it over to them to explain who they are what they do and to share the best of what they have for you thank you very much oh and here they are hi Madison I'm iya I'm so excited it's all yours now talk to you later you hello everyone so we are going to be preparing to find a job online right now Madison I think we need your mic on alright hi everybody sorry about that so we'll go ahead and get started um my name is Madison Olson I'm a senior technical recruiter here at code Academy prior to economy I worked in both recruiting and people ops across companies and tech media and advertising spaces so my day today typically consists of essentially trying to get people excited to work at code Khadem ii and i focus on hiring primarily for the data science design engineering marketing and product teams and i am Mia biscaia I'm a technical recruiter here I actually just started right before the stay at home orders came into play so I'm relatively new here at code Academy prior to this I worked as a coordinator and I worked both in house and on the agency side of recruiting I deal with sourcing and building out the top funnel here for most departments from engineering and product to design and marketing so a little bit about what we'll cover during our session we'll go over preparing your profile resume LinkedIn and so forth where and how to look for jobs and preparing for future interview processes and then we'll do a little Q&A at the end so things to consider prior to starting your job search or application process ease things we would recommend doing preparing your resume of course this seems kind of like a given of course but it might seem relatively straightforward but you know keeping these things in mind prior to starting your search or as you start at applying for jobs will definitely be beneficial so although you know most applications and application tracking systems do collect your name and contact info it's still very important to make sure this is very clearly highlighted on your resume obviously you would like to incorporate your work experience so just thinking about what you've done and highlighting experience that shows why you are potentially a great fit for the roles that you're applying or you might want to include your education as well optional sections if you have room you might want to include a section for skills you might want to consider adding a section to talk a little bit more pointedly about you know skills you've developed throughout your experience and highlight why you might be a great fit for this role or how certain skills you've developed would be beneficial and a new opportunity additionally my 1 consider adding volunteer experience so if this is something you have room for feel free to throw it on there especially if it highlights and kind of you know the work that you're doing outside of just your job position and then you know feel free to add any awards as well considerations when preparing your resume so just a few considerations to keep in mind as you drum it up length one recommendation that we have is to try to stick to one page for the most part you should not need to expand to two or more pages it's very easy to do because there's so much that you've done you know throughout the course of your existence obviously so we definitely want to keep in mind that you someone who's looking at your resume might not get to the second page or might not scroll all the way down so they might miss something super important that they'll want to know so we definitely recommend sticking to one page when possible also consider the font that you're using you don't want to go too small or use a font that's too difficult to read you know if people are kind of squinting at the screen or squinting at a piece of paper to you know read what's on your resume they might miss a few things design and format also so you know we come across a lot of different resumes and you know unique the resumes can also be great however you know you don't want to you know go to too you don't want your design to be illegible you don't want to expense you know readability for you know a creative or unique looking resume and then finally your education you know something you might want to consider is where to place this on your resume if you are a new grad for instance you might want to consider putting more towards the top of your may before your work experience however if you are a little bit more the senior side or have many years of work experience we would probably recommend putting that further down on your resume and then additionally preparing your LinkedIn so this is a really good kind of supplement to your resume it's something that I know a lot of recruiters or hiring managers might go to you know in addition to looking at your resume a lot of companies might utilize this sort of in place of your resume as well so we definitely recommend ensuring that your LinkedIn info is uptodate prior to applying to new positions so that way once you start applying if people are going to your LinkedIn it's already prepared a photo so in the age of social media profile photos are always a very hot topic of course feel free to add a photo you know sort of at your leisure however if you're not comfortable putting up a photo you shouldn't have to I'm having a photo should not affect your candidacy so I wouldn't say that this is a mustdo it's just something that you know you might want to consider in addition to that you might want to add a quick summary about yourself think about like what do people want to know about you and what you want them to know about you what are you looking for having a quick summary at the top of your LinkedIn you can always come in handy and then in addition to that experience this is a great place for you to expand on your experience so if there's stuff that you couldn't fit on one page of your resume that you would still like to highlight definitely feel free to add it here you can add you know as many bullet points as you want and so you can continue to expand on your awesome experience on your LinkedIn and then there are additional sections that you can add on LinkedIn so another great place to add things that you might not have been able to cover on your resume like such as volunteer experience LinkedIn offer also offers you a section around skills and endorsements so definitely don't hesitate to ask like your friends or colleagues to endorse you for skills that are going to be beneficial in your next role and then in addition to that ask previous colleagues for recommendations if you feel comfortable you know I think I look at these personally other people do as well so these are great just kind of supplements to show you know why you might be a great fit for your next role where and how to look so we're going to be covering different places that you can look and the best means to do so so there are a lot of general jobs pages that you can look at for varying interests industries it's great to go directly to a companies dedicated careers page sometimes companies won't post certain jobs on external boards if there's a funny that you have in mind that you're extremely passionate about go directly to their site LinkedIn is also really helpful as well there are hundreds and thousands of postings on LinkedIn typically companies will keep these postings updated as they tend to get a lot of traffic you can see when they were posted how many people have viewed the postings and how many people have applied so that's really helpful as well in your job search Glassdoor is also great for job postings a lot of applicant tracking systems will cross post a glass door so anytime that a post is made live on their company page it will also be made live on glass door glass door is helpful in getting a little bit more insight as well into a company and seeing if it's the right fit for you they offer employee inform employee feedback on worklife balance and benefits just to name a few things and you can also look into salary expectations and reviews of previous interviews for various positions that that have been conducted and that you may be considering indeed a similar a glass door but covers a lot more industries as well there are tons of job postings on indeed that for varying backgrounds and skill sets to angellist is a little less known it's specific for earlystage startups so if you're really interested in getting into a company at the ground level Angeles is a great place to check out you can see how many rounds of funding have been raised people at the company and the mission of the team there are also a variety of industry specific job websites and job boards dribbble offers jobs in the design industry behance also veers to the more creative job types and github and Stack Overflow are great for engineers and product managers how to look so you should set up a time every day to check for new job postings be it the morning in the afternoon the evening it's best to have a specific time that you can set up every day also it's really great to keep a list of companies and positions that you've applied to who you've heard back from interview confirmations and any notes you want to track when you applied if you've heard back maybe any notes from like the company if they emailed you back if you've spoken on the phone with them or a recruiter or hiring manager take notes make a list of that it's great to not apply to the same jobs over and over again just reach out to the people that you're you're interested in and keep a spreadsheet it's really great that way LinkedIn connections you can reach out to your connections that might be open to making an intro to anyone that maybe you have in common it's a great way to get a referral and also consider reaching out to previous colleagues or friends who work at companies that you're interested in it's also a great way to get your foot in the door great and now we'll talk a little bit about preparing for future interview processes and just kind of getting yourself prepped for any potential conversations that might be coming your way so just a couple quick tips before we wrap up so before you go into an interview process or if you're just trying to prep yourself for future conversations one recommendation would be to prepare to kind of deep dive into your experience you know you can do this kind of by yourself you know going through your experience through your resume being prepared to speak to your experience and thinking about what you accomplished in previous roles like being prepared to discuss projects what was your role in that project what resources did you have how did the project or work have an impact you know who did you work with in the project and just be prepared to speak to your work style maybe a little bit about how you have given or received feedback in the past how you handled a situation when something went wrong and maybe what you learned from it thinking about all those questions in regards to your experience I think can be super helpful as you move into any conversations with recruiters hiring managers and future team members a lot of different interviews might cover things like this and so it's just helpful to be able to you know speak well to those different experiences that you've had and then one other thing you can consider as well is a lot of companies have different values associated with them as far as you know what defines them their culture and so forth and how they work and it might be useful for you to think about how that relates to you your experience as well to kind of speak to that a little bit in addition to that being prepared to speak to any gaps in employment I think gaps in employment definitely do not scare off potential employers the way they might have in the past you know the only you know gaps happen whether they're voluntary or involuntary so I think the biggest thing to look for is just to you know to be able to speak to what you did with that time you know what you learned and so forth and just being prepared you know to discuss why you're ready for the next opportunity it's also great to reconnect with your references if you have any doubt that a reference might not give you a good reference maybe you don't use them it's better to be safe than sorry in these situations you should always use someone that can speak to your daytoday work and that you've worked directly with they should be able to speak a lot to your work ethic and specific projects that you've executed references are typically more about how to set the candidate up for success and their potential new role and that's what the hiring manager or the recruiter is trying to delve into when they reach out to those references you'll want someone that'll be able to speak to that and shed great light on it and then one other recommendation is just to you know as you continue to move forward in your job search you know try to continuously expand your contacts you know you can connect with people in many different ways obviously through LinkedIn and other social resources but you know definitely don't hesitate to reach out to people that you've mutual contacts with unlinked and kind of like we mentioned earlier you know attend any meetups that might be in an industry that you're interested in I know we're in a virtual world right now but they're definitely still those virtual meetups happening as well even virtual networking happy hours for instance so definitely things to consider it's definitely helpful just to expand sort of your network within the industries that you're interested in and a lot of times there are different panel discussions going on that might be interesting to you as well and this can also be another opportunity to find job opportunities that you might not have how to access to you before or that might not be widely posted online all right so I think that kind of wraps up our presentation portion so I guess now we will move on to QA and I'm super excited that we've got a good number of questions coming in from a lot of people so thank you all of you for sharing your questions in the Q&A box while I'm looking for a few to serve up right now I just want to share a reminder to everybody that if we are if you're typing your questions please do type them into the Q&A box we see you chatting in the chat and it's not easy to answer your questions from there so thank you so much for putting them in the Q&A box another reminder I we also see that your hands are raised for this event we won't be able to respond to and raise hands even though we would really really like to but again please do ask your questions in the question and answer box okay so to get us started oh yeah there we are a little bit bigger I saw a question come in from you and the question was how do we feel about templates on a resume are they good are they bad should we use a template should you design your own I don't know what got me a DUI but yeah I think templates um definitely an okay way to go they are look very clean you just put all of your information right into it I've seen the same template used over and over again and it doesn't really jar me away from a resume so I don't think that it's a bad thing to use a template personally yeah I would I would agree as well I think you can definitely be beneficial don't hesitate to stray away from a template but I think it's an absolutely great starting point as well if you want to work from that and then just yeah if you have questions on how to format your resume it's really great to use a template wonderful so there was also a question about LinkedIn it's from see me Evan I understand that LinkedIn can enhance our chances but is it really more helpful than a resume so I think this question is like comparing and contrasting what is more crucial in the job search right though assets as an outbound sorcerer like I am reaching out to people that I mostly find on LinkedIn so if I if I'm reaching out to someone who hasn't directly to me then I usually will find their LinkedIn page to kind of look at their work history so if you are on the job market and you are looking for a job I would say that it is definitely beneficial to have a LinkedIn if it doesn't get too descriptive that's fine if you have a resume that you've also submitted to a company that's great too but some sort of LinkedIn I think is really helpful yeah I would I would definitely second that as well I think it's a great you know sort of supplement or additional resource as well and as Mia mentioned super critical to making yourself more discoverable as a potential candidate because there might be jobs out there that you might not have discovered for whatever reason and recruiters are going to be recruiters but hiring managers are going to be utilizing LinkedIn to try and discover potentially great candidates so it's definitely helpful if you have the ability to create a little bit of a presence on LinkedIn wonderful thank you so I'm seeing a few people and I'd like to be able to say and like okay missus questions coming in from Rosie so those questions coming in from Simula but I'm seeing a few of you asked what do we do when we don't have experience for the resume what would you suggest for somebody this is really their first job and actually this ties into another question perhaps about where do we put education on our resumes so if you don't have if you don't have any previous like direct work experience or if you have an internship definitely put the internship down or if you've worked on like projects like technical projects or some sort of thesis for for school that could be the top the top section of your your resume underneath education I would definitely put projects underneath education if you don't have any relevant work experience and then you can expand upon your skills below that to up see thank you sorry I'm Addison did you have something that you would attack no no I would definitely agree I think triage can mine you know what you've learned throughout your education projects you've worked on things like that are definitely great to highlight to be very beneficial for the job search wonderful just a quick reminder to everybody who I see in the chat please do ask your questions in the Q&A box we see them coming through chat and I really want to get them as many as we can answer it so please do place them in the Q&A chat I appreciate it so much and I know that our panelists appreciate it because that's where we can see them all to thank you we have another question coming from Courtney Keller and feel free to pass on this team if you need to and that question is I do both web dev and design do you recommend two different resumes I find that nearly all my contract work uses both of those sets of skills but not always sure how to market yourself Thanks overall I think you should be in a sense should be able to use one resume consistently so I think highlighting both is great however you know depending on what job you're ideally looking for you might want to highlight a certain set of skills maybe a little bit more than others however I know you know and most of my searches or with hiring managers I've worked for in the past they definitely love to know you know sort of your comprehensive skill set and if you have if you even if you were looking for more of a web development job as opposed to design for the time being if you wanted to focus on that more highlighting those design skills is also going to be a huge add as well so I think you know being able to highlight that comprehensively still going to benefit you but I would say you know I would maybe tailor your resume a little bit more towards what opportunity you might be looking for and if that is a comprehensive you know kind of a mixture of both design and development then you should highlight both and again you can always utilize you know LinkedIn or your portfolio or whatever that might be just highlight you know all of your skills or continue to expand on all of those things as well thank you I'm gonna read ten meals question because this is one that I've actually had um in my life before PDF or word I like PDF I place a PDF and Doc's you there can be depending on the application like tracking system or how you upload it or you know depending on the computer that someone might be using I think it can get a little mistranslated at time when you upload in word for the applicant tracking system that we use it comes up just in courrier font and it's like a very like very messed up document so I would definitely recommend PDF thank you I have not seen this question comes through yet through this Q&A but as a rumor I'm working as the community manager could ketamine so this is a question that I do see come up pretty often like in our community spaces can you Mia or Madison can you speak more to that system that changes up the resumes can you explain that a little bit more Oh applicant tracking system asti's sure so an applicant tracking system or an ATS we use a system called green house there's a bunch of them out there for recruiters to use it basically just when you apply to a job or when your resume is uploaded by the recruiter internally it creates a profile for you and it's our way to track your your candidacy within the company so if you've had if you've had an interview we can put it what stage you're at and we can put some feedback in there and then it helps us like track you along the way so you don't get lost great thank you for that so this is just a plug for the the next the next session that we have we will have a session after this on best practices for interviewing online so get ready for that we do still have about six seven minutes left for Q&A here though so we're gonna pace ourselves I see so many questions right now coming in and I super appreciate them just want to give a headsup to everybody if your question is not answered for for Madison to Mia you can always visit the Koch Adam II forums we have a space actually where we can keep this conversation going that's discuss codecademy comm so we can keep talking there in case we don't get to everybody's questions right now so I saw earlier a question come in sorry Lenny I like this one very much so maybe this is something that you can ask from you know Thomas Chang asked what tool would you use would you suggest to a job searcher to use for tracking everything that tracking other applications have you ever seen a good system that you like yeah I think you know it is very much up to the user as far as what they like you know there are always there are so many different tools out there and so it definitely can be hard to choose of course I think you could utilize anything from a sort of basic like Excel or Google sheet I think I saw that in recommended with Trello Trello totally works as well again I think you know any of these things could could do this well so I think finding a workflow that works well for you it's what's most important what you think you'll actually go to more like are you more apt to go into Google to utilize a Google sheet or you might have to check your app Trello or whether that's an error table or I think they're kind of almost an endless amount of sort of organizational tools that you might be able to use but definitely recommending something where it's pretty easy for you to edit or move things to different categories or stages or to add notes something that makes that easy to do especially if you think about after you've had a call with an initial call with a company for example a place that's you know something that's easy for you to go into and add a couple notes or you know something that's not too difficult for you to update and edit and track it's definitely going to be important but I think it's totally up to you as far as what's gonna work well for you okay oh thank you we're all at home right now just show us in the chat how many of you are at home with a dog or a pet or a family member right now um there's probably a lot of us you are gonna hear my dog back that's good that's gonna be part of today thank you so much for understanding um okay I really appreciate this question how to add sub medical experience on your resume travel listener yeah yep yeah I'm not sure what your attica like traveling took a break travel people people will most likely understand I think it's better to put something rather than just leave like if it's like six months to a year or even if it's three months just put like sabbatical and Paris or like traveled Europe something like that yeah just add it however you feel comfortable putting it yeah I would agree I think I do personally anyways prefer to see you know something highlighted at you know as a sabbatical experience or time off or whatever that might have been I know there used to be a few different LinkedIn pages that would highlight you know time off whether that was for a sabbatical or parental leave or whatever that might have looked like because most likely you were doing something pretty amazing you know during your time off your sabbatical parental leave whatever that might have been and there are definitely interesting things that you're gonna be able to highlight that will totally benefit you you know moving forward in your job search as well so definitely don't shy away from I think highlighting that a little bit rather than leaving a hiring manager or recruiter wondering like hmm there is a gap there wondering what was going on yeah I think it's nice to mention something if you feel comfortable if you don't and that's fine too you know you have other amazing experience that will you know you'll be able to speak to as well wonderful thank you so much and thanks everybody for telling us who you have it with you that was actually a nice little moment of joy as well somebody has five dogs of you you are you are among the best okay I saw a few questions come in about actually how to start a relationship with recruiters and headhunters if you're new to the job market so outside agencies so is that you're looking to get into a relationship with a headhunter an outside agency they're more than willing to speak with you most likely if you have any sort of relevant experience they will jump at the opportunity to speak with you and to get you in their pipeline to get a relationship with a internal recruiter I would say reach out to them or maybe a contact that you know the company apply the best way is to apply to the position through the job posting I'm constantly going through the inbound application so your your job application will get seen yeah I think those are the best ways Madison anything else dad yeah no I definitely would recommend as Mia said with thirdparty agencies I would echo that as far as tape to reach out to them apply to their postings going to their you know agency website applying to postings there they'll be you know more than keen to reach out to you I think and then as far as internal recruiters you know something I've seen that has been effective is people will reach out to folks on the team if they can search for them on LinkedIn on the team that they're interested in joining and then they'll see if they're interested in having a chat or just chatting via message and more often than not I think our team members are forwarding and highlighting those resumes to us so you know don't hesitate to give that a try and the most like polite and professional way that you can obviously not everyone is going to have time to respond but most of the time people will forward things long and if they do have time they're usually more than you know willing to speak with you or chat with you a little bit whether that's online or on a call or whatever that might look like so it doesn't definitely isn't hurt to do a sort of like gentle reach out on LinkedIn that way but it is something that has totally worked and we've gotten people into process that way as well from someone reaching up someone on the team oh yeah thank you so much okay we have like less than 60 seconds left with you both before Jeff and Emma come on for best practices for interviewing online so in this limited time that we have is there anything that came up for you that you weren't able to share that you'd like to share with everyone today I would say I know that a lot I saw in the chat a lot of people were worried about applying to jobs right now I'd say still apply to jobs that are open if there are any if there is anything out there there are still companies that are hiring I know that a lot of people are scared right now about finding a new job but I mean hopefully things will get better in the future so I'd say still still put yourself out there and apply absolutely yes definitely like you no trying as best you can to not get yourself down about you know applying I think you know as me I said it's you know it can be a little arduous and it can be a little cumbersome as well to do it but I definitely don't hesitate everyone is you know people who are hiring are more than excited to you know look at all of your applications and try to get in contact with you as well so definitely don't get down yay okay we will not so Mia Madison where's we're still working together

Emma and Jeff for best practices on interviewing online thank you guys thanks Lisa I will share my screen first of all thank you everybody for coming this segment is about best practices for interviewing online before we get into some of the introductions between myself and Emma I would like to address one quick question that came up before about that I saw in the chat about cover letters I think it's an important topic yes yes yes on cover letters start with a great topic sentence tell the company why you want to work there make it personal recruiters read these teams read these so you know yes for me on cover letters and that also goes for optional questions I no companies a lot of doing optional questions on the actual a balloon take some time go full so let's get to the project this is best practice for interviewing online are all going through this many of the time we'll get to all those two things i'm jeff director town code at me before this I worked for a large Bini so work for a recruiting agency for about thirteen years so I've worked with clients of different sizes in many different recruiting processes and fittings and philosophies I've been here for about six months and absolutely loving it I think we have a team of experts as you've already seen in Mia and and has a lot of things to share let me turn it over to you haven't you want to do an introduction for sure um say I'm a senior technical recruiter I'm the talent team here I on a day to day basis focus on engineering roles curriculum roles sales roles and customer support roles I think right now um so basically a broad spectrum of the company in addition to just technical roles and as far as my background goes I've been at code Academy for almost two years now and previously worked in agency recruiting so I focused on working on tech roles in New York City with basically mostly startup and media companies fantastic Emma your wealth of knowledge for code Academy if anybody has questions please put them in the chat if you're interested to know more about recruiting or all things code Academy our agenda for today we're gonna run through what a typical interview process looks like you know how you can think about ways in which you'll describe your experience to various people along the way and what to expect and who you're going to talk to we're gonna talk about preparing for your interview you know the things that go into ooh what will show that you have prepared yourself and we'll talk a little bit about adjusting online interviews of course very relevant for today you know this again is something that we're gonna focus on a lot and then we're just going to give sort of one overview opinion about using the star method to answer behavioural questions you know this is something where there are many different ideas philosophies that are that are roughly the same but this will give you an easy way to remember and go forward about this and then how to follow up so here we go Emma do you want to take it away for the typical interview process for sure um so just to start off we wanted to to talk through what a typical interview process will look like I think it's it's great to know what you're in for when you get into process with the company and and just to kind of highlight we put it at the bottom but this is an example of what a lot of companies will use it's always encouraged to ask the recruiting team at the company you're interviewing with what kind of process they run remember that the recruiter that you're working with is it is a great resource for you for questions that you have in the process and really wants you to succeed in the process and so you have a lot of mutual interests so starting off in the in the interview process is application review candidates are coming to the company in some way whether that be a referral applying online applying through some kind of paid platform or job board and someone's looking at that resume so for us it often is Mia who you guys talked with earlier but it may be another recruiter on the team as well then there's a recruiter phone screen so typically at codecademy this is often done by myself or Madison or Jeff and this is really about the candidates background about what they're looking for there may be some like basic eligibility questions involved as well after that there's often a call with a hiring manager for the role and on we a hiring manager we're talking about the person who will be making the final decision for this role and that's also the person who would eventually be the boss of the person we're bringing in so the the decision maker and the person who would be managing then there's some kind of an assessment stage for technical roles this may be some kind of coding screen or take home assessment for other roles it may be a presentation of some kind or some kind of data analysis there's really a broad range but there's always some kind of writing sample or something involved then we do a final interview previously this was done onsite and it was a great way for the candidate to see what the office looks like get a feel for what it would be like to work with the team and all that unfortunately right now we're running these over over zoom so we're have like five hours in calls with candidates in which different members of the team will pop in and out we shine scheduled breaks to make sure that people have a chance to like grab water grab food that kind of stuff so we we had to really quickly adapt to there and then we do reference checks typically for us that often looks like a past manager or a past peer but I think it can vary depending on the company and me I gave some great tips earlier about picking your references and then from there we make an offer fantastic again I want to +1 to Emma saying that you know this is a typical process this is not going to be the same across the board you know some companies may not do an assessment or some companies you know will have to onsite interviews some companies will do a reference check and you know it can be a character review if you haven't had a previous manager it may be a professor or you know a a relative of some kind so so it is important that you you know are aware that these are all can be a part of the process and making sure that before you begin your job search you have some of these people or places ready to go the really the worst thing you can do is sort of slow down the process that the reason is is that you want to make sure that it is as seamless for you as it is for the company so let's dive into preparing for the interview I will run through a couple of the dudes you'll hear from at mahanakhon Cola the don'ts we find that it's very very very important that candidates know the company before the interview this is for many different reasons you could use your imagination but to us the most important one is that you're showing that you're interested in working for this company that you didn't apply blindly you know that there is some significant reason that you are driven to this specific company whether it's the mission whether it's the industry you know whether it is you know if you're an avid skier and you want to work for a ski company like k2 or if you're a hiker and you want to work for Patagonia you know or if you're a coder and you want to or an educator want to work for Codecademy those types of things a lot of what's posted on companies careers pages you will find valuable for your interviews especially because most of the time they're built by the talent teams and they the talent teams and recruiting teams and HR teams are trying to do their best to highlight all of the information that candidates would find interesting about the company little known facts company values is a really important one you know these are way or these are avenues places for you to highlight your interest in the company but also find questions I you know the old saying is come prepared with a couple of questions to the interview and the more specific you can get the more in depth of an answer you will receive you'll get a much more robust picture of the company you know so that you can better prepare yourself for making a decision down the line also important reread the job description you know these are questions that recruiters or hiring teams will will be the foundation for the questions you'll get so the better you know the job description you know the better you'll be prepared for answering those types of shit's another really important one everybody you need to know your resume you need to know your experience I purposely what I was making my introduction said that I worked at an agency for OS a number of years stumbled over that the real answer is I work for 12 and a half years at an agency and the difference between telling somebody that I worked at an agency for 12 and a half years or have to think about it you know shows that I'm prepared it's really important that you know your experience reread your resume also another nice thing I think is to research your interviewers you know you should be getting a list of the people that you will meet with during your interview go online go on LinkedIn find something in their profile that you can identify with and talk about I think building personal connections now more than ever especially with things on zoom' is really really important you know it shows again that you have prepared yourself that you're interested in the company you know that you are taking pride in this interview and that you're serious and taking this very you know you're considering this opportunity at SAAP opportunity and the last thing I'll leave you with is to practice you know make sure that you run through it it doesn't matter if it's in the mirror and it's just to yourself or to your dog or to your cat or to your child or to you know your neighbor across the street and you scream it over Fifth Avenue you know practice it will help you it will hone your skills it will hone your preparedness it's very important MIUI go ahead yeah almost tying into Jack's last point about practicing um I would definitely not forget to prepare questions at the end of every interview at code Academy you're going to have the chance to ask questions and now more than ever doing these in a remote that's really your chance to get an idea of what it would be like to work with these people and what the culture is like at that company I would also say not to forget to set a calendar and write for 15 minutes prior to your interview you want to make sure that there's gonna be a bit of buffer room in case something goes wrong with setting out some technology make sure that you're ready for when your interview starts cuz even though it's Anna probably zoom or Google hangout or something like that you definitely don't want to be late I would also say to never hesitate to ask the recruiting team if there will be a break or any other questions like that if it's helpful for you to have that break in the center the fact that you're at home right now makes it more flexible for you in terms of your schedule and also don't forget to bring yourself water bring yourself coffee and have that stuff on your desk that'll make it yes just holding up his coffee I've got coffee here and have it having that right next to you um will make the whole thing work all more smoothly and hopefully make you feel more comfortable great let's go to the next slide here and then you want to take the dues here for adjusting to a virtual interview pressure and the main thing that I would just start off here with virtual interviews and saying is that it's probably just as new and slightly uncomfortable to the company that you're interviewing with as it is to you so we're all learning together and adjusting to a rapidly changing world here the number one way to to adjust is to practice so definitely make sure that you've like set up your space see what it would look like in your camera and all of that the next thing I would say is to dress the part this can mean a lot of different things for a lot of different companies sometimes you may be interviewing at like a bank or more corporate environment in that case you probably want to dress up more if you're interviewing for a startup like codecademy it probably doesn't matter if you're wearing a tshirt so there really is the need to kind of know your audience and where what's appropriate for that um if you're gonna use a zoom background you might want to think about not wearing like a green shirt or something like that to make sure that you don't fade into the background but it really really depends I would also say to test the technology if you've never used in before you're gonna want to get on ahead of time and download it onto your computer make sure you know how it works check out the basic functionality and all that kind of stuff um and also think about think about the lighting in your room these conversations over zoom are a little bit unnatural a little bit uncomfortable but being able to see each other clearly makes it a lot more effective another thing that we all we actually all did this for this interview as well it's made sure that we had our desktop notifications turned off whether that be email or calendar or slack keep in mind that any notifications or pings that you're getting on your computer will be able to be heard by whoever's on the other end of your video conference so you don't want to hit them to hear the incessant slack notification saying that you got a message it's gonna be really distracting to the interviewer as well as yourself don't forget to take a breath as well I think we could all probably benefit from some advice take a deep breath think on a question and slow down and I would also say say just talk about something personal these are really really unique times and I think for most people that I'm speaking with that they're maybe like a dog or their child or their family in the background and like that's completely fine just calling it out and saying like Oh like you know I'm definitely paying attention I'm sorry that there's some stuff going on here usually that the company will recognize it and if they're like not interested in the fact that that you have a family and that they're there they're probably not a company but you want to work for and also smile there's so much body language that I think is lost being over videoconferencing um so you don't do whatever you can to uh to project your personality into the interview thanks Emma a couple of don'ts these are you know fairly straightforward don't stress this is new for everybody don't get flustered with the technology it's okay if you know again the dog barks in the background or you know your your screen gets frozen that's okay don't be afraid to take notes I would tell your interviewer that you plan to do so if you aren't going to and if you're going to be typing you know make sure to tell that that person don't be afraid to ask questions including for somebody to repeat the question this sort of folds into the technology piece and don't forget to follow up I think the best thing you can do is is send an email to the recruiter follow up provide any feedback there is ask for a timeline of feedback and emails for people who were on the interview panel so you can drop it thank you um let's move to the star method we're gonna quickly go through this what I'd recommend doing is is doing some research online and these are for behavioral questions the example that we'll come to at the end is tell me about a time that you've made a mistake and how you handled it Emma's gonna go through two answers and we'll share a little bit of context as to why one is a little bit better than the other the star method is situation task action and result this will give the answer a very robust detailed and thoughtful response so you know setting the stage describing what you did how you handled the situation and what your effort was and the outcome and the result so Emma let's do the non star method answer first I will pose the question to you tell me about a mistake that you've made and how did you handle it all right I remember one time when I sent flowers to the wrong address I was an Internet at events company I realized this about two hours before the event and so I got in my car picked them up and took them to the right place it was really stressful but I guess all's well that ends well thank you now let's do the same question using the star method so Emma tell me about it a mistake that you've made and how did you handle it I was working as an intern for an events company and I was responsible for ordering the floral arrangements for a private event hosted by a highprofile client unfortunately I mixed up the information from another event and the flowers were delivered to the wrong venue on the other side of town I admitted my mistake to my boss took an early lunch break drove to the other venue picked up the flowers and delivered them to appropriate venue an hour before the event the client never knew about my mixup and my boss was very grateful but SiC so I want to save some time for questions but a couple of key things here you know in the first example we had almost no context about why this was a relevant mistake why the person a candidate is describing this particular situation whereas in the second example we really heard that this was a high profile client you know this was a main responsibility for this job you know and and so that so that's the why that's the setting of the stage you know the task at hand very clear and then how you handled the situation is specifically about a mistake and in the first example there was no mention of making mistake there was no you know here's how I understood this to be a mistake in the second answer it was very clear this was my mistake here's I went to my boss I admitted the mistake you know these are things that recruiters look for when hiring schemes look for the ability the ability to take feedback the ability to you know take ownership over a situation and overcome right the result was very clear in the first example the client never knew about the the earth sorry in the star example the client never knew about the problem you know it was solved internally there was a massive efforts and there was buzz that the client got their flowers which is directly tied to what the task was in the first example it was very blurry all as well that ends well we really don't know what that means did the client know anything what was the situation it's very unclear please go research the star method there are multiple examples in out there this works whether or not this is your first job or you're a VP going for a clevel job I promise this is a very very very good method so can we pause here and go to Q&A at least are you there I'm here and so is my dog normal snoring this is real life ok thank you all for your questions I want it where we're running a little tight on time we've only got five minutes or so left so just a reminder any questions that you do have let's please add them to Q&A what that does give presenters like Emma and Jeff an opportunity even after they're done presenting to actually go through the QA and see what else they can answer for you I want to also give a heads up that we will be recording this and you will be able to find this on YouTube I've seen that question come up a few times you will be able to find this on YouTube and if you registered for the event I'm Zoo it'll get sent to you via email and now before we go to QA actually Emma and Jeff is there any questions that you saw come in that you know right now that you want to answer or is there anything that came up if not I've got one yeah let's hear from you okay cool what's a good timeline for feedback like for asking for a feedback after an interview take this what I yeah I definitely think thing that this isn't this is a great question I think follow up after the interview is is really important as well as the interview itself I would say sometimes while rands working remote it may take the recruiter a little bit longer to gather feedback from everyone but typically if it's been 48 hours from a final interview there should be no problem following up with the recruiter and asking for feedback and the worst that they can say is you know I don't have anything yet I should know tomorrow I should know in two more days they're just asking them what the timeline looks like can be really helpful yeah I'll probably underscore that because this is something that we heard in Mia's presentation that ask questions that's a great thing to do a question from Andres BIA what kind of questions at the end of the interview make you stand out I've asked about the future of the company's specific and/or technical questions or just about the hiring process but what are some home runs yeah you know I always find the more specific the question the more engaging the conversation can be so I'll go back to my previous thoughts about researching the company knowing the job description and then showcasing that you've listened to the answers that you have for questions you've asked what have you learned throughout the interview and then I'd be remiss if I didn't say what my my fatherinlaw gave me some great advice way back when I was looking for jobs and he said you know make sure that you ask if you can have the job for me that is a question that seems to catch people offguard and but shows that you're very serious so so it almost has a a sense of humor but in a sense of urgency built into it I think that you'll find that that is super helpful you can pair that with something a little bit easier like how do you think the sweat you know if you're the interviewer you know do you think that this went well I thought this went very well you know you can be direct that would be my biggest advice thank you and we have time for one more I really really like this question that came in from an anonymous attendee and I liked it so much because culture is something so important to us at code Khadem a so this is a culture question what is the best way to know what is accurate and what is being sold when your interview interview were is speaking about culture one thing that I would immediately jump to is that it's okay to ask the same question if it's culturally related to more than one interviewer on on your panel I love yeah like you know asking every single person like what's your favorite thing about working here what do you think is a growth area for the company in terms of improving culture those kinds of questions if everyone they answering exactly the same you probably know that the company is pushing a script a little bit and I think that you can really get an idea for the kinds of things that are important to people who work at that company yeah and also making sure that those questions are really are really targeted so if you're asking specifically about an area of culture that's important to you you know it makes sure that your interviewer knows or interviewers know how important it is and ask very specific questions about it you you will depending on the place you will always have an opportunity to add to the culture and that is something that interviewer teams are looking for across the board so so if it's something where you have a specific thing that you want to do you know talk about it and if the company doesn't do it it may be seen as a as a really great thing for the company to do in the future I love it okay there are so many good questions coming in because that's the crowd that we have with us today thank you all for asking your questions if we are at home I'm hoping that we can do like a virtual applause for everybody who comes and speaks with us today I am so grateful Emma

first day in your first week while getting settled we'll focus on preparing for longterm success awesome so getting set up at Co Cadenet we consider onboarding to start from the moment a new hire accepts their offer here we want them to have a great experience that whole time couple of things we recommend here ask your onboarding team for advice every company has different procedures and processes so that team will truly be the best experts and helping you figure out what you need to know try reaching out and asking them what they need from you or find out what you can do in advance to prepare it's also a good opportunity to ask about any firstday expectations and when should you be prepared to be online how will you start your day what does your first day agenda look like many companies will send you new hardware like a laptop or a desktop computer for you to use if you receive this early you should try and take some time for your first day to get your computer setup this will let you make sure that everything works to your specifications for example customizing your mouse click settings brightness etc at koke Adam II we've been doing this by shipping welcome kits as a way of bringing that new desk feeling to our new team members homes we send out boxes complete with a laptop a Welcome Packet and some code academy swag to make sure that everyone has everything that they need to right in on their first day we're also then working with each person to set up any extra tech that would help them work better so things like keyboards or mice we also recommend you find out about software right just like Emma mentioned before find out what software the team is using and make yourself familiar with it things like video conferencing calendar email chat or all things you'll use right away on day one and so it's important to be comfortable with them quickly if something is new to you try it out first consider doing a test run on software like video conferencing with a friend or a family member so you know how it works you might also want to try out screen sharing this will let you set up your audio and video permissions before you jump into any big meetings so you're not caught off guard something I want to talk about here and you've definitely seen us struggle with this a little bit on the call the importance of using the mute function on video calls in larger meetings or whenever you might have background noise around you just make sure you are muting yourself right and take the time to practice going on and off mute and many conferencing software's also have keyboard shortcuts that will help you wanna meet yourself quickly and zoom for example you press on the spacebar and hold it down while you're speaking and then let go to go back right back on here I make that mistake daily so it's a good idea to practice another great prep step is setting up a designated workspace you should ensure it's free from distractions try and minimize noise make sure your background is professional it doesn't need to be blank it can still showcase your personality with items like a bookcase or plants but just make sure that everything that's in your frame is professional and very important tip if you are in front of your bed make sure your bed is made before I mean you should consider comfort and ergonomics when you're setting up your space one organ Amma Kip is keeping your laptop and any secondary monitors at eye level this helps reduce neck strain you should be aware of where your lot eyeline is in relation to your camera digital eye contact is something that will go a long way and making you feel connected to your team one tip we recently learned from the team was that if you're trying to take notes while on a video call you should put the window you're looking at directly under your camera that way you can look at your notes and also make eye contact at the same time yeah this is an important one and it's definitely something that's much easier to do in oneonone meetings where you're having more conversational time but if you are you know trying to present it can be more challenging so just make sure you position the things on your screen correctly our last step in this section is to do your homework it's similar to when you're interviewing this is your chance to make a strong first impression on many of your new teammates if you have things you've been asked to complete make sure you're doing them in a timely manner be sure to stay responsive to emails coming from the team they'll be reaching out with a lot of requests and a lot of information and make sure you get back to them quickly and with everything they asked for you can also take this time to keep on up keep up on any company news right and it's a good chance to start connecting with your new colleagues on LinkedIn awesome so part two getting started so now you've done all the prep work you're ready to start these are some things you can think about on day 1 and week 1 most importantly embrace the challenge I know we've talked a lot about how this is a new experience for many of us just know we're all kind of in the same boat starting a new job is exciting but it can be daunting and it may feel like remote onboarding is gonna be awkward but recognize that everyone else is in the same boat well it's a new experience for you it's also very likely a new experience for the team that's bringing you on know that it might take time for you to feel comfortable and try and be gentle with yourself and patient with yourself in the meantime ultimately just remember that it's gonna be a great learning experience for everyone so even though you've already tested your settings nothing's perfect so be ready to troubleshoot know some basics like where your WiFi router is how to reset it and try not to let tech issues fluster you they happen to everyone especially on your first day if you can't solve it on your own don't hesitate to reach out for help be ready to talk about yourself and your experiences you might feel like the interview is over but there are plenty of people in the office that you haven't met yet your team is gonna want to get to know you be prepared to talk about what you've done in the past and walk through your experiences it's always a good idea to have a personal elevator pitch about yourself or a few fun facts for their ICO Academy in one of my favorite traditions is something we call in for vex once every two weeks we ask our newest team members to come in and create a presentation to share with the team in our intro decks we usually ask people to share things like their role what we can expect from them here background info like their career path school where they've lived in the past we ask them to tell us a little bit about their families fun facts some hobbies and finally and most importantly their process and their purpose in Trebek's give us a lot of insight into who our coworkers are as people it also gives us an easy way to find common ground or a new conversation topic while this is something we do as a company here this is something you could take and adapt in a modified way for yourself right think about these topics and have answers ready to go and use them as icebreakers when you're introducing yourself to new coworkers you should take the time to meet your IT manager or IT Help Desk on your first day that way if you have any issues you already have a contact that can help you you should try and meet HR on your first day as well they can be a great resource if you have any questions about payroll benefits or anything else they can also help point you in the right direction if you have any other questions that need to be answered absolutely also get to know your stakeholders right who are the people who are going to be most important for you to meet quickly you're gonna want to find opportunities to connect with all of your new team members but in our current era of remote work without an office and the organic meet and great opportunities that come from a shared break room bumping into people in the elevator Bank or even walking past someone in the hallway this should really be an area of special focus in your first week or two new hires are often really surprised by how many connections they should focus on making within their first week or so but a good rule of thumb is to aim for 2020 I know it sounds like a lot but just think about how many people you now have really quick relationships with that you can ask a question or I can find out more about the company and use those resources a question we get a lot is how do you identify who those people are how do you find out who most important to me fast think about doing things like asking your manager the onboarding team or a recruiter you met during the interview process you could also take the time to review an org chart and see what roles you think you'll interact with most often most importantly don't hesitate to reach out to your new coworkers via chat or email just put on virtual coffee meetings on the calendar and get to know them you can ask them things like what do they need from you how is your being at the company going to impact their role how can you support them you might also want to ask them how they'll know if you're doing a good job you can use that as a barometer for your own success especially right now like you've seen ELISA doing it can also be important to ask about any constraints they might have on their worklife or what their situation is at home so many people have had major schedule disruptions while dealing with Kofi 19 things like child care new home offices so it's important to kind of just get in their world to make sure you understand also come prepared with questions for your new manager ask them things like what will success look like for you during your onboarding period what do you need to know in your first week your first month okay is there any weird jargon or things you might need to know about the company any terms that they might want to help you define is their background or industry knowledge that you should get up to speed on what are the most important slack groups email groups that you should be a part of and most importantly ask them how they like to be communicated with hey so many of us use so many different ways to get in touch with each other hey does your manager prefer to work over slack or chat do they like email when can you reach them and how should you respect your response also find out if your team has specific working hours recurring meetings or other team norms that you should be aware of awesome our last sections about getting settled what happens after you're in hey how do you get comfortable and really start to succeed in your new role don't hesitate to reach out to your new team for help or advice what do they wish they knew when they started what's the best piece of advice that they have for you they're a great resource for questions as they've been in your shoes before keep learning about the company right your knowledge about the company doesn't start doesn't stop in your first week right you're gonna have to keep building that up over time take every opportunity you can to learn about the business about his history and about any strategies plans or roadmaps the more info me you are the easier it is for you to connect the work you're doing back to the larger company mission you should also ask about what companywide or Department metrics you should be looking at and learn where to find them and how to keep track of them for yourselves this part is fun you should check in with HR to find out if your company has any social or networking opportunities lined up at code ketamine we've been hosting daily remote lunches we've also started using a slack integration called donut to pair team members for smaller lunch meetings we also have themed tapi hours we've run live cooking demos remote game nights and we're planning a live art class our engineering team hosts biweekly lightning talks where members of the team have the opportunity to present on topics that interest them we also hosts a monthly demo event where the team shares projects that they've been working on over breakfast or lunch Thank You Maria so many companies have all these cool different opportunities they're creating during this time and if there is something you wanted to do that you're maybe your company isn't giving yet try suggesting it right come up with an idea and present that back to the HR office team and give them something new to try we also suggest you check in with your manager on progress and expectations don't wait to be given feedback while many companies run regular performance review cycles to give you insight into how you're doing it can help to actively seek out and ask for feedback in between those things request feedback on a project or check in with your manager or appear on how it's been going for them right remember that feedback is an opportunity for development so take everything everyone gives you in and just try and use that to help you grow lastly share your feedback about your experience if you you know you have a great opportunity to impact the experience of every person who joins a new company after you use that opportunity please share what works well for you be open and about what doesn't and as you go on in your role remember that yeah remember that it was hard when you started and make yourself available to offer advice or welcoming words to all the future newbies behind you we are ready for Q&A ELISA wonderful thank you um we can yeah there we go we can probably make ourselves really big okay so thank you for that it was really informative and as somebody who works not on your team but actually receives the benefit of working with you that's all really accurate and true and I just super appreciate the work that you all do on a regular basis thank you thank you before hopping into a Q&A box and once you also thank everybody who sent in some questions for Carrie and Maria um quick plug for what we have coming next we have a panel of learners showing up actually who these are people who've actually learned with code Academy and then got a job after so they're gonna be around in about ten minutes to talk with you all about what it's like now to actually like have this job working remotely so cool for them excited for them for right now we're with Cara Maria and I really like this question that came in from Thomas Chang Thomas is killing it with the questions today has a new hire asks any new questions that you've gone like oh that's really good we're gonna add that to the onboarding process so I guess the question is more like are you building the onboarding process around the experience of working with new hires awesome question Thomas the short answer is every day that happens the long answer is it happens so many times I couldn't even tell you what the what the questions are anymore I can I think that question about how to communicate appropriately with your manager how to expect feedback from them which channels they use is actually something I picked up new hire along the way so that is one example I also think that it's important to note the onboarding process is never finished we're always constantly reevaluating it constantly changing it and even as we go from week to week we're adding in all the new things we learned last week great thank you we got a question from brandy it was mentioned that it might be common for new coworkers or for employers to ask about your family our get to know you what if you're like I'm not really comfortable sharing about like your personal stuff you don't have to feel free to not share it's something you may want to do is if someone asks right and you are not comfortable with that have something prepared to steer the conversation somewhere else okay it can be an easy thing for you to do to kind of change the topic and talk about something you do want to talk about maybe you steer that back to you a work experience right or how you want to learn to interact with that person maybe you can focus on the things you're doing in your job I talked about perhaps if you don't want to talk about what's going on at home maybe you can talk about how working from home has been going right maybe talk about what your new challenges are and your office space or all the different things that have come up in your daytoday and you control the conversation and you don't have to share anything you're uncomfortable with and largely your team will respect that definitely you can use the questions that we listed in the intro deck portion which is what we use like a presentation that new team members use to introduce themselves to the company and those are some good icebreakers you know you can weed out the things that you're not comfortable talking about and maybe steer the conversation towards your hobbies or something like that I love it thank you both very much for that so this one I think is actually really this is a cool question coming from Tanner tinsel and I think this is cool because of the culture that we have at code Academy and this what are the tools and things that introverted colleagues can do to stay active and social virtually and I I mean like you both know that I'm just like I were introvert across my forehead like this whoa that's a surprise Kari really oh yes oh yes same with me believe it or not it's definitely a barrier to break down and doing things virtually canned you know sometimes make things easier or harder for certain personality types yeah okay so like what are the tools then let's say we have to stay active socially virtually absolutely something that Randall says a lot sticks with me at coke Adam II were a culture and introverts which may seem surprising because we're putting so much of what we do out into the world and we're so focused on making connections and within our networks with our learners with all the people we're affecting it but apparently we are introverted by nature right so we are finding tools and we are creating new opportunities to kind of do those things on smaller scale and if you're not comfortable speaking up in a big meeting or jumping in right away to like a large lunch table or something like that take an opportunity to meet one coworker it spend time with an individual get to know them a little more closely maybe have them introduce you to a few people they know and start to build up those relationships more slowly try to focus on the quality of the relationship instead of the quantity in that case we also recommend trying to do things that might push you just a little bit out of your comfort zone take the opportunity to reach out to someone and say hello it's simple hello does go a long way because suddenly you have a connection you don't need to have whole conversation but taking a moment to just introduce yourself and say hello this is who I am this is what I do suddenly this person now knows you and you have a place to go if you do need them have a question in the future and you didn't have to spend a kind of time interacting with them or trying to have conversations that maybe you weren't ready for I think slack has been a very helpful tool for us in particular because I think you get to jump into conversations where you feel comfortable and you can step back where you may not yet be ready to participate and that lets you back to supply in them all we have all these slack channels for hobbies so like a slack channel for gardening or video gaming there's one for Animal Crossing that just started so you can find a place where you're comfortable sharing your hobbies and that'll help you like branch out feel a little bit more comfortable I love it thank you so much I've mentioned a couple times even like my role as community manager is one that I think I'm molded into because I'm so much more chatty online like in flag or even just in our forums it can be a really nice way to I think build connections with other people that is totally virtual and it fits this world that we're in right now this is this is a cool question I think again along the lines of culture what are some soft skills fist questions from mark on some soft skills that you've seen that when somebody really exhibits them it makes them quite successful and like their first few weeks of getting to eat yeah and I use the term soft skills but I'm very happy to be corrected um I don't mind the term soft skills but I am gonna kind of think of this question a little bit of a different frame so the first thing that comes to mind right away from me is one of our core codecademy values and that's thinking deeply I think that's very much any what we consider here to be a soft skill and to us that means that you're putting a ton of focus into what you're doing right and you're producing something that can be that is incredibly well thought out and that can be picked apart and pulled apart and people can dig into the ask questions right and it just shows that you're putting in a lot of depth and thought into what you're doing as a company we tend not to fly by the seat of our pants and I think that's a major soft skill that people can bring in is just the ability to think deeply and to focus and present their thoughts in a way that helps helps make it clear being proactive is definitely important we have like a timeline for how we onboard people's when we send out their welcome package when we request other information and it's always great to see new hires reaching out to us being like okay so when is when is the next step what can I expect or trying to make connections with their future coworkers their LinkedIn or just just being proactive in general it definitely helps this is wonderful thank you so much is there wait we have like a minute and a half laughter so is there anything else that's come up for you Carrie and Maria in this conversation that you think that you'd like to share with everyone that's a good question and not an easy one and I think for me the biggest takeaway is to really just recognize that your experience is going to be unique to you right and you should focus on the things that are going to make it feel most comfortable for you if there is advice out there and it doesn't sit right or maybe you want to try something a little bit differently it focus on how it's going to create the best experience for you and how it's gonna show up joining team and don't be nervous everyone that's already at the company has been through this process they remember what it's like and you know speaking for codecademy everyone here is so so friendly when we have new team members step in the door everyone's ready to greet them so just know that people have been in your shoes before it can relax yeah that's that's super important and I think applicable across so many areas of lives it's like somebody's done this before okay okay thank you so so so much let's bring the snobs the virtual applause for Kerry and Maria there's there are some more questions that came through in the Q&A box so ladies if you have a chance come join us America where what is the term room like a jungle trying to get through those right now oh I see I see the gratitude coming through for you thank you thank you everyone next we have a panel of code Academy learners we decided actually that that we were going to go through with our people team and our talent team what it's like to put together a resume what it's like to interview online what it's like to actually start and then in thinking about it I was like yeah and there's this opportunity to make it real and maybe we can show and share what it's like to have been a learner who has gone through this whole experience and is is living it and this actually is working online so we're gonna give a few minutes to our guests today we have with us Pablo choice we have Kathy Anna we have an and we have crystal so team if you're around now's the time to turn on your video I'm so happy to be joined by you right now oh my gosh hi everybody hi everybody so today this is ideal thank you all okay so just so that everybody knows the gist here is let's let's hear from this team of people who are all working remotely in technical roles you all at some point have learned on code Academy I think what is so brilliant is that some of you are still coming back and learning more on cook heavy and oh if you can see the chat team people are saying hi to you so just some reminders for how the rest this is gonna go we're gonna spend 10 15 minutes on some questions that I've prepared for this team of learners and then we're gonna turn it over to the audience and that's you all on the line and we're still going to be using that Q&A box just another reminder that if there is something that you want to ask it is it responding to in the Q&A box there's the four ups there's a code kami forms that discuss duck code Academy calm I'm super grateful that we've seen some of them actually you folks here we have on line with us answering questions there I am super excited to get started and we will get started by doing some intros I'm gonna go around in the order that I see you all so let's start with crystal what how are you what's going on at home and what's your day job like right now well crystal you're so muted yeah music me again for some reason how I was I'm doing well I've been working remotely for I think six weeks now and it's um it's going okay my dolls are happy so um Maya fern went completely removed a month ago with only necessary people inside and my parttime job also went remote so basically teaching students via zoom so I'm still I'm still getting used to it I think just going from because I went to the office four days a week and on the one day I work from home it was usually like babies I ran chores and stuff but I think it's just trying to get my work space situated that's then you know the most unique part of it but other than that like I think it's more been trying to support the other people who are trying to be remote right now and so I think we're almost at the point where they're used to it and but I live in Georgia which everyone probably knows they're trying to reopen the state my office has not said anything about it but I'm not sure how it's going to work yet but it's just we support all over the country though so I don't know if that means anything different for me though yeah like that's just like baseline for all of us right now that shrug emoji okay thanks we'll go to Tatiana in just a second I just want to share heads up that Randall and Madison and Emma will be joining us for the Q&A for the open Q&A section of this segment so we will keep going now with some intros for learners Tatiana how you doing what's home like right now what's your day job hi I'm speaking from Brazil my job is tagging I've been working as a dedicate or for five years now completely removed all this time soon so my day job didn't change a lot but my personal life did I well I was caught in the middle of the transition six months ago all this started I moved home moved back with my parents after I'm going out like nineyear relationship and then I moved to são Paulo like really big city and when I just got my own shoe box there you know like at least that lives in New York you know how this is I found my shoe box there and but it wasn't fully furnished so I came back to my parents house left my all my work stuff there like my work chair and every things so I'm having to yeah I think adapting is the name of the game and how are you and what's home like right now and what's your day job yeah so I am a WordPress web developer I've been with the company for about three years and the last two of those three years have been remote so I started in office and then moved across the country and so I've been working from home for like two years but not like this so we have a toddler and we have a nanny that helps out some days and I'd love to work from coffee shops and I have a coworking membership and so this is definitely different to say the least and so my husband is home with our child now and I'm at home like I can't go anywhere so I have a desk good I have like a home set up but being confined to my house is it's very very different so even though I've been working from home and it doesn't feel like it feels like I still left a job in a way if that makes sense yeah that's real that makes sense thank you for sharing Pablo your your next step what's home like are you doing what's your day job hi my name is Pablo choice I live in the Tampa Florida area um my current role is software engineering manager at AI canals the whole company's remote I've been working with them for almost two years so for me it's no different basically like you said in the previous session I'm also a bit of an introvert so I try to go to a coffee shop every now and then just to mix it up but most of the time I'm just here so nothing has really changed aside from I just have more work yeah it's a it's funny to see how workloads have done this over the last few weeks okay thank you I'm gonna get started with the set of like preset questions that I have for you all and then it already see some questions coming through via chat and via the Q&A just a reminder for everybody please put them in the Q&A section because that's where we'll be able to get to them big thanks to Andrew Boland and Christopher Klein because I've already seen your questions coming through that's very nice so this is just to all of you and we can do this by like who unmutes that's how we can is I'm not gonna like pick on anybody where does code Academy fit in your learning journey is that where is where you started it was coke added me where you came about like halfway through do you still visit click at me to learn new things tell us I feel like I'm a mix of all of that I'd kind of just like played around on coke Adam II for fun like years before I got into this my background was in marketing and communications and I had lots of WordPress experience and like plugins and themes and clicking buttons to make stuff happen and then I realized there are things that you can do that are way more powerful if you know how to code it or just edit and manipulate the code and so for me I like dough deep into a code Kadim eCourse right after my son was born and that was like a big turning point and so I got my job like right as I finished that course but I still find myself coming back because I think oh here's a new thing that I need to learn or here's something I haven't encountered before like I wonder if Coke Adam II has a lesson on that so I feel like my answer is like D all of the above there I need to include that every time is there anybody else want to share I'm like where Luke Adam if it's a crystal I see that you're unmuted yeah I forgot to mention I'm a software engineer so but when I during Codecademy I was a help desk analyst NIT and so it was one of those things where some of the things we had to do we had to do in HTML and I wanted to delve deeper into it to where HTML and CSS and JavaScript and then it just kind of went on from there you know I started running nose in jQuery and I'm someone that when I'm bored I like to learn new things and so you know Proterra me like kept adding classes I kept taking it's basically where it was and so I started in incorporating some of the stuff I learned on coding care and put my job like sequel and JavaScript and it actually helped me build up to learn you know other languages like PowerShell because you're not like once you learn basic syntax it's kind of easier to pick it up for other things and so today I still go on code Academy to refresh on certain things but also just you know see what's there I like I have tracks now like computer science data science stuff like that that really helps you know focus you know which way I want to go so great thank you I'm going to skip ahead Susa the thing that I think that you all can like give a lot of color on and maybe this is something that we can hear from every each one of you on is how to design your work from home space like we heard from we heard from Maria and carry on like how to get settled into your new job but like what's been working for you long term and maybe do a little compare contrast to like what that means now that like you can't leave your house I see Pablo you're unmuted okay yeah for me again it was a little bit different because they said this is kind of normal for me but the main thing is just being comfortable like I am comfortable standing up I can tell I have a standing desk so everything is within reach like I have three monitors to see everything I need to see I love music so I have good speakers here my bass is over here so if I'm feeling like distracted or whatever or if it's my lunch break I'll just grab the base plate for a little bit and come back to work I always have something candy to grab I need to have something my hand so there's always everything I need is always here in my desk and I also have worked out a lot so I just have a standard routine for stretching that helps my back it helps my posture so it's just a bunch of little random fitness equipment here and it's just a lot of discipline I sometimes you say oh my god it's only 11 o'clock I found so much already and have so much to do sometimes it's oh my god it's already 300 p.m. and the day just went by and I still have a lot of stuff to do so it's just like a regular job basically in that sense but as long as you have as long as you're comfortable with where you are you don't have to fiddle or move your chair or anything like that just find a good space that actually works for you yeah I'd say good my answer six months ago would be completely different because I had like an office space at home and now I'm in this transition so I definitely agree with Pablo that you need to be comfortable and that's something I'm aiming in the future I'm just winging it [Laughter] but I say try different things if you're allowed to like in my case I have flexible hours I work fulltime and it's fully remote but I can choose when I work I have to fulfill 40 hours a week but I can still like work during the if I want to I'm not in that person but I'm more of a morning person but um in my case I was able to during this five years to try a lot of different setups and and find a lot of things during the way like for example do I like to work with music on or I don't do I need to get out of the house in order to I don't know to turn the switch on and so it depends a lot and I would say like try try a different thing it thinks experiment and find out about yourself yeah that makes good sense thank you and I see your immediate yeah I so agree with that trying different things I'll preface all this by saying that I'm a ninny agreement seven which is like a whole other conversation but knowing yourself and knowing your personality and knowing like and you're only gonna know by trying but figuring out what you like and what's important to you I think there's so much value in that so like for me I really care about the aesthetic of things and I just care about visual design and so yes I need a chair that's comfortable to sit in all day but I also need a chair that's gonna look pretty in my house am I you know in my like work set up because that's inspiring to me and there are times when I want two monitors because I've got multiple different browsers and sizes and things going on and I want to be able to like see it all and adjust it all but there are times where I'm good with just my laptop like how did a coffee shop like as long as I have a plug to connect to I would rather be surrounded by people than have you know like the perfect setup tech wise and so like one thing I learned about myself is that I love to start my day out somewhere and then come home and so that's just kind of you know something that I've like worked into my schedule because I found that I work really well that way and then I think too just being okay with it changing season two season and so you know I have some like chronic health issues and so like these past few weeks have been really hard and that way and I've started my day later and I've worked after we put the little one in bed and I to him like lucky to have flexible hours like that and as long as I get you know my 40 hours my full time my list done but being like this is what I need in this season and this is what's going to work for me and it may not be the same in the next season but I'll try something different when that time comes crystal did you have anything to add probably just the same that everyone else was done I think for me since I didn't work remotely much before and I had to kind of get my setup different because when I work from home once a day you know I might be at the dining room table or something so I had to make sure a desk and I had to get an extra monitor and you know a chair that was comfortable because I have issues with my back and sounds like that but also I'm an introvert in heart however you know I still need to get up and move around and go outside so I walk the dogs in the neighborhood or I might go out for coffee or something but I don't have flexible hours you know I'm basically eight five everyday and then with my parttime job you know it's night and Saturdays so I just have to try to fit well I'm at home I want to be stuff play I still have to work so but for me you know I need to make sure I take a break from it you know walk away for 10 minutes every few hours or something or I'll stay here for eight hours straight working so I think that's it's also easier that I don't have children or anyone to distract me so you know like work is my distraction I guess so I just saw a dog goes through the back you know yeah yeah they're gonna be really running around efficient distractors um I decided to be Oh tell me in or just say one thing I would add is that if you are working from home right now like whatever your job is don't necessarily assume that the way that things are right now is the way that working from home has to look for you outside of this time brain obviously this time frame you can't change a lot but usually that's not how it is so yeah that's a that's a solid segue into the next question that I have and the final question actually that I have before we open up to Q&A and this one is optional not everybody has to answer this but if there's something that you would change or bring up or some conversation that you would have in your interview if you were interviewing for your current job right now with everything that's going on in the world is there one thing in particular like would you bring up that like hey I actually do need flexible hours because no no yeah maybe I stole a really good example but if there's something that you would bring up if you were interviewing with a company for your current job but with all the circumstances right now ah I can start like actually right now we are hiring and I am interviewing people so the things that I look for because these people are working remote usually in other countries is the first thing is share your video we have had we haven't had good experiences with people who don't share their video and we those that we have higher and even after higher they don't share their video eventually they just went away because they weren't a good fit so in my experience you don't have to share anything specific you don't have to show that yes I have experience working from home or I have this laptop or a half this monitor like to me that does really matter as long as you're a good fit personality wise then you'll make the team so it's more about showing your your real personality and obviously in your technical skills they're gonna ask you questions about it but it's mostly just be about being yourself and also be smart like if you have to share your screen don't have Facebook don't have YouTube or anything like that like even if I haven't seen something that's really really bad but if I'm if you're sharing your screen with me and I'm looking at the application that we're working on I don't want to see your Facebook feed next to it or your YouTube like yes I use YouTube to have music in the background but have it in a different browser so just be smart about what you have and what you're sharing if I see an you yeah I think if I were interviewing right now the question that I would ask is like how are we gonna stay connected one during this time and two in general so we're gonna small team it's just me and my boss but it's really important that we are on the same page and so you know for us that looks like a Monday morning call and I fly out to Colorado you know four or five times a year which we can't do right now but I would ask like how do we stay connected as it slack is it this is it that and then how does that look different outside of our current situation great yeah thank you okay we are time is flying and I think we're ready now for some Q&A from all of our audience I'd like to if you can hear me Randall Emma Madison or listen turn the video on showing us back hi hello everyone how's the afternoon bin or how's the morning been for you I think it's gone really good tell us in the chat how the morning has been give us some give us some feedback yeah and I'd also asked early on I'm gonna want to know what everyone's one major thing they're gonna do is so if everyone wants to throw that into the chat that would be great I'm hearing some New York City coming from somebody else that was probably random yeah yeah you're a few neighborhoods over from me okay thank you so much all right so Randall Emma and Madison have joined us for this section where we're going to take some questions actually for the learner panel so we'd love to hear from from you all and Tatiana crystal and Pablo but if there's anything that MI Randall in Madison can add they'll hop in with that oh right so I actually love this question from Amy because it's for everybody who you see on the screen right now how do you ask about flexible hours in an interview without it coming across negatively so for any learners who asked about like how do I get those flexible hours for any of our talent team how do we do it um first so I definitely had this question asked many times and interviews so one recommendation might be to ask this question directly to maybe more of like manager and interviewer as opposed to maybe other people you meet on the panel you know folks that you might be working more closely with are working across functionally with you know just to kind of get some of this sort of says this is sort of like a question that you actually should ask you know you should be open to asking you know what flexible work hours might look like or what worklife balance is like and things like that too and I think this is one of those sort of like logistical questions that's very good for your hiring manager or your potential future manager rather or cruder or someone else on that side of the team we get these questions all the time so it's definitely not offbase to ask but I would maybe save that just as a recommendation there I save that for those folks on your interview panel great it didn't and or Tatiana when you were interviewing did you have to ask for flexible hours did you have to have that conversation or was it just sort of builtin so I started actually only working five hours a week and so at that point in time it was kind of we were just talking about what the expectation is is it do you want one hour but you want me to check in every single day meaning Monday through Friday I check the email I do my things I need to do or you know do you want me to check in every other day but you know two two and a half hours whatever that adds up to be and then time kind of went on and it evolved and I picked up more tasks and we we really just like discussed what's most important so Monday morning 9 o'clock that's our team meeting that's like nonnegotiable but because I we are such a small company I mean my boss was basically a freelancer before me so he had flexible hours he has kids like I have so I knew we were coming in with similar lifestyles but I think the most important thing as time went on and even from the beginning was just understanding like hey I am your employer like I am here because you're paying me to do things for you so what is it that you expect of me and then of course you know like there's part of that as like this is what I have to offer and this is what will work for me not just that they get to like demand what you do you know but finding that common ground of like this is what works really well for both of us thank you did you Andy yeah I just want to add that in my case it's a big project we have contributors all over the world and it was already designed to be flexible and remote when I joined so I didn't have to yeah to add one quick thing on there I think it's all about communication I think just staying you know in touch with your team and your manager and you know continuing that conversation as you develop as Ann mentioned I think is super critical and for us to as a company that offers a bit of flexibility as far as working hours and things like that you know that's definitely the most important thing for us and what I communicate to candidates all the time is that communication is the most important as far as setting expectations and moving forward and I feel like that is a great segue into what will be our last question of the day for everybody I know time whew and this one is also a good one for absolutely everybody here because like we have the talent team and the people team who are yes hiring but also we're working and you all who've been doing this for a long time how do you manage your home life separately from your work life and I'm going to respond first by saying what is separate it's about home life integration right now that's that's that's my response I'm C ran I'm gonna I'm gonna go to Randall first because I'm seeing his wheels turn yeah now I mean it's look I have two kids and what I've been thinking about during all this times that this is such a stressful time to be a parent but it's also such a special time to be a parent at the exact same time I'm just going to be around your kids and but it's it is stressed because the work doesn't stop you need to make sure that things are happening and the way I think about it is definitely worklife integration take advantage of naps definitely but also I do think communicating with your managers I mean I've talked to my CEO Zack he knows that typically from around 6 to 8 it's gonna be really hard to get in touch with me for something that's emergency he knows exactly how to get in touch with me because I do need to be accessible but he you know we've have pretty clear conversations about what is and is not an emergency and you know just made clear look after APM I will do a lot of great work six data I want to be a dad yeah yeah for me coming goes back to discipline and just just being honest with people like I don't have kids but my my sister I shared the house with my sister Soho she has a baby if I need to pick her up from daycare I'll post in slack hey I'm five pick it up my knees everybody knows I'm out if they need me if there's something special they know they can tag me in slack I'll get out of my phone and I'll get back to them when I can but other than that it's just a regular balance like I make my own bread I'll step away 20 30 minutes I'll leave a message and slack afk 15 afk 20 and I'll make up the time myself like nobody has to tell me hey you have to make up those 20 minutes I'll just do it I'll stay either late today or I'll come in early tomorrow so it's just about your discipline personal discipline oh yes I need to get stuff done but I also have a life so I'm not gonna put either one on hold just learn how to blend both of them just just say like it's being 5 years broken working from home and I've learned that you don't separate completely and there's no way to do it you I have to get used to having this small interferences from time to time I remember my first time we have like regular checkups with with HR it is like perhaps the only time we have video meetings we usually communicate through email or chat hangouts and my first check checking with HR my cat just jumped into my screen and she was like oh let me see let me call my daughter because she loves cats part of things you know like you don't work from home and completely separate your personal life from that you know and I think that that's a great place to to leave this is that this is like we're all absolutely doing our best right now you know what no one was like no like having this interferences sometimes those bring between closer yeah that's here okay I'm just like a big disturbance right we we are about to wrap up is there any last things that anybody's like gonna burn if they don't share now would be the right time Oh Randall's always gonna burn if he can't share come on I actually just wanted I've watched all the interviews that Lisa's had with all of you so I feel like I'm I'm with a bunch of celebrities right now and it's just really really nice to hear your stories I just want to say that and it's been very nice to be able to share some of those also with some of the employees because that is that is what we if we don't always hear from you and we can get disconnected from what are we doing why are we showing up every day and it's just just a wonderful thing so thank you very much for sharing everything both here and other place you have it's just it's really interesting yeah thank you thank you Randall if it's a good point to reference that if you are a coke Adam ePro member you have access to Unicode Academy Pro community where an Tatyana Pablo crystal and others actually shared out and and answered a lot of the questions that you are asking in the Q&A right now about how they got started what they had to learn to get their job and what their what their journeys have looked like and so they've done an amazing job of sharing those stories and illustrating what it can look like for all of you so again that's just a plug for the Academy Pro community for our Pro members ok I can't thank you all enough for joining us today I massive thanks to our people team I think right now what we can do is can we
