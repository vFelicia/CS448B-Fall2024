hiyee this is Pat with Co Academy I'm a web developer based in Washington DC a project manager can seem like a pretty straightforward role but if you were like me you probably didn't know exactly what it was if you're not entirely sure what they do or just want a little bit more clarity you've come to the right place because in this video we'll discuss what a project manager is what is their daytoday like what are their concerns what keeps them up at night how do they measure success and most importantly the difference between a product manager and a project manager I hope you're ready for us to clear this up once and for all let's get started oh right let's get to it in this video we're gonna cover three main sections the first is going to be a project manager's daytoday and that's going to be how they translate the priorities into daytoday tasks which of course means managing deadlines but it also means managing up because what happens on the lower level needs to be pushed up to the higher level for further context so in that will also talk about breaking down tasks and that's from the start to finish or from epic to story in agile development terms next its managing resources which means both time and development resources or design resources but it also means listening to the team lastly there's momentum and that means both blocking and unblocking but it also means elevating problems when things don't go as planned who's ready to get started with me so before we get too far ahead of ourselves a project manager is the person in charge of the team's daytoday whereas a product manager is more highlevel a project manager is down on the weeds with the workers that translate the goals into action items and make sure that everything actually gets accomplished if you're curious what a product manager is especially in Contra distinction a project manager I'll link a video below that goes deeper into what a product manager has on their plates suffice it to say although product managers and project managers have confusing titles and a lot of overlapping focus there are subtle changes that make a big difference as to what their daytoday look like but for us we're talking about project managers in this video so the first thing that is on their plate is going to be the priority translation in a lot of companies project managers work in agile development cycles where they typically have a week or two weeks or maybe even a month to plot out what can be realistically accomplished project managers take the vague highlevel directives from product managers and translate them into stepbystep instructions for designers or engineers to work on it's important for a project manager to understand where a priority comes from to turn it into the proper steps sometimes the spirit of the task might involve more steps than usual or sometimes the priority might be more vague and need clarification for example we could say we need to make our customers happier a project manager needs to understand what's making customers unhappy so they can come up with a plan to make them happier and translate that plan into actionable steps next managing deadlines so a project manager is in charge of breaking down the tasks so they don't seem insurmountable for the teams working on the feature or application in a sense this means a typical day's distinguishing between the urgent and the important this is big because in the real world teams won't have infinite amounts of time to get it right or get things done but project managers have to do their best with what they have this might mean breaking down a task into iterations to achieve progress given limited resources deadlines are often subjective to what's happening relative to the rest of the company and whether that's an announcement coming up for marketing tradeshow where our company will demo their new capability or securing another round of funding if it's a startup every company has a different set of priorities and those priorities means they have to be accomplished by a certain set of time so to accomplish this this is means prioritizing the sequence of tasks and making sure the most important parts are built first before jumping into the urgent urgent is tricky because it may mean it's a priority for some but not all where as important means everyone needs it done not just a select few so a project managers job is to separate what will really matter at the end of the day knowing it can't all be done at the same time sometimes this means managing up a project manager has to work with their managers above them to set the expectations may be a feature is taking longer to build after engineers discover problems in the build out phase or maybe a feature is unexpectedly complex and it needs to be addressed before a subsequent work is done a product managers focus needs to stay high level so they're counting on their project managers to tell them if they're on course or if something's come up it needs to be taken into account the goal here is to not be blindsided companies need to have the right people in place to flag when there are problems so that they can anticipate any challenges and budget for them and it's the project manager's job to push up the chain of command both good and complicating things to keep in mind when the courses are being said and promises are being made the next theme for project managers is going to be breaking down tasks breaking down tasks is the name of the game for a project manager in an agile development environment there are terms called epics and stories epics are much higher level tasks that can be sometimes a little bit more vague in what they need to accomplish and a story is a subset of that epic that is more specific as to what needs to happen let's revisit that example from before where we make our customers happier a project manager needs to understand what's making customers and Happy's they come up with a plan to make them happier and translate that plan as actual steps now this can involve determining where the users are getting frustrated deciding if a new feature needs to be built or how an existing feature can be tweaked and then delegating the build out to the right team members the project manager will make Story tickets that enumerate what needs to happen to address that priority next project managers have to manage their resources each team has a finite amount of designers and developers to accomplish any given task some developers and designers may be tied up in a previous task or maybe they specialize in an area that no one else can do so a project manager assigns tasks the team members based on their availability and capability given the realities of these teams and where they're at and you know this might mean reassigning team members to start on different stories or it could mean keeping them on the same thing so they have the required amount of time to complete it which is important for the next step because a project manager also needs to listen to their team a project manager can't manage expectations for the team if they don't know what's going on so they need to stay in close contact with her years and designers to know what's blocking them what resources they need and maybe who they're waiting on before they can proceed in our anti development model a project manager and the team accomplished this through daily standups sometimes called scrums where team members list out their progress in any blocks they needed removed sometimes though for project managers this might also mean talking to individuals directly taking them to coffee or hearing them out in a different capacity project managers are there to move things along so they have to be the feet on the street knowing what's going on with the team they are the very best source of information about how much progress can actually be accomplished lastly a project manager focuses on momentum momentum means blocking or unblocking wherein a project manager will free up or security sources or by flagging other team members that they cannot progress until a previous stage is complete let's talk about unblocking maybe a developer or designer is waiting on approval for their work from someone else and they've just been too busy to get to it unblocking could also mean securing software licenses trainings or teachings it could also mean requesting a more senior team member to sit with someone to work through a problem that they're struggling with unblocking is less a function of capability just that a task could be accomplished faster if there are more experienced people looking at the problem together this is because there are still those deadlines and a project manager could have full faith that a team member is capable of solving that problem but they might just need to get it faster with a little bit of help the spirit of unblocking is to remove anything that's stopping a team member from accomplishing their job in a given amount of time conversely a project manager may have to halt a product or process to make sure that a subsequent or parallel task can be completed in this context maybe the order the operations was not forecast in the right order maybe a challenge has come up for a designer developer that needs to have someone else on a different team address it before they could finish their part of the task maybe a story is complete but it hasn't been tested yet so we can't release it with confidence knowing that it will work as intended a project manager's daytoday is balanced and making sure that the sequence of getting stuff done happens in the right order if there are problems or major delays a project manager needs to keep the relevant stakeholders in included in the discussion this could be where a project manager or parallel departments like marketing finance or customer support are kept in the loop and informed higherlevel departments like product managers chief marketing officers chief technologists are all counting on project managers to keep them informed of how the progress is going everybody wants to advance the progress that they are ultimately responsible for so it's important for them to be kept in the loop if there's something they can do to help out this can mean stepping in to outside vendors for services it could mean approving purchases like hardware or software but it could also mean that a higherlevel discussion needs to be made in order for the project manager to set the right priorities given what needs to happen first project managers are the glue the help keep the company together and moving as one with the understanding that the team's challenges as well as the higherlevel priorities are all tied together this is Pat with codecademy I hope I cleared up what a project manager is but did I answer all your questions you can like it subscribe to this channel or
