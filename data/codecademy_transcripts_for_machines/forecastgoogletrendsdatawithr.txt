okay hey everyone welcome to forecasting Google Trends data with our welcome join our is an awesome language hopefully everyone will soon get really excited about and everyone as you join feel free to start writing in where you're joining us from we want to know who are who are audiences hi Melissa hey Kenneth from Michigan Oh Diana Oh Montreal French Jane Chu Lebanon Argentina all across the speeds good afternoon or early evening to you Vietnam so good okay yeah nice morning how is everyone doing today are it guys excited going data science we're definitely excited over here and we are coming to you live from New York normally we are at the code Academy Soho Office but today we are both coming straight from our homes as I'm sure you are as well well we are going to make the best out of this situation and one thing that you can do from home is learn and programs and code and Kaila we will be learning our and not only will we be learning our we're going to be doing some time series analysis and some really cool forecasting really the bread and butter of a lot of our predictive analytics so I think it's I'm very excited it's gonna be a great time and have you been joining us all day logging some of our other sessions where we've been talking about a little bit of web development or learning other languages this sessions gonna be a little bit different we're gonna go in the direction of the data which is something that camellia and I both really love and we'll be showing you some really cool things that you can do with data science and we'll start off with a little bit on platform and the Codecademy environment which you might be familiar with but will also be venturing off platform to see what it's like coding on your computer hello everyone we'll wait another maybe 30 seconds or a minute or so to let everyone come in so we have a question from Maria do I need to download our so for this session today I would recommend that you go ahead and just follow along with us to see what we're able to do with our we'll spend some time on code Academy where we welcome you to follow along with us if you'd like but when we go off platform into our own environment I will be showing you some cool things that you can do and we recommend just watching along asking questions as they arise I'm asking why we're doing certain things or what else we can do with coding and data science and then you'll have the opportunity afterwards to go off platform download our yourself and try and explore it and have to do with some where analysis what we do here today and I think the biggest thing for me just because I have you know been a data science for some years now is I wish I had the opportunity to have someone like Ian who's gonna be able to walk us through the code and you're just gonna get you super familiar with are super excited about a lot of the statistical methodologies that we're gonna go in together and then I think the biggest thing is just be scared go into Codecademy play around with a learning environment get familiar with all the functions like our might become your best friend you you may not know it yet and we have another great question from a bot cell what is our great question so our is magnificent and amazing and fun and it is a programming language and the cool thing about R is it is a statistical programming language so it's designed to work well with doing statistical analyses or doing data analysis so it's great for taking in all that data that is being collected all over the world about every single topic and letting you find interesting insights or maybe creating visualizations and ultimately trying to find answers that can help us make decisions about the world who I am loving these are verses Python questions and R versus JavaScript questions and I just really want to answer it because I think as a data scientist it's really these very diverging philosophies right like do I go for our joy go for Python I would hardly say that any data scientist is trying to get their hands dirty with Java or JavaScript but that's mostly just because it's way more complicated it's actually an objectoriented language however what I will say is that art is super easy to use it was actually built by statisticians for statisticians and that means that people like analysts data scientists sociologists economists whatever don't necessarily need to have the most you know I would say strongest foundations in computer science you can just go ahead and learn our and within a few like few lines of code be able to develop an analysis even then you know develop a machine learning model um so that's why I highly like especially if it's your first programming language definitely go for are like the learning curve is just so much easier and similar to that we're seeing some questions about what exactly is is data science and do I need to have any prerequisite knowledge going into this today should I know math for we want to just spend some time showing you what are the possibilities with data science and data science is essentially just taking some data and doing something with it organizing it in a different way formatting in a different way so that we can find out some new information or recognize some patterns and so you don't need to have any background and no programming or math will explain things along the way and we just want you to be thinking about kind of what is the bigger picture what are we finding out from our analysis and what does it mean for for like our lives or for our interest or for the world or even for you personally so you know no need to fret if you don't have that background well be taking you hand in hand today well that being said Ian should we start since I think people are almost done coming in we can start with some intros if you want to kick it off yes let's do it so hi everyone welcome to our session today on analyzing Google Trends data with our my name is Ian freed and I am a senior Human Development and so what I do in my job is spend a lot of time working on designing the courses that go on the Codecademy website specifically related to data analytics and data science so in the past I've done some courses on machine learning which maybe you've heard about or natural language processing which is where we're looking at text data and trying to get some insight into that kind of data I've also worked on creating our learn our course which I will recommend as a great entry point to programming as well as to data science so after the session feel free to check that out and give it a go yourself and really excited to be here with you all today to learn a little bit about our checkout code kata me and then do some data science um so hi guys my name is camellia Hassan I am a data scientist at code Academy and I've been identified is for quite some time now I just moved to working before this I was a data scientist at uber we're very similar to what I'm doing at code Academy now um I was building out experiments designing some causal inference frameworks rebuilding machine learning models which is always fun in the space of risk and safety so I'm very very passionate about data science I think like a lot of you I'm a total math physics statistics nerd and I think for people who have these types of affinities this is a really amazing field to be in just because once you have basic understanding about a lot of these you know core methodologies you can go ahead and apply it to any type of industries may it be operations ridesharing logistics healthcare finance I mean you name it the world will always always need data scientists so that being said we have a really incredible agenda today so I know the title of the course is forecasting using Google Trends with our but Before we jump into that we're actually as Ian mentioned we're gonna go into the learning environment and we're just gonna go and do some really basic foundations of exploratory analysis you know try to figure out how to manipulate data frames and I think once we are able to do this we can actually get our hands really dirty and get into the code so once again it's very interactive if you have any questions while we are in the learning environment or at any point just chat us I'll be monitoring um and then yeah I mean overall ours just once again I couldn't say like ah such a great and easy and fun language it was built by statisticians for statisticians really with a main purpose of data analysis and of course you can do data analysis in Java and in Python but um are just so easy and for me like examples of work that I do using are is just any type of exploratory analysis where I'm looking you know am I looking at a normal or at a personal distribution am i when I'm doing hypothesis testing if I want to compute a power R has some packages within one line I can look at the sample size estimates um so I just I couldn't recommend it enough from like today really we're gonna be doing it some time series analysis so we would love to know time series analysis have you done it that being said um Ian let's let's go into the Le let's have some fun definitely and um you should see also in the zoom there is a poll going right now where you're able to answer some questions about your familiarity with our with time series analysis so make sure you're going ahead and answering that poll question it seems like we have a lot of people who are new to our haven't worked with time series analysis before which is super exciting we're gonna take you on a great journey today so I'm gonna go ahead and start sharing my screen so we can go jump into the learning environment and take a look at some are together and now as I jump into this let me say before coming to our I know a lot of you are asking these Python bizarre questions I I was a Python person that's what I started out learning when I got into data analytics data science and it was what you know was first introduced to me and I grew to love it but then about a year ago I started working with our for Coke atom II and it's been a really great journey as well I now I'm a huge fan of our in addition to Python so it's what I want to let you guys know is that it's not about one language or the other it's about which tool is gonna help you accomplish your task and when it comes to data analysis and data science Python and are both really steal the show can't go wrong with I just want to give one example because I know everyone's freaking out this are versus Python which is always super exciting but I can give you a really quick example of in one case where you would use Python versus R I think really once you become like a full stack data scientist which means that you're building machine learning models and you need like real time pipelines so you're basically needing pipelines to predict things every second every minute and there is like operational needs then yes I think Python is definitely more powerful than R however we will not be doing that today and to be honest like that just takes a lot of time a lot of effort and you can still do so money so much cool work with like what we're going to be showing you right now definitely great point camellia and on the other end of things there are some things that are can excel ads and some people's opinions one of which is often data visualization and we'll be doing a little bit of that today so you all get to see some of that advantage that we can get from so in order for us to get to that now let's dive into the learning environment we're here on our introduction to data frames and our lesson and in this lesson which we really recommend that you take some time to go through after the session over the weekend and any of the free time you have the next coming weeks and learn about how we work with data in data science and we often boat our data into something called a data frame and a data frame is essentially like a table that you might see if you're working and Google sheets or if you're working in Excel where we have rows and columns and from this table like format we're able to go ahead and do a lot of interesting analysis so it's a good foundation for us to work off of and so in this lesson you learn all about data frames and I just want to spend a little bit of time going through what this lesson looks like if you're coming to it for the first time and how we can take advantage of the power of our so in this lesson we have our code at the right you never work with code Kadim e we often have some content on the left side of the screen we have a code editor in the middle and then on the right hand side we have our browser component so this is where we're gonna see the output of our code in this case since we're working with an our notebook which is a really useful kind of file where we're able to write some code and then have it display and a rendered HTML page so we really add some dynamic ability to your code and so we can see right now when I try and run this file nothing is happening we're getting some errors and our code isn't working as we'd expect and the reason for this is we are using some are packages which are really useful collections of code that other people have written that accomplish tasks for us and that's one of the great parts of our is that there are all these packages out there of people who have spent time and research figuring out how to accomplish different data sets on ISS and they've gone ahead and put all that together for you so you need to write all that code my hand you can just use these packages well we're not loading that package into our code file right here so what I'm going to do is I'm going to load two really helpful packages I'm right here into this code block and so we can see a little code block is defined by a few backtick so three on the top three on the bottom and in here I can write our code so what I'm gonna do in here here's write library and I'm going to put the our packages I would like to load one is called the reader package and one is called supplier and these packages are part of a greater collection of packages in our that we call the tidy verse which is a collection of packages that are super helpful super useful and enable us to do a lot of these tasks and we want to go ahead and do so now that I've written in here to go ahead and load those packages I'm gonna click the Run button so we can run our code and voila amazingly now our code that we had written here is displaying all this information on the right hand side and so let's go ahead line by line and see what is going on here so we can go through together so after I load these packages on lines 8 & 9 we load our data into a data frame and so what is this data that we're actually working with we can see that there is this file artist CSV which is a CSV file which we can open up right over here and you might have seen CSV files at work or at school they essentially contain that same kind of data that you might have in a Google sheet or an Excel spreadsheet and in this format it's a little bit hard for us to read this data I can look at it and I can see some band names from around the world I'm a huge music fan a huge music lover so I love working with music data and that's I also think one of the cool things with data science is you can find data about any sort of topic that really interests you so I went ahead and show some music data for this lesson and we're going to take that CSV data and use a function from one of our packages called read CSV to load it into a data frame that we're naming artists and in this next code block we're using a few different functions to go and look at that data into data frame so right here on the right hand side we can see our artists data frame has a few different columns one is group which looks like to be showing a group name we have a country representing the country that nut band is from as well as the genre and if we click over we have a few columns representing streaming numbers so we have Spotify monthly listeners YouTube subscribers year founded and the number of albums that that band has created so we have a few different columns here of data some of these columns contain what we call encoding a string which is text data so for the band name and for the country those are strings other columns represent some numeric data that we have so like those listeners or the year founded and so we can use a few different helpful our functions to inspect or analyze this data frame one of which is the head function so that goes ahead and just just grab just the first five rows from that data frame that we have and then or four six excuse me and then we also have our summary function so the summary function which is on line 21 is able to give us some information and statistics about are the columns of our data frame so we can see here we have the min value the median value the mean and so it's writing us some quick insights about our different columns that we have one less code block that we have here in this notebook file we're doing a lot of stuff here so I want to break it down with you line by line and if anyone has any questions feel free to put them into the chat about what's going on and we'll make sure that we can jump into them so we're taking our artists data frame that we have right so that's that same collection that we had right up here and we're going to use some functions from D plier to filter and breakdown and see what's going on inside of our data frame so first we are going to use a function called select and what the Select function does is it says let's only look at certain columns of our data frame so some of them are important to us other ones aren't so in this case I'm telling on line 27 that we do not want to see that country column the year founded column or the albums column those aren't important to me we're gonna take them out and remove them and really quick click now because I see a lot of people were also asking about how are relates to sequel and for those sequel lovers you'll see that their functions select is very similar so you can really just think of that block of code from line 26 to 30 as a really long select from where function condensed in our syntax so there's definitely a bunch of similarity than actually for those who like started learning sequel and then are moving to our it's a really easy way to put things into perspective definitely before I ever knew R or Python even I had that background with sequel and so I had learned those select from you know ordering by and a lot of those same concepts filter on right over to R so now lets you talk about another function that we can do in R that is similar to a sequel statement actually so it's equal if you work with that we can use a where clause where we say we are looking for rows that have a certain value in a column well in our we can use our filter function so in line 28 we are using a filter function and we're saying let's only take the rows of this data frame where thus modified monthly listeners is greater than this number which is I'm checking right now 20 million so if we have any rows where the number of Spotify monthly listeners is greater than 20 20 million we want those rows and we're also going to pass another condition that we only want groups that are not in the genre of hiphop and so in this case I could have said I only want groups to have a genre of rock or a genre of electronic but here we're specifically saying we just want any group that has the Spotify multi listener is greater than 20 million but a genre that is not hiphop and then on our last line also going back to sequel if you're familiar about that order by Clause here we're using the arrange function and this says let's order or arrange the rows of this data frame by certain columns so in this case we want to order our data frame by the number of YouTube subscribers but we want to do it in descending order so that means going from the greatest value to the lowest value so if we take a look at what that code looks like when we've run it we can see that we now only have three rows three groups ruin five imagine dragons and Coldplay so if we have any fans of these groups in the chat feel free to shout it out we can see that these are all rock bands rock is you know pretty Universal popular genre all across the world and we can see they all have spawned five monthly listeners that are over that twenty million number so we can see here since we're or arranging by number of YouTube subscribers that the band has the highest number of YouTube subscribers which is 240 million seven hundred eleven and 114 is maroon 5 so it seems like they are our big big popular band so I see L pretty happy about that I'm glad that you're a band that you love is being represented hold plays number three coral call play number three and I see a great question in the chat from Alina um what exactly does the pipe operator do and so the pipe operator is this funkylooking symbol right here with a % carry and % and this is something that I think is pretty unique to our and specifically to the tidy verse which is this collection of packages that we're working with here and if you're familiar with programming at all or have any background or experience typically when you're using a function you'll pass in a variety of arguments so for example with this select line or select function we're saying we don't want the country we don't want your founded and we don't want the album's on line 27 and typically we would also as a first argument directly pass in our artists data frame right here so if we wanted to just do this in one line like this we would write something like that with artists as a first argument but the pipe symbol enables us to write code in a way that I think makes a lot of sense and is helpful when you want to do multiple or use multiple functions in a row so in this case I want to take that artists data frame and I want to select certain columns from it on line 27 then I want to filter on line 28 and then I want to arrange or order them on line 29 and so this pipe operator is allowing us to basically say let's do that selection on line 27 and then take that selection and now use the pipe to send it to our filter function and once I do that filtering on line 28 let's use the pipe again to pipe that filtered data frame into our arranged function so lets us write our code in a sequential order that you traditionally wouldn't be able to do so a great question of a liter awesome so this was a nice little quick jump into the learning environment into our but there's so much more that we have in store for you all today and it's going to take us venturing off platform venturing to other parts of the web so if you want to circle back to our learn our course we highly recommend that you do that in your free time after the session later today or over the weekend and check it out for yourself it's a really easy start to your programming journey and I think you had a lot of fun cool so um yeah just another this was we did everything and like one lesson but if you actually take the time to do the lesson you'll see that it'll be breaking broken down so you know a lot of people are like what's a pipe you know operator there will be you know like one lesson specifically on that and then another one on like select and you know understanding tidy verse so I think like if you take your time you'll be able to just break it down more and have a deeper understanding of what's really happening in terms of the language but now it is time to get into some forecasting using Google Trends um so I think Before we jump into the code I want to talk about Google Trends um so little trends is going to be the data source that we will be using today I'm gonna have a quick voice over but you'll see Ian on the Google Trends website and for those all of you online feel free to kind of get on that website and play around it is an amazing publicly available data set and really for those who are unfamiliar with it all of it met measures is relevant hits and kind of of all of your search queries and it's not just with me or review but all over the world I think what's really great about Google Trends is that you're able to look at it from like as a total time series so let's say if I were to search sushi I would be able to set see how the hits of sushi because I'm getting hungry has changed over time and then another cool thing is that and actually even compare things so especially these days you're feeling a little bit bored you can compare well how is sushi and pizza doing across the way in the last five years and so really what it's going to do it's going to take all of those queries that all of us in the world have queried for and then just be able to compare the interest over time now Google Trends can compare only five things at a time so we'll have to we'll have to raise ourselves and then you cannot also look at it not only from a time series perspective but you can look at it geographically by category interest by region interest by City um so super super interesting data sets and one of the reasons actually that there's been a lot of papers published using this data sets is that there is a hypothesis that there's a very strong correlation with the actual level of activity or you know kind of interest in that actual matter so you know if depending on whatever like application you're looking into it so in this case today we're going to be using Google Trends and what you'll see is that there's a fantastic our package and arm function that just takes that data and will be used for our case today to analyze now forecasting forecasting is one of my favorite topics in data science and I think it's somebody it's something it's not a person thing that all of you have had exposure in one you know you've probably learned about it in your statistics class you've heard about it in terms whether folk at forecasts electricity demand sales customer supports tickets I'm you don't all things that you can forecast and that's what we're going to be doing using the Google Trends data set now how are we gonna forecast I wouldn't I wouldn't be freaking out right now if none of you have you know haven't even taken a intro to statistics course that is okay because the really cool thing about forecasting is that there are so many methodologies out there there are some really naive ways to do sis to do forecasting sometimes you can just really take the mean of your historical time series and use that as your proxy for a forecast or sometimes you can literally take your last observation and whatever you see in your data set that would be your proxy for your forecast as well today we're actually going to be doing something more complex but actually be able to deliver it in such a simple way using the profit package I know I have a very glamorous look names so for those of you who haven't heard about profit profit is a library to the package that is created by Facebook now what does profit do profit is essentially a forecasting it is a forecasting package that any one of us have access to that we're going to teach you how to install and that you can apply to your data set another really cool thing about profit is that you don't necessarily need to have like some really deep understanding on regression models or like complex statistical methodologies all you need to do is really understand what is it trying to extract yep I'm slowing down guys sorry this is me getting so motivated so it's something that you just need to understand what is the seasonality what is the trend and then you apply profit to your data set and it will apply the forecast so I understand I spoke very very quickly and do not worry we are gonna go through this with the code and I think I will be able to reiterate it once you guys see it in real life so that is all from me you take it away hold on one moment before I don't know if we want to while transitioning or before transitioning take a moment to get to some of these great questions that we have open yeah great great mention ELISA and so I'm looking through some of these right now so Jeff is asking when working in data science what percentage of time is spent scrubbing data versus analyzing data so you can ask this question to a lot of data scientists or data analysts and you get a variety of answers but there is a lot of truth to this idea that so much time for an analyst might be spent on cleaning or organizing data and getting it ready for that analysis phase this can depend on the environment that you're working in so there are some organizations or companies where there's good data infrastructure and you know these data cleaning tasks maybe aren't as timeconsuming but I would say from from you know what I know what I hear there's can often be a lot of time doing that cleaning an organization which in my opinion can be a ton of fun I really enjoy it it's a cool part of doing data analysis but you do also get to spend a lot of time doing that you know actual analyzing or building models or interpreting your data too so I would say that most most jobs have exposure to both sides of Camellia would would you agree with that yes I would and unfortunately it's one of the it's one of the activities of a data scientist that we enjoy the least it's really cleaning the data and there's always a basic kind of I want to say 6040 rule where you have to spend 60% actually getting the data tailoring it trying to make sure that it's reliable doing a bunch of QA and then getting it to a format or you can then actually do the really cool analysis and modeling yes Joe I hate cleaning data it's really not my specialty but we're all you know we're all we all have to do it unfortunately part of the job so some other questions we see here this is a good one that maybe Camellia you can chat a little bit about we have a question from Steve and asking is a forecast and I have a hypothesis the same thing that is a very very good question so actually this is what your question is actually very smart in the sense that you need to have four you need to have hypotheses first of all as a data scientist as an analyst all we come prepared with a hypothesis you need to have an intuition of what's happening and what's driving the data right once you have an understanding of what's actually happening and what is your data like then you're going to have to have a bunch of assumptions that you're gonna have to give and that's what makes really the job of a data scientist irreplaceable is the assumptions that you're putting and you are applying to your data set and so that's going to be able to really kind of configure the forecasts that you use and so right now I will definitely dive into this when we look at our when we look at our application we're gonna have to apply a bunch of assumptions to our forecast but thankfully profit is already going to apply but you will be able depending on the data set that you use in future use and depending of course on the hypothesis you'll have to configure as as as you see fit great question and then we also have another question about what is the difference between forecasting and predicting and can these terms be used interchangeably so I would say that a forecast is a type of prediction we hear this word prediction a lot in data analysis data science and a prediction can be one of a variety of things maybe we are predicting the type of user if we're looking at a bunch of user data so what is maybe like the characteristics of this user or maybe we are predicting a house price based on a variety of factors such as number of bedrooms or the bathrooms but a forecast in itself is a prediction of a future value of something that we are analyzing so that was a great question and so basically forecasting can be aporia's prediction a prediction can mean a lot of different things and the thing is is that as Ian said forecasting and predicting uses basically the same I mean you they are essentially tied together the methodologies that you use for forecasting such as regressions those are the same methods that you're going to be using in any type of you know machine learning and doing a logistic regression and doing a linear regression um so definitely I mean forecasting is part of the modeling and predictive analytics world cool so we have a few more questions I'm I'm seeing a few about the tidy verse and as we jump into our code in our studio I'm will chat a little bit more about that there and so I think we'll move forward into this next step so we can get our hands dirty on a little more code and we'll circle back in to answer some more questions in a bit I will be monitoring the chat and a QA apologies if I don't get to everyone but I will focus on you I promise yeah we love all your questions thank you so much for you know be inquisitive that is one of the I think really defining characteristics of a data analyst or data scientist is asking questions I'm asking questions about the data where the data is coming from if you have someone who's telling you to look at the data and do some insights you should be asking that person questions why why are you interested in this metric what assumptions are you making about the data why why are you interested in it asking questions is really one of the greatest tools that you have out there so keep it up everyone and as Ian logs in and starts working in our I'll give you guys a fun fact I remember when I was a kid everyone was always telling me Camellia you're so curious you don't need to know that stop asking questions and well jokes on them I guess now this intrinsic curiosity is really helping me in my day to day definitely definitely cool so I switched over to our studio which is a interactive development environment for our and when you're going and getting started with our use code Academy check out our lessons it's a great playground for exploring but there comes a time with most programmers when they want to go and start coding on their computer itself and our studio is the best way on your local computer for you to go ahead and do that and so throughout this session we'll do some exploration of our studio I'll show you how to run code in here utilize some of the features and functionality and you'll see that it's a really great tool for writing code in our and on code Academy we have access to a video that we'll go ahead and also show you how to work with our studio that you will have access to temporarily as the part of this whole session so feel free to check that out awesome so let's go ahead and get started with doing some analysis on some Google Trends data so people were asking about how do we work at the tiny purse when in the example we were only going ahead and loading in deep liar and reader so reader and deep liar are part of the tiny birds so we can use our library function to load that package explicitly by just saying library with GPIO reader as a argument or we can just use tiny bursts overall and this tool automatically load for us all the packages in the tidy verse so there are a lot of them out there does it be a simpler thing to do when you're working locally um and we'll do not here in addition there are few other packages that we're gonna use here today that I'm going to load right here and a start for us when it's called lewberty this package is really useful for working with date data so it's a kind of a play on the word lubricate because it makes working with dates easy I like that one there's lots of punny names with our and our universe so I always enjoy that another package we're going to be using as G trends are this package enables us to go and search Google Trends for the specific search terms that we want and get that trend data additionally we're going to use the profit package as Camellia was mentioning created by basically sorry Ian Cara is definitely right did you misspelt ID verse hi Dean thank you so I do this all the time I misspell things when I'm coding and then I go ahead and run my code which I'm gonna try and do right now and we're gonna see I got this error so thank you so much for calling that out I'm gonna go ahead and update this to tidy burst and now when I go ahead and run the code in just a second we should see no issues don't worry about you know sometimes spelling things wrong it happens when you're coding happens to me all the time thankfully we have errors which help us got us in the right direction so great call out and then one less package we're going to use is the maps package and this package will enable us to do some visualizations with maps which are I think really fun really useful we're seeing a lot of these visualizations today with the ongoing kovat 19 situation for visualizing you know cases and things like that so we'll do a little example here today and so in art studio i'm able to run a code block using some keyboard shortcuts so for anyone out there who does work in our studio or it's gonna get started with it that's command shift enter and I'm able to run that code and get those packages going um sorry one more comment I think there's some confusion how do we follow along on this so I think this is a little bit different from what we did previously in the le where you guys um had access to the learning environment and could run it on your own we're really this is what we're gonna be doing right now is just showing you how to use this code and so just really all you need to do to be honest is just listen and look and then we'll be providing the code so after you can go ahead and play around with it and run on your own so really all you need to do is just listen and learn yeah and at the end we will share this file with you so you're able to go ahead download our studio yourself and then play around with the code or run it in your own environment um but like Amelia said just sit listen and feel free to ask questions along the way and we'll be asking you some questions too to get some so let's go ahead and get that Google Trends data so we're able to do this using that G trench package I'm gonna use a function called G Trends and this function if we want to get an idea of how it works or what we need for it we're able to go ahead and use a helpful feature of our studio which is this help feature so if I just put a question mark in front of a function I can go ahead and do on a Mac command enter and you'll see in this bottom right hand corner it brings up the documentation for dysfunction and documentation as I'm sure you may have heard from people is a really important part of the coding process documentation is essentially instructions that were written by the creators of packages that explain to you how to use the different functions that they're using they tell you what kind of data you need to put into it what you get out of these functions and overall it's really helpful when you're trying to go and write some code so we can see here that this G Tron's function as arguments takes a few things that we're going to use today and we're going to use the keyword argument the geo argument and the time argument so the keyword argument represents the search terms that we want to use so before we search for sushi and pizza but this time we are going to search for a few different programming languages and so today we're gonna focus on two that you might have heard I heard of Python and Java so in addition to providing two G trends which terms we want you to take a look at we're also going to provide another argument of Geo and the geo argument represents which geographic region we want to focus on so in this case we for today just to make our analysis a little bit easier we're gonna focus on the US so be looking at different interests in the search terms Python and Java I'm throughout the u.s. lastly we're gonna use this time argument in order to limit our search to a specific time period and so we want to look back from today so this current date and then go five years into the past so this plus five is saying let's go back five and then the Y saying five years if I was only interested in going back five months I could change this Y to an M I want to go back five days I can D but we want to go back all the way to 2015 and use Y and I want to save the output of the search to a variable that I'm gonna call mine we'll go and run this code blue on says I'm getting an error and what is my error here so um let's see if I take out this keywords I think it might be true to do keyword we'll give this a shot there we go so misspelling my argument came there but we have to give this a little bit of time to load because what the G times R package is doing is it's going to Google Trends searching these terms for us going back five years and storing it our land area bowl um so let's go ahead and take a look at this variable and by the way guys when you do have access to this code and start playing around with it on your own have fun with it change the parameters like if you're from Kenya look at like the different trends on different top searches if you're from Brazil like look at what's been happening in like forests versus you know anything else be creative these are the things we're really you'll just become a total expert and whatever data said that you're looking at and that's a great point camellia another thing of data science that I was touching on a little bit before is kind of the topic or the domain of interest and so we're talking about programming programming languages here since we love programming we work at an educational technology company and something that we're passionate about but let's say you're a sports fan um you can feel free to update those keywords to different sports or if you love food different food options or video games you can put it in popular video games here whatever your interest is feel free to go find data related to that I think it's one of the really interesting about data science is being able to dive into whatever it is that excites you one of the fun things that you guys can actually do because I'm sure that all of you will want to go on vacation after this you know this era you can go ahead and be able to use this code to like look at different top holiday destinations and then like predict how popular this holiday holiday destinations are gonna be so you can figure out you can do some price wrangling and figure out what will be maybe the cheapest ones those are just some ideas I mean there's you can literally spend hours on this once again total dirt totally so many options so many ways you can go so when we're looking at this Lang variable we can see it's spitting out all this data and so this data looks like those data frames that we were looking at before and that would be a good guess because they are data frames when we're getting multiple data frames here so we have a lot of different data and so we're able to go and get an idea of how is this data organized by quickly looking at the the names of the different data frames that we have stored in here so I'm gonna pass our Lang variable into this names function and it's showing us that we have all these different data frames one is interest over time and this is what we'll be using for that time series analysis we can also look at interest by country or interest by region and if we actually looked at interest by country here we would find this data frame empty because we are only searching on us but if we did a global search we'd have all these different countries here and can do a cool analysis but for today we're gonna just go and quickly look at interest by region as a quick starch so if we do lying interest by region and when I start typing in a name of one of these data frames we can see it pops up automatically as a different option so I can click interest by region and the way that we access that's a big data frame within lying is we use this dollar sign operator so we're saying within the Lang variable let's go grab that interest by region and now I'm gonna use our pipe operator and let's try and take a look at the regions that are most interested in Python let's think that's something that we once you get out of this data um and actually before I do this it'll probably be helpful for us to take a look at this data really quickly so I'm going to show that right here so let's look at this data what do we have here right it's easier for us to decide what and I'll so you want to do once we see what we have we have a column location that represents different states we have our hits column which is representing that Google trend popularity so that's what is that interest in this topic so 100 being high is eroding the lowest then we have the keyword so that's the actual search term of interest and then we also have a few other columns so we have the geography US but we're not gonna worry about those right now let's just think about that hits and the keyword and location so if I wanted to see which states are most interested in Python what I can do is use that pipe operator and say let's filter this to only show the rows where the keyword is and I could choose here either Python or Java so let's say I want to look at Java I will then use our pipe operator and then say let's arrange these rows by keyword in per sorry by hits in descending order this is saying in descending order write the rows that are I have the highest value for hits with the keyword Python and I only want to see the top 10 rows so I'll use this head function that we were mentioned earlier which just grabs the first number of rows in the data frame that you ask it to so if I pass in 10 here and I'll grab us just the first 10 rows and if we go ahead and run this we can now see the states that have the greatest interest in Java so at the top we have Washington and Virginia I'm so we have one West Coast state one East Coast State and then we also have Massachusetts California Maryland rapping out that top five and really easily if I wanted to go ahead and just see what is the most popular States for a Python I can just go ahead and change that keyword to Python on my code and now we have the states where python is most popular Massachusetts California Washington so it seems like Massachusetts or Washington big coding places and this is one of those things that I think is really fun is to think about why like why is may or may be people looking up coding in these places and a way that we can dig into this a little bit further is let's go ahead and change the data frame really quickly instead of looking at our data frame interest by region let's change us to interest by city so it's gonna be a very similar analysis but instead of the location being a state we're gonna see it by city I'm gonna run this we get some interesting so the most popular place for City for Python is mountain view I don't anyone out there knows if there are certain companies that are based in Mountain View maybe that has to do with it maybe there are some Googlers that are out there searching for Python but that is a possibility so these are the kind of insights that can be fun to search into when you're kind of looking through a data frame to see what you can find and so going back to that question about you know hypothesis testing I think this is like really the power of exploratory analysis right once you start looking at these different types of distributions by city by country by region then in whatever you know in whatever industry or framework you're in that's when you can start building out these these types of hypotheses of like oh well um is there you know are people who are interested in Python or overall in programming and in Mountain View than in anywhere else in the world well what are the things that we can do to test us out and how is that going to affect our forecast so really that's the point of these types of exploratory analysis great great point Camellia and we have a good question from Rachel are the list of hits normalized to 100 and so this hits column is representing relative interests so basically what it's saying is yes we're kind of normalizing from zero to 100 so it's looking like over in a relative manner right like where is this language like most popular or at least popular so yes it isn't that kind of fixed range 0 to 100 it is not exactly a hundred hits there are I'm sure or more than 100 searches for the word Python from a view great question though and that's something that you'll see in data a lot maybe were normalizing variables which might mean we're changing the range that they go over in order to aid in our analysis cool so now that we've done this a little bit of exploratory analysis on our data frame it can sometimes be helpful to make a visualization to showcase what we're talking about so it's one thing to look at a list of places where something is popular but if we have that visual with it can be a little more intriguing or interesting um so let's quickly go ahead and make a visualization that will showcase um where certain languages are popular by state so we're gonna go ahead and I'm gonna write some code quickly to do this for us and essentially we're gonna map this data to an actual map of the United States so I'm gonna say I'm gonna use this map data function from the maps package and I'm going to pass in state here and what this is doing is it's grabbing the actual latitude and longitudes of all the US states and grabbing them in this data frame which we're gonna use to do some plotting really quickly and for the sake of time I'm going to copy in some code that I have prewritten I'm so we're able to see this visualization and make sure that we get to the forecasting that we have since I want you all to be able to see this cool visualization but make sure that we get to talk about that forecasting as well I'm gonna do this only for Python or Java so if you can do a quick shout out in the chat if you want to see this this map for a Java or for Python let me know and we'll do the one that we're seeing we're getting more responses from we got a lot of Python here a lot of Python okay so let's do this for scientists I can tell Python lovers so what I'm doing here this is some code that is taking this interest by region data frame that we had up here this is interest by city knob or take that interest by region data frame I'm gonna do a few things to it quickly we're going to create a new column based on the location where we're just lower casing all those values in that column and this enables us to use this data in coordination with the state data that we've looked downloaded from the maps package so we can see this region column is all lowercase but before our locations were had a capital letter so now we're just removing those capitals so we're working in the same format and then we're gonna filter our data frame to only have rows where our region or state in this case is one of the states that we have in this state table and then we're gonna select just two columns to look at the region or the state and the popularity which is the hits we're gonna order it in descending order by fits so now we see for python these are those most popular states and now let's go ahead and create that visualization with ggplot so ggplot is a package that is really amazing for doing visualizations in our and it's I would say a really user friendly plotting package I've worked with madpal live and Python if any of you are familiar with that which is also a really great and useful tool but there is a little bit of a learning curve that comes with using MATLAB and our ggplot is a little bit easier to get up to speed with and don't worry if you don't recognize or understand this code a bunch of payson right now if you start going through our learn our course you can learn more about ggplot and some of those functions and we'll briefly chat about it and take a look at what's going on here briefly but what we are doing is we are using ggplot to add a few maps so we see this geo map here on line 46 to 49 and 5253 and essentially what's happening here as we are creating maps with different data the first map we're creating is the actual state map where we're using that longitude and latitude data to plot out the actual states so we can see the shapes of them and visualize that the next step is going at an adding Ana this popularity data that we have right here so now we're saying on top of that blank map that we created let's go ahead and fill in that information about which states really enjoy Python and we've added in a few more things here that kind of changed the axis so we can see the data more clearly and I just change some of our labels were able to see them more easily we go ahead and run this data we're now able to get this awesome map which I want to expand for us all right here expanding the wrong way this is actually a really and this is I know some people were like ggplot or matplotlib and so this is actually a really easy way to be you know to actually visualize the results in a map versus in a bar chart or in a time series and so here you clearly see that the top hits are in California in Massachusetts and unfortunately in this in more states in the south or now Midwest are there it is less relevant let's say um so I highly recommend to like when you are doing a lot of these types of data analysis to think of a lot of the creative ways that you can actually visualize it especially when you're you know presenting to stakeholders or to leadership it just summarizes so much in one easy in one easy picture great so I'm just looking in the chat to see we have any questions here anyone what's happening right now I think it looks like people are being pretty like thinking really critically about the data it's coming up I really appreciate the like we're trying to understand why California being such a huge state like I do not appreciate what's happening and yet these are the kinds of questions that are great to ask the the data helps us see what is happening but then there's the question of why sometimes and that's where it helps to kind of have some knowledge about the data that you're working with or to have that background because once you're able to see what is going on you can use that knowledge to explain the changes that we're seeing and provide that insight so great questions everyone so I'm just I just have to our our data manager our data team manager is hanging out in the chat and being funny I wonder if you can spot her yeah total credits to her she was giving me tips IRL hey cat awesome so now that we've gone ahead and done some of this exploratory analysis seen our data visualized in different ways let's focus in on the test that we have which is that forecasting and looking at our data over time so to do this let's look at our data frame of the interest over time let me take a look at it here really quickly we have a few different columns we have the date we have the hits which is that popularity we have the keyword those are the columns that we're gonna be focusing on for this analysis and so in order for us to go ahead and get this data ready for our time series there's a few things we can do so let's go ahead and do a little bit of data cleaning on this data so let's take this laying interest over time and we are going to do some manipulation so first I'm going to pass this into a function called a Sybil and don't have to worry about this function too much this is essentially just converting this data frame into a type of data room that works better in the tiny purse so don't able us to do some manipulation more easily and handle this data a bit better and then we're going to do a little more data cleaning where we're going to update our date column to a different date format which will help us or more easily plot and work with this data and then in addition we are also going to do a filter to only look at data that is occurring from at least a week ago and back so we don't wanna look at data from the last week there could be some noise in that data I mean you just want to focus on data from before that time so to do that I'm gonna say I want the date to be less than and I can use this date which will hold the current date and we want to say that we want this date to be at least seven days before this current date and I'm going to save this to a variable Lang time series cool and we have that and I can also just showcase this you quickly and then we're gonna do a really quick visualization on this data before we go ahead into our modeling and we're seeing the requests to slow down a little I think that Ian and camellia are trying to make this a very actionpacked 90 minutes yeah succeeding at making this an actionpacked 90 minutes for you this will be available as a recorded version on YouTube and fingers crossed that this ends up in your email inbox too since you registered so you will find this again and be able to slow it down okay I'll stop and the only reason I think we might be going a little quicker than we would want to is we're just so excited to get to the forecast in the time series part so bear with us we we will get there yeah and you know it can definitely seem like a lot and it is a lot if you're coming to this never having worked with our before so don't feel bad if you're not understanding every line of code or what's happening this will be like we said available to you to take a look at later on and you can dive into it and you know look back and see again what was happening so and thank you for whoever and the chat was posting that more information with the Google Trends data I think that's really helpful for getting an understanding of what is happening with that hits or a relative interest column but essentially what I just did here was change the format of our date so it's easier for us to work with and we're just looking at dates from a week ago back to 2015 so I don't want to look at this past week a week ago to 2015 and let's do a really quick visualization on this data so I'm gonna take our Wang time series and I'm going to pipe it into ggplot and with ggplot there is this weird kind of little different thing where we use this plus sign sort of the pipe symbol when we're piping our information into a different or the next function in this case instead of making a map like we were last time we're going to make a line graph so we can look at this plot over time and what we are going to be plotting over time is our date on the xaxis and then we want on our yaxis to be that popularity or the hits in addition we're looking at both Python and Java here so we're gonna add one more parameter here which is assigning the color to be recognized as our keyword so we could choose to just plot the Python interest over time and we wouldn't need to add in this color keyword if we maybe go and filter our data to just be Python but because we have both Python and Java we're gonna edit this additional keyword so it'll put them both in their own color and lastly I'm going to add one more parameter here of size equal to one which says how big do we want to draw this plot so I'm going to go ahead and run this code and we can get a really quick visualization of what this data or this time series data looks like over time you can see we start and maybe camellia if you want to jump into analyzing this for us I mean yeah I mean this is I think where the core of the time series analysis actually begin so what CEA's xaxis the date which we've been pulling from Google Trends and our yaxis is the hits and so I think one thing that you would never have been able to visualize if you just looked at this in tabular format is that overall the trend which once again is a very key term in time series analysis the trend for Java is decreasing whereas the trend in Python is increasing and you see that really starting around 2016 you're starting seen this kind of shift where the hits kind of like a bifurcated and so that's when you can start developing a lot of these hypotheses however Travis I think has just mentioned it which is no one is searching code on new years as you guys see these are cyclical trends and every single year starting you know December December 20th or so there's just this huge dip where people are just like done I'm not interested in programming I just want to spend time with my family for holidays and so this is something that definitely we'll be able to replicate in the in in the in the forecast because this is a really core element of our time series and then in terms of hypothesis really one of the reasons that you could potentially think about why the interest in Java is decreasing versus Python is increasing is that for example in data science you start seeing that Python is a language that can definitely easily be used for so many applications and then there's a lot of the core functionalities of Java that make it a little bit more of a tougher language to learn can be used with similar applications in Python one hypothesis but there's so many things that you can derive from this plot great thanks for that analysis camellia and one of the things that I just want to go back to what Gigi plot is in three lines of code we were able to go ahead and create this plot which i think is really awesome really user friendly and even if you don't you know know the ggplot syntax at this time that's totally okay you can check out our course on GG plot which will go ahead and all the code that's here and if you get to that lesson you'll be able to create a chart just like this so now that we have this time series data we can move on to that really exciting part of modeling and so a lot of people keep asking questions the chat about you know what does that split between cleaning and getting data ready and the modeling and so we're finally getting to that point now where we can do that model make those predictions and so we're going to do this using the profit package so I'm going to create a new variable that will store our model I'm gonna call it Python M to represent the model and I'm now going to use the profit function from the profit package and I'm going to pass into it our time series data I know there's actually one thing that I'm forgetting to do before this and we just want to focus on the Python data at this time and not worry about our Java data so I'm gonna do a really quick sub setting of our data and cleaning it so it is ready for modeling so I take it back it's a little more cleaning that we need to do in order for us to go ahead and make that model so I'm going to take our lang time series and I'm going to filter it for a keyword equal to Python so I only want the rows of our data frame where the keyword is Python and then I only want two columns from the state of frame I want that date column and I want the hits column so we're only interested right now and like the date of interest and the level of interest on that date and there's one more thing we need to do to work specifically with the profit package is we need to rename these columns for data frame since when we pass this data over to profit and once that data in a particular format profit is picky we have to appease it so in order to go ahead and do that we're going to rename our date column TS which i can do using this rename function and I say I want the new name to be equal to this ole name and then we want to rename our hits column with bi and lastly we want to go ahead and arrange this and order update just so we have it in that nice border of starting out with our oldest data moving forward to our newest data and we can go ahead and look at this variable as well and we can now or this data frame we can now see we have this DES column starting from April 12 2015 and the interest in Python was 43 and if I go all the way to the end if I click this 26 here we can see that the most recent data is that week ago or about a week ago March 29 interest of 75 so we see that general increase from 43 to 75 over the last five years I'm now gonna go and take that time Python time series data that we have pass it in to our profit function and when I run this this is gonna actually go ahead and create this model for us if you're doing this on your local computer the first time you do this it might take a little bit of time to actually go and run that model I'm the profit package is doing a lot of stuff on the back end doing some math some calculations building that model for you and finding out I'm kind of all that information that's hidden in that data so it's recognizing are we seeing a general increase potentially in our data or is there that seasonality right now new years you know dip that we were seeing things like that I didn't remember that essentially what profit does is curve fitting and so as Ian mentioned it has to be able to capture all of these patterns and understand what are the underlying what are those parameters in order to create the most robust forecast so that's why you just have to be patient with it when it runs and yeah great point patients once again a virtue of a JSON as well so the next step for us is to go ahead and think about how far in the future do we want to make predictions and this is a good thing that you should discuss or think about and plan before you go ahead and start making predictions for ten years into the future you know I was thinking once when I was learning data science learning that I could forecast things I was like okay let me go grab some stock market data and let me go predict what's gonna happen over the next few years so I know exactly where to put my stocks and I'll make all this money why is that maybe not a good idea correct me on this sorry I was answering some chats can your people no worries I'm just saying how when I was first thinking about forecasting and learned that I could go predict out or forecast things maybe a few years into the future I was thinking about putting all my money into these stocks based on my forecast over the next five years or ten years why is that maybe not a great idea yeah I mean markets are very volatile and you definitely want to just have a forecast as close to the present as possible because as you keep extending to two years three years five years you have less of an understanding of what happened in the kind of near in a not only in the in the history in the last year but you're just gonna have like way more error and your residuals will keep growing so definitely keep it in a very non volatile market such so I highly do not recommend to try do not try forecasting come out of the indices or anything relating to finance and just 365 days anything past that it's it's really just gonna be a directional approximation at best and ask or oil so we can make some predictions but we want to keep them in that smaller range Thank You camellia so to go ahead and make a decision on how far we want to go and make these predictions we use this make future data frame function from profit and what this will do is it will create a data frame of it's for us that will include the dates of our actual data that we have so that passed five years from 2015 up through last week and we're gonna go ahead and then look at another 365 days into the future so we use this period equals 365 keyword right I'm with that value of 365 to say let's look 365 days in advance so I passed that with our model that we created into this make feature data frame function and let's take a look at what we get out of this really quickly we see it just gives us this data frame that starts once again in 2015 of April so like we saw that original five years ago but now if we go to the end it's taking us all the way through 2021 March 29th so instead of being up to a week ago we now have dates all the way to a year from now now we get to go ahead and actually use our model to make those predictions and so to do that we use a handy function that is built into our called predict and the predicts function takes any model that you built and it applies that model to a set of data that you feed to it so we're gonna pass them to predict our profit model as one argument and then as a second argument we are going to pass in our dates so the Python present huge future and I'm going to save this into a variable I'm gonna name Python future and let's go ahead and take a look at this as well and now one more thing I'm gonna do actually before I take a look at this data frame is I'm going to once again use that as table function in order to make this data frame easier for us to work with and now let's take a look at this Python future data that we have there's a lot of great stuff in this data frame that we are going to use so I think it helps to take a second to dive into it and talk a little bit about those columns yeah briefly since I know we are getting short on time community one take a look at discuss one of the best things that we can do is why don't we plot this as a time series so then we can actually go through these sorry that was a lot of noise but we can go through the lock lower and upper bounds and then um I can explain to you what the trend and the additive terms are I think that'll be way helpful than just looking at the data frame awesome great point visualizations are always better than looking at tables and so in order for us to do this for the sake of time there's a little bit of code that I'm just going to paste in here that allows us to do some data cleaning on this data frame so what we're doing here is we're taking this data frame with predictions or forecasts that we made and we are essentially saying let's segment this data into what we actually already had the real data from the past five years and then data from the forecasts so that next year out that were predicting and we just want to make that distinction there so we're able to plot those separately and so I'm sorry that we're not going to dive into this code here there's a lot of fun stuff that we could discuss but I want to make sure that we get to that visualization and now with this data frame we can go ahead and plot this data so what I'm going to do is I'm going to take that Python forecast that we just created and I'm gonna pipe it into ggplot and I'm going to add a few different genomes here to represent different things so first we're gonna do a line graph of our actual data so I want to plot the date versus um inside our date here is D s so the date versus the number of hits which is our Y here and then we're going to and this will plot that actual data that we saw before in our visualization so over the last five years what is going on there and if I plot that quickly we can see that right this is the same data that we have from before just for our Python now let's go ahead and we will add in some code that showcases the forecast that we had and also since we have eight minutes I am going to just paste this in normally I'd walk through it but I want to make sure that we have time to discuss the visualization which is ultimately what we are all here to see and I'm just gonna make sure this is all good all right so let's take a look at this because this is the big the big interesting results this isn't really the final product right this is your forecast essentially and so you'll see that the red part is specifically the part that you predicted based on those five years of data you'll see that the shade those are your predator essentially your prediction intervals so when you saw in that previous data frame upper and lower that's exactly what it was predicting and that's just giving you a cushion of based on the forecast what you can expect that it won't go over and under and yes somebody Travis it predicted new years and why is that because it's an it is an additive regression model it will predict your seasonality and it will protect your trend and so your trend was that since 2015 it was increasing and that is exactly what we are seeing starting 2020 Anna you know at a different slope but it's still increasing now what you're seeing then it also predicts is exactly that seasonality is that every single year December you know the usage or the relevance of that programming languages dips and that's exactly what it's doing um so really this was just a really great example to show you how first of all robust of a prophet is it's a really excellent forecasting package but it also really analyzes the data in order to come up with the most accurate and robust prediction great Thank You camellia for that explanation and what we're even able to do with the profit package is dig a little bit further into what is going on in terms of that seasonality that we were discussing and that trend we're able to do that using this function profit clock components and if we pass into this function our model and our forecast data this is what I love the most because you know it was one thing for me to just do that voice over on like how I would interpret that prediction but profit once again here extracts the seasonality and the trend component of that data set of that time series and tells you exactly what I was just saying how starting 2015 that trend was an increasing trend but at a I don't let so it was increasing more slowly starting 2019 right that's something that we were also seen in the prediction and then can you scroll down a little bit Ian for the early for the seasonality yeah so that's exactly what you see starting man even before no vet yeah I think that's about Thanksgiving actually starting Thanksgiving you start seeing that the hits of Python just decreases dramatically and now this is all cool and I love I mean you know once again if you're interested in this type of stuff if you want to understand how our model works these are some really cool trends to be able to understand but why is this even more relevant in let's say in an operation or in logistics or in supply chain because when you're actually trying to say okay like I need this number of supply for the month of November well you're gonna use your historical time series to be able to say well you know between September and November my supply is always between X you know X amount and Z amount which this is where the confidence intervals come in and you're really able to have a stronger more solid understanding of your business if you're able to understand me seasonality and trends call you in awesome thank you for that explanation camellia and now what we can do quickly with our few remaining minutes is take a look at our Java data and I'm just gonna go and paste in a bunch of code here that's essentially replicating what we were doing earlier I'm but it's not able to go and look at both our Java and Python together so I'm just gonna grab this and let's run some of this code so what's happening here is we're creating that time series for just Java like we did with Python and we're gonna go and build our model for Java make those pick shion's on or this forecast for the next year and we're gonna do a little bit of data cleaning segmenting our data into the data that we already have versus what our forecast is and now we're gonna go and combine that forecast data for both Python and Java into one data frame and then we can go ahead and plot it all together so now we can see what those google trends look like over time for the past and for our forecast for both Java and Python here so what's the what's the outlook for Java Camellia are we are we gonna see a Java resurgence I don't know I don't know it's just this graph does not give me much confidence I will definitely say that it's at best staying at the level that it was in 2020 with similar seasonality for Christmas 2021 um and Python is gonna keep increasing which I'm very excited to see yes yes seems like Python is having having a good moment I'm interested to run this analysis on R and see how R is doing my gut says that our would also be seeing a similar increase with with Python with data science becoming we're talked about more popular these days but we'll have to do some coding and find out and guys I know we went we covered a lot a lot a lot of material but definitely try you know try to rerun parts of this code play around with different keywords play around with different regions um do the question mark profit question mark ggplot2 question mark whatever and really learn about your packages learn about your tools and learn about your methodologies because as a data scientist you're really only as good as your toolkit um so really could not and don't be afraid that's really my biggest recommendation yeah go out explore find anything interest you and if you're not sure where to get started on this whole journey to learn our course that we have on Koch Adam II is a great starting place we highly recommend it and you know it's a great place to get your feet wet so don't be scared keep asking all those questions and you'll have a great time and really the last thing that I will say because I know in every intro to programming courses you know your professor or your teacher will always be like you can't break it you're not gonna break your computer and that couldn't even be more true for AR you will never break anything so just go ahead be crazy be ruthless and just practice makes perfect right yep give it a shot give it a go nothing you can do will be wrong it's all learning journey so I hope everyone had a great time today I posted a link in the chat to download the code we will also place it on the site for you so you can be on the lookout for it there but once again I'm going to paste that link one more time you want to go ahead and download that code so feel free to just go and download it right there thank you all so much we had a wrapup session that you can move on over to to hear some closing remarks from our day of code and I'll hang out around here for a little bit and try and answer some more questions I'm just in the chat but thank you all so much fun today thank you bye bye everyone and everyone who's still here I'm looking for the lang to send you all over to our closing remarks okay everyone I'm about to post in the chat the link to the closing remarks feel free to check it out thank you all um awesome Thank You Renee mazwell for posting them there you all take care have a great day and yeah I feel free to reach out to us on you know can the internet LinkedIn things like that I'm happy to chat more take care
