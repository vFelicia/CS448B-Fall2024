a lot of people come to code Academy with the hope of becoming programmers we thought we'd try to answer a simple question what do programmers do at a high level programmers write code to build applications that solve problems there are many languages in which programmers write code some of the most popular ones include Java Python csharp and the list goes on programmers know different types of languages depending on their specializations the term programmer is a giant umbrella encompassing many careers some programming jobs include web developer data scientist full stack developer backend developer developer operations engineer and another umbrella title software engineer within each of these specializations there are different technologies a programmer can learn in order to do their job all of these jobs share similar responsibilities at its core programming is the process of breaking down a problem into smaller parts and tackling each with a set of instructions for the computer to execute we talked to different types of software engineers here at code Academy headquarters and asked them what their favorite things about programming were our engineers loved puzzle solving and they see programming as an extension of that programmers are strong collaborators and communicators programmers really enjoy continuously learning new things a must since technology is always evolving and programmers love being able to reflect on the code they wrote and feeling proud of what they built our engineers also want it to bust some myths you may have heard about programmers programmers do not sit alone in their basements all day programmers do not write perfect code on their first attempt in fact errors are a totally natural part of the process even for the most experienced programmers programmers do not come from any specific background programmers can be of any gender race ethnicity or country when it comes down to it we're all problem solvers already becoming a programmer is about learning how to use technology to solve those problems
