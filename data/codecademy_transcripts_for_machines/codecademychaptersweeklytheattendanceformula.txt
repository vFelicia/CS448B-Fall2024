hey everybody lisa here community manager with codecademy if we haven't met yet i'm excited to bring you this week's quick tip via video on the attendance formula so i had a good chat this morning with lorenzo of the helsinki chapter and he brought up this really good point and i want to share it with you um because it mirrored something that i had learned actually in my own experience so the attendance formula is going to sound a little insurmountable but first but i promise at the end of the near the end of the video i've got a little something that makes you know that this is actually going to work so let's say that you have a goal of five people at your next meet up that's a good goal five people is a great number because we usually see a show rate of about 25 of rsvps that means that in order to get five people to show you will have needed 20 people to rsvp 520 people to rsvp but because we have see a pretty variable rate in how many people rsvp out of all of the people in your group you're gonna need more people than just 20 in your group so again in order to get five people you'll need about 20 people to have rsvp'd in order to get 20 people at rsvp you'll need some number more than 20 in your group overall okay so now you're going like oh my god how are you gonna get all these people in my group next week we'll talk about promotion next week i'll have a video about all the different ways you can promote your chapter and get more people in it but the good news for right now is something that also came up in the call with lorenzo uh we were looking at this chapter and this is my buzzer sorry we were looking at his chapter and he was looking through the members list and he was like hey there's there's new people and i'm in my head i'm like yeah of course there's new people but um it is like a little christmas surprise every time that happens so one really great thing about partnering with codecademy and your community building efforts is that when you have people uh googling code academy dallas texas or codecademy learn to code helsinki your group will show up or your chapter will show up and people will join your group and you'll get new members and that's one way to uh get ready for more people to rsvp the next time you are creating a meetup and more people you get to rsvp the more people will show i hope this is helpful like i said next week will be on promoting your event i look forward to all of the questions and hanging out in general in discord and i'll see you next week thank you
