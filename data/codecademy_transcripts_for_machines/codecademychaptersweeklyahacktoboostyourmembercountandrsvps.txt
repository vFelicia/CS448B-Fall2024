my name is elisa if we haven't met yet i'm a community manager at codecademy today's quick tip is actually a hack on how to get more rsvps and more members into your chapter and the hack is as chapter leaders let's join each other's chapters and let's rsvp to each other's events i especially like this hack for two reasons number one is it just builds community uh and it came actually the idea came actually from a community a member a chapter leader in our last chapter leaders meetup so i like it that for that reason number one number two really no better way to learn from others and how to build your chapter in your community than to join and see what other people are doing so two ways to do this real quick uh this is just an example this is the experience of what it would be like for one of your chapter members to join literally clicking on any chapter that you haven't yet joined and just giving it a join there's this really re affirming and modal that pops up and lets you know that you've joined which is awesome and the second way to join other people's chapters and rsvp to their event actually at the same time is to i'm gonna join address south bend event pretty cool so right now she's got three people rsvp'd that's killer let's boost it let's boost it for her and we can do that by hitting rsvp this stuff should all be already prefilled and checking this box also adds us to that chapter and by doing this we get to see what emails are sending out we get to see examples of what other people are doing we get to learn from what other people are doing our channel and discord is just like becoming overwhelming frankly with all of the awesome stuff y'all are sharing all the time and this could be another way of more passively learning from one another i appreciate your time i hope this was helpful i i'm just like totally loving these banners and logos that you guys are doing i could sit here and stare at this all day i won't thank you very much and i hope you have a really great week
