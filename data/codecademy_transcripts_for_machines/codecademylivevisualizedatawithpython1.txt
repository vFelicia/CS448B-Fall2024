so hello everyone my name is Alex Koontz I'm a curriculum developer here at Koch Adam II and I'm here with these that we hey everyone I'm Zoe I'm a curriculum product manager here at GoDaddy and so what today is the first in hopefully a long series of events where we are going to be doing some coding with you every single week so we're calling this as of right now well first of all all of you in chat your your your the early adopters right first time ever really kind of trying this this larger series and so there will be I'm sure many many things to talk about and things that will change over time but good for all of you in the chat for being here and being the first ones to check out this series Zoe do you kind of want to describe what is Koch Adam II live what are we doing here yeah so code County live is a new series that we're doing if you've been a code Academy learner with us in the past you may have seen previous live streams with the curriculum team so like Alex and I have both done live streams before but now we're going to start off doing a dedicated series to walk through some code Academy content we're starting off with the data visualization Python skill path so we'll be doing a session every week we're figuring out the times and the days correct Alex yeah I think right now we're planning we're doing this on Wednesday obviously yeah I think in the future we're planning on doing our stream on Tuesdays but again all this is kind of up in the air we'll be relying on feedback from you all to try to help us figure out best way to do this yeah so we are planning on walking through a skill path from the very beginning all the way to the very end and learning a lot along the way yeah and if you folks are new to code Academy basically a skill path is a combination of different content different courses that we have on this site and it's meant to get you to learn a specific skill hence the name scope at us and as the name of the scope acts we're going to be learning data visualization with the Python programming language you can learn data visualization with a couple of different languages but we're doing the Python one specifically this time cool all right let's go ahead and jump right into it I'm gonna share my screen and so today's lesson is going to probably be a little bit different than a traditional lesson where we're gonna be walking through the first lesson in data visualization which is really kind of why are we doing any of this so I think this lesson is gonna be slightly less coding focused we're really we're not gonna go through a ton of syntax will go into this lesson and play around with it a little bit but I think this particular one is going to be a bit more discussion based about what is data visualization why do we care about it what are some cool examples in the past really kind of setting up what we're doing here and why we're doing it and then the following weeks we'll get into the Python syntax Python functions you know all of all of these things that we eventually teach you in this path but this one we're just kind of setting up so again this is the visualized data with Python path it is it is one of our one of our many paths I suppose I won't show you how to navigate there if you want to code along with us we think that that would be you know a fun thing for you to be able to do again we don't really know how manageable that is with if you have a YouTube window and you've the chat open and you have Koch Athenee right so give us feedback on whether or not you're able to code along with us and if that's something that you're actively doing or if it's more fun for you to just kind of watch me and so we go through this are gonna be recorded so if you find that you're not able to pay attention to the live stream and coding at the same time don't worry you still have it to look at later yes I see in the chat first of all people are from all over the place which is super super cool somebody in the UK probably so knowing I are both coming from New York City so really cool to see at hugely international audience and yeah I see one comment about that we're using zoom we will actually touch on that in the in the future where we are using zoom to stream stuff but we are also going to be hosting some some zoom boom webinars that are not streamed so we won't kind of touch on that towards the end of end of this session okay let me show you how to get here so so here's coke at me if you just go to the catalog you will see we have some career paths which we are not doing and then we are gonna be working with where is it analyze data with Python alright so sorry analyzed it we're doing yeah visualized data with Python alright and let's jump into this first lesson cool Zoe do you want to talk about what this overall path tries to teach we can look at the look at this first lesson and kind of these two capstone option options what's the what's the purpose of visualize to add it with pythons yeah so again much as the name suggests the goal of this path is to teach you how to create data visualizations using the Python programming language fun fact this was a former intensive person code Kadim e users and it was actually the first one that I led so yeah so this skill path is near and dear to my heart and what you can see here this first exercise is actually some of the stuff that you can build once you complete this skill pack so you have two options for completing a capstone you can do both of them if you want but one of them you are analyzing the data of a Netflix stock profile and visualizing that and then the other one is looking GDP and life expectancy data so we tried to think of the different applications that folks may have if they're interested in data visualization maybe you're coming from a feminine side maybe you're coming from more of a of an academic side and we also just have kind of like fun general projects for anyone to go through that I think you know pretty much anyone would find enjoyable yeah I see in the chat we have a soccer girl took that intensive Zoey so we got some math and with us for many many years at this point which is really cool all right cool so that's a that's visualized a with Python I think something that you might notice is you might see you know there's a larger data science path and there are other courses that give some of these topics this is one that really focuses only on data visualization but you can definitely take the skills that you learned here and apply it to machine learning and to data science in general so in fact some of the examples I'm gonna show you later on in this session are from different paths entirely but you use some of the skills that we wanted here soft girl Lisa your name is Lisa cool all right so let's take a look at this first lesson so visualize data in Python what is the format of data that we typically use at least on our code Khadem esight to visualize here we're bringing in data using a CSV file that stands for comma separated values so as you can see let's just open the file that we're actually using as our data in this exercise it's not pretty but you can tell it is true to its name it's using commas to separate the different data values right so at the top you get would essentially be the column name so if you were to pull in a CSV Excel or Google sheets you'd get your standard spreadsheet and you can even take any spreadsheet you have an export it as a CSV and this looks something like this so again column titles at the top and then below that you start to see the raw data than numbers so the first one you can see is a date 2017 April 4th and then we are getting some other number values this looks like its stock price data from that Netflix capstone project I don't know a lot about stocks yes I think one thing to note is that this is kind of a question that we get a lot is like why bother learning data visualization in Python right like I could open up this CSV file in Excel and I could make my graphs funny in Excel or I could work through my data in Excel so like Zoe from your perspective and whether it's Python or another language like what's what's the value of doing this in a programming language rather than it's cool like Google sheets or Excel with something like that totally it's the ability to customize whatever we want to do right we don't have to rely on the tools like Microsoft Office or Google is providing us sure maybe you can get some nice visualizations out of it you're still gonna have to do a lot of tweaking in a process like this you're controlling it from the very beginning and to the end so you can you know figure out how much of the data that you want to use you can easily clean up the data using Python and it's data analysis libraries like pandas you can try out different visualization libraries so in this scale in the past we have me show you map cut live but we also show you a more advanced visualization library notice Seabourn and again it just gives you way more possibilities I see that Lisa girl saying Excel is limited yeah a lot of these software's you know they just give you the very barebones for you to work with if you are really interested in digging into data analysis and producing your own reports producing your own presentations knowing a programming language like Python and how to use it for data visualization is really gonna help yeah I think one of the things we're gonna talk about later in this session is also using data visualization for like an artistic pursuit so hmm not necessarily for your job or to create a report but just to express something that you're interested in or that you find value in and I think being able to use these tools that are like more flexible and you can do kind of weird or less traditional things with it's really helpful for that sort of stuff absolutely you know it is all around us and you know we don't have to think about data as being limited to a business application I think it's really interesting when you start to examine your own life how can i express these patterns in an interesting way can you state a visualization to do that totally cool okay so let's do this first instruction which is basically to copy this block of code and put it down at the bottom of script py and so if you've never seen data visualization before this is a lot of code that we're asking you to copy with personally I'm not a huge fan of because it's like I really like my my students to know what they're copying copying but it's fun to see we're working towards this sort of thing so I'm gonna copy that code in and that you'll see that it creates this line graph of two separate lines opening price and closing price our axes are labeled pretty well where we're able to see what the xaxis is and what the yaxis is I thought we could dig a little bit into this code yeah you can first talk about what libraries we're using so you'll see at the very top of this script reporting to libraries the first one is confusing unfortunate is this like a bit of context right so when you're working on codecademy you're working in a pretty special environment it's not the same as the environment that you'd run on your computer and so in order for us to emulate what it would be like to run an environment on your computer and being able to import certain libraries we have to import one of our own special libraries which we called code cat ameloid but if anywhere to for example want to try this out on your own text editor on your computer you want to have to import that yeah in a way in a later session and perhaps in one of these zoom webinars which we've been teasing we can we can discuss how they'll like set up your own personal computer to run run things on your own computer so you're not reliant on Codecademy we also how much of resources on code can out of me that show you how to do that I think it's always really helpful to see someone go through that process because kind of a pain in the butt absolutely and I mean we have this look great about the skill path is that we have projects throughout the entire path that you're meant to do on your own computer so as I look so saying sometimes it can be really painful to install a lot of the software and get started so yeah I think it's a great idea something like that cool so that's cocaptain a lip it's the thing that lets us show your graph right here when you hit the Run button the other more important one is that we are using matplotlib and specifically we are using pipe lot from matplotlib and so this is really the library that this path is going to dive into we're gonna learn a bunch of different matplotlib functions and features and settings that you can set in there so this is kind of the bread and butter of its course later in the path we're going to be getting into yes yeah more complexity get like really interesting graphs highly recommend checking out the documentation you get those crazy violin plots yeah these plots were came from Seaborg yeah they kind of look like birds [Laughter] yeah I think maybe the one last thing to say about the import is that you can see your scroll up at the top again we're importing the pie plot but we're also renaming it to PLT so that just helps us to shorten our code makes it more efficient yeah if you cut if you come down here and look at this code a little bit you'll see we have PLT dot plot basically here we're saying okay we're calling this plot function but what library is it coming from it's coming from PLT which really is PI plot but we've just shorted it so we don't have to write PI plot again and again again and again if I get rid of this I can then cut them down here and we can do PI plot dot plot okay I'm looking at the chat Thank You Kenny for answering questions please continue to ask questions in there Kenny is obviously doing a great job of answering them but we'll try to take a look every now and then of questions for you to answer we really want this to be kind of as interactive as possible again this lesson is a little bit weird because it's more discussion based and not a super coding based but if you have questions about the code in particular we're happy to dive into that otherwise we will just keep going I think this is a great time to you know ground ourselves in the concepts of data visualization to write so like right now we're looking a lot at the code and what it outputs but in the narrative we're also thinking about what is the data visualization process overall and that's something that's going to be important to think about as you get into more of the coding like it so why suggest visualization but specifically like you know how do we go about that at a higher level we start with formatting the data we then move into visualizing that data and you can style the visualization too so I really I do love these Y data visually or I guess I should say like Y X we have at the beginning of a lot of our skill packs because I think they do a great job of contextualizing why you would want to learn this technology and what you should expect to see over the rest of the course even if you have to copy and paste some code and kind of don't know what's happening yeah for sure yeah it's it's kind of a motivating uh this is what's coming up the rest of the lesson kind of talks about what you were to speaking to Zoey where we have a couple of different key parts of data visualization that we're gonna go over in a super high level the first is this idea of formatting so data can come in a bunch of different formats the the ones that we talked about in this narratives are Python set Python has lists which is actually I think the next unit that we cover in this skill path is that we really dive into lists and show you how to work with them that's it's kind of one of the most basic elements of programming in Python and so we'll also want to start working with like a little bit more complex data structures so like we talked about before we have CSV files which are comma separated values these are what you will find if you export from an Excel document or even you can open up a CSV file in Excel and then finally we have panda that pandas dataframes so what that does come up you know I I don't know I feel like I'm often on the wrong side of these debates I'm gonna I'm a Jif guy not a not a gift not again person yeah in the chat tell us if you're I already forget what which one we are so it team Alex is data and Tina it's the other way around it was data it's I mean it's data on Star Trek it is data on Star Trek that's obviously but to go back to your actual original question data frames so pandas is another data analysis library that we're gonna be using and of course the skill path much like the matplotlib one that we saw in the last exercise pandas is a really awesome library you do a lot of stuff with it but what we often use it for is taking in raw data either you know like from a CSV and starting to structure it in a way that enables us to work with it further so that structure is called a data frame and alex is highlighting the specific command that you use to read in a CSV file and then print it as a data frame so let's take a look at what that what that looks like yeah so again we have a CSV kind of behind the scenes here and you'll see that the headers are we're talking about countries and then different years this is global population so you'll see we have this big mess of comma separated values it'll be pretty hard to like you could imagine trying to put like make this a Python list like I could copy all of this over and then like put it like genuinely done try to do some formatting in some of these files right so so that's really the power of pandas other I mean one of the one of the strengths of pandas is that we immediately just get to read in this CSV file and it's in this format now that we can start to work with and so I can probably do stuff like actually it has been in a while [Laughter] mom's writing uh writing our content so I'm more familiar with our at this point but I will try to write a line of pandas code here real quick cool Kenny said Astroworld had a good question oh yeah hi thanks for the live stream YC born over plotly just reference that is a great question so yeah Seabourn was our particular preference partly it's nice because you can do interactive graphs with plotly honestly like if we plot li was like a reach goal for us in this and I hope that someday that we do end up teaching hotly on code Academy cuz it's very popular but Seabourn I think is a nice natural step from matplotlib because it's library and actually I was going to say this plays nicely with canvas you can directly read in a dataframe from pandas and turn that into a visualization cool yeah I know again I was saying I've just been working on our content for a long time and Plumlee was something that I ran into in writing all this our content and so partly is one that again seems to work between different coding languages which is kind of cool yeah so I was about to write some pandas pandas code but I realized we actually aren't showing the the terminal output here we're only showing this this web browser output so even if I didn't do like print length of data frame which I don't even know if that's a real function again it's been a little bit since I've done pandas um even if I ran this we wouldn't see that print that print statement because we're not showing the terminal yeah nevermind basically so I mean a little bit about it like I guess peek into the the backside of coke Adam II as you can see in our lessons we have a you know a text editor in the middle and then we have the output on the right hand side so we can modify those components per exercise depending on what we think is what you should use in the exercise so like if you thought you wanted to have a terminal in order to be your output to the term and I guess this is also a fun fact about the code Academy live that we're actually rendering these panels made Hana data frames as it's like an SVG or something there's like it's like an HTML file yeah again interesting and engineering platform wizardry to be able to print out these pandas into our our web component yeah yeah cool all right let's keep moving we're at the halfway point of this session so I want to make sure we get through this lesson fairly quickly and then we can show off some other visualizations we can take more questions Sam I see your question I will we can we can answer questions as towards the end of the session so keep asking questions and we can come back yes all right so in this one we talked about okay so the first step was getting your data in a format that you can use the next step is visualizing your data so you talked a little bit about the difference between a plot live in C born here ask you to draw this graph which [Laughter] month passengers and bar charts and so I know the next section of this this course is talking about how to make your graph intelligible right where right now I don't really know what this is talking about I would guess it is airline staff yeah yeah loading data sets flights but in the next section we'll talk about how it's important to kind of label your graph appropriately so people know what the heck you're talking about this is this is Seaborn so any any supporting elements thinking about there's some articles that show you that you can choose we're going to talk about styling later you can actually change what kind of grid you're using we're also loading the data set with Seaborn and then we are executing a bar plot and if you're familiar with bar plots we're plotting things on the xaxis the month it is and then the yaxis is the passengers how many passengers are in it and then we're saving the data that we're passing into that bar plot is again the flights data that we had before exactly we're doing a little bit of stuff where we're rotating the xaxis or the things on the xaxis let's see what happens if we just get rid of that yeah and that's something that I think zoeng I would both encourage people to do in these intro lessons where you don't really know what this code is is doing do little things like that right if I just remove this line of code you get a better sense of like okay that's somehow affecting these X ticks you could even look up so X tic is coming from clot so let's do this let's do matplotlib pie plot X 10 let's see if we can find the documentation here on the fly right so I can just google that look at the documentation and see examples of different different ways that we can use X to X yeah I'll see if that works oh yeah Alex's points it's really great especially since you are just copying and pasting right now to like spend some time with the code that's that you're that you're pasting in to see if you can understand it a bit more before you even start to really learn it in full yeah I like one of the things that I think that's something that I think that I wish we did a little bit better on Kirk Adam E is like encouraging people to explore and it's hard to do that when it's just through through text because we can write up a you know we can write a paragraph that says exactly what we're saying of like explore on your own but yeah it's so fun to like just go through coke Adam II and like get the green checkmark in that way yeah so it's so to really take advantage of coke at me I'd like that really that's like the best thing that you can do is really kind of experiment and play with the code even after you've got the checkmarks absolutely cool let's move on to the next section yes so let's see what are we doing here we are setting the X tix so this is our stock exchange data you're setting the x tix rather than zero 50 100 150 200 and 250 we are overriding those with this list of months month names specifically using this tables function so again that's a that's a function that you might want to go and look up the documentation for and say okay it seems like this is taking a list of names could it take anything else are there other options that I could do with that all that sort of stuff would be a good idea to do let me actually didn't get the green checkmark but that's because of some weird backend stuff there we go yes similarly we can have the title mmhmm I think one thing that we kind of try to highlight here in this lesson is that we say make sure to put all of this code that we're pasting in before plot dot show we do plus if we do an after plot dot show it didn't do anything in personally it passed our test but you'll notice that uh the the title get an update it's a really plot dot show is the thing that says like okay you've set everything about your graphs let's show it now so everything has to come before plot show exactly important thing to remember if you're ever debugging saying hey I changed this thing yep and then finally we do legend labels so this is setting an opening price and a closing price legend for the different colored lines so y legend labels to turn plot yeah I think I mean the obvious answer is to have people understand what your rafters is talking about where there were no there are no labels whatsoever on this crap graph it would be a pretty graph but I would have no idea if this was talking about you know Netflix lock prices or if it was talking about the weather right like it could be it could be literally anything and so just communicating your findings he's kind of the point of data visualization and so I know personally I'm pretty bad at this where we can graph him and I like forget to put in the final five percent to make it yeah I was looking through all the lessons that I've done I found stuff where it's like I do not like put the title on there so like I'm I'm bad I'm bad at it but or I forget sometimes don't aren't as a rigorous as I should be but for like truly professional graphs or graphs that you're really showing people and publishing you want it to be as detailed as possible absolutely a part of it is framing it right like usually you're doing data visualization to sir a set of questions so how did Netflix stocks perform in 2017 right like we are using this visualization to show that performance which is why again it's helpful to have month names there because we're thinking about this in the context of time rather than just using you know whatever I had before I think super easy okay but what are you automatically you know think that's what it was not necessarily it's you know it's taking a lot of this stuff and we can get more cubed readable right here's I think for your audience to slightly critique the graph I think like price we could show units well first of all I know nothing about stock so I don't even know if prices or if this is in if this is in dollars or you know whatever but like I think the yaxis could be slightly more detailed but maybe that's because I am not pretty not exactly the audience for this you know I mean how do you style your plot specifically for your audience you may not need to provide as much detailed information if people already have an understanding of what the context is but if you're writing an article rate like you see a lot of data journalism these days you're usually going to have just like it you know everyday person a professional reading that content so you're gonna want to be as detailed as you can possibly be whereas if you are a I don't know microbiologist and you are presenting a paper at a conference that's on you know some very specific topic I don't nothing about microbiology right shows that as my sample but you probably wouldn't have to like spell everything out for a person performing pretty well right now but that's a pretty good segue so let's fly to the end of this course and I can show you some some other visualizations we have on the platform dad a responsibility yes important topic and really I really love this exercise and I'm really glad to tell you we're at this lesson put in here so I think it's super important yeah do you want to give a highlevel overview of what what this one is talking about yeah absolutely so what is covering is kind of saying like it's really easy for us to take in some data and just make a visualization and say like okay great I'm trying to you know ask this question and I've got a set of data and it clearly proves what I would like I wanted to prove or sometimes we look at data like we could say you know like the number of users on coke atom each site and you just let it you know say like what we think the answer is I don't know like we see like a ton of users around like noon oh okay noon Eastern Time everyone's having lunch what is that like really it was happening I think part of it is is taking some as it sounds like some responsibility for your interpretation and thinking about where you come from as an interpreter right like what are some biases that you may hold how is that impacting even your data collection process and what you're bringing in so they have this example may exercise about when they were designing airbags and the prototype that used was just a male mannequin and so the data they collected was actually biased in terms of how it performed and that ended up actually having real ramifications in the production process all the saying that you know ethics I think is super important to talk about generally what we're talking about programming and especially when we get into talking about data how we're collecting data the processes for collecting data the actual content of the data that's there and then how we choose to show data data visualizations notorious for being able to lie to people because you can change things like you know like the why there's like a whole thing about yaxes and like shortening them to make it look like there's actually a greater difference between like two line graphs that there actually is or in this case so plotting to totally different data sets but saying like oh look there's a relationship between this data just because it has a similar shape to it do you really think that there's a relationship between the letters and the winning spelling bee word and we have a good one in chat from Robert saying these rise in sea level and the decline of population in Pirates correlation correlation and causation it would like try and find these like super random different data sets and then show how they they mirror each other right right we should try to find that one but yeah there's lots of articles out there that talk about how you can you know critically look at a data visualization to understand is it actually interpreting the data correctly and presenting the relationships correctly actually there is a great one from The Economist that talked about their process for critiquing their data visualizations and improving that I'm saying like looking at like how clear is this data is the relationship really what we're attempting to show various things like that so it's cool to see you know we do this for a living start to think more deeply about how their work is impactful yeah I mean knowing I could talk about this for hours the cool thing with like basically everything that you can learn in programming is that there's like the syntax of how do I do this thing and then there's the kind of meta discussion around it of okay how do we use these what are the ethics of using these tools that we've done what are the different ways that we can use in the different stakeholders that that are interested in this technology so I mean hopefully that that's one of the benefits of these streams is that you'll not only be able to get like the syntax as we get into doing some real programming but you'll also be able to engage in conversations like this where we talk about you know the impact of these tools that we're teaching absolutely cool we have two final little looking ahead wrapping up we talked about formatting visualization and styling okay so that is the first well in the visualize data with pythonpath so plug it for next week is the next Tuesday it we have two more curriculum developers going through the next course so the next course is going to be let's see I believe it is Python syntax yes so what we did here is the content and we sherry picked a couple of programming concepts that we thought would be super helpful for folks to know if they hadn't done Python before and they were starting to engage with this material so what I really like about a lot of our school paths is that you don't come in with any prior information you really start you at zero so you can skip this stuff if you've already done Python before but if I can't speak for you all good we'll be learning it before we get into the data visualization stuff so that's the plan for next week I believe the people signed up for that are we Ian freed who has written a lot of our data science content and then another alex curriculum developer not me we'll also be doing next Tuesday stream I think this would be a good time to talk about the other set of streams we have planned yeah so in addition to these these streams that are free we're stringing them on YouTube and twitch and everywhere every week we're also going to do a bonus stream or it's not a stream we're gonna do a bonus webinar or bonus session for pro members this week's bonus session is actually going to be open to everyone just to give people a taste of what we might be doing in that session but the idea behind and so that session is gonna be on Friday it's gonna be me Zoe and then a third curriculum developer Carolyn the idea behind these book sessions is rather than doing something consistent like these free streams where the free stream is always going to be going through the next the next step of the path whatever path we're doing these bonus sessions are going to be an opportunity for you to basically have more personal conversations with with us we're gonna do it on a zoom webinar and people can call in if you want to call in and ask us a question and like have a conversation with us that's something that we'll be doing Zoe and I are gonna give out a little bit of an assignment that if you want you can come to be the procession having done this thing and you can show us what you've done and talk about it a little bit it's kind of more Q&A we're in this free session we've really kind of been focused on getting through the lesson and going through the lesson and you know we've been trying to answer questions in chat as we go but we'll have we'll have tons of time for to do that in the bonus session so very briefly I want to show the flow of registering for that bonus session again all of this stuff is this is kind of a beta week for us all this session were is the first time that we're doing it so bear with us as there are kinks in the process and also we would love your feedback for how we can do stuff differently um but if you go to the main page of coke Adam II we now have this events page so you can click on register and you'll see that we have three events one is the one that you are currently watching if you're watching this live which is in this visualize data with Python we have the next free stream which is the second course individualize dating with Python battle that would be the thing that Ian and Alex do next Tuesday so that's this one again that will just be streamed on YouTube and twitch and everywhere so you could either come in here and register for it or you can just find it on our on our YouTube page or our twitch page but then this middle stream is the one that's right now we're calling Q Pro na so normally will restrict these two Pro members but for this one we are letting anyone register for it so you can come in here and register for it click on this link and register for the bazoom webinar basically you'll get an email and then on Friday at 3 p.m. we'll go live we will go live with that webinar so that's the idea basically we want to add we want to do a session where we go through a course and then every week also offer a session where we actually get to like chat with you and get to build a little bit of the community and take any of your like deeper questions that we weren't able to get to in the free session mmhmm anything no just a game University lecture class and you have those lab sessions with a TA where you really get to engage with your fellow classmates you get to ask questions that maybe you didn't have a chance to ask during the lecture session I think that's how we're thinking of these processions it's really an opportunity for you to you know come to the free session you get exposed to the material maybe spend the next couple of days going through it on your own you start to have questions and Fridays your opportunity to ask those questions to a real live person which isn't something that we've always you know had the opportunity to do with code cabbies are really excited to make that an option yeah the big dream for this it is eventually if these turn out to be popular you can start doing this with different series so right now I'm only going through visualize data with Python but these turn out to be super popular and people want hey let's do a web dev series where we'll have a web dev course and a web dev procession during the week that's kind of like the idea of like we would love to see this events calendar really kind of like build out into almost like you know coke Adam II like here's the week of events at coke Adam II I have a bunch of different learning suddenly enjoyable when you have other folks doing with you and us as teachers we've like just talking with you guys to reading reports and it would be fun to connect to you all with each other right if if someone hops on a call Linley in the process and asks a question related to a project you were working on maybe you can link up with Velma and start working on together or you can help each other out and maybe you know Alex and I talked about little assignments that you can do you know be introduced during the first event and when you come to the Q&A session you show off the word that you did to us and to the other learners cool yeah so Joey and I came up with this little assignment so if you would like to join that the pro Q&A that's gonna be on Friday at 3 p.m. again you can follow that link in the advanced page to read sir for the zoom the zoom call we've linked this form I'll put it in the chat right now but it's also in the YouTube description we've linked this form if you're going to come to the procession which I think would be super fun we would love you fill out this form so we're asking you for your name which is optional we're asking for your name so we give you credit if you ask a question we can say hey you know this person asked this question any general questions about data visualization this is the assignment that we we thought of yeah we wanted you to create a visualization of data of any kind doesn't have to be programming find a way to share it with us could be a pic you know you could make something physical in your house or apartment and take a picture and tweeted at us you could I have an idea already shared with Zoe which i think is a weird one yes let me I'll give you this screen share in one second let me finish going over this form so this is yes so this question is I create a data visualization of any kind if you share it with us we'll talk about it on the probe pro stream or show it off if you're if you're in the pro stream you can come on and talk with us about it if you'd like if you have any links or resources that you would like to share with us we'd love to see them and we again that's something that we could share on the stream and then any feedback about all of this stuff in general what you think about the free live streams of going through a course what you think about the pro live streams of getting a chance to like talk to people and it being a little bit more communal so just any feedback we'd love to have again people watching this you are like the first you are the what well done you're like the first people check this stuff out and so no we would really really value your feedback attack let's see cool Zoey I'm gonna stop my screen share if you want to screen share to show some cool visualizations I will also try to look through chat to answer some questions and we'll do all right we see this cool so as Alex and I were working on putting together today's session we talked about our experience with data visualization and also some data visualizations and I just wanted to share some examples of folks that whose work I've come across in the past couple years so one person is Jared Thor people been on the livestream with me before it's a lot about how I went to graduate school and my view this program called I Tiki Jared Eric was a tshirt and my Tiki Amy taught a class called data art and so I think he has some really great examples of projects that exist at the intersection of data but are also using a lot of different mediums so again well we're going to be talking about data visualization in programming dude visualization has a long history that existed before we are actually working with computers so I think like one great really example it's W two data visualizations these are incredibly beautiful and talk about life of black Americans at the turn of the 20th century we'll post links to this stuff so you can you can look through it on your own time stuff that's more current again not using programming but Mona Shalaby is a infographics artist and she just he's just like if I needs to be like incredibly hilarious and super relatable data visualization so while she's using the languages of you know our chart she's finding ways to breathe new life into that kind of idea so this is literally just googled Mona jalabiya infographics and you can kind of get a sense of this her Instagram is really fantastic I was the nose job one there in the top left or there's no this is flu viruses see the other one another person who has a really simple way of doing data but visualizations is an Friedman she has a great weekly newsletter email newsletter that she sends out and she posts one of these pie charts at the end of each of it so what are we doing on this airplane and you can click in here and see how she's she's flirting at crying and a Pixar movie okay it dried open third bag of pretzels so again if you're thinking about completing this assignment you know what I happen so you need to go through and like have to program anything it could be as basic as this another really cool one that I came across was this artist married Lucian Berger who did a project data visualization now I'm trying to find using photographs and everyday objects I chose feature and so I'm not going to pretend I know that these visualizations are about but I think just scrolling through them you get a really interesting sense of how you can again visualize data in ways beyond the traditional scatter God's choir charts graphs things like this like what again is in your environment both that you could think of as data but that you could use in your data visualization get super creative I love this sandwich what warranty food do you have use to make any visualization data for example last resource that I'm going to share is a website called pudding so they are as they say digital publication that does these visual essays but a lot of them are really just amazing interactive data visualizations so the worst highest game NBA player ever like what I love it because they they find these really interesting stories that are super me then you're a really great job of presenting that information that's awesome yeah so all of this stuff is our kind of example is of like what we're looking looking for if you want to share with us and come to this procession make something like that and try to find a way to share with us yeah I so we are basically out of time more ways to get involved with this sort of stuff if you enjoyed it subscribe to us on YouTube that will that will actually help I think that that's a great way to just like see the Wendy's live videos come up we're also on Twitch if you follow us on twitch that will also help us out if you want to get in touch with me and Zoey you can get in touch with us on Twitter that even would be a fun place for you to send your send your visualization if you end up making one I think I am at Alex B Koontz and I'll type in the YouTube channel right now and then so we are you can find me on Twitter highly recommend that you sign up for a free account with a free account you get a free week of trial and then that enables you to get access to quizzes projects actually this entire is still packed right Pisco pack is a special content item for our pro learners yeah so um yeah I think that's it so again the events coming up we got one on Friday at 300 with me Zoe and Carolyn where it will be a little bit more discussion based so any questions that you had or if you just want to talk to us after watching this session then next Tuesday we have another livestream with Ian and other Alex going through the next course in this path so hopefully they'll get through that course and maybe do the quiz in the project well follow along there and the live stream these are recorded this is not a convenient time for you no worries you'll be able to watch the recording later obviously we love it when people are watching live with us asking questions that we can answer on air too although brief clarification be like bonus session the pro the pro session that's going to be only on it's gonna be a basically a private Zoo and webinar so we won't be stringing that live because that's for pro members sources right exactly yeah so so just a little a little special something for our Kroners or coke addict pro learners which is great and like I'm excited to talk to you more about data visualization as art really innovative ways doing data visualizations talking more around the ethics of data visualization particularly no right now with this hope in 19 days of collection that's going on and how is that even collection helpful to communities basically it's hard to get means that we only wanted to do an hourlong session today but then that wanted to keep talking though we hope that you will join us that yeah alright I think that's it it's it's 201 thank you again to everyone who joined us for this very first sessions really appreciate you taking the time to be with us today bless you for making of our first first time we've tried this [Laughter] you know what really needs is having you all here with us and folks take your questions hi I think it's gonna be a really great series Alex you know yeah this is some money yeah Kenny and then the folks behind the scenes that helped us Lisa all those folks too so stay tuned for more content okay Kenny lives all right see y'all later
