hi everyone this is Zoey I'm a curriculum product manager here at Code Khadem II and today we are doing another coke atom a live event myself and Jamie are going to be walking through another part of the visualize data with pythons skill path Jimmy how about you introduce yourself because it's your first time everyone I'm Jamie I'm a new associate curriculum developer at code Academy I'm very excited to be joining everyone here and I'll be here to answer any questions and code along with Zoey with the data Python data visualization course yeah so I'm gonna share my screen and take us through the content that we will be doing today so one moment as I get that set up okay so I'm excited because today we're gonna be talking about how to select data visualizations for your work so at this point we've gone through how to create line graphs and map plot live how to create other types of plots like bar charts pie charts and what we're gonna be talking about today is we're gonna go over this article how to select a meeting visualization and then after that we're going to test our knowledge of plotting different types of data in this lesson slash project that we have called recreate graphs using that pop live I'm gonna be screen sharing over here walking us through as Jamie mentioned he and I are gonna pair program on the lesson slash project that we have after this and we'd love to hear from you in the comment section what are your questions about data visualizations we would love to hear if you have ideas for answers to the project you know we might walk through them together and then we'll turn and see if anyone in the comment section has the answer that we're looking for and we're gonna wrap up around to the clock today so hopefully we'll get through will definitely get through the article and we'll see how much of the lesson that we're going to go through as well cool so again we're gonna start with this article how to select a meaningful visualization I think this is really important because again at this point you have understood you have learned how to create different visualizations and now comes the moment where you're putting it into practice right when you put it into practice you have to consider which visualization matches the data that you have on hand it's gonna be you making that choice so in order to help you with that process this article explains how you would go about making a decision about that so basically when you're considering what you want to build you want to think about two things the first is the question that you want to answer with your chart and the second is the type of data that you want to visualize so depending on your answers to either these two questions that should determine what chart you're going to use so we have this diagram below where we've taken different matplotlib visualizations that you've already seen we've already built at this point and assign them to a couple of different categories and so these categories can again help you answer those questions and help guide you to the chart that you want to make so the four types of diagrams that we have this diagram diagrams are composition down your composition charts distribution charts relationship charts and comparison charts so I'm gonna walk us through each of the four of these Jamie and I have found examples of each of these types of charts so we're gonna show those examples and discuss again what kind of data you can use for each type of chart and when you might want to use one chart over another Jamie I'm gonna show the charts that you pulled up and maybe you can talk to us about each one of them so first off we're going to talk about composition charts and with composition charts you have the question the question that could lead you to choosing this chart I should say the focusing question is what are some parts of the whole what is the data made of so data sets that work well in this case are data pertaining to probabilities portions and percentages charts in this category illustrate different data components and a percentages as part of the whole so you can see here that we have a pie chart right so we're saying that this data is composed of different types of percentages of data within that and you can illustrate that by assigning those percentages different color values so you can quickly see and see what may be the majority of your data what we may be the minority of data so Jamie I believe that's not the one this is the one that you selected so tell me a little bit about this visualization of course so as always said we use compasses and charts went like often when we have proportions or we're dealing with percentages so in this pie chart it's talking about US energy energy consumption I just found out on the internet it was just a reallife example so all the sections of the pie chart show the different types of energy sources that the u.s. uses and then the interesting thing I thought about that this chart showed is you like most the time we think of composition charts we think of pie charts but really you can use any shape so if you notice on this chart it shows like a pie chart and then it also shows the percentages within renewable energy so solar wind geothermal hydroelectric and I see that says biomass so with with compasses and charts you can use like different shapes just one things you have to be careful of is like the specific thing you choose normally it's normally choose a pie chart or bar chart if composition shirts you have to you want to make sure that the percentages like are shown like equally with the area and what I mean by that is you want to make sure that like the area chart that you're using does not like overemphasize different different percentages right because as we've kind of talked about actually in the first episode of the series while data visualizations can communicate data and increase our understanding it's also really easy to lie with data visualizations sometimes and so you could theoretically make a pie chart look you know slightly different in terms of the data if you were trying to communicate something but it wasn't actually true it's always good to again make sure to check and see that you're communicating things correctly this is gonna come up again in another type of chart that we have alright so the next type of chart we're going to discuss is a distribution chart so datasets that work well and distribution charts are data that is in large quantities or have various attributes so visualizations in this category will allow you to see patterns the occurrences making very important clustering of data point does your data a sort of end up kind of having doesn't get distributed in like a certain density in a particular area so I'm just gonna scroll back up so that we can see some basic distribution charts so you can see these ones over here you may not be familiar with histogram charts or maybe you're still getting to it I can't are right now but history Am's are one way of showing distributions of data so very commonly also known as a curve so we can know that most of the data occurs between these certain areas that the average would be somewhere in the middle of this particular histogram here so Jamie also found in his and so now you tell us about this particular visualization so this is another graph that I just found online so this one just talks about the histogram of arrivals I imagine just like the rivals of maybe like jeans at a train station or something mom so Zoey went over what a distribution chart chart is so the reason it's good for this data is because when you look at a distribution chart you can see the overall shape of the data so by looking at this chart you can kind of see what the where the mean arrival times fall so on this chart I would say it probably falls around for arrivals per minute so that's kind of the advantage of a distribution chart you can see things like the mean you can also see basically how spread out the data is so if you look that this histogram it's like rike skewed meaning that more the data it kind of skews toward the right right of the graph if you notice so like between values of 6 and 12 the day is a little more skewed than it is towards the earlier values so yeah so it typically works well with things when you want to look at like the frequency of like how the data is yeah and I do believe I'm not sure if it's in this particular doesn't look like it's in this particular path but if you take the data science path I'm just gonna bring up really quickly so folks can see this we have a couple of courses that really dig into the relationship between stats and visualizations particularly when it comes to history so if we go down to this number I section set 6 to 6 with numpy you'll actually see histograms again in here so you're talking a bit of a of a heads up turns on the specific nets and like fun visualizations let's see this maybe I can't find it particularly right now yes so this one we can you can see Instagram here and you can see if you have certain do you know that are outliers how that impacts the distribution and specifically the mean in this case cool so moving right along next type of chart we're going to talk about our relationship charts so here's what missing question is how do variables relate to each other we want to think about more than one variable in this case and looking as the image suggests at the relationship between those two variables so similar are they how much do they diverge so datasets that work well here are surprisingly datasets I have two or more variables that could be displayed in these charts that could be you know looking at population over two different years or both of us in Harrison all right this would more be more so looking at something like what I'll show is the example is temperature related to ice cream sales so you're looking to see if there is a correlation a relationship between two more variables so scatter plots are great for these so this is a very fun little cute friendly website but does make things really accessible so here you can see the data set so it is temperatures Celsius and then what the ice cream sales were that day so if you were to take these and plot them against XY access where our temperatures on the xaxis sales y access you'll start to see that there looks to be some kind of pattern happening here the dots tend to trend upwards when the temperature is high sales are high you can actually use you know line of best fit to see and we can really can use charts like these to also predict things in the future we can imagine that if the you temperature got any higher than this maybe ice cream sales would increase as well so those are examples of scatter plots you know one thing that we talk about again to go back to you have data visualizations why is that we turn of this phrase correlation does not necessarily equal causation and this term is specifically known as a false cause fallacy so when there is no relationship between variables despite a visible correlation that's known as spurious correlation and there's actually this really funny website that he knows made the rounds in the internet at some point there's even a book about it now but it's called spurious correlations it's by the sky tiny button and I think these are absolutely hilarious because he plots these they would look very serious you know formal data visualizations that you would see in like the New York Times Wall Street Journal something like that and then you look at the data sets and it's dark very dark a lot of one's about people buying is up with you man anyways let's go number of people could drowned by falling into a pool correlates with films Nicolas Cage appeared in and you look at this and it's like if you didn't know what the dataset is you'd be like huh there seems to be some kind of relationship here what would that mean is it that suddenly people were inspired to I don't know like get drunk by the poolside and accidentally falled in because they had just watched a terrible Nicolas Cage them or I know that people's opinions that Nicolas Cage but yeah so you can you can see that a lot of these you know again they trend in very similar ways but do we actually think that there is a relationship between per capita consumption of margarine and a divorce rate and meaning I don't think so so I think it's important when you are using scatter plots and data sets that are looking relationships to think about you know to remember that correlations is not always equal causation it's fine if you see that but you can't necessarily that one thing pollicis the other one and it affects the relationship and sometimes it can be just pure coincidence again like some of these things all these various correlations are just pure coincidence so if you know you do start to see a pattern in your data you want to think very critically about whether whether you have enough data to suggest that there's actually a strong relationship between those variables poor leadership in you also made one when I think about could there be other variables that are impacting that data so again we go back to our ice cream example ice cream and hospital admissions for heatstroke could also possibly be in correlation but it's not that ice cream causes hospital admissions for king stroke right it's more so that temperature as we saw maybe would increase ice cream sales but it can also relate to more hospitalizations and basically if you are going to suggest there's a correlation just really make sure that your argument is watertight cool so the last chart type we're going to talk about our comparison charts so sort of you know a similar idea of working with multiple variables but this time we want to know now what the relationship is between them and whether one causes the other one but how do they actually compare to each other so data sets up well for this are once again that have multiple variables in the visualization itself shouldn't allow the reader of that visualization to easily compare two sets of data a versus B so over here we can see that you can have a multi colored bar chart you can imagine that maybe this is the population of a country and it could be Great Britain versus France over time which could also be plotted on a line graph like this and one line would you know be the variable for population in rebrand the other one would be France so looking at some examples of multiple line graphs as I was mentioning populations based in different countries here we see three lines for one line for each continent it looks like Africa combined and Europe on the xaxis we had years Y access we have populations so you can see generally there's a trend moving upwards however Africa is consistently below the Americas and Europe in terms of populations you can see another one down here about temperature in Dubai in this case it's comparing the minimum temperature to the maximum temperature over time in a specific year for multiple bar charts it's again you have just a different choice in terms of if you want to do a live chart excuse me a line graph versus a bar chart so here I want to go back down a little bit more here's another one about population but in this case rather than looking at population over a significant number of years let's say every years was in the last 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 years we only have 3 years in this case but we actually have more countries that are looking to compare to so again looking at France versus the United Kingdom and each bar relates to a different year so we're both able to compare population between different countries and then population across these three years per country as well so that's that's basically the idea so if again you are doing your own data visualization project outside coke atom II we highly recommend thank you to put into practice you can use this article and this diagram of diagrams to help you select your next visualization so Jamie any comments or questions in the chat has a chat rolling oh yeah Chao is going good Wow a lot of people are just asking questions um thank you sure to stay on top to answer any of them and yeah please keep asking questions and let us know if you have any questions about what Zoe is doing absolutely and Jamie if you're interested you can also answer some of those questions lab to court over there awesome so next thing we're gonna get into will be the lesson projects that I I mentioned so this comes right after this article path so in this lesson project we're imagining that you work as a high school math teacher which is Jamie didn't you do some did you do some math teaching yeah I was a student teaching calculus and precalculus this past year look at that what a coincidence so if we can imagine that like Jamie we were a student teacher a calculus classroom and we want to display 14 metrics about our current class and maybe even compare our current class to previous classes that we taught so we can see more about patterns and trends that you know you just want to be able to get if you're just looking at like an Excel spreadsheet when it's just you know tables and tables of numbers so over here you can see a couple of different graphs these may look familiar to you either if you've taken a previous courses and you have gone through the backlot lived with visualizations or even just from the last article we were looking at that really showcased a lot of these actually I think some of them may be identical it's okay there and zoom bar I was like comes down it was just my past okay so let's let's have some audience participation can someone in the chat tell us what this first chart is trying to plot was it trying to communicate here pause a moment because I know there is a delay so zoom in a bit may help any responses no responses yet all right g'v would you like to take a stab at it all right of course so the first chart it's so defiling final exam averages so it's probably talking about test scores and then the xaxis talks about different years so this graphic we just be talking about different Oh someone did answer final averages over time yeah exactly so that's exactly what this graph this time at so it's finally his name I reduce over time and one thing you notice about this graph is it has these blue bars and then at the top of each blue bar it has these lines I believe last week they went over this but if you weren't there if you don't remember these lines they basically represent error bars so the reason you the reason some people put error bars on their graphs is because a lot of times when we're graphing we're graphing data and the data might have like there might be some uncertainty in that data so basically you want oh and someone else also a cancer to error bars in the chat and basically you want to show that there's like some uncertainty and that the actual like you know the actual exam average might range from you know between 80 and 90 even though that graph will show that it's at 85 awesome yeah error bars they're super helpful and I appreciate you pointing that out oh cool so they're these I believe are all of the graphs that we are going to recreate so just take a moment for yourself and look at each one of them in your own browser and examine them think about which one is trying to plot especially based off of the previous article and what we've learned about different type of grafts and where you might want to use one of them so we can talk about each one of them I think as we go through the lessons let's get started hopefully it cleared everything okay we have the magical powers here at code Academy to you know get the answers and we're through without getting blotch so I didn't want to peek don't want to have anything up there so we're gonna first start with that chart that we saw and we just discussed bar chart and bar chart with error as we said and for this bar chart the data that you're going to need to recreate it is in the lists which we see here past year's average years and then error so we'll be using these lists to help build our charts so as the comment says we're gonna make our chart below and they actually already called plot that show for us so as we run it should we should be able it probably will take a moment till we get to the final part but we show it so uh Jamie let's start with this first one we're gonna make our chart have a width of 10 and a height of 8 so what's the assumption that I call here so I believe the function is dot figure so be little T dot figure and then within the parentheses I believe it's fig size and then you want to so that's the parameter and you want to set equal to in parentheses 8 comma or well 10 comma 8 so that we have a figure of sy of with 10 and it ate great so the data for 10 for with excuse me it's passing first and then hey so let's run this okay not seeing anything yep but it passes the test so let's move on to the next one we actually get to plot the blue bars so we want to plot the bars which have the heights listed in past years average so maybe someone in the chat can tell us what what method we need to use to get a bar chart what is the Matt plot live method it's a bar chart its own method for bar chart would be what something say eager to pay program and this is a good time to also highlight you know we have this get help section here in the learning environment and if you're ever stuck on something you can go to the forums so there's a specific forum here that if you have these are common questions that we've seen so you can find answers there and if you don't if that question is not the one that you're looking for you can go to the forums and post your own question also a concept review by looking at this cheat sheet that was for this so you can sometimes find your answers routes all right about that you can sometimes find your answers here in the cheat sheets you can also always get the solution if you you're stuck you just want to find it so yes also someone answered in the chat acid they said plot that by I think they mean plot bar Bart yeah sounds good all right so here's where things get a little tricky so how do we pass in the data for past year's average Jamie you want to cast AB so if we want to pass in the data so for a bar chart we want to oh right so for a bar chart if you want to pass in the data we are going to have to first basically just set it so that we have a range of values along the xaxis so that was like one of the common are like one of the challenges with creating a bar chart matplotlib so if you want to first create just like the values like you can use the range function so you use a range function and then what you want to go into the range function is basically the length of the list that contains the actual values that we want to go along the x axis so it'd be length of past your averages in this case spot the spelling error all right so then I want to go out from there out from there again all right and then we want to graph our Y values so here over the Y values you want to graph our the like actual test scores so that's the list that would be in the list past your everything's alright we've got our guard shirt you know it's super sunny I'm so sorry but basically we have on our xaxis again that is the length of the value so they're what seven values going from twosix range and then our test scores are getting plotted against 20 40 60 and 80 and if you got stuck there's a real all right so let's add the error guys so um how do we add error bars in a bar chart you can see if any one to me in the audience can share with us how you would add errors to the bar chart specifically of a capsized five and the heights should be corresponding to the list error that we have it's been good practice for me the last time that Marielle and I did a live stream I've been so in JavaScript Lamech kept on lists arrays here to enlist comprehensions I think I finally finally gotten myself out of that habit any thoughts don't have any answers yet on the chat just uh so like one thing if you like when you're doing your own chart like in real life one thing you can do if you don't know how to add error bars or forget ah the name of a function is either you can just google of it so like if you were just google well how to put error bars using matplotlib it is you'll typically find the answer there wasn't like the first couple links or even find you better find examples that show how to do it Oh someone someone answered in the chat so Lucia said that we'd use the keywords you're why her ye are are your which is exactly right so we'd wanting it's a parameter your and within that parameter we just set it equal to air so we'd say equal to air here because in this we have error set equal to a list of errors and then she also said you use capsized so capsized will and since you want to capsize of what is it length yeah so you just say equal to five all right let's run it there we go there you got the tick mark and you can see how they've been plotted to that awesome thank you too there's me responded in the chat okay next one I now we are going to set the axes so we're gonna set the axes to go from negative zero point five to six point five on the xaxis and seventy to ninety five on the yaxis so we're going to use another matplotlib function here to set our axes and Jimmy what is that method in this case so the method to make an axis is just PLT stop axis access what values to be passing so we want to pass the values so if we want to go from negative 0.5 to 6.5 we'll do negative 0.5 as the first value so in a in a list in English 0.5 I've been mmhmm and in the same list correct we do 70 yeah so basically it's the first x value to the next to the last x value and then the first Y value to the last Y value all right okay so not saying anything change but or did it yes it did all right um so now we're gonna create a ax object using plot duck subplot okay so x equals healty dot sub plot method we're going to use ax to set the xaxis takes to be range length appears and then the axe excuse me xaxis say that five times fast x axis labels to be the years list okay so we can use the set X ticks method for the first part and this time since we just again we created that ax we have an X variable there are four subplot we're going to be calling methods on XML T this case so that is set X and they said we're going to pass in range of years again here okay how's that look to you Jamie no no it's perfect yeah awesome okay and then we're gonna use the set X ticks labels again Klein that method on xaxis s thanks labels and we're setting it to the value of ha here we go and now we see we set the ticks again to the quantities that are in this year's list and we've also changed what the actual labels are they're showing the same thickness they're great um and again a hint okay two more feeding so now we're getting into the styling part of our visualizations right so we in the data visualization process when you explore we graph and then we want to style so we've started that styling a bit by changing the X&Y tick labels and now we're going to title and add labels to the x and yaxes another step out alright so Jamie what do we use to get a title on this so to get a title you use the dot title function okay and that's on PLT this time yeah peel x let's step out so fealty got title and that's final exam averages and then we're gonna call why we bowl with test average and with yeah so we should see basically these labels pop up that's happen on the left and bottom of this really there there so now we know what this plot is about also just one thing I want to point out when labeling so if you notice on this graph like you might think the titles and labels are too small or too big you can change the size the font size of the labels and ahhs both in the title just by using the font size parameter I believe but if it's not that you can also Google what the parameter is yeah so as Jenny mentioned earlier to matplotlib has very thorough documentation so you can always find what you need there reading and using documentation is a huge technical skill when you get into programming how do you unlock a lot of things yeah you're not expected to memorize every single you know matplotlib function or every single function for every programming language you use there's a reason they make documentation so even when you're going through code Academy content and you feel stuck you know use the resources that you have use the documentation use the the forums cheat sheets all of that and yeah I agree Jamie the skill is not in memorizing everything it's more about knowing where to look to find yes also someone is it possible to like zoom in on the graph or good question and I basically gets to this point I'm so sorry it's so small ya can hit the top right expand arrows just like chauffer Wow awesome Thank You Jamie perfect okay so here we go definitely can see things a lot better now you can see the titles clearly you can see the y and x labels clearly or Aran charts awesome right so we've got one more we know a little bit again so our last checkpoint you have to go through is that we have to save our super bar chart so Jamie how do we save a bar chart so that we can access it say if we wanted to like create a slide presentation so it's another matlab function so use PLT in this case it's dot save big you just want to give it the title that you want to give your chart okay so the title is my underscore bar underscore chart dot PNG in this case yeah and I think if you're doing this on your own computer you can also like I think there's a way you can choose where you save it by like giving it a file path location but I'm not certain yeah we went in to hearing that same thing telling the general one so filed a things can define the orientation and paper type well in case you can do around the documentation to find out more about the properties and parameters that you can define in these methods there's a lot in there all right this is so run it take a moment to save the page there you go as it happens that's actually a great thing to run in tubes I know this happens a lot real nervous so just remember if you've ever encountered something like that rich the page your code is still save cool all right so let's go through next slide we'll see how far we get in this because we only have a couple minutes left and I want to make sure that time is flying time is so much behind here I've got a few like today I hope you're having fun I think this is like a really great project because it really gives you to think deeply again about the different fiction charts so let's let's get off with with this and we'll see how far we go so in this one we're doing it side by side bars and it's displays the difference in average test scores between students who went to two different middle schools before enrolling in their high school so you're comparing the average test score for your students and I guess trying to see it is there some kind of you know cause causation coming from the school that they came to in relationship to test scores but you're also looking at and doing the comparison right having a bar chart like this is one of those comparison charts that we talked about before you can compare these values so the data that we need would be in the list middle school hey this will be in unit topics so you can actually drill in and see how different so it's performed based on what the topic is looks like middle school a may have had a strong your set of math teachers in this particular case it's just what I'm kind of getting from the visualization but I'm glad to see that everyone's solid on applications so let's let's start off by using the list to create our charts here so Jamie how would you so yes this so this function came from a previous module module so like the one where it's like just introducing you how to graph I'm at my Apollo so the create X function T is basically the number of sets of data so if we want to create the we're trying to create the label for school ax we basically want to call create X like the function key X and then for T we'd put two for W so W is the width of the bars and their default at 0.8 I don't know maybe like pics whatever the like parameters for that are but it's 0.8 and then n is basically like if it's the four set or the second set of data so for middle school a it would be the first set so we'd put an equal to 1 and then for D it's basically like the number of things were plotting so like the number of pairs of bars are so for that one we'd have 5 yeah we've seen when T is like basically the average twist in that pot like excuse me for a bar chart he talks about this interesting thing up in list comprehensions content because we enlist out you can use those comprehensions too and actually this example we're in useless comprehensions to be able to create these bar charts so it was two zero point eight one being the first data set what was five attention so five is DD like stands is like the number of pairs of things we're graphing so b5 yeah and the hints also like show like writes out like what all those things are brilliant here we go data generally want Murphy with of 0 8 is the first their five topics that are plotting so I'm just gonna do a little copy cut paste take this and change this to school B X and the one value that I need to change in this case is n right because this is the same with the same but is the second data set there's still five doing so let's run that I think this is a really good one for us to go over so we can explain what that yeah that we got to this one yeah cool all right so we can write a long create a figure of with ten and eight so we did this last one right so in this case what we're doing again plot dot figure using big size Wow nice parameter and we're setting it equal to 10 comma 8 again all right yeah I believe it's with yeah with the 10 hey to be always good to have a friend check you're cool so you're gonna create a set of axes and save them to you a X so that I guess just they mean like we're doing creating that variable ax in this case I'm doing one plot sub sub plot my typing says I'm not on today is there anything else we need to do on this one Jamie I don't think so I think that's it the first all right let's run that okay so here we're getting or figure you can start to see the X and the y chicks brilliant um again here till seen you so I thought okay plot a set of bars representing middle school a and a set representing middle school be next to each other on the same graph so Jamie how would we go about this so you want to create two separate bar charts so you want to use the top bar function this time with PLT so in step what was it in the first step we created our x set of values for school ax in school and school B so for the first party you would want school ax to be the first parameter and then you'd want the values associated with school X to be the second one so I'd be the list of what are we dealing with test scores yeah so I think write this not this second less middle suitable a alright so maybe that's okay and then so you say we're creating two bar charts so I'm basically gonna copy this paste that here and change Scooby here Matt okay there we go so we've gotten the data in there Rach good we made me wanna do some fixes up yes so one thing I do want to point out with this chart compared to our original chart one thing you might notice right now is that they're like seems to be less of a difference between the values the reason that is that if you notice in the original chart the axes go from Kenny I think it's from 70 to 90 and and then one we have right now we haven't set them so they go from zero to 100 so pay attention whenever you're like looking at a graph you want to like pay attention to like what the axes are showing because you might sense a bigger difference than there actually is yes I think this is again an important thing and what you should be thinking about if you're ever looking at a data visualization is what is the scale that's happening right again as Jamie was saying if you were to look at this versus this one you may think that there's um you'd have a stronger reaction like wow it's a really big difference in this case obviously also it seems like you know we know that test scores generally don't go from they do go from C is 70 I guess yeah I see a 70 that's the second less it's curved so yeah so it's in this one so I guess you really want to dig into the comparison really actually I want to basically zoom into this section of the graph Pearson um I'm gonna stop it there because we're four minutes until obviously there are some more steps in here but I'm sure you'll notice a lot of these next steps are just the same steps we did in the last part right it's still the styling it's adjusting the X ticks at illegals this one has a legend in it right because we want to know what the data set is between new and orange what values for comparing and creating titles and saving it so I think these are all things that's great for you folks who are here to now go and do on your own and as you'll see there's an additional four types of charts that you can go through so stacked bars histograms like we talked about earlier high charts like we talked about in line with shaded error which we did not talk about shaded air but that would be a great thing for you to explore and if you don't already understand again how we represent error with line graphs and we talked about it bar charts great thing to dig into so as folks know here at concatenated with polka me live in addition to today's session on Tuesday we also do a Thursday session so this Thursday Jamie and I will be back again it is the pro specific Q & A so Jamie and I have been talking about digging into the constellations project which comes up next in in this section it's one of the first cumulative projects that you get to do so it's a really really fun one you actually like plot a 3d graph which we haven't shown you yet you know if yes I thought there was gonna be maybe it makes sure about it maybe not that's alright but any case it's a really cool project we're excited to go over it and if you're joining us and you're here on Thursday and you work here today we can also answer any questions you might have about these additional ones that we didn't get through today so in addition to the Thursday event just like I call out we're actually doing a special Friday and then so we just released a new lesson or maybe it's getting released this week on emoji code so mochi code is actually a programming language I guess built in emoji I don't know much about it so I think I'm going to turn it in for the live stream because I'm excited to hear more about this I believe July is thrilled emoji month maybe or to July 17th is emoji day something like that any case so our curriculum developers Sonny 3d folks may know and I've seen this stuff before he's going to be interviewing Jamie any final words well I just want to say I had a lot of fun for my first live stream as I said in the beginning I'm I'm new here at code ketamine and I look forward to doing these again in the future and I looked I really enjoyed talking with everyone in the chat and then also just do the camera absolutely and thank you again Jamie for taking the time to read through and answer everyone's questions as we're going really appreciate that and excited to have you on the team and doing more live streams so with that folks it's 2 p.m. thank you again for joining us today and we will stop sharing my screen so it's a second but yeah well we'll hopefully see some of y'all on Thursday have a great rest of your week
