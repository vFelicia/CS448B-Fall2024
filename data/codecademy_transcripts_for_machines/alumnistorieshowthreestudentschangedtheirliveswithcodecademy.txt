three years ago I was gonna drop that I did not like I wasn't enjoying it I didn't really feel like I was going anywhere and I always wanted to work as a creative lots of places had it on their list of desirable things if you wanted to work as a creative people would like you to have HTML skills or some CSS skills so I thought well well I like take a couple of courses started out after college working as a IT specialist for about five years and then started to kind of have the itch to learn something new and start to teach myself to code I was just consuming a lot of things that other people have made so there's this feeling of wanting to actually build something in my own when your day to day is talking with folks who have been coding and engineering for 20 years it's pretty intimidating you start to look for ways to shore that up and to stand out in fact I made it my new year's resolution learn our code after that the forces I started trying to apply it stuff so I'd like one little tiny project of my own and I found it quite rewarding and I was like this is something I'm actually really enjoying doing wouldn't this be really good if I could do this all the time I can get paid for it I applied for an internship in New York and I got it so I spent a year in New York working as a developer for Citibank I didn't really have anything to properly show literally all I had was but I would say I took these characters resources and that is how I got the job I think the first time that it really clicked and I thought I was getting it was gonna go into the lessons and thinking okay and they just taught me how to randomize the things and I thought okay if I could do that there's something in my own life for me at the time it was picking out some exercises that I wanted it to do but not having the same ones every time I could actually take when I was exactly learning in that lesson do something on my own with it and then let me put it out there into the App Store's and see what happens just see if other people want to use it knowing how to code has got me off the sidelines and I got promoted and it happened at the end of the year so I was able to basically look back at my new year's resolution and say man that definitely paid off and I'm currently the found in the CEO of my own syrup are you protect me to learn for free people paying like thousands and thousands of pounds for university degree in some kind of computer science and I didn't and I still have a proper job I'm a proper developer sore could start off as a side project that was the first time you know I've started a project that actually clicked I think I got lucky on the first try at this point now we've helped over 25 million people work out that's great feeling
