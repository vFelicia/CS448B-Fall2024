all right here we are well hi everybody yes thank you for joining us today we're gonna get started with a recorded version of this webinar the background on that is that we wanted to make sure that we had all the relevant information for everybody without technical difficulties we're all at home my name is ELISA we're on the phone with Alex and sunny today Alex yeah hi I'm Alex curriculum developer at code Academy sunny and I have worked on putting together that blog post if you've seen that blog post about resources on how to work with coke atom e from home so that's a that's what we'll be talking about today a little bit yeah hello everybody I'm sunny I am currently wrapping up our learn Swift course with the learn Swift team and helping this gonna be a fun day yeah that blog post can be found at news dot code Kadim e.com that's gonna read as like a background I guess script go into some highlevel information we're gonna go deeper in today so in just a moment we're gonna press play on the recording if you're watching this you'll see sunny Alex in my camera go away so we can all focus on the broadcast that we have for you and then as soon as that's over we're gonna pop back in and we'll do Q&A I am super excited about this I'm super ready for this thank you so much for already engaging with the poll that we just sent out yeah just some questions so we can know who we're chatting with today cool Wow Wow it looks like we've got some people who just signed up one thing I want to test before we dive in for real is are we able to send Q&A can somebody just tell us where you're calling in from so like let's test out this this question and answer let's see what we get I'm from Colorado Susan I'm from Colorado it works and work we also have chat oh yeah cool and then Michael the poems or I might may have to launch the poll uh yeah I think I think it's gonna be greedy I'm gonna be greedy and be the only one who can see though the Preferences so so far it looks like 71% of you just signed up but 29 have you been coding for a while Pat yourselves on the back that's really great everybody we have 86% students on the line with us today 29% teachers 29% parents those don't add up to hundred that's because you could choose multiple and holy smokes a hundred percent of respondents that are learning Python Wow okay that's also a multiple choice so we've got fifty percent of people in system only but thirty three percent into C++ thank you for filling out the poll it's super exciting to see this happen time okay so this is who we've got with us we've got people from Pakistan Germany Greece south central Idaho and people learning all kinds of stuff so this is gonna be good this is gonna be great I think that we are ready we're five minutes in let's yeah so as this video is playing we'll be we'll just turn it off our camera but we'll still be here so if you want to ask questions in the question panel as the video is going feel free to do that and answer them as the video is going or kind of back lock them for after the video and we can answer them on air let's cool let's keep the lines of communication open and we are about to get started three two one everyone thank you for joining us today my name is Alisa I'm calling today but codecademy we've got two of our curriculum developers online can't wait to introduce you to them we have sunny leave hello everybody sunny I'm on that curricula team and Alex Koontz and today's webinar is to help everyone who has recently signed up for a scholarship or recently signed up or Codecademy to be super successful and use this time to learn to code so this is an opportunity I think for someone on our team sunny has so much passion for what he does so I think I think sunny why don't why don't you tell us about like how this scholarship program and and what you're doing at Koch added me all just fit together with our mission oh sure so Co cami is essentially a leading online learning platform that teaches Peabody code in a very easy and fun way and we have courses on computer science web development mobile development game development and data science we have courses on 14 different languages that each include lessons quizzes projects articles videos and Co challenges and our mission behind all of this is that we are trying to empower people around the world to transform everyone's personal and professional lives by helping them learn skills like coding and this is a very tough time as a former teacher I can't imagine what teachers and students are going through right now and we're trying us to to do everything that we can to support our student learners we believe that even though school may have been cancelled we hope that learning does not stop and on the term Alex right now to go over we're going to cover today in this webinar yeah so along those lines we think that coke Adam II is a platform that people can really use to continue learning while they may be stuck at home and not going to school and so today we're kind of gonna go through how you might do that whether you're a teacher and you're looking to develop some curriculum for your students that are stuck at home or you're a student that is at home and might not know what to do or what resources to turn to the purpose of this webinar is to really kind of guide you to use Khan Academy to help you work so we're gonna go through what code Academy is so if you've never used code Academy before and you don't know what it is or how to use it we're gonna give you a little bit of a demo of one of our lessons we'll talk about the scholarship program that we just started and how you can use your dot edu or dot k12 email address to sign up for a free promo code and then after that we all specifically discuss for teachers and for students like what strategies might want to use to use our curriculum and help you out in your classroom so we can walk through maybe different lesson plans that you might be able to make so let's go and get started with that I guess we'll start and something you can somebody was the once actually write this course but this is kind of our bread and butter on coke Adam II this is a code Academy course this one happens to be learn Swift so a typical course will be between 30 30 and 45 minutes we say so me like I met around that size for a course and so you know a fairly good block if you want to assign an assignment of course might be a good a good unit to be able to assign for a day or for a couple of days and kind of the benefit of coke Adam II is like we have this interactive coding environment so this is a course that's teaching Swift which is a programming language and you can see that there's instruction here and there are some instructions or goals that the the student is trying to accomplish we have some hints I can show how they how they accomplish those and then over here we have our interactive coding section of the website so you can write code here you can run the code and see the results and so really the benefit of code Academy is that it's all right there for you on the website you don't have to do any work to set things up outside of a website you literally just go to one of these courses and we've got you know this text editor where you can start writing code and some of the cool things about our learning environment is that we have a cloud navigation system so right on top of the coeditor you can actually manipulate different files the file names is also at the top and on the right hand side that's what's called a terminal this is where your when you type code and the coeditor the output will be displayed in the black box so you can see you know we're doing some simple coding here or we're adding one plus one but as you walk through these lessons things will get more complicated and in this case you would learn all about the programming language Swift so that's kind of the basic basic stuff like what code catta me is essentially it is curriculum about coding where you get to code along as you're learning next we wanted to talk a little bit about the scholarship itself so we're offering the scholarships to students and teachers that have education email addresses so you know that end in dot edu or dot k12 you'll see down here in the frequently asked questions if you are a student or our teacher and don't have one of those email addresses you can fill out this form and we'll try to get you one of these scholarships anyways so essentially what this scholarship is is access to more every bit of curriculum on our site so if you click here to join pro on this page is where you would sign up with that dot edu or dot k12 email account and so I'll do I'll sign up with my own University email account hello Carleton people and if we go and say start coming out we also gotta do a CAPTCHA identify some motorcycles hmm fun cool so we you just signed up for or we just signed up for an account there's a little bit of onboarding if you want some course recommendations things like that but instead of doing that we can just jump to the catalog and Sonny do you want to talk a little bit about what people can do now that they have one of these scholarships and one of these pro accounts what maybe I'm doing the catalog kami has 14 different programming languages if you count some of the market languages like HTML CSS and SAS with the scholarship and lots pretty much all the content and courses in our catalog so with the pro search screen you have pro courses you have something called skill path which essentially teaches a skill using a basic language and you also have career paths such as web dental and path in computer science path data science path almost once long of curriculum yeah these these paths are cute which I would say you know three four months minimum we would take to get through some of these fads yeah about past that you can actually start from not knowing any code not having write in any code and we just kind of built you up from there yeah yeah but so to be clear when you sign up using these scholarships you'll see that this is the account that I just I just created using one of those edu accounts and you'll see that it is a coke at me Pro account so when you sign up using these scholarships you have access to literally every single piece of content that we have on the site so any of these chrome courses that you might be interested in taking skill pouts you'll have access to to any of those these scholarships are for 90 days we as of now we're having these runs through the what the traditional school year would be so at the end of those 90 days your account won't be the activator in it or anything you won't just no longer have access to these core courses a question if I were a teacher how would I go about sharing with my class what they can do or should do yes so Sonny and I were both teachers somebody if you were a teacher and you had to figure out curriculum how would you use Khan Academy to to do that yeah so the first thing I try to pinpoint is what the class like to do in this downtown some of the students and I want to build a web app they might want to build a mobile absolutely I want to build a create like a data visualization a chatbot so basically first I'll pinpoint their experience level their interests their grade level and create a lesson plan based on that by picking a course or skill path or a clear path and create a weekly calendar with our monthly calendar for the class to follow trying to you know make the students stay engaged in this time I'll probably post weekly discussions weekly checkins with the students another thing that I love to do is building team projects so after every you know a couple of modules it's on code Academy have students split up into different groups that have you know design something that wanted note and kind of just let them go for it yeah I think if we so I just clicked into the Java course Java's the language that AP Computer Science and sought in so this might be relevant to some teachers out there if we go into the learn Java course and take a look at the syllabus you can see the way that we've broken down the content is into fairly manageable chunks where again anything marked as a lesson is probably 30 to 45 minutes of content introduction so let's see if we go down the loops chapter this this lesson on loops will be introducing the concept of what is a loop you don't have you know that guided practice again working in the interactive coding terminal you can jump in here and look at that it's a links but again so we teach what the concept of loop is students are going to be able to practice it and you know pass these means challenges or checkpoints so in general I would say a lesson is kind of equivalent to a 45minute class that you might have you know during a normal school day we also have these quizzes which are a little bit shorter those only usually be 10 to 15 multiplechoice questions about that topic that they just learned so that's a good check for understanding at the after students have completed the lesson and then projects which is a content type that we haven't really talked about yet again that is similar to a lesson in that they're gonna be coding right on the code Academy platform what is this this is fizzbuzz right there are a number of tasks that students will be asked to do and again they'll be coding right in the text editor right here but the idea behind projects is that they're a little bit more selfguided and independent and students are asked to apply the skills that they just learned rather than learning the skills for the first time so if I were a teacher I would really I would probably organize my curriculum around okay we're gonna do an interactive lesson we learn new material we're gonna do a project that code Academy gave us where you're building something from scratch and then I would probably also challenge them my students to expand upon those projects and so that's probably what I would do if I were a teacher where I would go through the go through the lessons try the projects and then ask my students to expand on on the project's themselves which is maybe a good place for collaboration or like pair programming yeah and that's another way you can also divide up the curriculum is just maybe one module a day it might be a lot for beginners but I think it's easily doable within an hour yeah the module is one of these kind of collapsible sections so this is the module an array an ArrayList yeah I would say I would say maybe an hour and a half two hours for a module depends on how he can really want to dive into it yeah but I could definitely see that the probe is that you have every student share the same progress right so you can have nice end of the week discussions or you know have a point where you can all build a project together yeah for it for student for students if you don't have a teacher that's supplying you curriculum right if you're just a student that signed up for wannabe scholarships and you just got here and you're wondering what to do I probably get going to the catalog I probably would look at these career paths these are really long sections of content where Sonny and I were talking about this earlier where it might take three or four months to complete this but take a look at these see what you might be interested in whether it's building websites whether it's doing more kind of computer science theory the computer science tool path is pretty similar to what you might see in intro collegelevel courses or the first collegelevel courses or the data science don't path also if you're interested in analyzing data visualizing data all that all that kind of stuff you scopa sorry yeah no I just took a question if if I am a student how much experience do I need to have yeah so for these skill paths you can start completely from scratch you definitely don't need any experience we build them in such a way that we start you from the very beginning and we get you to a point where you're building something pretty cool so that that's a that's a really good place to start the the courses in the catalog vary there are some you know recommended that skills that you should already have like the machine learning course for example is fairly complex so you should be familiar with with a handful and things people are going into there but in general these skill paths you can start from absolutely no programming experience we will build it completely from the ground up and and there's so much content in there that by the end of it you're building some pretty cool stuff you know but remember one thing that if you're a student that you should do is try to pinpoint what you want to build now help you pick the right course we also kind of develop this course recommendation that we broke down as a freaking team that kind of divides up our catalog by education level so you should definitely check that out yeah yeah it's a great idea to take notes while you're taking a course so you can you know look back while you're doing the the project we also offered two sheets now to help you retain the knowledge that you're learning especially the syntax and we'll love for you to think about things they can build doing this specific time we already seen a couple really cool projects I think 100 workers Zoey's strike this out she sent this really cool little web app it's called do not touch it face essentially uses a webcam and a machine learning algorithm to to remind people alert people do not touch their faces buddies find your friends your classmates and try to you know appear fresh and get started with you and you know something cool together that's like one of the beauty of you know tech right now yeah so I think that's about it Lisa do you have anything else that you want to talk about no I think that this was fantastic I think that we covered the basics of how to get started with a scholarship or without one really I feel like this answers questions for a lot of people I think one of the first questions that I know in the community we see people ask is like where do I get help how it's gonna help me get unstuck I think we put together or you all put together a good list actually if that's something that we could show thank you yeah the piece or section me yes the yeah sure sure sure yes yes yes right we talked about teachers the students yeah so here are additional resources the coke atom II community so discuss that code Kathleen dotcom we say you do a ton of work over here if you want to talk a little bit about what's going on here sure yeah this is the space to come when you get stuck not if because that's part of it that's what that's what the learning is this space is actually completely monitored and moderated by a group of volunteers you'll most likely interact with them and our awesome teammate will is in here too answering questions all the time so this is a good place to go I am particularly fond of the rest of the work that you all put together too because there's an entire world adjacent to coke atom II and ways to learn too yeah so there's there's a bunch of really great YouTube channels that teach me how to code my personal favorite is the coding training which is NYU professor he does kind of similar bitesized coding exercises where he'll go through he teaches you how to build the snake game in around a half hour so even if you're not super experienced from a river yet I find that just watching people code and hearing them talk and seeing their thought process can be really helpful and as as he's going through these projects you might have ideas on how to change it a little bit or things that you might want to add that he didn't add so I really love specifically the coding train but they're a ton of really good YouTube resources out there as well we also added in oh yeah this is a great blog post how to start a group project collaboration is super important in coding and then this little piece just helps you get started yeah we'll try to get these links out to you but you can always look through our blog or Google how mister project wink at me and you should be able to find this finance blog post and then hacker ranking leak these two are really great platforms that can help keep your coding skills sharp by you know having these little code challenges that are great for the data structure and algorithm problems for technical interviews I think it's super nice to have something like this to do you know ten minutes a day 20 minutes day 30 minutes a day yeah I think these two don't don't focus a ton on introducing new concepts but if you already have a little bit of programming experience and you want some basically you want a 15 minute problem to wrap your mind around and test out your coding skills both of these are really great resources for that oh yeah another one is the COO Cammy app the code can we go yeah yeah I forgot to put that one on that one's just our mobile app that has also bitesized flashcards and while you're you know on Instagram while Jason or he could just you know that dude's coding for 10 minutes there's there's less you know typing code on that app just because that's a that's a pretty lousy experience fee writing out a bunch of a bunch of code on the app but a lot of really great review cards and like multiplechoice questions kind of quiz questions type things so yeah yeah is a good resource as well that's good I think what what all of these resources here have in common with code Academy Pro is that they're an opportunity to practice I think something that's really important to call some attention to is that code Academy is open to everybody and so much there's so much you can learn for free with code Academy Pro and this scholarship you get the opportunity to practice and I'll leave it to Alex and Sonny the actual educators here of the power of practice but when we want to actually make sure that we are cementing something we want to dive in and that's what we're we're really excited to be able to offer right now yeah I think you said it well yeah we know there are little features we have streets so uh with everyone everyone you know not necessarily going to school every day we could see some high streets up on our platform people logging in every day and we do a lesson or two now we were talking about potentially putting together a leader board yeah that'd be great I don't I don't know what the what the biggest streak we've ever had is but be fun to fun to find out uh yeah that's something that we can we can learn I don't know if that's I don't over promise there's an exciting time to see how many consecutive days I do think we will get a you know increased street numbers on each other all right this was super and super informative and I am really looking forward to sharing this with educators and students who are looking for something like this there should be an opportunity either on the Facebook post where this resource is shared or if you can't find an opportunity to write a comment on this webcast join us in the forums and definitely find the space that we've created just for students and teachers here ask questions Alex and Sonny don't want to speak for you but this is great I think that let's in fact just one last time and land on that Thank You page because that's what we really mean here a giant thank you for sticking with us today and for learning with us all right good luck out there you alright alright there we go we're here looking to share video okay cool we've got some questions there are some questions that came through for you Sonny and Alex it's just super exciting let's start with do you provide the full courses of all the languages are just the basics this is multiple answers here yeah so I would say that some languages are just the basics and some languages have a lot of content kind of our newer material is covering the basics although you know we go fairly far into into the details I think you can speak more to that like Swift is one of our newer languages how would you say how far into like basic Swift do you guys good yeah I'll say we teach probably all the fundamentals of Swift before so the large sort of course basically teaches the language rather than to just like how to build an iOS app but we are thinking about building a skill path or career path on iOS curriculum very soon so that will take you there and and we're trying to do that we try to like model that around how our Python content works right now so in the learn Python 3 course you're learning the basics of the language but you know you able to take that and learn different skills and skill paths like you know you'd learn about all the different Python packages and libraries such as matplotlib for 2dimensional data visualizations you learn about psyche learn package in the machine learning skill path and that will teaches you how to do some basic supervisor and supervised learning using the package we teach another really fun one is the beautiful library that helps you web scrape pulling data from different websites what else do we got for Python yeah basically I would say take a look at the career paths which here maybe I can share my screen just so I can show this once we talk about it cool by the way this is the perfect time to ask any questions we're here to answer okay we have we have ten in the queue right now okay I'm excited to see what Alex has this year I'm just gonna pull up the show the career paths which are kind of our longest who actually want me give me a second to screen share I need to log into my cup cami account let's answer another question yeah so we got a question from Faruk Mohammed can enunciate enjoin these courses absolutely most of our courses a lot of our courses actually help you get started from scratch so you don't need a CS degree or you don't need to take have taken is yes programming course to start on cocaptains yeah I'm also and actually I think this can be a twofer once Alex hits his screen setup there's one from Irene whoo if I were interested in following two career paths at the same time oh there we go what sort of daily schedule would you recommend to complete both in three to five months complete both yeah so that's which I don't know if Irene you're still in the in the stream but can you let us know which two career paths that you're taking right now because that might answer might be different web de and see us thanks Irene is super quick okay so web dev and CSR both are two of our probably longest paths career paths that we have it's it's definitely gonna be very tough to do both in let's say four or five months but if you do want to take that route which is which is possible I'll say you probably have to be coding learning every single day I'll say one module a day seems one module to two modules days seems about right yeah those paths are pretty big I would say one of the so I worked a lot on the data science career path and I think that one is equally as big as its computer science and web dev and I would say I would ask to meet like six to nine months to complete the data science path you know if you're coding you know if you're coding it for five or ten hours a week I would say it would take six to six to nine months yeah but it's doable it is doable but yeah and I also think is cool to be jumping between career paths where you're definitely learning different skills and you can start to see similarities between languages that pop up in those different paths okay I have another question yeah and you guys you can you can see past that would be okay I'm a first year computer science student I want to specialize in cybersecurity and AI what is the best programming language to master for these two subjects I already know Java and Python which one would be more helpful on my case yeah a Python is definitely my programming language of choice and I think that that's a great one to use for AI and cybersecurity stuff we have a little bit of AI content on coke Adam II and all of that is in Python there are a lot of really great Python libraries for doing machine learning and AI stuff um so that's a good place to start and as you get further further along into it you might do you might dive into some other languages but I would say Python is a good place to start you yeah just to name a few libraries for Python in terms of AI tensorflow is great for machine learning Carris is great if you're you know free opensource library well tensorflow is free open source but Chara's it's great if you're interested in learning deep learning I'm secular and we teach that and the gift started with machine learning and in the data science path course that also is a nice package to help with like the basics of machine learning yeah try to I don't know if I've ever talked to a learner who took the AI course that we have mmm that I wrote and I really love feedback on that so I so give that one a shot if you're an AI students I would love to hear what you think about it thank you I think that it's just I think we already answered this but I think it's also worth repeating oh we did with Farooq let's just put this in stone cannon on C a student join these courses yeah in terms of whether you can join the yeah so as long as you have a dot edu or dot k12 email account you can get one of these scholarships will post the we'll post the link to the scholarship page all over the place I'll post in the chat in a second but as long as you have one of those email accounts you can sign up for a scholarship it doesn't matter if you're a student or a humanities student or whatever it you can get it no matter what if you don't have a dot edu or k12 email account we have a form that you can fill out and we'll hopefully be able to get you set up with that as well it might take a day or two to get that set up but I'm trying to get you an account yeah there's there's another question I think it's been here awhile from Deepika will you introduce more languages like C sharp or etc yeah so we actually already have a csharp course that we recently released I'll say few months ago and we are currently working on ASP skill path that our coworker Nick is working on so it will be out in the upcoming months very soon and then we have another question from Troy thanks so each student needs to fill out a form question mark can you tell me how to assign things through Google classroom and check student's progress I have used Google classroom before the UX is for dental volunteer work at a co nation on that you school classroom and the UX is kind of complicated I don't know if you used it before else but it will be very difficult to teach that in this webinar so so unfortunately on code Academy we don't have something that like lets a teacher you know say that these 13 accounts or my students accounts and like let me look at all their progress we don't have anything right now that lets us do that I've seen that we request a couple of times just in this in this webinar so that's a good thing to note that that's something that you all are asking for when I was the classroom teacher I use code Academy and it's not super graceful but you can definitely basically I had I have my students like screenshot their their progress really yeah right because especially because our UI shows like you know that they're what what quizzes they've taken what modules they've taken okay so it's not super graceful but that's like something that you can do to check that project and have that be submissions I suppose you can also have them I don't know something you have any other advice on how you can track it check in on students and see how they're doing I mean one way that you know we we talked about this in video but it would be nice to have students work on team projects together like prayer Broga prayer program together so after you know every one module two modules you have students work on you know basically submit the code or like the folder zip file or the output like if you actually post it somewhere on github or somewhere of the code itself so that's like another way to check proper to see that they actually understood the material applied it to their own personal projects yes some of these some of these skill pounds have I know exist have off platform projects which basically means their products that instruct students or whoever is taking the course to download code themselves working on it on their own machine rather than on the code cottony website and so something like that would be fairly easy to first for a teacher to be able to check in on because the students are downloading the code themselves and working at on working on the code on their own machine they can just send you those files so maybe an op off platform project like this one where you actually go and download the code instead of working on it on Co Academy that might be a little bit easier for teachers that are looking to like checking on students okay I hope there's some like really good questions coming through now I'm not so sure that we got to this one but this is probably the most popular question I see asked in the community forums is if I want to be job ready with Jessica ketamine will that be enough the question goes on to say that I know I want your view and your advice and by the way I'm already focusing on a web development path okay we could yeah we get that question a lot so I mean you want to take that I think you might know the end of web development path better than I do yeah so I think I mean the goal of code Cammy at least on the curriculum team is try to build something that's a almost like a onestop shop where you can come to cook at me you know finish a career path and be job ready but I do think that it's important to go off platform a lot of times to seek out resources wherever you can so as you're taking a course on code Academy I highly suggest to take know even though you don't you know sometimes you don't look back on your notes it's good to it's a way to retain information I'll also try to build a lot of portfolio projects right like use the Codecademy projects the prompt to build something euro and I will try to join different communities like the code Academy community on Facebook and mobilize I'll try to join Twitter follow all my favorite RIT you know a lot of like wellknown developers I would try to join deaf too you know just just a talk code right and and you know once you're done with the one on path you should definitely take that data stretch and algorithms any of you prep on code kami for JavaScript and that should be able to and just network but there are a lot of things that you should do I think I'm gonna write a blog post on this later on to to to you know make the the programming journey and more a whole a whole London yeah echo what you said sunny I think like the number one thing is probably to build a portfolio or a personal website or github someplace where you can show the work that you have done and so the way that you can use CAD imme to do that is to like take the take the off platform project seriously right where if there's if there's an off platform project that asks you to download code and work on it on your own machine really make sure that you are like comfortable doing that and then once you are comfortable doing that I would even recommend like you know if you're working on a project that's on code Academy on the website you can do it on the website but then I would we can say grab that code throw it into your code editor on your own computer and um you know expands on that project do stretch goals new challenges things like that and kind of trying to turn it into your own thing and then that can be a part of your portfolio or website or or something like that but you basically just like have to be able to show your code somewhere show can also talk code that's a very underrated skill to write to chat like to talk about programming and I also think this is a great time to I mean it's a down time right it's good time to reset and work on things that we're just like tackle things that you've never tried before with coding there are a lot of virtual hackathons going on right now that you could take a look a lot of them are Cove in nineteen related but I highly suggest you to join one you know find a team and come out with the project next question yeah Alex you're still sharing screen sure I can stop wait so this event is like this is another one that I want to touch on because it's such a common one I'm having a hard time choosing the kind of path I need to take hmm when I start a path I can't focus on it because I'm not really sure if it's the right one for me how can I fix that yeah I mean this is a great question I feel like you're gonna give this question it doesn't matter which career path career industry that you're in is this thing for me I've definitely run into that problem a lot because I'm somebody who's interested Oh a lot of things that means we are I'm interested mobile I'm interested in creative coding I'm interested in hardware but I suggest that you just try a bunch of things right before committing to a career path definitely learn some of the fundamentals right like a1 learn X course so you understand the fundamentals of programming and you can use that take that with you whenever you decide whichever career path that you want to take and also I like to pinpoint I think that you should pinpoint which what kind of things that you want to work on right I think that's a very important thing do you want to build a bit of a position do you want to build a Twitter bod you want to build this Square bot do you want to build a heart where projects do you want to work on well the lab web app desktop apps frontend backend do want to work with data like sequel our Python so you got a pin point you know the things they text you like that makes you that you enjoy before you know and you don't have to commit on anything right you can just everything you learn will help you become a better programmer better data scientists better whatever game developer so yeah we don't have you don't have to commit and you can just try to career path for as long as you want and then if it's not for you you you know you turn over to a different of course her path actually that's a decent segue I heard the buzz word game development so from Victor though what languages are career paths would you recommend for gaming development to build skills and become a game programmer so we actually have a skill path on build webbased games using javascript and phaser library phaser Jas library so if you know HTML CSS in JavaScript you should definitely take that next but uh in game industry my cousin is a game developer he's told me that the two languages that people look for are C++ and C sharp so C++ work with the real engine super popular and csharp works with something called unity and those are so learn C sharp and learn C++ are two languages that you should also try to pick up on code can be neat I'm just gonna take yeah there are a lot of great they're a lot of what a lot of questions there are a lot of great what's that there's I think there's a delay with Alex so Alex okay yeah that probably is gonna help Alex did you want to add to that answer for game development yeah there are a lot of great intro tutorials to unity I know and so that's using using C sharp so if you do some of it some artwork on coke add immediate and then you can also follow along with some of those android tutorials on unity which is a really good place to start game dev stuff great thank you I want to share it somebody in the chat right now Susan Sebastiani she is they are sharing information in one in two points exactly how they're using code Academy in the classroom so Susan thank you and I am going to copy/paste some of this information here so that we can have it for later that's really cool of you thank you for doing that okay so still getting questions this is cool one from Freddy Cortazar no let's say that you're completely new to coding how would you choose a language out of all the generalpurpose ones is there a resource that explains not the pros and cons but more like the differences so I think this like we already answered like how do you choose but are there any resources that you go to do to pick a language to like show the differences between the languages or just surely yeah I also YouTube and Google are great places to look for there's tons of videos that's called you know the top ten languages of 2020 I would say the top two right now and then distri is you know one number one number two is Python JavaScript I thought is super beginner friendly it the syntax like how the coat looks the grammar structure and the the spelling of the the code the surface of the code rather than the semantics which is the meaning behind the syntax of Python is very very simple does have too much clust clutter it's actually not a super new language it was developed like in late 80s 89 but it's super popular because he has you know like went out 120,000 libraries and like almost two hundred thousand packages and they use a you can use it in a variety of domains like you know it's popular for backend it's popular for machine learning ai it's popular you can use it for hardware now and JavaScript it's you know it makes a you know the webpages move so that's also you know definitely in the top two but Python you can learn it from scratch javascript i highly recommend you learn you know HTML and CSS first before jumping to JavaScript and Java scripts great for a web development and mobile development but outside of the number one number two the top 5 and top 10 that's very debatable we just see it you know a top two very strong and their lead but you know some people say Chavez you know third some people say you know C++ you know they're the list goes on III would suggest like looking at outcomes of like what products do you think are cool what what are you interested in and then try to figure out what languages are used to make that make those projects and so right if you're like super into design and um that sort of stuff then you might want to go down CSS HTML Javascript and make really awesome websites if you're more into data then that might be more Python that kind of stuff so I would say realistically if you've never coded before I always recommend doing Python because it's a really good beginner lesson or beginner language but if you if you have an idea of what you want to make I would look at those outcomes if you want to make iphone apps then there's no reason why you can't start learning Swift right yeah any language you can you can learn even with no experience and so if you don't care about what you want to do I would suggest Python but if you have an idea of what you want to do then look at me outcomes and trying to figure out what programming language is used to make that sort of stuff well what was your first language Alex I took I started coding in AP Computer Science in what 2008 and the AP tests hot Java and then when I went to college all like the intro courses were impacted on and so I did Java for a year and then quickly jumped over the Python and that's primarily what I coated in for for like how about you C C++ okay interesting yeah I've written like like ten lines of C code in my life next question yeah sure this one actually is coming from the chat this isn't coming from the question okay we might need Marielle another member of the c2c dev team for this but what applications would you need to learn natural language processing and why you learned why actually why I learn natural is processing what applications do you yeah what application to match language library and repositories of books and articles and all this sort of stuff that just like comes pre built into Python so it's a pretty easy language to get to get started so why why an ope I'm also fascinated by NLP because its language is absurdly difficult like it's amazing that you know we can talk to Siri and she has any idea what we're saying right it's I think it's cool because it's like kind of a field where it can always get better and it's like so difficult that there's like always innovations and it gets better and better which i think is kind of cool yeah it's it's it's it's interesting so Emma P is like intersection between linguistics computer science machine learning and not only we're talking about like audio right we're also talking about like word processing and like a Google search or so we we actually rely on and I'll pay more and more especially in like 2020 yeah how do I use it I'll be in my life I mean Gmail just added the thing where it every sentence is like a predicted sentence right remember Li to write scene how to predict or sorry uh was it was that you know we're like Google Docs or something like it predicts the next yeah yeah right that's what I'm talking about yeah but yeah all the voiceactivated technology all of that is relying on on NLP to understand what what you're talking about it's already filled though I think grad schools are offering and LP programs in the last like five years but it's still you know relatively new what framework would you sorry I didn't work more questions what framework would you advise to learn for web development in Python so there's flask and Django are the two big ones we have Flash content coming out within the next couple of months I don't know why we picked flask over Django but those are the two big ones and we're doing flasks there are two questions that came in that I think I can actually answer so one of them was from Emmanuel is when is the next Community Challenge so a plug for how the communities work it comes from community members so if that's something that you can visit discuss cook enemy comm find a moderator find a super user and propose lunch and also find me you can find me there and we can put one together that's a that's the thing that we just we just do one one another question that I think I can answer from Stephen Gardner's will there be a meetup in person when this is all over gosh I hope so gosh I hope so I hope we have so many in New York City if you're local yeah absolutely as all things that come from that happen in the community they come from the community so Stephen not sure where you are but if you want to see a meetup happen locally I'm find me I can find you in the forums and we can do that I'd love to support you with that so we're at 59 we're at the top of the hour any parting words from Alex and Sonny parting words Jesus I know sorry I didn't mean it like that today's call I think this is a great time to I mean it's an interesting time very weird time but I think it's a good time to buckle down and you know take advantage of this time if you've been working you know six seven days a week there's a great time to catch up on your shows if you you know don't feel like you know you've been doing much and you want to pick up you know want to get started this is like a great time to reset and you know learn the skills that you need you know build the little primal program that you always wanted to build I definitely have you know five books that haven't finished that I'm trying to reap doing this period I have like I started by having finished there's tons of little projects I projects I've been working on that I'm trying to knock out who knows when it's all over but yeah I think this is a great time to to work on things that you always wanted to and I really hope yeah yeah yeah this was super cool it's nice to hear from all of you I think the echoing what Sonny is saying just like I think one of the difficulties of doing all this from home is that collaboration is a huge part of coding I saw one question here was like I was talking about what are the main challenges of letting students self learn on your platform as opposed to like being in school I think the biggest challenge with that is that when you're at school you can collaborate super easily with with other people so I would say that the biggest challenge is that your higher self and it's hard to talk to people it's hard set bounds ideas off of them and so I'd recommend doing whatever you can to collaborate with people whether that's you know getting on zoom' calls and sharing your screen and working through code together yeah doing whatever you can to not feel as completely isolated as you could be if you're just coding alone yeah that's onwards what's up I said I guess I I guess I answered a question my final word because I did okay oh yeah what are your Twitter handles yeah we can we can share those these but yeah happy to chat after this through messages and whatnot if you have questions more questions you know we're in the same situations as everybody right the whole world is kind of on pause right now so it's kind of great to to also you know give me some time to work with everybody here I think we talked with Michael Cruz I don't know if he's still in the chat but for like two three hours last Friday about things that you know the kirkin team at code can we can improve because we're definitely trying to build something and there's so many tons of areas where we can still make a lot of stride and you know making our content better is you know even our highest traffic courses like WebEx courses like learnings to know and things like that so yeah the main point is that we like hearing from you and that's all I would kind of say I want to hear from you so much more this was cool I don't want to volunteer sunny and Alex but I'll say it for myself we're gonna do this more like like this is fun this is easy you know we're just getting on and chatting with all you it's it's fun it's yeah it's fun because you showed up so thanks for doing that and hope to see you next time thank you everyone everybody Oh Alex you gonna end it thanks Larry yeah let me figure out how to turn this off by Alton
