I think we're recording now yeah we're good hello everyone I'm Chris I'm a community manager for D big bank and Ashley if you want to say hello hi I'm Ashley um I'm a community engineer for do Bing So today we're going to chat to you about a really exciting project that will be exceptionally relevant to everybody in here so okay I say everyone in here my assumption is that everybody here is from the typescript um courses and is interested in in typescript um so let me just paste this in chat right now if you click on that link you will go to.big bang.com so for those of you who might be watching this later I am going to screen share so then people can see um I've got my notes on there if I'm looking over there you know why so what we're going to do today is we're going to take a look at do big bang we're gonna have a look at all the cool features uh and we're going to demonstrate why Big Bang is an excellent playground for you typescript people uh typescript Learners um to make games it's a great platform for that so first of all uh Ashley could you post the link to the login and sign up for me so on Big Bang you can see we've got all sorts of games on the front page and we've got lots of um feature content we've got uh all sorts of awesome games and objects that people have made um you can just click on any of these and just jump straight in you don't need an account or anything if you click on log in and you actually I click the right one thank you uh if you sign up for an account then what you'll be able to do is make stuff and it'll all be saved in your avatar in your profile on the top right so here is everything that I've ever made here is all the objects so like I can type in wac which I always tag my objects for weekly art challenge so this is just objects that I've made using the voxal object editor in the browser and then the games that I've made they're all like little prototypes and messing about and stuff like that um so I'm going to customize my avatar uh this is actually incredibly bad because I have a custom avatar um so like you can change your face but I've just realized my custom avatar gets overridden by the default character so if we if we pretend that I'm not a wizard none of this blue wizard stuff exists I can like change my avatar Parts um and I can be a clown with some stuff this looks really bad apologies and then you can like save it and like add accessories and those kinds of things right so that's part of the user experience what I'm going to do next now for anybody who signed up what we're going to do is we're going to join the Hub right so an incredible thing about W bang is we're completely web based all of our tools and all of our games are on your browser so I'm going to send you this link and what you're able to do is you're able to just join me no download no nonsense and we'll see if we can get a few people together uh anything you'd like to add anything I've forgotten Ashley if you don't have an account as well you just won't have so interesting okay we're in cool so all of this oh R hello it's you it's Ashley so everything in do big bang can easily be so asy doing emotes me doing emotes jumping anything related to automatically yes that's right press Escape if you w to get your hello people hello so this is our H world don't tell anybody but we're we're we're doing a new one it's amazing have you seen it yet actually excited that's really cool I can't wait yay I can see wacko from the chat or wo hello so you can press any of the uh one to nine and you can do little emotes so just have a Wonder round so we got like lots of um games that you can play in here in the Coliseum things like pocket Garden Ashley are you noticing what I'm noticing what you have the top Fisher thing I noticed that no the The Walking oh I didn't I didn't know this so yeah Ashley and I are just going to chill fishing for it a little bit oh that is really strange what is going on there um oh my God so yeah we've got like you can fish and then you can sell your pets and then you can sell your pets sell your fish um grab some pets and they can follow you around and we've got like quests and this is just just the whole world where we all kind of congregate when we want to try something new I think it's because I'm screen sharing to be honest when are we building our own RuneScape Chris I've actually done that F I've actually been prototyping like a Skills game so Ashley could you do me a favor uh and post a link to chase heroes yes oh yes it's definitely just a few lines of C uh we'll get into coding and stuff later um Ash asley has now posted a link to chase Heroes if people want to come join us so this game is super super easy hey Jamie welcome this game is super super easy to understand it's an obacle course um this was actually showcased from GDC um fairly recently whoa that is L give me one second there we go oh it's Ashley hello so you can actually see on my oh my screen share stopped there we go so we can see that the all the Shadows have been disabled on my on my game because my laptop struggling a little bit with all the windows opening the screen share it's automatically being more performant I can screen share on my computer too I'm working on a a big monstrous gaming computer you want to do that that is totally up to you yeah that's right uh NY Alco so oh I guess I'm going [Laughter] over uh so yeah all of the games that you see on D bang on the front page in the hub have been made using the inine TS so we have scripting we have um our Vox object editor we have our game editor and all of those are free um oh oh no oh I've been squished no it's a disaster um and I realize I'm concentrating more on the game than I am talking to everybody so like you'll notice that everybody's just running around doing their own thing playing the game and it's all Network this is by default um so it makes making multiplayer games super super easy as you saw with me just send with Ashley just sending a link sharing the games that you make and getting testers in and that sort of thing super super easy to do it's it's rudimentary at this point um and you don't have to do anything that's like one of the mo one of the things that Drew Drew me to this because I was actually just a user uh a couple of years ago and I got really excited about the project started um learning how to script and making stuff and it's super super cool and now we're here with you guys uh you should be able to click your car ah I just read the comment actually so yeah uh oh no how's everybody else doing oh I can see you behind me Ashley hello I've only played this game a few times I know right it's incredible don't forget if you have any questions at all for us throughout this feel free to post them in chat and uh and we'll get around to go one sure we answer your questions uh so we have a whole bunch of creators on the platform some make boxel objects some script some make call games all of that's just available for you I forgot to mention that also if you're if you can access chromium on your device so be it a tablet or phone or whatever I made it yeah sorry uh dot Big Bang runs in any Chromium browser it also runs in Safari and all sorts of other things as well uh but it it works best on Chrome um and there's a couple reasons for that uh such as the console uh the dev tools right so that's it for a quick demonstration uh in terms of the platform uh sorry in terms of um play players perspective what I'm going to quickly do I've just looked at the time I'm a little behind but so we'll try and catch up I'm going to quickly do is I'm G to make a voxal object H so um if we are in our profile we've got create new voxal object or we've got a hamburger menu on the top right to create an object and then it will give us some start stuff that we can choose from so I'm just going to pick a blank one so uh we have our little Color Picker and then I can just left click because I'm adding a voxel uh or I can get rid of them now what I'm going to do is use some super super simple shapes and I'm going to make like a little plat form and then what Ashley's going to do she's going to do some cool stuff with that uh so Chris I don't know if you mentioned this um is this a collaborative sandbox could both of you be working on the same project that is exactly what we will be doing later so um the actual the end the way the engine's buildt means that in a minute in in a few minutes everybody will be able we'll send a link out and everybody will be building together there's no um build time if you change a variable the effect of it is instant it's all it basically it's like Google Docs and do you have do you have permissions where people can see but not edit yes so if I come up here um let's just do uh random platform code academy uh Capital C please friend right so we can see published usable by others and remixable published means that anybody can see it uh usable by others means that people can use it in their projects and remixable means that they can somebody can make a copy own copy and edit it freely and the same is true for gains as well um I don't know bear with me one second I had a plan in mind uh that's not it oh do you know what this will do so I'm just going to use the fill tool now come down here add a and I'm just going to do something that doesn't look terrible hopefully uh I'm going to oh my goodness this is terrible it's fine this is a speed build and I'm not an artist as such so this is totally fine uh what is this ashle I don't know what this is I think it's awesome I don't know what it is either but I cookie I think uh I'm I'm rushing too much rather than enjoying the process are you trying to make a coin uh I'm attempting to make a platform that Ashley can then use will a coin work for you as well Ashley yeah coin would work we can make a coin pick up all right so uh so I'm that's it we're done we're done we made a coin it's got a see on it it's the Chris coin so I'm just going to rotate the front this way and make sure the origin fine right I've saved it that's it done so there are tons of tools in the Vox object editor um we've made a coin it's a bit rubbish but that's totally fine because we can change that later on so Ashley would you like to do something cool with this coin that I've made sure um first I'm gonna could I would you mind stopping okay you stopped sharing your screen so I'm going to take over before I do anything I'm just going to do a grand tour of making a game um so that people know how to start that process Etc um so sharing my screen do big bang There we go so you've seen it before here it is not B bang.com um so you can just go so that was create objects that was making voxal objects that's where you'd make all your art for your games um and then if you click build games you're going to get this screen that gives you a bunch of examples to start from so there's an empty game we have like some templates for starter games uh if you want to have something already there to work with so we've got like an Obby an FPS um this intro to Magic just kind of shows you the basics of scripting um like how to move something how to make a door open uh how to send events uh then this other scripting examples shows like a lot more advanced stuff um and then some environment design examples so you can pick whatever you want as a starter I usually go for the empty game um and then you're in here and you're ready to start editing but I'm actually going to edit a game that is uh that we can all edit together in a little bit uh that I prepared for this so oh let me reload this um so I'm just going to give a tour of what our game editor looks like if you've used any other game engines uh some of the stuff might be familiar but you don't need to have any experience with um making games to jump in um so you're just going to click edit Ashley you're no longer screen sharing oh no wrong tab there we go I closed the other one here we go we're in a game I press edit button and there we are so you're going to see a couple things on the screen I'm going to just start with one part at a time at the bottom of the screen um you'll see resources that you can drag into your game so at first we have all the resources the voxal objects that are being used in this game so we have all these arms and butterflies and stuff so if I wanted to add something else I can just drag it in from the bottom um you can also look at all voxal objects that have been made by other creators that have been made public so I can look through these are kind of like some of our featured objects can look through these and drag them in this is like a crazy dragon that someone that Veria made um which is a really cool detailed voxal object um so you can look through ones that other people have made you can filter by your own objects here's a cat on a pogo stick that I made about a week ago um so that's pretty pretty cool and um and then you can search by term so Chris what was your coin called that you just made it it's called Uh oh it's currently saving oh it's called in fact just type in code academy it's code academy coin Cod Academy coin there we go so I actually can just uh drag in this coin that Chris made like moments ago and now it's in my game so it's really great for like work when you're working with an artist on a game as they're making art you'll have it available um immediately as soon as they save it um and then in terms of extensive knowledge of typescript um I mean I had never used typescript when I first started using doig bang I kind of learned as I went so definitely wouldn't say you need extensive knowledge of typescript there's so much example code which you'll see in a bit um and so much to look at and learn from um that I think you can definitely start with not very much knowledge of typescript and still be able to get the hang of it um it's more about like game development principles than language specific typescript stuff um yeah so that's dragging in voxal objects um which you can do from this panel but there's other tabs you can also drag in scripts from the bottom so we have some featured scripts um that you can just drag on to your object so I'm going to drag this scale script and now my cat is scaling um we've got which one do I like I'll do uh actually I'm going to take the scale script off of this scale this down oh I didn't even show off the transform tool so once you put an object into your game um we've got just some transform gizmos you can move it around in space scale it have it stick to a surface of something um there's also just a move tool rotate tool a scale tool things that you wouldd expect from a game engine um and I can add like this p script to this cat and now this cat is going to follow around the player um you can also search these are just the the featured scripts we have ones that we think people will want to use a lot in their game but you can search any scripts I can filter by my own scripts none of these are going to be very helpful they're all pretty specific but I can filter by the scripts that I've written um and then just every script that anyone's written um kind of search by a keyword and find something and so that's what you can do in the scripts panel and then there's also one more panel which is templates um templates are my favorite sorry my favorite one out of all tabs yeah so this one is really exciting it's just um entities which is what we call like the objects in the game are called entities in Big Bang um and these are just entities that already have different components attached to them and different behaviors attached to them so I can drag in this toxic Barrel template and now if I go near the barrel it's going to do damage to me within its radius you can see the collider on the barrel when you click on it it's a big radius where it can do damage there's all sorts of stuff in here there's so many fun templates there's a boom box there's a swimming pool which I think actually just got added um does this work I didn't even know we had this let's find out guess it's a swimming pool I only have one heart of Health oh okay there we go and now I'm swimming in a pool so you can just drag this into your game like I haven't even opened the code I haven't even like looked at the entity panel and I've already got a swimming pool with a bouncy diving board so that's pretty cool if I die while editing it um there we go I blew up and I respawned in the pool it's not a bad place to respawn if I died I would not mind respawning in a pool um so there's all sorts of stuff in here Launchpad there's a lot of stuff that's like great for making an obstacle course this Launchpad is a classic um trampoline another classic where am I oh my spawn point is inside of the Dragon I believe and the pool let's move these and so so you can see how some of these templates work um and yeah that was just it just drag dropped them in you can also make your own templates um and save them and then you have access to them so so let's say I we'll get into that as I show the next segment which is the entity panel so I've only just been dragging these entities and voxal objects into the game but if you want to edit them and change their behavior and change in detail how they work you're going to want to look over at this panel on the left side of the screen which we call the entity panel and this will have your object your entity and all of the different components that make it what it is so we'll take a look at this trampoline uh so the entity is trampoline this first component will just tell you what its name is if it has any tags on it which tags could be used for sending events and communicating or just organizing your scene um and if it is a template um you'll have some information about that template um and then the transform will show you its position it scale can see this changing as I move the trampoline around it's rotation um and you can also parent it to another entity so let's say I parented the trampoline to the player which would be really strange thing to do if I did that now the trampoline is uh attached to the player and we'll move around with the player um going to click that out though cuz I don't I don't think I want that in my game um you've also got the Collision component um so there's number of different shapes of colliders right now it's using the voxal object itself as the shape of the collider so when you collide with what you see on the voxal object um that's that's where the Collision is going to exist but you can also make a box a capsule sphere Etc um like you saw with this um toxic Barrel this has a sphere collider a big trigger on it so when you enter that sphere then you take damage um and you can also set it to none but I'm going to keep it at the voxal object Collision um you have your voxal object component so let's say I like this trampoline that I dragged in um but I don't like this foxal object you can change it on the component I can look up other trampolines and oh there's a green one so now I have a different voxal object on my trampoline but everything else stayed the same on the entity so it's still going to behave just the same and then you have the script the trampoline script it's got a description on it so some of our like Dev D Big Bang Dev sanction scripts will have descriptions or ones that other people make so you can read about it um which will help for usability of other people and then I've got all of these exposed properties on the script that I can change so still without having jumped into the code yet there's still a lot I can do to customize my the behavior on this object so I could make the impulse like 1,200 and not require jump and uh I'll just change those and now right when I collide with it I get shot super high to the Skye um so there's also a number of other components that you can add these were just the ones that happen to already be on the trampoline but you can add a text component and change the color of the text change what it says um font anything you would expect from text component I don't even know if that's yeah that's how you spell trampoline right I think so um and what if you lost one of your entities while you're making I don't know what you mean by lost like deleted it on it's gone somewhere oh I can't find it okay so I look it over here and I don't know where my entity went so um you can just search up the entity in the upper right hand panel there's an entity search um search bar so I can search I found my trampoline and then if I press the F hot key it'll focus on it and now I'm looking back at it um so you don't have to you can navigate everything that's in your scene um and on the entity there's also we have particles sounds cameras so there's all sorts of different types of uh components you can add a particle effect now there's like particles coming out of the trampoline and you can edit all of this um with code and so if I wanted to make this an invisible object what I would do I'm going to take off the text and the particle component I would go to the Vox object component and I can actually um edit the opacity if I wanted to make it kind of see through or I could just go to the visible property on the Vox object component turn it off and now it's invisible um and if I wanted like right now I can still collide with it but if I wanted it to have I could even just delete the voxal object component in its entirety and not have an voxal object component um to search up other people's create uh created entities so I did that at the bottom if you go to foxal objects on the bottom panel uh make sure you're looking at all instead of this game in that drop down on the right um and then you can search up if you're only looking at this game or mine then um You probably won't be able to find anything but if you make sure you're in the all dropdown you can search anything anyone's made make another that's a cool dragon I actually haven't seen that one before um so other things let's see just making sure I get everything out a little list yes so that was the entity comp panel that the entity panel that's how you um edit your entity and then um up in the upper right corner we've got some other properties that's where you found the search in your game um you can search by all sorts of different things so you don't just have to know the name like I know that these birds have the script called flocking on them so if I want everything that has the flocking script I can search by that script name and it's going to show me the birds and the butterflies and everything with that script on it um you can search by tag there's a bunch of things tag no Ray cast which just means that the ray casts are um ignored by it you can search by anything um you need to and you search by things that have a voxal object component I don't know if you can do that click on the advanced tab I've never done that oh my goodness okay so if I want to look for particle effects I can search by particle effects I can search by text components I guess if only the player has a text component scripts all sorts of things wow I can't believe I didn't know that um that's cool um and then we've also got render settings as well so right now we've got this nice mood going on um and um actually before I get into that I haven't even explained what I'm doing with the camera when you start a game the camera is going to be following the player or whatever custom camera you have set up but you have different camera settings in here so you can while you're editing the game look through the game camera um to see what the game will be rendering there's also a fly camera that you can control with WD you can hold down shift to make it go faster so that's letting me kind of zip around this level really fast um and then there's an orbit camera where you can um click with the r right Mouse button and then orbit with the middle Mouse button um um I like the fly camera and yeah you can change the render settings so I'm going to actually press G to enter the game camera so I can see the fog and everything that's being rendered and then I can kind of just click on these different presets there's a couple different presets in here I think I want oh that one's pretty moody I liked the original one so I'm going to go back until I get the original one back but there's all sorts of different um settings you can change fog Bloom um vignette all sorts so much stuff to explore there's advanced settings with shadows and lights and things that I have an artist typically do cuz it's not really my wheelhouse um and then besides that um oh you can also there's some transform settings too so if you were making a grid or like a tile based game and you don't want to be able to freely move things around um you can hold down shift and it'll move by a set transform amount and you can change that step um to whatever the size so if you made a voxal object that was like 50 by 50 Vox holes and you want to make sure that you make your grid based game um all fit into that without any like free motion you could set your translation step to 50 boxal and then place your grid objects um along that grid and besides that there's just save you save your game up at the top um you can change out your player template here so if you made a custom player with custom scripts you can set your player template here so you can make a 2d game with a custom 2D camera and a custom 2D player so this is what the default player looks like and the default camera looks like but you're not stuck with that you can make a game in first person you can make a top down game um all of that can be customized we just have a default default settings that are easy to work with so people can jump in and not have to worry about getting their movement set up getting their camera Road patient setup and all of that kind of stuff um and then you can also set um oh additional game options yeah so you can set whether the player uses the Avatar or if it uses like a voxal object um and we do have an FPS game um that people can play and remix we have a really good starter kit so if you wanted to make an FPS we have a really good kit for that um yeah this is the the kind of basics of what how to navigate the editor and then for script let me just make something I'm going to make a script that does something just so we can all see it's going to involve this dragon and this thing um so we can see how that scripting looks so I'm just going to make a new script here really quick um see we got 20 minutes left do I have enough time to do this go really fast like speed round of scripting um so I'm going to make a new script up here press new um I'm going to zoom in a bunch of times CU I always forget to do that uh zoom zoom and then now you can see here we are we have our class um so there's a start function that's called um whenever this object starts to exist um so either at the beginning of the game or when it spawned in and then a tick which happens every frame um there's a bunch of builtin functions into our API um and I'm going to use on trigger enter you'll see it's starting to autofill that for me this one takes an entity which is the other entity that collided that triggered with this object um and just going to say if the other entity or if other has the tag player on it um other do send event um I'm going to send an event called enable so I'm also going to uh console.log hit so if we open the console since this is in the web this is in your browser you can just open the like developer tools the chro like I opened the Chrome developer tools and now we have a console that will actually work for debugging our game so what I'm going to do is walk over to my hey Ashley we can't see that currently oh that's um I don't know how to make that work um I guess it's just not part of the screen share but you can use Chrome developer tools um I don't know how to get it to like show up as part of the window in the screen share thing um but I promise I just saw the message in my console um but just to show so we can see something visually um sample trigger script I didn't name the script so I'm I sent that event enable um oh wait I don't want to send it to other I'm going to send it to I'm going to do this. entity do get component by type component type so I'm going to grab a component off of this entity um and I'm going to set it to Invisible when I collide with this um thing so I'm going to collide with this and then I'm going to turn invisible there we go we made something happen not very exciting but um we were able to make something happen very quickly um and so what we wanted to do I would love to spend more time coding um but what we're going to do is show off the multiplayer editing which is one of the most powerful parts of Doc big bang and we haven't even shown you yet um is that we can all edit this game together in real time um I have all this random stuff in here and there's going to be a lot more random stuff added but I'm going to share this link and anyone can jump in here and we can all edit this game together um you can drag objects in you can drag scripts on to objects um and drag in templates we can do all sorts of stuff so got that link shared don't want to get in let me in and uh yes the editor yeah the script editor is super similar to VSS code if you're familiar with that um you can use the console for debugging and um it all runs in typescript it's got really good autofill um and I'm not sure if yeah Chris shared our API documentation so there's tons of example games that'll show you um more more about scripting and do big bang and also you can access scripts that other people have made um at any point in time so if I wanted to to drag in a door here is that's a nice door um they didn't think so though um and if I add if I just open I clicked on the script component and press open and I can search door and let's see dbb door that sounds like a good script and now if I walk over we'll see how it works you can look at the properties but I've got this door that turns to open and you can take a look at the script um I can't edit this cuz it was made by someone else but I can look through and read their code and try to piece together what was going wrong or what was going on I can also remix their script um so you can remix scripts that were made by other people so I can say I really liked this door script that someone made but I wish that it behaved a little bit differently I'm going to go ahead and remix it add my edits to the code and then I'll have my own version of it but I already had a base to start off of um so as long as someone had their script public and they've marked it as remixable then you can remix it um in your game and then it will um and you can make whatever edits you want to it see we've got some coins floating about what do I want to add oh I know what I'm going to add um I'm going to add a really fun template we have where is it uh we have a Jeep template so the console is there I promise oh you press F12 in Chrome oh someone can jump on the back of this Jeep too and again like this Jeep is we have a video oh I wish I had the link on him it would take a second to find it but this Jeep is totally remixable and we even have like detailed documentation and videos of how to reskin the Jeep and add your own art onto it and change the speed and the settings and all sorts of things so lot of uh sharing of knowledge um and it's really easy to to learn things when you have so many resources available to you all the time yeah let us know if anyone has any questions about making games in do bang about how our types scripts and scripting works or anything else you might have I have a question uh Ashley when do you feel what would be your advice for somebody learning to code or learning types script right now in terms of coming here and trying things out do you think that is should be hand in hand like the moment you start learning you should start trying things out or do you think that there's like a natural progression point where people become more uh I guess comfortable using what they know to start building things I think that the best thing you can do is just to like get your hand dirdy and just like jump in I think not being scared to write Cod not like I think it's great to have all of these like resources that you can use but I also think that like just like saying I'm just going to write something and see what happens and just if it doesn't work it doesn't work just like trial and error and just jumping in head first is the best thing that you can do especially think on our platform there's so many so much you can look at so much you can read and like so many things you can see working that there's no harm and just trying to like do it yourself like seeing okay I see this Launchpad I'm going to read through this and then I'm just going to try to write something from scratch like and just see what happens I think that's the best way to start is just not be scared of trying anything and not being scared of breaking things also um at Co Academy we teach typescript more in the context of web development which is a little different than gave Dem mop um do you have you seen in the past some sort of shortfalls or differences where somebody might be used to writing typescript one way coming into something like do big band say oh wow I'm I'm super lost I really don't know because they're just kind of train to expect to use types script in a specific way um yeah I actually haven't talk to a lot of typescript like web developers who've moved to dot Big Bang I think it is very different and it kind of feels different the whole time um that um I haven't seen people really get like tripped up over over like trying to do things one way for web I think that there's kind of a general like a big difference in game development and web development that becomes really obvious like as you're using it um and I think that using typescript for Big Bang will not only make you better at typescript but also will just make you a better game developer in general and then you'll have less trouble next time you try if you ever try a different game engine um you'll learn kind of to move away from like the web development thinking into a game development thinking which I think is just very different and very distinct um so it feels different when you're even if you're using the same language it feels like a very different interface um the um also see the question from Maria what is the most intimidating experience you had coding I think something that intimidates me the most is uh coding 3D physics is um I like using quaternion is how rotation is handled in in 3D space in games and I often that was one of the things that I was always like I'm not going to touch that I'm just going to let it I'll take my time figuring out how that works um and having to just dive in I ended up working on a project that was really physics based and I just dove in and um messed up a bunch and things were rotating all ways that I didn't even know they could rotate and jumping around the screen and eventually after like just struggling and seeing things blow up over and over um I was able to start figuring out how to get it work but um yeah it was definitely really intimidating but I'm glad that I tackled that cuz now I'm not as scared of physics anymore but I will say that one of my favorite things about coding and Dot Big Bang is just having um so many references and like so much material to look at and such a big community of people um we have a big community in Discord where we um the devs are helping out with um people who are making games adop big bang and we help troubleshoot their problems and um since the start I've had my coworkers helping me learn the engine and we're all just working together and remixing each other's code and like learning from each other so it's been uh really nice to get to know the engine and typescript with the help of so many people I'm I'm inclined to agree as well I'm I've done software engineering in the past but not like on a serious level and I found it really straightforward coming to do big bang and learning typescript uh I wouldn't say that I make triaa quality games but I definitely have a a fundamental grasp on um on typescript and how the engine works and I think anybody coming into do big bang with a little experience is just gonna have such an easy time saying right here's a game idea I've had give me 10 minutes and just coming up with something that's really good and really fun and it like said like there's a ton of support um we have people at ashy in the Discord all the time just ready to to help out if you have any questions or anything and we also have a lot of experienced community members as well who who are there for you so it's it's dead easy to get started yeah I also think that like since typescript and JavaScript are widely used languages um and they are less complic ated than some of the other languages that are used in game development like C++ for example um it's uh do gang is a really good place to start your game development Journey just because you're more likely to be familiar with these languages and even if you aren't I think they're a little easier to pick up than some of the other common game engine languages and also if you're making games uh in typescript and big bang you're also learning a coding language that is widely used for we development and all sorts of other applications so it has some nice crossover um which I think is really cool and it's also a nice place to get started in game development if you're coming from web development cuz you kind of already have a lot of that work already done um I have a question in terms of the crossover that you were talking about and learning other languages uh how that helps uh there's always people that come to Cod Academy because they're looking at uh getting a career in Tech or switching careers into Tech so how do you in terms of like writing code adop ban and sharing it outside this is like an easy way to Showcase this in portfolios let's say on your GitHub or things like that is there like a way that you can export this code you just have to copy and paste it is there an easy way for somebody that never useb ban to come in into someone's profile and see what they've build codewise yeah so it isn't it is just kept within the platform the code so you could copy and paste it but also because um everything is public and immediate like you can send a link and someone can play it immediately so if you're trying to build up something for your portfolio you could show off your game that you made instantly without having to take videos it or have like a download link on itch or something like that you could just say like hey here's a link to what I made if they wanted to look at the code you could copy and paste it and put it into GitHub or you could um if they had an account they could look through your game and see the code that you've that you made um but right right now there isn't like a site where you can go like externally look at just the code part like how you would use GitHub but I do think at least sending a link to your game and being able to immediately show someone what you made um can be really helpful to show what you've been able to create
