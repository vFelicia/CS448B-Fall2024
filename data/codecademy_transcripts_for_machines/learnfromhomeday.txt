right after the keynote with Zack I'm sorry you guys all your hellos this is just so wonderful good morning good morning the you you will know that the world's been turned upside down and I think it's fantastic that despite it you all being here together with us is a fantastic show of what we can still do together online from our homes it's excellent when you learn a new skill with click Adam II you're taking courses that are written by real educators and practitioners today's sessions that you'll have access to after our keynote are hosted by those very same people to same people who are the courses there the code Academy curriculum team the team is thrilled to have a chance to connect with you in this way it's like the ultimate lemonade in that sense so I'm going to plonk something in the chat right now and if you can see it I'm going to put it in a few times because it's going to disappear that is a link to a blog post and that blog post that's where you'll see all the sessions that we have for you today in order to attend a session you'll need to register for each one if you're missing the link to the blog post no problem follow us on Twitter we'll send out updates

is excellent okay you know it is time to get started thank you so much for joining I am so excited to introduce you to Zach Sims Kevin Catanese cofounder and CEO Zach are you with us on the line I am yeah awesome all right Thank You Alisa I am going to get started right now so super excited to have all of you here today I think this is in the first time we're doing a conference like this entirely over zoom so we're with us as things go hopefully as well as they can and maybe we have a glitch or two along the way I think you know we know that during this time as Alisa said everyone's world has been totally torn upside down I think you know we're all working from home in many cases you know we might have family or friends that are sick and it's just a lot to manage and I think one of the things that's kind of helps all of us at code Academy make it through this period is knowing that there are lots of people out there that are using this time to learn to build something new to help with the situation and that may be a little bit of what we're doing is hopefully helpful to all of you and so we hope that learning can kind of be a bit of an escape for everyone during this time when you know walking outside might be hard or reading the news might be hard and so we're really excited about today I think we have some really great programming together for everyone ironically help you learn programming so to talk a little bit more about today I think our hope today is that you can use this day to explore coding and realize the amazing things that you can start learning from home during this time I think we see lots of people use code Academy for a lot of different reasons I think one of them is to just learn a new skill maybe something that's interesting that you can help build that you can start a business around and another one of those key reasons is for people to upgrade their career opportunities and so obviously now I think that's more important than ever you know with so many people at home with so many jobs at risk learning skills like programming and data science is more important than ever and it's a really easy way for you to make sure that hopefully in the future your job prospects are really strong so I think I'm gonna talk a little bit about how we started code Academy a little bit more about kind of what we're gonna do here today and then I'll pass it back off to Lisa so I think you know the first thing for everyone is that today is just the beginning I know that many of you are starting out on your programming journey and some of you have a little bit of experience so kind of all over the place and we've tried to put together a great set of programming no matter where you're coming from but our hope is that today is just the beginning you'll start to learn with us on zoom' or YouTube then you can pick up you're learning on code Academy and we're going to try as hard as possible to make as much great content for you as we can so you can start learning now and keep learning over the next couple of months so with that I wanted to talk a little bit more about you know you're on a call with code Academy today who are we what do we do I think you know I first started co economy almost nine years ago at this point in my dorm room in college and you know when we first started the company the focus was on allowing anyone anywhere in the world to kind of feel empowered by being able to create something and she connected millions of people around the world to economic opportunity so I think when we first started the business you know I didn't know how to program and one of the reasons we started working on code Academy was to teach me and so I know exactly what it's like to feel like many of you feel right now we're in programming seems cool that might seem a little bit challenging and our goal is to try as hard as possible to make sure that it seems as easy as it as it can be for you and you can get started and really kind of upgrade your career and everything so I never would have imagined when we started the business nine years ago again that you know we would have millions of people around the world that if you spoke at me so at this point we have reached more than 48 50 million people around the world that have signed up and registered with code Academy and even just on this zoom called there are a couple of thousand of you that are getting started with us so I think you know we're honored to be with all of you and hopefully to help you a little bit today so I think you first I just wanted to share some stories about you know what we've been able to do during this time I think one of the things that we've been working really hard on over the past couple of months or weeks is helping people that have been affected by coab in nineteen and so coke Adam II gave a way to start ten thousand three scholarships to code Kaname proto to people that are in high school in college and unfortunately are no longer able to go to high school or college because those schools have been closed we've also started giving away some code Academy Pro scholarships to people that are affected by unemployment whether it's or Lowe's or they're being laid off as a result of this crisis so we're trying to do everything we can and I just wanted to read one user story that we've gotten from someone just to kind of make it real and hopefully help inspire all of you to make a change in your lives as well so here's our story I'm quote I have been working at a nearby nearby Toyota auto factory about three weeks into March the factory ceased production for several reasons due to the code in nineteen pandemic the demand for cars has fallen significantly a few supply chains regarding specific parts were nearly interrupted and there was an increasing concern emotionally is a challenging time with the future of the factory uncertain at this time and the full economic implications of kovin 19 still unknown having access to code Academy Pro is helping it is helping to give purpose to my days during this time of uncertainty I try to make a little progress every day working through a module or two I have always had a desire to learn more about coding and expand my skills having the time and access to code Academy is giving me hope that I can strengthen my coding skills so this is just one of the thousands of stories that we've gotten over the past couple of weeks from people like you came to code Academy to improve themselves and found deeper meaning and are much greater outcome so before we get started I just want to talk a little bit about kind of what code Academy has done to help I think first you know our headquarters are in the heart of New York City so the effects of kovat are really apparent to us I think the city that most of us call home is a shadow of its former self and you know we want to make sure to help as many people as we can so that things get back to normal and everyone's lives you know get back on an upswing so as I meant to mentioned we've granted many tens of thousands of scholarships at this point code Academy pro to students and teachers we're also starting to look into how we can work with employees that have been laid off or furloughed during this time to help them as well and lastly we have been working with people like Karlie Kloss to provide more access to our paid offerings and help reach people like young women they need to learn programming more than ever and may be overlooked by traditional opportunities so we're going to continue to do what we can to help people through this difficult time and hopefully today will be a lot of help to you so our community manager ELISA will walk you all through the logistics of the day I wanted to just open things as a small appetizer of what you can expect the main course that we'll all be working on today are tracks that our curriculum team has constructed just for today so you know it's a chooseyourownadventure game if you will throughout the day so you can build websites you can learn languages and you can start analyzing data with our own experts everyone will be on hand to answer questions and help you learn skills we've tried to make today a little bit of this I'm talking at you or resume but a lot more working together or getting your questions answered and really speaking to the people behind code Academy so that we can spark you to learn a little bit more today hopefully you will take what you've learned today and put it into some learning going forward I'm use this time productively and hopefully in a way that kind of distracts you from a lot of what's going on in the world right now so I'm super thankful to all of you for tuning in it's really great to be here and I'm looking forward to spending the rest of the day with you and with that I want to hand it back over to ELISA and you know tell you all to stay home stay safe and hopefully enjoy being a part of the code Academy community thanks abrin Thank You Zac hope you're staying safe and healthy all right it's back to us thank you all for sticking with us thank you to everybody who's asking questions we are going to go through 54 of them and answer all of them as quickly as we can for the rest of our time here today as Zac mentioned it's about figuring out how today works okay so as you mentioned there are two tracks one of them building websites HTML CSS JavaScript is that everything you need to know about building websites no is it gonna get you absolutely started yes Trek to learning languages there's a whole world outside of building websites and our curriculum team is on deck to help help you dive into a little bit of that world today so I'm very excited about that in case you haven't the URL to visit to register for sessions in the tracks is news code Khadem EECOM slash learn from home day that's news code Academy comm slash learn from home day when you get there it'll be a blog post and you'll scroll down to register we've plugged it in in some of the questions so visit the Q&A panel and some of your fellow attendees have also put that URL and so you'll be able to see it there what's really cool about registering like what why would why would you register people who register are able to do three things and you're able to chat with other learners as you're doing right now here which is so cool thank you you're able to ask our curriculum developers questions via Q&A so while our curriculum developers are taking you through maybe a project maybe a discussion maybe an overview of a new language you'll be able to interact with them with this Q&A panel so I see that since mentioning it we've just gotten like 20 more questions you're practicing the QA yes that's excellent this is the modal that you'll use to interact with your curriculum developers throughout the day and finally once you register you'll have a record or you'll have access to a recording of your session so register visit news code Academy dotcom slash learn from home day and that's where you'll find all the links that you need okay for more if you missed it follow us on
