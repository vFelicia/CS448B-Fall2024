go live cool so now we are definitely live hello everybody for those watching live and for those that will watch in the future uh we are in another episode of tips and tricks and recruiting and today we have the one and only giovanni you want to introduce yourself uh tell me a little bit about your background maybe sure uh my name is joveney carter um i'm an associate recruiter with ko academy and i've been with kocademy since uh september oh my anniversary just passed so september 7th last year so about a year now thank you and um i'm i recruit mostly for the curriculum roles right now which include um like a a a decent level of technical um abilities uh but i've also done some recruiting for uh people team like hr roles uh talent roles some a couple of other like product manager roles things like that um but right now i'm mostly in curriculum did you always knew that you wanted to be a recruiter was it like you know you were eight and you said you know mom i want to be a recruiter no no that's not how it works i didn't even really know that it was a career stage but um coming out of uh college i knew that i didn't want to get into consulting but i wanted to do something that had like stability and i had a friend that said oh you're you know a people person you'd be really good at this and i went into executive search um which is sort of like consulting but it's more uh people oriented and so i was like okay i like this um and then as i was in the executive search role i really enjoyed uh just like power structures and you know being able to be able to influence the people who are making decisions um and how it really can change the whole scope of a company so that's why i'm a career now okay yeah i mean i didn't know what community was either until somebody told me so it's one of those roles i think that it's not very clearly defined but then once you discover it's like oh this is actually really cool awesome great yeah i can do this yeah so now that you're focusing here on code academy you've been focusing you said mostly on hiring for curriculum team uh i would imagine that you come across a large spectrum of people from all kinds of backgrounds all kinds of expertise right like because being a curriculum developer is not very straightforward either i guess like um it's not like saying well i'm a mechanical engineer and i build engines like like that's a very kind of like stray arrow sort of knowledge i would imagine that for curriculum developers depending on the field what they do comes from all kinds of places so do you you know um one thing i wanted to ask you was how you see because a lot of learners in code academy also have this kind of diversity in background how do you see these kind of backgrounds playing in stem or like pros and cons when you are trying to apply for you know tech companies like getting to the technical field is that like is that something that you need to worry about is that pretty common spread you know that's a really good question i do see that all the time where learners or just people from various backgrounds are applying to roles and i think people from a lot of backgrounds will apply to curriculum roles especially because it is a it is a interdisciplinary role where you have to have the technical abilities and some technical experience to say well i've i've coded before i know what four stack is like i i could teach these things but then secondly you have to have some sort of teaching education experience um to be able to really demonstrate like strong pedagogy um and so because of those two fields sometimes i'll get people to always left left field all the way right field uh but uh there are very few times where there are people that are like straight up and down the middle um but we're not necessarily looking for someone that's up and down like has has somehow been a coding teacher all their life um we're really looking for people who just have been able to demonstrate experience in both fields so let's say that let's say that you were previously i actually had this this this um candidate once who was a pilot in their previous career uh yeah and um we ended up moving forward i think he was a parttime hire for a while but uh he was interviewing for a parttime role a parttime curriculum uh like frontend you know content creation role something like that and um he uh had actually he didn't do a boot camp or anything he had done like he had fully learned on co academy for like the past year and he had several projects to prove his expertise and so he had the projects to prove his expertise and um he had written blogs or something like that about his learning experience as he was going through that and so he sort of fulfilled the two main parts that we needed which was like his writing experience being able to teach other people but also his technical experience um so it's not that you have to have five year career in this it just has you you just really need to demonstrate um both now that was a parttime role and you know different roles at different levels like if you're going for a uh like a midlevel role you're gonna have have to have of course like three to five years of experience something more but that's just an example of like it doesn't need to be one solid background i feel like there's a lot to impact there um you mentioned you know having projects to demonstrate your knowledge uh blogging where you're trying to kind of like be out there and be proactive with showcasing your work uh you mentioned that he was selftaught showing that drive on like you know i'm gonna go through walls and and learn what i need to learn to land a job also knowing the platform that he was applying for like i want to get a job at code academy and i'm like very familiar with how good academy works the learning environment the course work everything so like there's a lot of them back i think there's there was a lot of things going for him and i know that uh my conversations with other recruiters they've touched on those things too where they will say well you need to research where you're going to apply for you know know where why you are applying for that company in particular so when you are in that phone interview and that's screening it's like you know what to say uh you know demonstrate that you know what you say you know on paper and the work on projects portfolios connect with people right so i feel like they take away basically is don't worry too much about what you perceive as being your background or like where you think that you stand and just worry more about what they're looking for right because i mean i think all the recruiters have mentioned this in the past that's like companies when they're recruiting they basically have like an idea of the candidate they're looking for so the company is going out there looking for that person which means that you basically has the applicant need to make sure that you fit into that mold basically is that is that right uh more or less yeah i i think i think you you just have to convince the recruiter or the hiring team that either you fit into that mode or that they can extend their mode to fit you um and and that doesn't have to be uh i think there are some extremes of that where people who may have like no experience in the specific field that they're interested are applying to like let's say they're uh they have a full stack experience but they don't have a lot of experience with mobile development um then and they haven't really developed ios apps it's gonna be much harder to convince the hiring team that you're going to be able to you know contribute early and often for a mobile development role if you actually haven't developed at all in ios and so the best thing you could do is put together a couple of projects and then go apply for that role if that's something that you really want um i think i think you're absolutely right like being prepared for the roles that you're applying to and being um intentional about the roles that you're applying to and not just being like i could fit this i can do this because uh if you if you like don't really have that that's a real thing right technical feel yeah i mean well people do that all the time but i feel like i feel like i've heard it before like they're saying well this person is kind of like a tr a jack of all trades but that's not what we're looking for like yeah good for you that you know a lot of things but we are only looking for this role to fail with this particular skill set and i've heard before that the the idea that some candidates it's not there's nothing really wrong with with well how they approach what they know it's just that you you don't really you don't necessarily care about the things that don't apply for the role in particular right so so sometimes there's that kind of like um it's almost country intuitive which is like you know too much or like you don't seem to be focused enough like we are hiring somebody to be a curriculum developer it seems that you could be also an engineer how do we know that you want to be a curriculum developer right you don't want to be an engineer right right you have to somehow demonstrate in your experiences or in your cover letter or something that this is actually what you want and not just you're just throwing your resume out there to anything because a lot of people do that too okay yeah yeah i think uh i mean there's always a worry about overfitting like oh you're too perfect molded into this but then i'm assuming that there's also a part where it's like this candidate is not focused enough it's like not not like concentrated enough so we i can't make a call if this person is going to be with us in six months because maybe for them this is just kind of like a stepping stone to some some other place right um and obviously for a company you want to hire somebody who's going to help the team which means that you know you can't just like keep a revolving door sort of so to speak i guess so speaking of concentrating and speaking of showcasing that work i'm assuming that you go through a lot of resonance like your fair bit of reading through resumes yeah i have a few questions about restaurants and i think the learners that are going to be watching this video live or later are probably having the same questions one of my questions is when you write a resume does it always have to be one page you'd be surprised how many people submit several page resumes okay um uh at co academy we don't automatically reject someone because of something what we being trivial to be like the length of their resume or the layout of their resume things like that um so we are try we try to be as um compassionate about that as possible at other camp companies i don't know what they do they probably if you have a multiple page resume they may not look at it it's not necessarily that it's not it's not um it's a volume thing right it's like you got 10 cents yeah it's like are they gonna get you up about seven seconds do you think they're gonna read that second page do you think they're gonna read the third page no um i know i know people also say that you know it depends on the years of experience like i get a lot of phd candidates and they submit their cvs that's a very different style of uh background um and i recognize that when i see their can their resume and i'm like okay well this is fcv this is all their articles published and it's actually relevant but if you've like been a software engineer at the same company for the past seven years you don't necessarily need three pages to demonstrate your work i know that i think it was harlan that mentions like look i'm looking up to them right that's how we read if i don't see anything that interests me that sparks my curious like oh this could be a good candidate that's it that's the end of the line like you just need to make sure that there's something and he said you know i don't mind spending some extra time and i can't that i'm pulling up the linkedin or something but but something has to spark the first interest yeah right yeah so i know that uh some learners especially now in 2021 with you know after the pandemic last year there was so much emphasis on being online and your wrestlemans traditionally are a very like paper so like even now right we write it as a document um platforms like linkedin have tried to virtualize or digitize a resume where it's a bit more like a website um how do you see the role of like resumes traditional resumes versus putting your content out there in places like linkedin is that is do they complement each other can they replace each other like is is the resume still like a very strong part of applying for any tech role that you've seen i think they complement each other but they serve different purposes uh like if you're applying to a job you may submit your linkedin profile but what i'm gonna see first is your resume uh versus if i'm sourcing people so if i'm looking on linkedin for people to fill a certain role the first thing i'm gonna see is your linkedin and then later i might ask you for your resume so i think that they support one another but they don't necessarily replace each other i think they do different things one is digital one is very like pointed um well they're both sort of digital one is like a website and one is very pointed to what you what your interests are or it should be uh like a lot of people in their current jobs won't display on their linkedin exactly what they're looking for because their employers see their linkedin um but on their resume they might say i'm actually looking for pivot careers i'm looking into this and so that that piece of the puzzle is is important oh that's interesting so there's a part um i'm thinking about resumes and the structure of it um you're saying that in some resumes people write like a bit of uh objective or gold or like a section like so so you think that that's helpful like people that are thinking of applying for jobs having like uh maybe what like two lines like how how does this actually structure i think it's super helpful to have like an intro like some sort of because what you really have to do right in the resume you have to guide the readers attention to where you want it to be and almost guide their perspective to what you want them to see and so if you write an objective and it says hi i am a full stack engineer looking for roles in this team like that automatically puts me in the space of okay so this experience should be like this or if their experience isn't this then i know from their objective that they're interested in this versus if they submit their resume and it doesn't match the experience that we're looking for and they don't have any sort of cover letter or objective census that says i'm looking for this sort of role then i'm just like well this person isn't a fit because they don't have the experience and they haven't communicated that they're looking for that you don't have a conversation with every applicant we only see their resume or their linkedin so you have to somehow communicate um what you want especially if your background isn't 100 a fit because i know that uh curriculum i mean not the curriculum sorry uh the cb or the resume uh i was thinking cv um i know that the real state is limited like you're trying to fit it in one page i've seen people you know really small font not enough spacing they're just trying to cram it all in that one pager so to tell somebody hey by the way besides your relevant experience and your education section and your skill section and maybe your hobbies section throw in there like a couple lines for an objective or a goal like passion or like while you're applying for this and some people might be like really do i really need to like i can't so if but it sounds to me like it's actually important like it can actually make a difference it can't make a difference it's but and i say especially for those who don't have the 100 experience or their experience is hard to navigate uh like you they know their experience and they know their journey but you can't necessarily understand how they went from being a pilot to being a a software developer um and you need you need a sentence to say hey i transition careers and this is what i'm passionate about um uh but i will say most people add too much information on their resume anyway and so probably people who are trying to squeeze the senses in and can't find space they can probably cut out several things that aren't necessary or that we won't look at like sometimes people will have seven bullets under one job and it's like no one's gonna read all that you have seven seconds to communicate your value and we're not gonna be reading all seven bullets under five jobs wait i'm curious now okay okay so let's let's just from jump right into that start telling me about all the horror stories of resumes because i'm sure that there's some lessons learned here i'm sure that this people watching this video now or in the future i'm sure that they can save themselves some pain uh with whatever you know what you've seen what are some of the common mistakes that people make like you just mentioned bullet points okay so if i'm writing my experience and i say you know 2016 to 2019 this job and i write seven eight lines explaining everything i was managing a team of seven or eight reporting to whatever i did this we achieved this goal and we did this one project sounds like that's too much how and what is that i think it falls back does it does it go back to the idea of like what you're trying to communicate what is it that you're trying to tell the recruiter what's the story i guess like is that so is that one of the typical things that you see maybe too much information you said yeah i see i see it all the time too much information i think people confuse uh the section of details on their resume with job description and it's actually not your job description it is your results your accomplishments your achievements um what you're actually like proud of um it's as if you're in you know you are having an elevator pitch and you have two sentences to communicate what you did and how it was great at that job like i think people should phrase it in their heads in that way as opposed to let me write every possible thing just in case this one thing or this one thing catches their eye another thing another way that people go wrong is that um people don't realize how um how complicated they sound on their resume when it's actually it shouldn't be that complicated uh for instance you know uh if i wrote you know well let me not give a specific outfit but sometimes people give too much detail about what they're actually doing when the reader doesn't know their company or doesn't know their actual uh business set up so if if you know if i talk about the specific uh curriculum people that i'm hiring that might be important but if i talk about um you know this person and that part like it's just somehow somewhere you have to find a line between uh the overview and the weeds of your description and you really only need to give an overview you don't need to go into deep description because if the overview doesn't catch their attention then the description won't either and it'll just be a waste of space i feel like um so is it fair to say um i feel like resumes is sort of like the first thing that you're gonna see but like i said before if that interests you as a recruiter then you might set up a phone interview right to learn more about them so like i feel like some people so am i correct in inter in understanding that your resume should showcase some of that work enough that it makes the other person interested the person reading it and then they can always call you they can always hang by your phone and then you can explain at length like what you did hey i saw that you have this relevant experience can you talk you know can you tell me more about this role or how you did this right like you're trying i feel like some people write their resumes as they are trying to answer questions in a phone screen interview is that is that what's happening yeah well not necessarily they just try to put as much detail as possible to just cover all bases they're like oh well just in case you want to know about this project i also did this and it does this cool thing and it's relevant to this company this way when that's actually not important we want to know the high level overview and why it was awesome if you could say i was amazing and two to three bullet points that's good um you don't necessarily need more for that um now if you had a job at a company for 10 years and you did a lot of amazing stuff then that's a different story than if you were at a company for two years and you did some amazing stuff but like you did some really amazing stuff we want to know the really great stuff the stuff that you let the stuff that you produce um and that's what that's what gets attention not okay the my new details what about what about the skills section of resume is that a mistake when people write skills teamwork microsoft office uh communication um i mean i'm not saying that it let's not say it's a mistake but um i mean what's the value of that section like if if somebody were to remove it like that's not a section is that a negative against the resume then i think you need the skill section but i do not think that you need to list every skill set you've ever learned in your life i think you need to list the skills that are important for the role that you're applying to so if you're applying for a curriculum role for instance um you need to demonstrate that you have that full stack experience but also that you have teaching experience so you might say both of those things in your skill sets now if you're applying to a marketing role or pr role maybe saying communication could be important but um you know it may not be the most important detail to add on a technical role when we want to know more about which technical skill sets that you have okay and do you know anything about uh i know that some companies do some sort of like prescanning resumes where they're looking for keywords or things like that and i've heard in the past that maybe at the bottom of your resume like you know at the very last line of or something or even even in the margin um add keywords or hashtags or like certain things that will kind of like a computer will pick up that human might not see that's why they say put out at the end um is that in your experience i don't know if your kodakami or another place is that a thing that some people can take advantage of trying to hit more keywords so they get sorted in the system better or um i mean i would say yes in general yes i would say if you could look at the job description of the role that you're applying to and look for exactly the sort of things that they're looking for um i mean i guess you could think of it as looking for keywords but more so just actually look and read what they're looking for and if that matches to what you're doing let's say you use a word like communication instead of public relations and you can replace those words and that would help you then that that's fine but i wouldn't go adding things that you actually don't have experience with just to increase your level of keywords because you still won't be relevant if you if you don't have that experience okay and i mean i guess that also goes into knowing the company you're applying for right i mean some companies have a very automated process right where you submit a resume and like a minute later literally 60 seconds later you get an automated email saying sorry you didn't get a in this role whatever and that wasn't a human being right that was they had like a i don't know how they called it has an acronym like this they call it ats yeah application uh tracking systems yeah yeah so i know that sometimes so i guess that's that's also part of like doing your due diligence when you're applying for a company okay uh this company has this sort of systems so i need to make sure that i i pass the hurdle first right um and do what i have to do um that's pretty cool do you have any other like examples of things not to do in a resume that seems to be very common or like people should avoid is there anything that you come across a lot um i i think you know sometimes people put their entire addresses on a resume and that's not necessary it's actually a safety concern you should probably just put you know this you want to disclose your location which you don't have to do you could just put the city and the state or the city in the country you don't have to put your entire address or po box because no one's actually mailing you anything that's a that's something they did in the past not now we're going to email you um i think another thing is just being really wild with with templates uh okay this can be very fun um and they don't have to be you know black and white straight up and down you can add color and even add a picture if you want if that makes you feel good uh but i think sometimes i see really well templates that i'm like this is actually too far especially in technical resumes because they try to you know do whatever they can to explain express their you know design um abilities um and i would still make it readable still make it you know similar to a resume and i would even do an approved template uh just to be safe but if you wanted to design your own template i would just make sure that it's still very professional um and that it fits the the the brand of the company that you're applying to so if you're applying to code academy um yeah we're fun but we're also you know a company that cares worked on it yeah every company that cares about clarity um and you know communication that is pretty professional so i would i would still take it seriously i think uh you know that that's actually a great segue for another question i had to for you that was about templates um google does this thing called uh grow with google or something like that it's like this kind of like one hour mini courses that they do offer online on demand um and i actually attended one for resumes and stuff and the first thing that they tell you is go to your google drive and create a new uh wrestling template and i'm curious to know templating seems to be one of those things where if everybody does it then the recruiter is going to be trained to recognize that design and it might actually give you an advantage because the developer knows where the experience section is where the skill section is because you've seen that template a thousand times so it's kind of like so it might give you an advantage in that sense that makes it easier to read for the for the recovery because they've seen it before but at the same time sometimes people will say well it's it's a template so you're not showing any interest real like this is like a copy and paste from the other 100 places you apply so some recruiters might look at them be like well this is a template which means that they don't care they didn't put enough effort into this do do you have you seen that in the past that how templating can go both ways i i can understand how that could be the case but like i said at cogatomi we don't we don't uh reject candidates based off things like that are a bit more trivial like their template now if they have a bunch of typos in their resume like that's not a good sign but if you generally have the experiences and you use a basic template i'm not going to be like oh this person's using didn't care about doing a different template i'm going to say this person has experiences i want to hire them so i don't think that i think that template and the style and the format that you present your resume and as long as it's professional the actual decoration of it uh is probably less than five percent of the importance of getting you across that you know to the next step but i i think your experience will be 90 of what's relevant okay great uh and i know that uh you also mentioned this uh with the address saying nobody send you letters anymore so modern day restroom is is it is it more common place now for applicants especially for technical roles to include uh urls uh to their linkedin profile or their github repo things like that is is that more commonplace now or like at the top right under your name or something that is like links to pages is it like normal now like no vacuum is gonna scoff at that or be like this is poor taste or something yeah i think i think it's really um it's really common and in my experience it's actually pretty helpful if someone links their linkedin and doesn't just like because some people would just put the html uh like the whole web address uh which is fine as well i could copy and paste but if someone links their linkedin i'm gonna much easier click on that and go to it then i would copy and paste someone's uh the same thing with their projects and with their personal website so but i don't think it's a it's not a necessary component like if i if you were really a great candidate and i wanted to go look at your website or your projects i will copy and paste the link or google it uh but it's helpful if you have those links and obviously uh this is with the caveat that we're in the us and there's people watching from all over the world like i know in some countries they expect you to include profile pictures for example where in the u.s we don't uh so obviously uh for everybody watching remember that um what we were talking about is kind of like u.s centric a little bit that might be different in the country there in and maybe maybe including links to your github repo it's bad taste in the country living so just keep that in mind uh you know you have to play by the rules of where you live um you know we actually touched on a lot of things i don't know if you wanna if you wanna offer any sort of general advice or we can go straight into q a um the last thing i would say is generally i think uh linkedin's can be a bit touchy and or maybe you know someone may not put as much energy into their linkedin as they with their resume and i would say it's still important even though they serve different capacities and they're they're not necessarily interchangeable they're still both individually important and it should be individually strong nice yeah and i think uh it's something that people don't wanna they don't like but it's still the rules of the game sort of uh when they say hey make sure that the photo in your profile photo in linkedin is like not blurry that you look normal yeah like whatever it's kind of like well that shouldn't matter who i am what i know it's like i know i know but someone that doesn't know you is still going to look at that photo and their brain is going to make a judgment call out of that and and i know it's terrible and you don't want to be judged on like you were wearing tshirt and flipflops in the beach but at the end of the day you're trying to get a job and if yeah you know so there's little details like that on linkedin like you said uh sometimes people don't put effort on linkedin and it might make a difference even if you don't think that's important it's not about what you think it's about what the recruiters think right yeah especially if you're trying to get into web development or something that is you know front end facing we want to know that you have like a solid uh understanding of how to you know navigate something like a linkedin profile which is on the web you know so you're lying in a linkedin profile and it's like the gray figurehead like there's no photo or anything like oh no i mean i would like again we wouldn't reject someone because of it but it would i mean i the photo i'm not really big on is the rest of the profile like you know what i don't have a banner either there's no banner image there's no profile well you know how we see their bio is one line i like what about like one i mean that wouldn't be a bad thing if they had details under their jobs or if they had skills that they listed um or if they had a link to their website but just having nothing um and just a couple of jobs and it's outdated and we don't know if you're still there that's when it's like okay can this person be a web developer because they don't even uh update their linkedin i feel like um you know what it's kind of one of those things instead of thinking of like um there's two ways i think of thinking like this um you start with 100 points and you lose points every time you make a mistake that's one way of thinking about this i think recruiting the way that you're saying like well a photo is not going to make me reject somebody i feel like it's the other way around you start at zero points and you're trying to add points to your account to the point where the recruiter wants to talk to you in a phone interview or a technical interview so oh you don't have a profile photo okay well that's plus zero like you you didn't gain you didn't lose oh you then put a good bio in your linkedin well that's not a negative but it's not a positive and if we have a hundred applicants for this maybe the other ones did a better job than you did right so that's exactly it's kind of like it's like a basketball game or like any sports game like you're just adding points to your scoreboard so i think you're right i think you're right about that so like yeah you're not gonna get rejected but you might not get chosen either just because you didn't you know spend an hour one afternoon making your linkedin more polished uh polished yeah um cool let's go uh let's go for some q a here um yeah so at the end of every live stream everyone watching we always do some q a and i'm gonna go through the chat looking at what people were asking let's see if i can find some questions somebody was wondering about transitioning from different kinds of career what should they put in terms of the past jobs okay so i think this question is more about um when you have experience but it's in a different field do you is there any way is any particular where like better than way of highlighting experience that might be relevant for the job but it's not in the field that you're applying for um i think what i i i think what i would not do is lie about the previous jobs or uh change the previous jobs in a way to make it seem like you are always doing this thing i wouldn't do that like less like if you were a librarian and now you're transitioning into engineering you put on your resume all previous librarian jobs everything i did had to do i t like i wouldn't do that because it doesn't actually serve serve you i think i think the best thing you could do is um be short and be honest about what you did um and like i said before add in a cover letter and an objective that says i'm pivoting careers i'm excited about this i'm passionate for the next steps and this is the work that i've done to get towards that next career but i think it depends on the years of experience that you have in that previous career uh like if you have 10 years of experience as a chef before you went into engineering i wouldn't put every job you had i would put maybe one or two jobs let's say if you had one job for a long period of time that job and then maybe just put chef various companies uh x amount of years or let's say you only did it for four years um that you were a chef before you transitioned then i would just put you know chef various companies list the companies list some of the roles that you did but i wouldn't add all the details and all of the examples that you add under your engineering projects because if you do that then it may take up too much visual space and you need that visual space to demonstrate your interest and to talk about your projects and so i mean if you if you spend 70 percent of your visual resume space talking about your previous industry then we will assume that you are you know not fully transitioned versus if you spend 70 percent of time talking about the engineering role that you're going after then it'll be like okay well they're transitioning they have projects now um they have things to talk about okay cool yeah so focus on the goal yeah uh i know that uh other oh people have talked to uh mentioned something similar which is only mention the bars that are relevant for the role so like oh okay you were a chef and you were you had like three shoe chefs under you or you had like these people whatever oh you've been managing inventory for the uh for the kitchen the wine like yeah if you're applying for a role where you can highlight your communication skills or your team leadership skills or whatever like cool mention that like there's nothing wrong with that yeah it's a different industry but people are people like it's just you know so i know that um that tends to be kind of like don't be ashamed that you weren't working in the job that you were you're applying for that's why you're applying for the job be sincere with the job experience you had and just highlight the parts that are relevant i guess yeah right i would agree yeah yeah uh let's see other questions be honest and be myself yeah yeah very much uh these users are saying yeah that's uh that's what we just said let's just be honest um because at the end of the day you don't want to work at a place that doesn't want you to be honest anyways right like that that's just that's also from your perspective as a candidate you you want to work at a place that that also nurtures that kind of mentality what about the fresh news okay so somebody some people are wondering about college degrees versus selfmade portfolios and they're wondering if there's like one that is better than the other or if they go handinhand or like so i get obviously every company is gonna be different here at code academy i'm assuming that we don't really put a preference in like if you have a degree or not like i guess it depends on the role that we're looking for i would actually be interested and i would i'd be interested in the stats of how many people echo academy came through like self learning or boot camp or some alternative education method versus uh like cs or data science degree i i i would think maybe it would lean a little bit more towards degree but it would probably be like 60 40. um i don't think that well i know for sure that it's not that it's not necessary to have a degree um it's about whether or not you can do the work and you have the experience to showcase that you've done the work so if you have if you've been selflearning like the first example i gave was of the pilot himself learned through coke academy for the past year he had experiences he had projects he had links and certificates he he demonstrated that he was doing the work if you can demonstrate that you know how to do the work that's what we care about if you get interview you know what you're talking about and you could pass a technical assessment that's what matters not because someone who you know has a degree you know may not necessarily be so familiar with those concepts that they could pass a technical assessment or they may not be the best at that so i would say really just focus on demonstrating your experiences and that's what matters more mileage may vary uh or kilometer may vary depending on where you are in the world uh metric system um i have i actually have a great example for this something i learned last week that is one of our administrators one of the admins on our discord community he's been selfteaching himself code for the past year and a half or something and he actually landed a job prepandemic but because the pandemic came around the lockdowns he that that offer got rescinded uh so he spent a year keep teaching himself and this person didn't actually have a portfolio like they just they collaborated with so many open source projects online and they collaborated with so many people and they connected with so many that that developers in companies were like dude are you working somewhere no you're what that's so and they started giving him referrals like hey i'm gonna put you in contact with my recruiting group and like you know people like we need people like you and like so so it just kind of like happened for him he was just like getting online and you know working on projects and it was very typical yeah not the typical like i have my three pro projects here i'm gonna start applying it was more like people saying why aren't you working yet and yeah and kind of like so i think that goes that goes kind of like that idea of companies look for different places different people and different backgrounds and some job descriptions will say straight out bachelor's degree require and others will not and if they don't they don't like that's just right like don't worry about it yeah yeah agreed i did have a candidate who who we hired who for a subject matter expert role and i he did not have a degree but he worked on a bunch of different things he had so much experience and the most the most great thing about his experience was that he had uh like completely he had like done so many open source projects that he was like running the open source board for for one particular field and it was just sort of like we don't it's no it's no option like because we have to hire this person because he knows exactly what he's talking about i'm pretty sure he built this this software like not even for a junior role yeah it was for like a part time yeah so i'm like yeah it's about the experiences yeah definitely so yeah i would encourage anyone watching this not don't get caught up in like the traditional uh divisions of like college degree not college degree things like that uh that's changing especially in tech uh that's changing a lot it's shifting um and in fact uh platforms like code academy they're so valuable for that for that specific reason because more and more companies are realizing you know college degrees are great but you can learn the stuff someplace else and that's why they're boot camps and there's all these places um let's see someone is asking about job gaps so how do you deal with what if you had a job then a couple years went by and then you have no jobs um is there any way of like i don't know how to embellish that in the resume or like yeah what is that is that something that yeah is that a red flag for a recruit like you're looking at up down seven seconds and you see 2021 to 2019 and then 2017. is this something you go whoa what happened um uh i mean i think it's very common that people have job gaps so i i don't think that it is weird um i think people would like recruiters would probably ask you about it like hey and notice that this time was uh if you don't say it in your cover letter or your objective um or if you don't say it on the resume um they might ask you about it just to clarify that it wasn't something that you take that you took out of your resume and it was a job gap um i've seen some really clever things that people have done especially on linkedin like i saw one person had on their linkedin traveling world 2019 to 2020 and then they were like you know then they have their new job 2021 after that and it was just sort of like okay um and you know i'm not mad at you for traveling i think um if you can be honest about that and i think i think you anyone who has those sort of gaps wants their employer to to be able to um allow them to do that or just you know see them as a human being and so i don't think that you have to shy away from that i think we're in an age where you can really be honest about it or just leave it off and say i wasn't working and then i started back here um you know my stepmom is one who stepped away from from work for like six years to raise um babies and so that's a like that's a lot of years in terms of her management experience but she still has all these years of experience and i was just helping her write her resume and she was like you know how do i do i even address it do i say anything i was like no just just skip it don't say anything if you if you want to say raising family you can but i don't think you have to give them that much information you could just skip it and put you know whatever let's say you've been doing volunteer experience during that time or um you took taking a class during that time just put that information and just focus on um what you have to give as opposed to drawing too much attention if you don't want to yeah okay yeah so again be sincere but yeah get creative i guess you can be a little creative like doing classes volunteering work traveling i guess enjoying your life building a family uh i know that that's a big one uh facebook had a program a few years ago that was something like reengaging the force either i forget the name of the initiative but they were basically looking for people specifically with job with job gaps with gaps in their timelines where they were like these are the people that want to help uh you know get jobs on facebook and stuff because you know we believe that that's not a burden that's not a negative um someone had a question earlier during our conversation about formatting cover letters and i don't know if you do resumes and cover letters like i guess you do a bit of everything is there like a typical structure for cover letters that seems to work better like i think that it's like a intro yourself second paragraph it's about your experience and third paragraph is you fit in the company things like that like there's like a one two three like is there like a recipe for this i there probably is uh my favorite type of cover letter is one paragraph real quick one paragraph cover letter it is simple it is concise it isn't some people in the cover letters they'll tell you the company's mission statement they'll take the company's values they'll talk about their 20 years of experience and they'll repeat what's on their resume well that's actually not what i'm looking for i'm looking for how you fit for this job and that doesn't mean elaborate on every job that you had that means give me high level why you're in why you're a fit for this job um and yeah letters don't have to be a letter it sounds to me like it doesn't have to be a whole 500 500 word page well the thing is that people take it and they will write three pages of a cover letter or they'll oh wow or they'll make the font size 9.5 and expand the margins and they'll put so much information in one page and it's just like no one is re like we don't want to read all that we want to read concise information that explains exactly how you're fit for this job we know that you're passionate we know that you're interested we want to know why you're fit um and so that that that's the important part of cover letters you know talking about getting creative with gaps so if you had a gap in 2020 because of the pandemic could you just do you think that would be totally fine for somebody to be like 20 20 pandemic it's just like i lost my job it's it's it is what it is i've seen it i've seen uh they'll put during they'll put in in parentheses um left you know out of work due to covert layoffs or i've i've also seen uh people just say um you know pandemic family leave like people will be very open and honest about you know things and i don't think it's a bad thing i think we on the other side of that paper really understand okay i was there too i know how it felt like i know people were doing all types of things and there's no judgment at least at cocademy now other companies i'm not sure how they'll judge people but i'm sure that people are just as human as we are um and they will try to give you the benefit of the doubt all right you heard it here before i mean first uh before i'm first uh okay last question uh somebody's wondering about the language and resumes and they're thinking about there's like a passive tone an active tone um another different ways that you can portray information in the resume um is there any way that you recommend is there anything that that tends to be the norm or kind of like the the rule of thumb for writing resumes um active versus passive i think the rule of thumb is definitely active language uh i'm trying to think exactly what that looks like and i can't really pinpoint it but i know that uh the main thing of resumes is that you just want to get to the point as quickly as possible and passive language sort of takes you on a little bit of a journey to get there so if you can you know say teacher talk kids wrote assignments did this like just be very concise and very poignant about what you're saying uh then i i wouldn't i wouldn't spend too much time on the other details okay yeah i think we just keep coming back to this idea of like there's limited time and yeah real estate for a recruiter they're gonna look at it for so many seconds and their eyes can only look at so many words so don't go in circles don't do anything weird just just say this is who i am and this is what i know exactly and the recruiter will give you a thumbs up no problem okay well it's been awesome uh i think i learned a lot i'm walking out of this uh feeling like i'm ready to apply for jobs maybe okay i'm glad that we got to answer some questions from the audience um we do this every week guys by the way so next week we're going to have somebody else online live answering questions another recruiter from code academy so just stop by just keep checking our kodakami youtube channel and i'll catch you in the next ones thank you so much gemini uh any parting thoughts uh no i'm excited to see resumes all clean and concise out there in the world all right being concise thank you so much everybody goodbye thank you and that's the stream
