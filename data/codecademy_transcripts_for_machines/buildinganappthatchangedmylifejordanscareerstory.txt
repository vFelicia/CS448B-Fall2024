coding to me is essentially creating something that can change somebody's life you don't need to have any type of prerequisites it's all in your hands I saw an opportunity to help people purch sneakers that they desire without paying ridiculous high prices code academy kind of gave me the robust ideas of how to actually use programming to my fullest potential it took me about three or 4 months start building out my own projects and then I got my fulltime job at Microsoft I didn't know what to say I didn't know how to feel and I had to tell everybody this business has changed my whole life I'm able to help my whole family out I even bought my dad a car the love and the passion of what I currently do comes from what I was doing when I was a little kid if you really want to make something then you really have to work hard and figure out how to make it code academy gave me that jump start to figure out what I actually wanted to do they put me out on an empty road and said how far can you go
