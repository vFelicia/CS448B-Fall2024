hi everyone my name is elisa and i'm a community manager at codecademy and this week's chapter leader weekly is about getting access to your event data now at the end of each of your meetups an automated email is sent containing a survey that asks your chapter members what they thought about your meetup which is excellent information if you can access it this video will show you how exactly you can access it so here you are you're on uh the the screen is showing actually what your dashboard would look like pretend that you were at community.codacademy.com and you clicked on the dashboard button this is where it'll land you you will not have this icon here because that's for admin only take your eyes up make sure that you are in fact looking at the chapter that you are the leader of and click on the events tab from the events tab you'll see which are live whoops i need to schedule one which are completed so we're going to click on the completed tab we're going to click on the actual event it's going to open up a lot of information but you're going to be interested in forms and then you're going to click on this neat bar graph not bar graph what am i talking about line graph icon and it will show you any responses to your recent surveys okay from the top again you'll click on your dashboard it will take you to the backend or what's called the mezzanine of your chapter you'll click on events you'll click on completed select your most recent or maybe a different completed meetup and from here you'll select forms the line graph and here you get some pretty cool data about your event thank you to taya and thank you michael cook for responding to a recent survey so that's really it um the whole purpose of having data on your events is so you can understand hey what's going well what's not going well something that i learned by looking at this survey data is gosh this uh software that we've been using is tricky and i need to send out some information ahead of us ahead of our meetups to make sure that everybody has what they need so that they can actually use the software that we're using it's a great point of improvement for me and it's super actionable um thank you for watching this if you have tuned in at the point where this was actually shared with codecademy leaders happy new year that totally makes this not evergreen content but i'm excited that it's a new year and that uh we get to be here with you all for it thank you again happy daily hunting
