to me coding is this feeling of balance between you and the computer you have the creativity of the human and the speed and precision of the computer these two forces together balance really nicely I've always had a curiosity for sports medicine and sports science and I started a yoga and Pates Studio my clients needed to be able to pay for a block of classes and then book them at a later date I couldn't find anything that quite met my business needs and I thought and I'll just learn how to do it myself I went with code academy because I liked the way that it keeps track of everything that you're learning everything's laid out in a very intuitive way all of the tools that you need like the workspaces and the documentation they're all in one place so everything's really easy to find code academy is like a a very accelerated way to get through the basics and then you can kind of learn the peripheral stuff being able to go from no knowledge at all to having a job within a year it was a really big achievement for me today I'm working as a full stack web developer and I'm entirely selftaught
