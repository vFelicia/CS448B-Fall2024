hi i'm regina and i went from no code to being a software engineer in six months and switched careers completely back in november 2019 and now i work as a full stack engineer number one get yourself a support system you have to have friends who will lift you up and encourage you and the good news is the tech community as a whole overall is a very supportive environment one of the best things i did was join 100 days of code on twitter and that kept me accountable for my study time even if it meant i was putting in just 15 minutes a day but i would share my stuff and i started becoming friends with other people who were learning brand new just like myself and also people who were already more experienced and so get yourself a community that is super important uh number two is telling yourself that you can do it because um i think a lot of the hesitancies lie less in um the logistics because if you're already considering a career change it means that there's something that has stood out to you in tech that is appealing to you and i i think that the block is more so that maybe you are doubting whether you can do it or not and um the thing is you're not going to know until you try and so the first step is always just getting your foot through the door and making that jump and it can be scary but that's why community is really important so yeah i would say get yourself a community tell yourself you can do it and then you know hold yourself accountable and you know do the 15 minutes a day and participate in those uh in those forums and those exchanges because you'll find that the more involved you are in it the more excited you become or maybe you don't and then that's fine and you can respectfully bow out and you know figure something else out but um you're not gonna know until you try everything up until the point where you write your first hello world line of code it's all up here and so i think it's really important just to um yeah get support and and do the thing just do it
