one okay and we are live again on Academy's YouTube channel hello everybody I see that we have some viewers already ready here so that's fun how are you doing Lucas I'm doing all right how are you Fede I'm doing great so today we're going to be talking about Academy docs I'm a community manager here Community manager here at code academy I've been in my role for about two years and I help people connect with one another you know Community platforms and find support and the resources they need and here with us today we have Lucas Lucas can you introduce yourself yeah for sure uh Sam Lucas I'm a curriculum developer here at code academy I work on the web development domain on courses such as our CSS and JS course and our go courses uh and uh my Prime Joy is our UI and ux courses of which we released an intro to UI and ux design course back in the spring and we have just released two more learn user research generative and learn design thinking ideation um you can go check those out after our stream uh I also work on a lot of our free resources including our articles and our docs pages which happened to be the subject of today's live stream and I'm excited to get into it yeah uh yeah let's just run jump right into it I'm going to start sharing my screen and we're going to be talking about what docs is and why you want to hear about it let's go so uh I just share my screen hopefully everybody can see it real quick that I am just going to interject that we do have two uh code academy team members uh in the chat with us as well um Adam and Brandon are here to uh also lend a hand that's right so if you have any questions drop those questions in the chat we're going to be taking a look at the chat and making sure that we answer all those questions and we have team members right there like look I said answering questions as well on the fly so great uh you should be all seeing my screen now this is the main docs page so if you've never seen this page before uh this is called The Academy docs and I'm going to read here from the paragraph of the top docs it's a Community Driven collection of code documentation for popular programming languages and Frameworks so what this means is when you're Googling information online when you're trying to you know you're going through your coursework at code academy and you might be interested in taking a deeper dive into a concept or maybe you want to review something that you just saw a loop uh what is a button what other things uh docs is fulfilling that purpose is giving you that information right right here on this page very easy to navigate very easy to see and and to consume the information and I want to show you some of the pages that we have here just so you get a better sense of what this page can do for you let's say that you are learning JavaScript and you have some comment you know you have some questions about how conditionals work so as you can see once I click JavaScript here on the topics and we are in the JavaScript main page you can you get a collection of all the concepts that are here and by the way because this is Community Driven it means that you also get to contribute to this so we're going to jump into a conditionals one that has an example today but imagine that you come to JavaScript Concepts and there is one that you can't find instead of just you know saying oh well too bad I guess uh nothing to do here you can actually contribute to the docs and make them better for everybody and add that content so if you Google it and you find information somewhere else come back to docs and make it better for it for you and for everyone into in the future so conditionals here is a page or an example page for example here in the conditionals uh it will tell you what JavaScript conditions are if statement you see some example code here so you can understand it real fast L statements you can keep scrolling down more information and this is a really cool part of the page it's called a code byte and this is a live console and better writing to the page which means that when you're writing this you see here that there's a yellow button that says run you can actually click it and run the code that you have so let's say that you just read about JavaScript conditionals and you're thinking wow um I would love to practice this a little bit I don't know where to go you can just use one of these code bytes and run some of your code um I can just go ahead and delete some of this if let's say you don't you're not interested in this delete it you can run it again and you know practice what you just read about let me yeah those are those are a really awesome feature of uh docs um and uh for those of you that are more advanced we'll get into uh this a little bit um but docs was written completely in markdown so um all of these code bytes and you'll see uh where we have like uh the the code blocks and the kind of inline code segments um are all really easy to get into docs once we start contributing let's say I'm gonna go back and we're going to jump into the UI and ux Design hub oh click too fast and let's say that we're interested in learning about buttons um here's some of some more information about buttons right so you're reading about it you're set you're learning what a button is and UI and ux design and here you have some graphics that show you how to work what it is I think I mean it's it's great to see all this information right here so easy and once you've navigated the docs you know for two minutes you already feel so easy so at ease just navigating through and finding information that you need it's it's amazing you even have resources at the bottom and you even have a quick link to the introduction to UI and ux design so maybe you weren't on the course but now that you've read about it you want to you know you might be wondering well is this something I can learn at code academy well just scroll to the bottom and boom there you have your title click it will send you right to the coursework so that's great too I think um maybe we could just uh move on and start showing people uh a bit of how they can contribute to you to to dogs I'm gonna stop asking now yeah and I will take over the screen share um so uh in uh preparation for this uh oh that's actually the wrong screen sorry about that um I will share uh this screen um where uh I will be talking about um some uh bugs that we found in kind of preparation for this live stream um so uh this is type uh typescript it's a um you know a typed superset of JavaScript um and we have our own uh docs category for it um and our uh amazing team member Brandon in the chat noticed that we have uh this weird error happening where we have uh a page for function and a page for functions um and so upon digging a little bit further uh Brandon realized that this function page is actually supposed to be type aliases um which means that uh this is kind of titled incorrectly um luckily this is a really easy fix and I'm going to be showing how you can make a change like this or change if you see kind of a typo somewhere in the content uh we can use the GitHub platform to really quickly uh make a nice and easy fix to this so I'm going to click this edit on GitHub button and uh we'll first be met with this message that you need to Fork this repository so given that this is a big GitHub repo that we have lots of people contributing to we have people Fork off of the repo so that they can contribute back onto the um to the main repo so I'm going to click Fork this repo and now I have my own version of the docs uh you know the entire docs uh service I have a version of it on my own uh forked version of the repo um and so now we can see what this file looks like um so you can see if I jump back we have these code blocks and we can see those code blocks right here in the markdown as I mentioned before um but what I'm going to change up here is this title um as we remember it should be type aliases um but instead it says function here so I'm going to change that to type aliases uh and then uh the description looks okay I think everything is okay in this um this should just be a quick uh a quick fix so I'm going to go down I'm going to say update type aliases I'm going to add in a description I'm going to say um uh fix title to say type aliases um and I'm going to propose this change um and we're going to compare those changes so you'll see up here for those of you that don't know the GitHub interface I'm going to walk through it uh I think this is a good time to make a shout out that we do have courses on learn git and learn GitHub so this is a you know if this is an unfamiliar area for y'all that's a great way to kind of get your feet wet with getting GitHub and dive deep and understand exactly what this is but I'll just be doing kind of a quick overview a lot of of a lot of these uh Concepts so up here at the top you'll see that the head repository so what I'm editing is this live stream Lucas slash docs that's my personal GitHub and I'm going to be comparing that to the code academy docs repo so I'm going to be trying to push this change to the main code academy repo where it will live on the live site um so I am going to uh just double check that everything that I made is correct yes I'm just changing this title uh and I'm going to click create pull requests um it says it looks like uh the first time um if you want to look at the contributing guidelines and code of conduct you could um you know that'll go to our contributing page and uh you'll be able to double check that you're doing everything correctly um but we can scroll down uh and there's a lot of information here um about getting appropriately credited so that you can appear um actually that's that's a good note I'll jump back to the page and we can see here for contributors if you um make a change to any uh any Pages here on the docs page you'll be listed right here as a contributor um and you'll be able to uh you know prove that you uh you contributed to uh this amazing platform um but uh for that you'll need to follow these instructions um so be sure to do that I am going to add a description in here uh luckily I copied that previous uh subscription that I had before fixed title to say type aliases uh it used to say function which was wrong uh I am going to select the type of change that it is so I am editing an existing entry uh fixing a typo bug issues ETC um so I'm going to leave that uh and there are all these check boxes to make sure that we are um you know following all of the code conducts um uh you know all the rules that we have around making uh codecademy docs a nice and legal place to uh contribute to so we do want to avoid uh plagiarism um because it has you know serious impacts on code academy as a whole and we don't want you know uh that affecting any sort of reputation around this so we want to make sure that all writings are uh our own it's okay to use resources but make sure that you uh you know make it your own um that we follow the style guide um that uh we're not generating new warnings um that'll come up a little bit later uh I have performed a selfreview make sure that you don't have any typos or bugs in your code when you're putting this up um the next one also applies to that um I uh have made corresponding changes to the documentation if needed um that's not really relevant here but we'll check that I've confirmed my changes are not being pushed from my forked main branch so that's a big part of this we do want to make sure that we are in a different branch that causes some uh issues with the um with the docs platform so we want to make sure that we're on a branch not our main a branch of error repo and I'll I'll cover that a little bit more later um and uh this also uh applies there um and I think that we are ready to uh create our pull request so I will submit that um and we now have that pull request living in the pull request section of the docs um which lists out all the kind of proposed changes we have 56 now um I don't think we mentioned yet that it is hacktoberfest and so hacktoberfest is a big um open source contribution month uh sponsored by digitalocean um where uh you know they encourage everyone to kind of contribute to open source and so um you know that's a way that you can participate is through our platform um and so we now see that update type aliases.md is added to the pull requests um and uh thank you Brandon for noting here that I need to sign the contributor license so this is another aspect of contributing um it's just signing a license saying that you you permit your own writings to be on this platform uh on code academy docs um it's a pretty standard agreement for uh open source contribution but you can go through uh and read the finer details uh I've read it before so I know I'm comfortable signing it um but feel free to read duper into that um so you click sign and you click authorize um and uh I have signed it so if I jump back um to it'll automatically Point me back there uh it says all contributors have signed the CLA uh and uh in some amount of time uh you know it depends on how busy our content contributors are such as Brandon um but eventually that will be uh if there are any edits that need to be made they'll suggest those uh if not it'll be merged straight in um Lucas I know that uh somebody here in the chat uh Brandon already helped them but I just wanted to touch real quick on that they were asking about forks and how they work and if they were a feature of uh code academy or GitHub and Brandon already explained this but I just wanted to put it here on the video as well for people you know that might be watching to the Future could you just kind of like real quick uh touch again on why people have to Fork before they get to contribute to or Docs yeah of course um so uh for full of transparency the reason that we have this setup is um because we want a little bit of a level of Separation where we can have uh thorough reviews by our team before uh changes are made to um to the GitHub repo and so what uh we do that by having Forks um which uh if I go to uh my profile you'll see I have this Fork here um what I could do is I could show the process of making that fork manually uh and then we'll use that fork uh when making um I'm going to be updating some documentation and adding a new entry which is a very exciting thing and a little bit more work um so this is another reason uh why the end GitHub course is great because if you aren't quite caught up or a little confused um this will kind of fill in that course will fill in a lot of the details but I am going to um first delete this Fork um so that I am actually uh that might mess things up but I will just show exactly how it works um so you can click this Fork button um and what that will do is create a version of this uh GitHub repo it's kind of like a big folder that hosts all of the content um so what this is going to do is um create a new version of the codecademy docs on your own GitHub account where you can edit it um make it what you want it to be and then uh you make a pull request for those changes um so that they get merged onto the big code academy docs version uh where it will live live on the site um so once I make those changes uh we would see it on this page for example um so uh that's how forecasting Works um again another advertisement for our learn get in GitHub where you can really uh learn about the fine details of forking um but I think uh if there's not any more questions I would give uh I think this is a perfect opportunity to show how you can uh kind of level up your impact that you have on the code academy docs and not just fix a typo but actually add a new entry which is our uh you know my favorite part of the GitHub repo uh in that we have so many uh contributions happening every day uh if we look at this pull request again uh you see we have someone submitting for Swift UI views um someone's submitting Java math methods C plus plus math functions um all these different folks contributing new terms every day and we are just building this really awesome documentation um so let's be one of those people uh I am going to um go back to the docs main page which I can do by clicking on docs up here and I am going to click this code button which will allow me to open on GitHub desktop this also works in something called a command line interface it's a little bit more advanced some people really like it some people are more comfortable with the GitHub desktop I'm showing this because it's a little bit more approachable and beginner friendly so I again clicked this code button I clicked launch with GitHub desktop um if you don't already have git Hub desktop it'll prompt you to download it but I already have it on my machine um so I am going to just follow the prompts here it'll say it'll it's making a new folder uh in my uh computer uh it is cloning um oh I'm sorry I made a mistake there uh good to show this um so I actually cloned the uh codecademy docs what I actually want to do um is remove this and I want to clone my Fork so I'm going to go to my profile I'm going to go to my Fork and I'm actually going to clone my Fork uh so up here it'll say uh you know your GitHub username and then docs instead of code cabinet docs uh and I'm going to open that with my GitHub desktop uh clone that and uh kind of a little Merit error there but I think everything is okay I'm doing this to contribute to the parent project um that's uh this is just going to change some settings but we do want to contribute to the parent project that's why we're doing this um yes thank you Brandon really want to emphasize that really important to clone the fork and not uh the code academy docs I almost fell into that pit hole glad I caught myself be sure uh not to make the same mistakes as me um so contribute to the parent project that's the setting that we want um I already have this GitHub desktop to be associated with my um text editor of choice you can put anything in here you know if you prefer Adam if you don't know code academy has a lot of great resources to kind of figure out um what text editor or IDE you would prefer to use my preference is Visual Studio code you can set that there and I'm just going to click open in Visual Studio code and that opened on the wrong monitor so I'm going to bring that over and here we have the code academy docs it may look like a jumble of information we have a lot of um you know settings files here the thing that's really important for us is this content folder and inside that content folder is going to host all of the different categories that we have so we see C we have cloud computing we have C plus plus we have CSS a whole bunch of different topics if you'll remember uh I said that I wanted to contribute to the UI and ux design category um because I have written up a little thing about stakeholders as I mentioned I've been putting out a lot of UI ux content and so I want to grow the UI ux category um so I am going to go into the UI ux category go into the concepts folder and here we have the names of all of our Concepts so you'll see accessibility you'll see animation you'll see annotations I want to add a new folder in here because I'm adding a new entry and for that you add a new folder and I'm going to call this folder a stakeholder a little bit of rhyme there uh and I am going to put a file in here called stakeholder .md that's a markdown file as I mentioned before markdown is the formatting language I think I can use the word uh that is how our text is structured I'm going to borrow I think the easiest way to do this is probably borrow another file so I'm going to borrow the sketching file uh just for its formatting and paste that straight in at the top here you'll see some metadata so this is not going to be shown directly on the page but it is going to be um I think it might be helpful actually actually for me to pull up this sketching um file so that we kind of see how all of this translates so I'm going to go to UI and ux I am going to go to sketching and uh we can now see kind of how this translates so um I have over here we have this content you'll see the content update here at the top is metadata so that's not going to show and it's just going to show the uh the title here and then it's going to show this text you'll see we have this double asterisk to designate bold and we have this link so for iterate we have it in square brackets and then we have the link in parentheses and that's what creates this link here um so we are going to uh use this file stakeholder.md I'm going to change the title here to stakeholder I'm going to take out this description um it is still UI and ux so I'm going to kind of leave all of this stuff the subjects the tags the catalog content if you are doing a completely different category you can look up the tags that already exist but those are going to stay the same since this is already in UI ux uh and I am going to um delete this text and off to the side here uh in my magical other monitor I'm going to bring in uh the prewritten uh I did some preparation sorry guys uh I did some preparation and already wrote um this content so in UI and ux design a stakeholder I remember the those double asterisks are going to show as bold a stakeholder is anyone who impacts or is impacted by a certain project this could include your intended users administrators and it professionals helping set up your product uh the engineers and product managers on your team the sales people who will be selling your product and many more so just a really concise um definition there I'm also going to bring this first sentence so just a short snippet of that definition um back up into this description and put that right there uh I think that the description shouldn't have any styling so I'm going to take out those double asterisks and I think that we are set to make this really quick addition so I am going to go back to my GitHub desktop which you'll see now should have some changes showing yep and we've got here it shows that we added a new stakeholder.md file and added in this content um I also want to highlight here we do want to make sure as our contributing documentions I'm going to show this contributing dot so we forked this repo we cloned the repo to our computer the forge repo and we also need to switch to a branch so it's okay that it's on Main right now because I'm going to create a new Branch here uh and I'm going to call this um add uh stakeholder and we're going to create a branch called that it's going to ask me do I want to leave my changes on Main or bring those to add stakeholder I'm definitely going to want to add those to stakeholder this is a really important step because it's going to enable us to make a pull request to the code academy docs repo really easily so I'm going to do switch Branch here and great uh I am going to go down here um and let's create stakeholder.md and stakeholder uh markdown file just a short description there I'm going to say commit uh and I think I made a mistake there I'm also going to commit this uh and uh we're gonna publish this branch so we'll click publish there and that's going to send it to uh to GitHub and uh I can now click this create pull request and I will have a pull request here and it automatically uh since we selected that uh that we want to contribute to the parent repository it's going to assume that we want to make a pull request right to the codecademy docs repo but we're going to check that right there see we're trying to compare to the codecademy docs face main we are going uh we are using our live stream docs add stakeholder Branch right there uh and I'm going to fill out that same information so I'm going to add a description in here saying add stakeholder markdown file type of change I am adding a new entry uh I'm going to fill out all of these uh requirements that we talked about before I won't go too deep into those but just make sure you check those and that you agree and those are all accurate they're really important for our guidelines and making sure that everyone is having a good time and I am going to create a pull request and we'll see how it goes um so yeah we see our uh pull request here if there's any changes that need to be made um that'll happen as comments here in the GitHub uh we have some tests that make sure that everything is running correctly that we've signed the CLA um and if there's any failing there um our content contributors uh we'll be happy to help you out there uh and help you you know have a smooth merge into our uh onto the live site um great I think that's a good natural stopping point do I have any questions uh any any interesting uh anecdotes or anything like that yeah that'll be a perfect time now to drop your questions in the chat if you have any questions I know that there was a lot of information but I mean this you know again this is not meant to be like a fullblown tutorial of how to do contributions on GitHub or git uh for that like Luca said we have a whole course on code academy that is wonderful place to go learn all the intricacies and like the stepbystep of how diesel works but I think still you can see how it's not that bad at all if you've never done it before I'm sure that it's a little uh overwhelming or it could be a little daunting but that that's sort of like Lucas I think it's it's one of the main benefits of why contributing to docs is so great because if you've never contributed to anything online before it can feel very scary like oh wow I'm gonna go to someone's repo that I've never met before rather these big thing and I might mess something up I might change something that I wanted I didn't want to change so having something like code academic docs where the stakes are relatively low or what you can try and you have you know there's people on the other side waiting to give you feedback and like talking to you and like walking you if you have any issues walking you through the issues I mean that's like I see that has a huge benefit for anyone that that wants to practice get on GitHub maybe they just finish the course and they want to practice yeah for sure um it's a really great opportunity um I I think that uh you know I I'm a former teacher um if I was ever struggling to learn a concept um one of the biggest things that helped me was figuring out how I would articulate that concept to someone else um so uh you know a lot of people make uh flash cards for themselves I think that this is a really great learning opportunity as you are learning about things contributing to docs is a great thing for your career but it's also a great thing for your learning experience so that you really drive home exactly what these concepts are um and also you know it great looks great on your GitHub profile a lot of people use that for getting jobs a lot of people use that to kind of show their contribution and so um yeah docs is a really great place I I feel like uh there's basically three main ways that you can look at this and like see the benefits right away uh number one is you get to practice getting GitHub so that's great you get to practice it with us before you go into the wild maybe try to contribute to more complex projects or from open source stories that were in my value more intimidating the second is that you get to practice I mean you get to build your your portfolio on GitHub so somebody who goes to your profile now they see that you are you know committing and making changes to other profiles out there to all the repos so that also builds up your naturally builds up your your profile on GitHub and I think the third one is what you were just touching on which is practicing makes you better the fact that you have to you know do it not just read about it and go through the coursework but actually go into keyword go into machine or using the the edit button on the page doing it yourself that just kind of like Builds on top of that make sure that you have that you really have soaked in the knowledge right and not only the knowledge of GitHub but you're contributing to docs so you know when one teaches to learn you are also researching Concepts maybe you look at docs and go like you know uh this part of dogs looks a little thin I'm going to research this and I'm going to contribute a couple articles here uh you're also learning new things and and it's kind of fun because you're researching it you learn and then you commit it and then other people read your content so you see the impact right so I feel like those three like practicing GitHub and then just building your your resume online I guess your your your profile online and knowing that you are contributing and practicing with other people I mean that sounds all like positives to me yep spot on uh yeah docs is a really great Community we have a really great community of folks uh both internal and external that are really uh willing to uh to help you um you know this is a great learning experience for you um we're very happy to help uh we don't get frustrated if something's not working we're very uh willing to kind of help you through your first contribution um because we know that that can be a scary thing GitHub can be a scary place so we really want to make that um as smooth as possible for you and help you get uh your first pull request through um I'm going to drop in the chat here uh link to our learn git coursework so that way if anyone is wondering well okay that sounds like a really cool uh course to do There's the link Follow It Go learn get in GitHub on me great place and if you don't have an account go sign up for one it's free you can just start with all the free courses that we have which is a lot in the catalog and if you ever feel like this is something that you want to pursue as a career or you just want to take a a deeper dive then you can also subscribe for pro and you know the whole catalog is open to you at that point so thank you so much for today Lucas uh thank you for the walkthrough I think a lot of people are going to benefit from this and like just you know getting to know docs a little bit better yeah thanks for hosting Fede and thank you all to Kane uh to everyone who came uh you know uh I hope that this was a great learning experience for all of you thank you and see you on our next live stream bye bye
