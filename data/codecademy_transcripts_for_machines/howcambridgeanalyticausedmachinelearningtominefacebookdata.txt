hey I'm Ashley and I'm Hilary I'm Eric could Kadim e where we teach anyone the technical skills they need for the jobs they want so we're coming to you today because of the Cambridge analytical scandal and for those of you who don't know what's going on I'll catch you up according to the New York Times Cambridge analytic ah harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permissions making it one of the largest data leaks in the social networks history yikes that sounds bad yeah um real bad so one thing that we're interested in is despite all the political scandal is what is the technology that's going on behind the scenes and in this case it's machine learning now if you're a human who's alive and 28t you've probably heard about machine learning but what that actually means gets a little bit fuzzy I know you're looking at me because people think they think neural Nets like deep learning machine learning robot no there's no robots so Hillary is a resident date of scientists take this from the top what is machine learning so machine learning is actually a lot less interesting than robots it's about taking a small labelled data set and using that to predict the labels for a much larger data set so if you're a fake you could predict if a transaction should be labeled as fraudulent or about if your networks you can predict if a user should be labeled as a question movie fan or a romantic comedy break and you have a bunch of pictures you can predict if they should be labeled as the hot dog or octopus all these things are possible with machine work but how is that actually working in this section sue Cambridge analytic I wanted to be able to label people on Facebook with a personality type from the ocean personality inventory the ocean stands for openness conscientiousness extraversion agreeableness and neuroticism and they wanted to be able to use people's Facebook Likes so if they liked a certain page like Hello Kitty or Metallica to be able to predict what their own of score would be so the way they did this was they set up a personality quiz so just like you could take a quiz and find out which does the princess are you then you could take a quiz to get your ocean score and when people signed up for this quiz they also signed over all of their likes that they had made on Facebook so that Cambridge analytical could correlate those two things together interesting so how many actually setting up this database then okay so when you do machine learning you need to set up a matrix where you have the rows or examples and the columns are going to be features so in this case the examples are different user IDs and the features are which pages they like there do the blank so if you liked Hello Kitty you get a one if you didn't like it you get a zero then the final step is to have a set of labels so each row gets a label in this case the label was there oceans four so they took all of this data this big matrix of ones and zeros along with the labels fed it into a machine learning algorithm and now this algorithm when given an arbitrary string of ones and zeros representing a new person's likes who didn't take that ocean quiz it can still create a label and predict what they would have said if they came back once but the big problem here wasn't that they were sharing their own line Street it's that they were sharing the history of all of the friends who didn't themselves consent now Facebook has stopped this now you can when you're building a third party app you can only ask for a person's own information you can't ask for their friends information interesting so that's not great I know it's kind of shady yeah that'ss I you know how it advances that's technology so the biggest challenge with this kind of machine learning is the scale of the data you can't run that big of a data set on your own computer you need to be using some sort of large cluster of lots of different computers going together most people would use either Amazon Web Services or globe for that but the actual code that's being run on the individual nodes is pretty simple if you had a much smaller data set you could run it on your own laptop using Python just Python yeah like advanced Python that's like that's a little terrifying well but yeah so one thing is educators that we don't want to see is people equate a machine learning with evil Oh totally there are researchers who are using machine learning to predict whether a tumor is cancerous or benign preventing needless surgeries there are folks who are researching using machine learning to track human trafficking and rescue people who are in trouble there's a lot of employment you can do with machine learning
