If you could do anything, what would you do? If you had a job that fit your life, would you get out more? Or would you stay home? Get some metime. And some family time. If you could do anything… would you set bigger goals? Feel the wind in your hair? Push hard. Focus. And repeat. Maybe, if you could do anything, you’d learn something new. Start a career you actually love. Or build something meaningful? Work with people who see the endless potential of technology. Like you. If you could do anything, the question isn’t what you’d do. The real question is… why wouldn’t you? Codecademy. Develop yourself.
