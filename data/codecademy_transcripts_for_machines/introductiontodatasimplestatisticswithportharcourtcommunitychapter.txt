okay uh let me click the button go live okay great so now we are live on youtube and everything you say now is gonna be recorded forever on the youtube archives so welcome to this event uh i'm here with samuel and augustine and they're going to be conducting an event for us today um i'll hand over the mic to you samuel and you can just explain the event and get on with it yeah thank you very much fed um hello everyone welcome to this wonderful event hosted and organized by codecademy community sport hackers in collaboration with coclassic hq fed thank you for making this work and thanks to everyone that could help me hq for pulling this out um with me is uh amazing guests and speaker really talented and educated is a great educator with um four years of experience um specialized in arrow molecular studies biochemistry you know the funny and the good thing the crazy thing about data is how wide it can be applied to various various fields you know everything we do is data i'm gonna let i guess you know ex talk more about that we hope that by the end of this event that you if you if you ever had that uh you know thinking how you want to begin your career in data science or you know just made up your mind we hope by the end of this event you will have enough information and you will you'll be you know have morale and support of course everyone supports you to start learning data we have a lot of courses we have path where you can you can begin your career in data science i'm going to introduce and let's our guest first number introduce himself and then moving forward we can go on thank you because then right thank you so much for having me thank you so much thank you fred it's an amazing opportunity to be with you guys today to talk a little bit about data and statistics some of my favorite teams so myself i am augustine at mccree i have my bachelor's in microbiology from the federal university of technology in overa nigeria then i am also an advocate of personalized medicine so i was motivated to apply to the university of liverpool for a master's program in advanced biological sciences the pathway is bioinformatics there in liverpool i i worked on a number of important human diseases especially those involving cardiovascular diseases i worked on proteins first i used a compositional knowledge to predict the structure of proteins that are involved in human diseases and in recognition of my contribution i was awarded a scholarship a studentship particularly to continue my education up to the doctoral level which i have just completed in bioinformatics so for the last six years of my life i have slept i'm woken up with data so it's actually you know i yeah i i feel honored to share some of these insights with you guys today and at the end of this section i hope that i would have motivated all of us to start considering i've to have a fundamental knowledge about what data is what kind of data we give out and then what are the simple statistics that we perform every day and we're not even aware of so the aim is to draw our attention to our environments particularly and like someone mentioned if we have any challenges in terms of beginning a career in data science or in any data related field i hope that at the end of this presentation will be convinced if we have questions we'll answer that if we have concerns we crash it out and then chat a new course for our careers so without wasting time i would start sharing my screen and then we'll go straight into the business of the day okay somebody just raise the hand i don't know let's go yeah so while um augustine is finished um again um yeah data is a beautiful career myself i'm tearing off as a data scientist and i must say even though i have you know delved a little bit out of data but um to apply that so yeah i'm augustine i think your assets over to you right thank you so much so today we'll be introducing data and a simple statistics so during the course of this presentation uh we're going to go over a few things so this this presentation is divided into two sections the first section would would deal with data and then the second session so during the first session we're going to cover different types of data sources of data laws governing the collection the use and sharing of data different data formats and ways that we can present these data that we've talked about to our audience and to make meaningful interpretations of the data so the second part of this section will talk about statistics so we're going to introduce ourselves to the basic concepts in statistics we're going to draw more on descriptive statistics and then finish up on impression statistics basically ttests and then we'll summarize what we plan so far and again we'll be open to answering all the questions that we may have so the big question is what is data every one of us must have come across this word data but what is actually data let's take a moment to look around us there are so many things out there there's so many things before us that we actually neglect but they contain very important information that can influence our decisions so simply put data effects statistics details features or item of information collected together as reference or for reference or analysis so this definition covers a lot of things facts statistics figures we come across these each and every day of our life another important thing that this definition covers is item of information that means it encompasses the information that we receive and we share so data can be quantitative when we talk about numbers or qualitative when we talk about interviews so we'll dwell a little bit more about the types of data in the latter slides so another important question is this why what about data why is it so important why is everybody talking about it so there are so many reasons why everybody is keen or people like him researchers are keen scientists are kid you know people in the financial sector everybody is keen to understand data one of them is to provide solid backing for your arguments let's take for example we want to say within this within participants of this event today that those located in africa for example are taller than those located in the rest of the world it would just be a statement if we do not substantiate this with data let's take another example so let's say we measure the height of every participant here and we decide to cl cluster these participants into two groups like again those in africa and those in the rest of the world if we collect this data this data i'm talking about now i'm referring to heights and we calculate it and we compute say a simple frequency to say oh the height of these people in africa is actually more than the height of those in the rest of the world we have been able to substantiate that statement with facts another thing is that we want to make informed decisions many of us do a lot of online shopping like me i know many of us will struggle with choosing between products to buy how do we make the decision we rely on data let's take for example you want to order a pair of sneakers from amazon or any other online vendor but you're not sure between two brands so let's say brand a and run b you're not sure which one you want to take but then your friend has mentioned to you that brand a is better and then you've opened the webpage and looking at the two brands the first thing that you want to look at is the reviews what are the people saying in the comment section understand the shoes or the pair or the brand you're looking at is nice or not after looking at the reviews they're going to look at the rating is it five star over five is it's 1 star over 5. obviously let's say brand a has 20 people giving it a 5 star unless the brand b has 10 000 people giving it a 4.5 star the decision becomes easier to make because if 20 000 people or 10 000 people have rated a particular product with a 4.5 star if you wait it's better than 20 people writing a product five star so you've made that informed decision based on the data available to you on that web page unlike so many other decisions that we make in our everyday life so it's also another importance of data we need data to improve our lives what will wonder why but the reality is this if you want to make decisions that affect the lives of people you want to substantiate that with data how do i mean let's talk about census for example why do why does the government conduct census because the government wants to understand the number of persons that have either migrated or located within a geographical location why to better allocate resources so let's give this example let's say within the last five years there is roots b within that would be the services a particular community there are 10 people and there are four buses that you know service these communities but then within the last one year an extra 50 000 people have migrated to the community the question is will those four buses be sufficient to service this number of persons obviously no how will the government know the government will collect statistics of the number of people or influx of people within that community and then make that decision to say oh no these people are going to struggle with four bosses so we're going to include the verses to 20 because of the number of people the same thing goes for other social amenities such as electricity water supply waste waste management the frequency which the waste collectors come around to call it the waste will increase with population but if that number if that data is not available then that decision will not be made and these people will struggle another importance of data is to provide solutions i have touched on this in the course of discussing improving lives but again we can look at this in a different context let's say we have a car manufacturer who supplies a particular brand of car or cars action and then the feedback from the customers is that the car is not energy efficient by the time the the manufacturer collects this information and puts them through the production line the manufacturer will be able to provide cars that will be more energy efficient let's take for example the climate crisis that we're experiencing because we have information that the climate or the climatic conditions have changed over the years now you see that we have more electric and hybrid vehicles being manufactured compared to when we had diesel and gasoline powered cars so that way we're trying to provide a solution or the manufacturers are trying to provide a solution to the climate crisis so we can begin to think about some of that you know importance of data in our everyday life how about planning and strategy why do you need data to plan so let's say for for example many of us are high school students and those early in their career let's say you want to advance in your career but you want to know the requirements for this particular type of job that you want to you know attain or you want to secure let's say you want to be a data scientist for example now you need information about okay how many job opportunities are available to data scientists you also need information about what are the skills that are required for me to acquire to secure that job now the data that you've collected about the job statistics we help you in planning which location do i have to apply to which location has more job opportunities the strategy comes in right now that i know that there are more jobs in sales location b how do i make myself marketable what are the skills required of me do i need to learn programming do i need to learn statistics what do i need to learn let's take it into a business context let's say you want to open a startup one of the things that you want to do is to collect information about one how many startups are within that location within the country how many startups are doing the same thing that i'm proposing to do what are their success stories what is their failure rates now you put this together in your drawing board and you say okay this is what they have done in the past that didn't work now i'm going to use a different strategy to present the same products to the markets data i also mentioned in the preview when i was discussing improving lines i mentioned something about allocating resources but i'm going to give this example in the context of the industry as the head of an organization you want to know where to channel your resources to maximize production this may include demand and supply but you need the information to make that decision you need to know which departments in your organization is the most productive and which department is less productive which department needs more manpower which department needs less manpower and that way you are you you are able to efficiently allocate your resources to maximize not just the success rates the production and outputs so what are the types of data when we described data we did mention that data can be quantitative or qualitative now what is quantitative data basically quantitative data includes numbers values so it can be discrete which means you're looking at the counts or continuous when you're looking at the measure i know that's during my undergraduate days i struggled with understanding the difference between discrete and continuous values for me i always think they're all quantitative values so why classify them again but i've come to understand that interpreting them statistically is different slightly different so for discrete values or looking at frequencies while for continuous values you're looking at intervals and ratios during the um statistics section we'll dive a bit more into what these values mean but i'm going to give an example of discrete values so let's assume that you own a shop and you want to generate data and you want to generate discrete data what kind of data you're looking at so you're looking at the number of customers who bought a particular or different items from you again let's say you want to generate continuous values so you want to measure the height of everybody that has come into your shop so in in measuring you're looking at a range of numbers they would definitely contain some will contain fractions however in discrete that just counts and integers how about qualitative data so qualitative data can be arduino so odd now data may include it's a type of categorical value so another name for qualitative is categorical so it's a type of categorical value that contains information that can be ranked for example let's look at socioeconomic status of an individual so we have those that around as low income we have those that are run as middle income and we have those ranked as high income so this is an example of an ordinal data how about a nominal data can we think of anything so in nominal data you cannot rank it or you cannot order it so whichever order it appears is fine for example i want to ask let's look at sex for example we have let's say male and female can you rank male before female or can you rank the other before the other can you run female before male let's say we're looking at race are you going to say black race comes first white race comes second and the rest no if black fps fest is fast if black appears last with last there is no order to which you can write it so what are the data forms and this is the very interesting parts we find that almost everything around us contains data our name our telephone number date of bets postal codes where we've been to the news articles we read the news media will listen to and what have you contains importance data that we can harness you know and maximize it to actually make better decisions as we have discussed in the importance of data so these are the different forms of data and you'll be amazed at how much data that we give out without even knowing like for example we can look at our phone look at your your map your gps it has track of all the places that you have been to data sometimes we have this medical unhealth data that keeps track of our you know how many steps we've completed in a day how many calories with bonds and things like that sometimes even our posts our heart rates how about online consumption i've mentioned amazon before take a look at your shopping history your online consumption contains information about the brands that you patronize the type of products the designs the styles it also contains information about your shopping preferences which stores you prefer to shop from and your delivery address where do you how do you prefer to receive your products and let's talk about government data what kind of data does the government have about us so in the west here i know once a baby is delivered or born the government issues a best certificate that contains information about when the baby was born the name the name of the parents the time the weights and some things like that let's talk about the biometrics that we freely give out it contains information about us so these are the various ways of various forms of data now how do we source for these data so there are two main ways we can source for data so the first one is the primary so basically what primary data sourcing means is that you have to perform the experiments you have to perform the analysis you have to interview people you have to generate the data yourself and you can simply do that by looking around you count the number of pain you have in front of you if you work in a department how many computers does the department have we can even do a head count here we can see how many male are on this call how many female are on this call these are primary data because we are actually performing this interrogation or this you know this kind of analysis how about when we don't perform this but we still want the data yes we can source data that we do not generate and that brings us to secondary data sourcing so secondary data sourcing can be internal so if you work in an organization has collected data you can access that data external you can look outside your organization for data and there is no there is no limit to where you can source for data so i'm going to explain a bit more about these two types of data sourcing so for primary data we're looking at observation you recording what you observe you're looking at conducting survey you're looking at conducting interviews and recording them you're looking at performing experiments and recording your observations you're looking at conducting pools and also focus groups so the unique characteristics of primary data is that you are performing you are performing something how about secondary data so you can walk up to government agencies to request for information let's say for example you want to know the number of uh new buildings that are being erected in your location you can go to your regional and urban planning and ask for this information and they will provide you with it you didn't generate this information they did and they've offered you the information you can even make inquiries about you know working in to your health department to ask about important health issues and they'll provide you with their data another favorite for me the favorite place for me to source my data is through published materials so you can look at published sales for a company and extract information in one day i study data from that you can look at information published in the newspapers in research articles company brochures and orders again you can look at sales data from financial institutions from commercial institutions or you can look at databases now some databases are public some are private so for the public databases we refer to them as public repositories people generate this data and store them there for easy dissemination of information but just look at the tone of places where we can generate data from for me in the last six years i have not done any primary data collection i just wait for them to do it and i extract it and i use it to you know develop patterns and provide actionable insights into anything i'm looking at so what the laws governing data sharing now because i have explained to us how much data we generate and freely give out now people are becoming more sensitive and more concerned about what type of data companies institutions have about them so governments across the globe have enacted laws governing how to collect information how to use the information collected and how to share this information so be sure to you know look up laws and regulations in your location covering the collection use and um dissemination of data so to give an example in the u in the u.s for example there is this uh gram leaders act that governs personal information collected by banks and financial institutions so there was they will the law will set the criteria for the institutions to collect information the direction they can hold that information and what they can use that information for look at the general data protection regulation in the eu that governs the collection and use of interview of data by individuals and organizations i know that this is not exhaustive of the laws governing data sharing so before you begin to collect data for any particular purpose take some time to understand the rules and regulations the laws governing how you collect that data how long you collect that data what you use the data for how you use it and how you share this data and it's even is very important if you have collaborators that are not located within the same geographical location so so far we've learned a lot about data we've talked about data types so what about data formats this place i know a lot of people do why do we have data formats so there are so many reasons why we have classified different data into different formats and i hope that at the end of this presentation will understand that so here we have three classes we have the structured we have the semistructured and we have the um have the unstructured if we look at the structured data it looks organized we can actually look at the squares and say oh the uniform however if you look at the semistructured we can see some of them are uniform others are not but in the unstructured nothing is uniform it doesn't appear to mean a lot for the purpose of this presentation i'm going to show us an example of a structured data so look at this excel containing student information and their grade point aggregates by just looking at this i could tell that mary has the highest gpa how about if i present it in a semistructured way will i easily decode that from this especially when i have let's say 100 students obviously not it contains the same information as a table however in a different format now how about if i present this same information as unstructured data i'm writing to mary to say hey i just saw the results i i just saw the results a 4.0 gpa yeah imagine if i had to contact 10 100 students that means i have to write hundred emails individually to each of these students to say hey i just saw your gpa hey i just saw your gpa when i can easily present it as a table or even as a figure so i've already mentioned that there are different ways that we can present data i just mentioned table but i'm going to show us different ways of presenting data so let's say we conduct a pool right now and we ask everybody on this call to select their favorite colors let's say we have a thousand people on this call how do we know the color that is chosen the most well i say hi john you chose red mark you choose blue no how many times i have to say that for me to cover everybody when i could present that results and everybody will see it at the same time so how about i ask everybody in the pool to see select your vex color and then i compute the frequency of the colors and generates about a bar plots to present the results clay without wasting much time we could see that a particular color will win so this pool was conducted for children and they were asked to choose their favorite colors and then the frequency was computed from this bar plot i'm showing here we can see that most of the children choose yellow as their favorite color i don't need to know the names of the children that chose which color however i need to know that the children that were sampled chose yellow how about if i want to present more information on about plots let's say for example i want to look at the financial data of different councils let's say i have three councils in the uk but i want to look at their financial information in the first second and third quarter of the year how can i present this to an audience that they will understand immediately so that is what we call the group bar charts which i'm going to bring up here so here you see that the bar chart is color coded in such a way that a color is informative even though i'm looking at data from 2020 different quarters i could tell which council has or generated more revenue than the order so for example in the first quarter lincoln generated more revenue than the rest however in the second third and fourth quarter kent generated more revenue than the rest easy without having to read all the documents to picture this out i have presented this information to an audience that will understand with minimum efforts now this is the interesting part so let's say this many of us are students so let's say we want to make an argument or we want to make a case where our pocket money has to be increased so we're looking at data so let's assume that our monthly allocation or allowance from our parents or guidance is 200 and we want to increase this um amounts to maybe 400. remember for you to make a generic case you want to arm yourself with data so let's see how do you present this information to your parents or your guiding or guidance so you can generate a pie chart of expenses and that pie chart will contain the percentage of your money that goes into academics traveling housing so when you call your your parents or your guide and say hey i need an increase look i have this information here it's showing that i spend a lot of money on transports which means i don't have enough for my test books and this is the information this is the data i have collected over a three months period they'll be like oh okay you deserve it so let's say you want to know how much money you spend also in constructing your home let's say you have a million dollars to build the home and you want to know what proportion of this money is spent on actually building the house so you can see that you spend almost 25 percent paying people to do some work for you and you spent the least on buying timber how about we do another pool here and we sample people and ask them to choose the best fruits and then we want to present this information instead of a bar chart now we want to present it as a pie chart so you see it's possible for us to present the same information using different ways okay how about if we want to understand relationships between events for example how about if we choose to look at incidents of measles in the u.s over time so we're looking at from 1930 up to 2000 you can see that across the 50 states of of the us you can track the incidence of measles there is a there is a color legend that tells you the number of incidents per 1000 or 100 000 actually and you can use information like this to say oh no i'm not going to a particular state because there is higher incidence of measles in that state compared to the other states and again if you're presenting this to me as reasons why you you're making that decision it's easy for me to follow to say oh okay i understand now so you don't have to move so the task i'm going to give to all of us now is for us to take a moment and think about other ways if possible put it in the chats other ways of presenting data to an audience i'm gonna give us about one minute to do that then we can proceed okay so okay so just to recap so we've described the importance of data we've discussed the types of data quantitative and qualitative we also mentioned the forms of available data and data sources we've also discussed the laws governing the collection of data and sharing of information we mentioned the different data formats and how to present our data so i'm just going to give us a quick break one second so that we can all relax and then we can move on so introducing the next section so i've introduced us to basic concepts in statistics and why it's kind of important for us to understand these concepts before we i mean as data scientists as scientists as anybody we find out that we perform statistics in our everyday life how we count the balance when we go to the store we count how much balance we received if that's the correct balance we're expecting your accounts money to give to somebody they might not seem like a lot but what we're actually doing is that we're performing some statistics right so what is statistics to start with so statistics is concerned with developing is concerned with developing and studying methods for collecting analyzing interpreting and presenting data so let's take a moment and reflect the last time we performed any statistics you might be surprised that it might be as recent as just some minutes ago so what are the types of statistics or statistical analysis there are a number of them but for the purpose of this presentation i'm going to stick to just two so the first one is descriptive statistics so descriptive statistics tries to answer the characteristics of the respondents so when i give you a data set and i ask you to perform the descriptive statistics i'm trying to what i'm asking you to do is describe the characteristics of the data i've given to you you can start by checking the number of rows the number of columns and tell me oh the data contains 10 rows and 20 columns it could be inferential which is what are the characteristics of the population that you're looking at it could be just the differences what is the difference between a and b i know we do that a lot it could be associative so what you're asking here is is a related to be or not or it could predict it could be predictive so you're trying to predict an unknown value because you know one or two more values so for the purpose of this presentation i'm going to stick to descriptive and inferential statistics so before we continue i just want to clarify here that there are so many ways of performing statistical analysis and there are so many packages that you can use packages i mean software applications so for those of them for those of us that are really really into quantitative and qualitative studies so there is this tool called mask max qda is a very useful tool for quantitative and qualitative analysis i'm sure many of us are familiar with python this is the language of data scientists r as well most people prefer r for data visualization i'm going to stick to r for the purpose of this presentation excel 2 is a very powerful tool for performing statistical analysis i'm sure many of us have used excel at one point or the other there is spss there is sql for those that query databases to generate information that is for those that also perform qualitative analysis and recently um power bi and tableau has emerged as important visualization tools for organizations so that's why i brought in tableau here so let us do some coding in our and see how easy it is to actually perform some of these statistics so i'm sure many of us can see my scripts so the purpose of this brief our tutorial is to show us some of the things that we can do with r in terms of computing the descriptive and influential statistics i'm not going to go into the principle behind each of these statistics it's beyond the scope of this particular presentation but i am happy to answer specific questions that we may have so i'm going to use this data iris iris is an imbued data with our package anybody can access it if you have any other programming language so i'm just going to import it into this work environment and yep sorry guys yes and we can look at the data it contains information about fishes so there are different species of fish here and then it's measuring the lengths the widths this spiral length and petal lengths spar whips and spout and petal weights across different species we can see there are about three of them now this is one of my favorite data so in descriptive statistics there are two types i did mention to us so the first one measures central tendencies so by central tendencies we mean the mean the median and the mode so let's look at this data for example and let us look at the lens this power length so we want to understand what is the mean of this power line across these three species it's very easy for us to compute that we can easily just ask the mean function to help us if we run this function here we know that the mean is about five point eight three threes and it wants to round this number up we can round it up so five points it's four for this particular length that we're showing here so for the length here the mean of this length is about 5.8 how about the median so the median is the center or the middle number basically we can also generate that results and we see that 5.8 is not just the mean but also the median now as they take home i would want us on our own to try and compute the mean the max the variance the standard deviation and the range of this particular data of this particular column sparling okay there are also other ways of generating these descriptive statistics without having to compute them individually let's say for example i just want to look at that column and then generate most of this information i can use the summary function in r and i will know that the mean is 4.30 and the max is 7.90 i could tell that the mean is 5.843 and the median is 5.80 so with just one function i'm able to generate most of the descriptive statistics that i have mentioned there is still also a different package or a different library in r that i can use and generate the same information but here i generated the information across the entire data so i had four columns contains quantitative values and here you can see i know what the standard deviation for each of these columns are i know what they mean is i know the median i know the sum i know the range so why is this important why are we talking about this sometimes like i did explain once you have data before you you want to look at your data you want to make sense out of your data you want to understand whether the data is well formatted or not and the best way to do that is to generate summary statistics for that data so let's assume that i have some missing values it will occur here but because i didn't have any missing values it's showing as zero so that way i know that if i perform any statistical analysis on any of the columns here a war on because there are no missing values now how about if we want to visualize this let's say for that for example we still go back to this at the spiral lens and then we want to generate a histogram to show the range of information contained within this column we can simply do that and you can see that we know from here we know what the frequency of each of the values are we know that the highest frequency occurred between 6.0 and 6.5 okay and we can begin to present data in a more concise and interactive way we can begin to look at this data and begin to make sense oh okay so more people chose this more people didn't choose this we can begin to see patterns immediately how about if i want to present the central tendencies using the box plots again remember that we talked about the mean and median being at 5.8 look at this here look we know where the range is we know that this is the maximum value and this is the minimum value it still corresponds to the information that we have presented here but here and here next we want to look at we want to look at another way of presenting this across the different species this time around we want to look at the relationship between this uh lens across the different species in our data so here i can tell you categorically that data contained in virginica has a well i say it's more actually compared to data collected for the other species you can also see that the mean and the median is even higher it's about 6.5 compared to this with 5.0 and 6.0 so we can begin to see the patterns by just looking at the central tendencies alone we're having to do any much statistics and this is some of i mean when we look at obligations these are some of the results that presents to us you know to support their findings how about if we want to look at relationships obviously i have generated a box plot sorry scatter plots but what does this tell us not much but this plot can be enhanced to show us the relationship you know between the petal lens and the super lens in this data or across the different species so let's say i want to color coded and i want each species to have a different color and i want to visualize these results i believe that this is more visually appealing to us we can begin to see relationships again so we know that this group doesn't really associate well with this group and we can begin to see this pattern and again look at this notice that i have presented the same information using different means okay and we can do a lot more visualizing data using different different patterns different techniques but the end goal is to communicate the idea to an audience and to make the information clear enough so i'm going to pause for a minute so that we can assimilate what we've had so far and then we'll move forward okay so when we talked about different types of statistical analysis we mentioned inferential analysis as looking at the characteristics of a population so we're going to use the same data to do that now there are different ways of performing inferential statistical analysis the most common are the t tests and the anova the ttest basically tests between two groups so you're looking at information shared between two groups and anything more than two groups the ttest is no longer valid you're looking at anova so when you have two groups and you want to compare the mean of the two groups you're looking at eighty tests so let's say for example we want to we want to compare the mean heights of participants in africa compared to the rest of the world we have two groups so we're looking at ttests however let's say we want to compare the mean heights for participants in three different continents so we're looking at africa we're looking at america and we're looking at europe we can no longer use the ttests to perform this type of analysis so the ttest tests or compares the mean within two groups or two samples okay and there are different types of ttests so you have the one sample t test so one sample t test is when you're comparing just the mean of the population to a standard or you have two sampled ttests and then you have the paired ttests so we'll talk a little bit more about them in a minute so but before then before we perform a ttest there is there are some assumptions about the ttest that has to be met before we select what type of t test we have to perform so one of these assumptions is that i've already mentioned it has to be two treatments another important thing is that it has to be normally distributed that means you're going to go for a parametric t tests so when the data is normally distributed you go for a parametric t test when the data is not normally distributed there are a few things that you can do which is actually beyond the scope of this workshop but i'll just mention it so one of them is to transform the data by transforming it could be log 10 or not 2 transformation and then check again to see if the data is not normally distributed and if it is not then you have to perform a nonparametric ttest for the purpose of this particular workshop i'm going to stick to the parametric ttests so the first thing i'm going to do is to check for normality just to check if the data is normally distributed and again i'm going to use just a column of the data that we've read into r and i'm going to use two methods to check for normality so the first one is the shapiro tests which is an arrow function that calculates and tells you a pvalue to make that decision whether your data is normally distributed or not so and i'll explain the results in a minute and then the second one is a histogram where you visually look at your data and decide if it is normally distributed so i'm going to go ahead and show that now right so the first test is the shapiro test now for you to make a decision that your values or your data is normally distributed then the team the pvalue has to be greater than uh it has to be greater than 0.05 in our case here by looking at this we can estimate that this data is normally distributed it's not perfect but we can't because i already know this data so i can estimate that this data is normally distributed and i'm happy to proceed with um et tests but let's assume that there is no data here and this data is located here which means that even if i transform it i do not get a dumbbell shape or i cannot put a dumbbell curve across these points then i will begin to think about using a different type of ttest which is the nonparametric test which i won't be covering here now let's be practical here so let's say we want to know i did mention we want to know the mean heights of individuals on this call and we know that the standard or the assumed standard of heights should be let's say seven feet so when we when we measure everybody's height in on this call we want to make sure that the mean is equal to seven so our high our null hypothesis would be that there is no difference while our alternate hypothesis will be that there is a difference there are two ways we can do that so we can either perform a onesided test just check basically if the heist that we've measured is greater or lower than the standard which i have discussed or we can do the twosided to see if there is any difference whatever the difference is whether higher or lower so i'm going to show us the result of these two analysis so in the first case in the first case we have um we have the results of the onesided ttests and it's telling us what happened okay so it's telling us that the difference the pvalue is about 2 to the power 16 that means the true mean is not equal to 27. so what about if we change this true mean to say 5 for example so let's just say we change this mean to just five and we perform this analysis again it's going to tell us that the alternate hypothesis is true because the true mean is greater than 5 it's 5.8 so if we make the true mean exactly this number here then it's going to tell us that there is no difference so let's just do this so that we can see that as well so it's telling us the alternate hypothesis is not true the true mean is not equal to this and it's computing the test statistics for us so this way we can compare the mean of our heights to the standards that we know and this can be applicable to so much as to so many types of data and scenarios so if you was let's say for example you you actually collected some financial information and you want to see that the stock the mean stock over this week is equal to a particular standard that you have set say hundred and then you computed the information and then you check the mean to your standard and compare it it will tell you if there is any difference or not so how about if we want to look at more than just one um category so we're trying to look at this the lens but this time around we're looking at it across the different species so we're going to look at um the two sample t tests so here we have the assumption is that it has to be two samples remember but in the data that i presented we have three species which means it's more than two already that means ttest will not work however because i want to show us how to perform this type of ttest i did subset the data so that i can only extract only two categories or two species you can choose any species you want and then i'm going to show that and then i'm going to show the t tests so first of all i'm showing here that i've only gotten data from two species so i have omitted the data from the third specie secondly i've been able to compute the same information the same test statistics as i did here but this time around without any specif without specifically telling it's the standard so i am comparing the mean across these two species to see if there is a difference between the heights or the lens sorry across these two species we can do that again we can look at individuals on this core and we can say the mean heights so we cut we're comparing the mean heights of male versus female participants in this call note that i did not tell it's what the standard should be it's just looking at the two means and then it will tell us if the male or the female participants are taller or their mean height is greater or less than the other how about when we have all three all three uh species and want to compare across all three of them it's still possible to do that but note that it is not going to be the ttest it has to be an anova similar to the ttest the anova has its own assumptions which i won't be covering in this workshop but again one of the criteria is that you have to check for normality is the data normally distributed or not note that there are two ways you can do that you can use the sh the function call or you can use the histogram some researchers and some data scientists have encountered prefer to use the shapiro tests because sometimes they don't want to output anything they just want to know that it's there it's working they embed it in their function call however you can always do that because it's always good to be conscious so that you don't make um statistical predictions that are not true because you've omitted a particular step now for the anova it has to be more than two um treatments that you're comparing so in the case of anova we're going to look at the three species simultaneously and we're going to look at the lengths across these three species another thing is this anova works especially in air by developing a linear model what does that linear model mean is trying to establish a linear relationship between the lines in the different species so the first thing i would do if i'm to generate an anova statistics is to generate a model okay and then i can output the anova model so that we can see and then call the anova function on the module so basically what i have access is is there any difference in the length similar to what i would have asked the t tests and it's telling me that there is a difference the p value here is 1.6 to the power minus 31 which means that there is a very significant difference between the length across these species if there was no difference with topup dance however as data scientists you don't just tell people oh there is a difference the question is where is the difference how do i identify the difference so there is what we call the post talk tests for anova you do you perform the post hoc test to identify exactly where the difference is some other people prefer to use a box plot sometimes it's not always obvious in the box plots so i'm going to show us that method i'm going to show us that we can present the same information as a post talk and as a box plots so first of all we have to perform a tricky hsd test and here we can look at from here you can see that there is a difference here so there's difference between this group and the difference is greater compared to the rest of the group now we can represent the same information in the box plots look at it we can tell that there is difference between these two and the difference between this virginica and basic color is not as much as the difference between virginica and septusa and again we could represent this information in our posthoc tests and in our box plots there are also other types of um statistical analysis that we can perform inferential analysis some of them may include things like linear regression linear regression is not far from what we've done here by generating scatter plots the only difference is that we needed to put a line of best fits and generate the the linear equation so it is very similar so the beauty of it is this take home message from me there are a thousand and one ways that you can present information the same information once you know the audience that you want to capture that you can tell on your presentation to them for example if you're dealing with people in the industry they want a pictorial representation of anything that you're telling them not tables not chats they want to see the patterns they want to see how you arrived at your conclusions at the glance they don't want you to know the computational aspect number two statistics is very simple and straightforward once you understand the basic principles and concepts you will find out that they will become very handy as you advance and for a biologist like myself diving a lot into statistics it tells a lot half of all the experiments even though we perform them in the wet lab we try to substantiate or draw inferences based on statistical values not just necessarily what we obtained in the lab the same for every sector of you know of the economy and our lives when people conduct interviews and compile them they also find a way to present them in form of numbers frequencies and patterns so no matter how far or how wide we go statistics is a part is an integral part of the society and the earlier we embrace it the better for us so just to recap and then i would take the questions so so we've introduced the different types of statistical analysis we've mentioned different applications that facilitate statistical analysis and we've presented some examples of descriptive and inferential statistics so i am happy to answer any questions that we may have all right thank you austin thank you uh let me i know that we had a few from uh about like an hour ago but hopefully the person's still around iveta i think uh the name is ivetta um compromising wrong really sorry uh her the question was i'm about to start my master's degree in data science and analytics analytics in the uk i'm worried about not being able to find good data for my final final dissertation project any tips yeah so that's a very good question now the the tip i'm gonna ask is first of all define the scope of what analysis you want to perform so the scope will guide you in your search for data there is something out there it might not be perfect but when you have a clearly defined scope then you don't have to look everywhere you know where to look okay so i guess the advice is make sure that your scope is defined properly and that will help you make sure that the data you're collecting or the data you're using is the the right kind i guess since the person is worried about quality of the data i guess i'm finding good data for the dissertation um okay uh send it had a question is i started studying software engineering this year uh will this lecture be helpful i asked the user they were going to use data and they said i'm in my third year i will have to choose oh in my third year in software engineering i'll have to choose a specialization which could be data science so i guess what they're asking more is um i guess that the question in general is should they go focus in data science if they are studying software engineering and they have to uh focus in one particular area i guess you're biased because you do data so of course you're gonna say yes but uh maybe you can explain a little bit of the different fields actually so software engineering is broad no doubts there are so many aspects to it but again one thing that they need to understand is that no matter what software you write your results your conclusions are still going to be based on data and statistics somebody needs to put in some numbers into your software and get results that will be convincing so data science is an integral aspect of software engineering no matter how little you want to dive into it for someone for me i like numbers so for someone like me i would want to specialize in numbers more i would like to specialize in numbers more because that way i can i can actually derive a lot more information so i will encourage her to go and there are lots of job opportunities as well in data science i think that uh uh i've heard other data scientists explain that a main focus of data even if you don't work with it every day is that you need to show your work and a lot of times when you're talking to your manager or your boss and you're trying to maybe get a new project off the ground or get resources for a new idea they will often ask why and how are you showcasing that this is important and if you're able to collect the right data and present it in a way that is compelling and that is useful uh it facilitates that sort of conversation where you say well here's the data and here is what we see that's why i think we should invest more in this or that's why i think we should put more effort into that area or this area so i know that that's a big argument for everyone to learn sql for example or to learn uh the basics of data visualization yep john you're actually correct i mean if you remember during the course of my presentation when i talked about ways of presenting data i made a case for somebody going to their parents or guardian to ask for more money it's similar to this case so if you want to if you want to ask for a new project or change the direction of your project based on information you have you need to you need to have something warm substantive so you need to have something that they can visualize and identify without you having to explain anything and that's the power of data visualization so if you are yourself with the right figures from the right information you can get any projects you know started so yes it's really important i know i had a math professor in high school that said statistics was really hard because you can always make the data say whatever you wanted to say uh if you start changing the data or only looking at certain data visualizations but in a particular way he said you know if if the if a study came out that said that the last car in a train is the most dangerous then someone would say well we just have to remove the last car but there's always going to be a last car so it's kind of it's a simple example of like how sometimes you will come up with conclusions and you have to make sure that you know data will always tell your story it's just making sure that you're asking the right questions and that you know what you're answering exactly so yeah that's that brings you back to statistics like you said you can beat the data and the more you beat it the more information you get out but what is the quality of that information is the right kind of information you're getting out or the wrong kind of information i'll give an example so let's say for let's say for example we want to track the devastation um devastation pattern in a particular country now we've collected data across the country and then you analyze a portion where there is less fascination and then you make a conclusion that oh the vaccination rate in this country is low it's the same data but you've only analyzed a portion of the data and you've made a generalistic conclusion which is biased now i know that that happens a lot with uh political intention right like sometimes they would say um sometimes there might there might be some statistics in the news that say the the intention to vote is 60 40 this way or that way and then you look at the fine print and you'll realize that they are extrapolating out of maybe 3 000 questions that they had in a souvenir in a survey or something like 3 000 people are deciding uh how the intention of vote is for an entire country like i know that that it can be difficult sometimes to understand how small amounts of data can uh project so much well that brings us to the other type of data that i didn't cover in this context so i did mention something about predictive data analysis so let's talk about that a bit more let's say we have information about a certain group of let's say we have a certain information about a certain geographical location their voters and we've sampled say 3000 like you said but we know that within this demography this 3000 replace represents you know independence groups within that by independent group i mean independent clusters so let's say for example you have the location and then you have the blacks the hispanic and whatever ethnic group and then you sample each one of them so it's the full representation of the population because you have samples from each one of them and then they all say something so let's say 60 percent says they're getting false so you're going to make that assumption because you have a representation of the demographic but it's not always correct so that brings sometimes people you know double it between population and sample studies but how do you get everybody to say something very difficult not possible so we what if the data is tainted right what if you were paying them a hundred dollars for replying to your survey like then you have other biases right you know if you coerced an answer [Laughter] in the survey i i think that there usually is some some followed way to top these yes so but then there is always going to be the tendency for bias however you do what you can to minimize it and you minimize it by asking the right type of questions and collecting the right type of data i don't know if that makes sense to you so let's go back to the voting population if you go to yeah sorry uh sorry for interrupting i was just looking at the chat and uh yvette actually had another question that uh that might be related to this where we were talking about the types of data and how to collect it and the question was if you have any advice for applying for jobs as a data scientist and i guess this kind of like wraps into the idea of what data you want to work with what you're interested in i would imagine that you can be a data scientist in the weather forecast right looking at the predictive models of storms you can be a data scientist in medicine or environment in biomedical like you are um do you uh do you have any thoughts on like how someone with a background in data science focus finds the right data to work with or explores different fields as a professional yeah actually i do so the first thing i would suggest is to ask the person what he or she likes because you start from your likes for me i love biology so even though i work in data science i always tell my finest was biology but again i do some teaching and some of my students actually are finance students so when i teach them i have to tell it to finance so for them they're coming to data science but their intention is to make financial predictions now once you answer that question what do you love what motivates you that the next question you're going to answer is what are the skills i need to achieve it because data science is very broad some people will tell you python is the way forward and some people will tell you oh no hold on ah even people that do advanced exam will tell you is the way to go so when you identify what you like and identify what you need to do or what skills you need to gain to act to accomplish that then you're good did uh did you mention excel people use excel for advanced uh what's in uh what's in the the uk last year when they had a crash in their systems because they were tracking vaccinations through an excel sheet and it maxed out on the number of rows they could echo track yeah so that happened last year it was kind of embarrassing and fascinating at the same time because some people's databases are actually a collection of excel files i don't know okay this is usually wrong it's not it's not a problem with excel it's a problem with the implementation exactly so they can tell you oh sam what did he say no i was i was confirming like go on i was confident oh okay so yes some it's kind of weird what people call databases this you can actually have um an office document that contains you know lines of information and then you say this is my database and nobody's to query you but yes okay uh sam do you have any other questions for the guests today um well um augustine you you really were like this is really detailed um if i hadn't made it switch to software i would i would just say no data science all the way because you you were really specific and you spoke broadly about on the topic of data and why data is important and how it costs across every field i did have a question about how to handle bias but during the course of our conversation you kind of like you know talked spoke about that i i don't see any more questions on youtube so um i would love to thank everyone who found time to be here again i'd love to thank um the code academy hq team love to thank fed love to thank you our honored um guest we are we're so grateful on behalf of from code academy hacker chapter thank you for finding the time um it is we started very early your time which is around pm not everyone would want to do that um you have indeed shown that you are truly altruistic as regards education and talking about data i believe i mean in the long run moving forward that legacy will live on your love for data and your love for talking about data and educating people so just want to say thank you on behalf of cool academy for hackers yeah thank you no problem we love it uh you know any information that we can gather i mean augustine knows his stuff and i'm sure there's a lot of people that are gonna watch this other live today or in the future they're gonna come to your channel and they're gonna they're gonna have a lot of questions that i'm sure that augustine is answering already before they even ask the questions so that's great we're pre preemptively answering questions on data science uh i think before we leave uh augustine i don't know someone was wondering if the jupyter notebook that you were using has an example that's available publicly or maybe there's some way that they can reach to you or contact you so they can get some of those examples uh if they reach through some i will be able to get it to some my problem okay perfect so if you want to get access to ice yeah i saw that and i was thinking that um yeah i was thinking that augustine could send it to me and i see you fed which um you can include in the description in the youtube description um like okay yeah we can uh we can definitely include uh a link to the pork court chapter and then if anyone wants to reach out to you they can just use the chapters page to send you an email or contact you great well i guess that wraps it up for today thank you everybody for stopping by and we'll see you in the next live stream right okay bye everybody like
