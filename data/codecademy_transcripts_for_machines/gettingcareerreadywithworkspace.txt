hello everyone i think we are live give us a couple of seconds to confirm that um get refreshed my youtube page cool all right um hi everyone uh welcome to this tutorial slash workshop about workspaces um my name is alex i'm a curriculum manager at code academy and i'm here with jamie hey everyone um so yeah welcome uh we're streaming this on a couple of places right now um twitter facebook youtube there's a zoom webinar where you can ask questions so uh we want this to be as interactive as possible so feel free to write in the chat um at any of those places i'm mostly looking at youtube right now but i will try to look at the other other places as well um and then as always these streams will be up on youtube after the fact so if you're watching this um in the future welcome uh maybe you can leave a comment on the youtube video um in this stream we are really gonna kind of highlight one of the new features that uh we just put out at codecademy workspaces and to talk about really what is the best way to use them and how to use them to get career ready um so cool let's go and go ahead and get started i am going to share my screen um window all right jamie how does that look it's good i can see the code category homepage cool okay so uh what we're here to talk about is uh our new workspace feature which really we kind of see as an extension of uh kind of the the journey through codecademy where so far we've done a lot of here's a lesson here's a project you're learning new topics but we don't really have anything that can help you build practical experience that might help you reach a job or really have anything that you can directly show to recruiters or uh send links to people to show your work and so that's that's one of the things that we want to show off with workspaces so workspaces exist uh here on my homepage i've uh if you scroll down a little bit you will find a place for your workspaces i've already made a couple uh uh in prepping for this this stream um but you can go ahead and see all of them and workspaces are really a place where you can write whatever code you want so i'm going to go ahead and create a new one and just kind of show you how this process works when you create a new workspace you you have um a lot of different languages that you can choose from uh i'll go ahead and create a new python workspace and so here we are this is it um this is this is a place where we start you with a python file when you hit the save and run button it's going to run that active file in this case using python because i chose chosen to be a python workspace and you can upload new files or new folders or rather you can create new files or new folders and that is that is what a workspace is and so i think one thing that's interesting is that this is kind of a blank slate and people don't really know where to start and so i think that one of the purposes of this stream is to really um kind of give you advice on how you can use this feature in a way to help make you job ready and help you build experience and help you build things that you can show off to the jobs that you're applying for um jamie any uh any takes on that to begin with how would you how might you use something like a workspace to become more job ready or to build something to show off to your employer yeah so i feel like one of the ways i have used the workspaces before is like sometimes when i'm working on a code counting project that's of interest to me um sometimes i want to like expand on it um or also if i'm like working on something in like a lesson exercise i might want to expand on that so what i'll do is i'll like copy and paste my code from whatever um project or lesson exercise i'm working on and i'll bring that code into a workspace and then i'll just like expand on it there and make sure i have it saved um and within where like the rest of my code is so i can keep it organized um i think it's like very useful for that um and like for instance um yesterday i was working on a code challenge um which is like something else you might talk about in this uh stream and yeah i just like have it like over in my workspace um in python so it's just like helpful to keep it there yeah nice i think that um yeah that those are two great examples i have i'll show off the workspaces that i've created i created four different ones that are all kind of doing something different that might help you get might help give you an idea on how to do it um before i show off the ones that i've created already i want to kind of just point out some of the some of the features of a workspace that might not be immediately obvious um again let me let me actually run some code here uh so i can do uh this is python so a equals one plus one bring to a and run my code there we go um like i said i can create um as many files as i want as many folders as i want um this is kind of creating folders and files is probably um something that's for someone who's like creating a pretty big project like i could see for a web development project where you really where the file structure is really important where um you know creating folders and nesting folders within folders and all that good stuff is really relevant um so that's something to kind of keep an eye out for for a bigger web development project i'll just demo that if i create a second uh file dot py here we go here's my other file um that's basic that's you know creating new files uh and running your code um something that's also really useful is being able to title these again if we look at if we look at my workspaces you'll see that i had created four and now with now i've just created a fifth common title and i've created four between uh before this session so being able to title your workspaces to kind of jump right back into um whatever whatever project you want to show up show off or whatever skill you want to remind yourself of titling those is really important so we can do um live stream demo um let's see uh the get unstuck feature i think is actually um fairly cool one of the things that we put in here is uh cheat sheets for the specific language that you're working in so again i'm working in a python workspace right now and so we've linked you to all of our different python cheat sheets which you can kind of think of as a very very abbreviated version of the in this case the python 3 course so you can see basically the the highlights of that course um let's see if i look at a html css workspace take a look at the cheat sheets that exist there um so that's a really useful resource to have again kind of that problem of like i think a lot of a lot of people will see this and be like this is great that this exists but i don't even know where to start or i'm going to start a project i'm going to get instantly stuck and so i think these cheat sheets are a great resource to have right at your fingertips to be able to jump back to um at any time so again this is from the html css javascript workspace we give you access to those cheat sheets and then finally um another thing that exists in these community forum uh in the in the uh what do we call this the get unstuck uh tab are the community forums so this is just a link to the forum and we really encourage you if you're making a workspace and want to get feedback on it we're going to show you how to make you the link to your workspace publicly available and then you can come in here and again if i'm working in a python workspace maybe i come into section of the forums um create a post saying i just created this workspace working on this project or whatever it happens to be and it's really easy to get feedback on your specific project that you're working on people can go in there see the code play around with the code that um that you were working on without messing up your own version of the code um and give you feedback on it so hopefully we uh or we hope that the um the forums are a really great resource for sharing your code um jamie any questions from the youtube chat that you want me to touch on right now and jamie i lost your audio sorry i muted um i think someone asked if you can nest files i think what they mean by that is like if you can like like how deep you can build your folder structure um i was actually going to try to see that myself but yeah let's see um i think you can nest uh so i just created a folder um so my and in fact let me jump back to my live stream demo um so i don't mess up that other workspace that i had i think that you can nest infinitely deeply so um so these two files script.ui and secondfile.py are at the base level just in this livestream demo folder and then i can put another file in there and then let's see if i put another folder in there yep so folder two is inside folder one uh and so you can definitely make as complex of a of a file structure as as you need um yeah and then we also have um someone had a question about like sharing um so when can we share the workspace to someone who doesn't have a codecademy account or do they have um an account great question let me let me show off sharing to begin with and then i can try to tackle some of the details of like accounts i believe uh if they have a free account you should be able to share um to share workspace and they'll have access to them um but we can test out what happens if uh if they are not logged into a code academy account as well um sharing in general um is is super cool i think you know codecademy has a lot of these places where you can run live code like if you're working in a lesson or if you're working in a project right you can create an awesome project but the issue is that that's tied specifically to your account so it's like if you sent that url to your friend and said hey check out this this cool project that i just did on codecademy um that wouldn't work right it would send them to the version of the project which is blank for them because they've never worked on it and so previously we haven't really had a great way for you to set say look at the code that i wrote run my code comment my code edit my code play around with my code as much as you want and so that is now all changed with workspaces where let me jump to one of my cooler demos um in fact it's this this visualization one um delete that folder that i created um this this was a uh so this is technically a website this is an html and javascript file i made this for a machine learning class that i made a while ago um and the code is like kind of hidden behind the scenes and i don't think any learners have ever really seen it um if you're interested in taking that course i can drop a link to it uh later um it's a cool visual visualization that explains this machine learning thing um but the point being is that it was kind of hard for me to share this code with people um i can now do that really easily by creating this workspace um going up to share you can make it private or public so right now it's private so if i were to share this url with people um they wouldn't have access to it i believe it just 404s but they basically they don't have access to it but if i make this public i can now share this link with anyone i'm going to drop this link in the youtube chat and hopefully that works um and jamie you can uh you can click on it yourself to see if it works um let me check my zoom chat to see if my zoom people are saying anything cool um cool and so uh again that's kind of the point there's a there's a link in that zoom chat right now that can take you exactly to this project um i'll admit that this project is not super uh reader friendly like none of my code is commented uh and and you know uh i'm sure that i'm sure i could clean up this code a lot before actually sharing it with people um and so uh but you know you can have access to it i see ryan in the chat says i need to sign in um you i i suppose that uh you need a free account to access these um and if anyone else codecademy is watching that can confirm um that a free account will be all that you need to access that um that would be great um cool so that's that's kind of one use case that we see for um for these workspaces is that it's really easy to share the share code that's like viewable by someone else or runable by someone else they can instantly start playing around with it and so you can kind of imagine having a bunch of these different links um that you could set that you could either put on your personal website and that gives people really easy access to like looking at your real code and running it or you know just sharing this link with if you're in an interview and you're trying to land a job sharing this link it's a really easy way to explain the projects that you've been working on without like showing them your github account and them having to read the code or fork the code or you know download the code um themselves so it's a nice way to like really quickly show off the projects that you've been working on and explain your code um which is which is a really important step when you're when you're trying to land land jobs um that's one use case for workspaces the other ones that i think are really interesting um are kind of creating your own cheat sheet so the example i built for this was i titled the list indexing notes um i even do this myself when creating content for codecademy where i'll just have to remind myself how certain syntax works so um you know i'm creating content i forget the exact uh mechanics of uh you know if i print out the first through third element of this list is that gonna include the third element or not and i you know i know i could do that on my own computer locally i could like open the terminals start like write a python file run the code but it's like kind of a pain in the butt to be doing all that and i've actually found myself that i've been using this for like let me just get a get a workspace up and running super quickly that i can kind of test this out on so this is the example that i built um if you're going through your courses on codecademy or somewhere else and you just want to basically write notes for yourself again you could have done that in lessons but it's hard to remember like oh yeah in the lesson on that first exercise i didn't do what the exercise said and i like played around with with list indexing kind of hard to remember that and so with workspaces you can really just create these like note documents of let me remind let me just keep having this document be around forever that is reminding me how list indexing work works um so i think that's a really cool uh i think that's a really cool use case of workspaces um jamie any thoughts on on that one i'm uh i feel like i'm talking to mile a minute uh no i agree that is also definitely something i do during exercises like i'll try to see if there's different ways or you can pass a specific checkpoint um and like i think being able to like organize those different ways is like a pretty fun idea yeah yeah i just love the idea of like you could do this with so many different topics of like i'm going through my javascript course and i'm learning this new topic i've gone through the lesson and i understand it but let me like put it into my own words let me let me like highlight the things that i think are important or the things that are tricky for me let me throw all of that stuff into a workspace and now that will just like live on my home codecademy profile forever that i can that i can look at whenever i need to refresh myself on it um another another use case for this is kind of what jamie has said before where um what we've been looking at so far is um creating your own project or creating your own notes off of a lesson but i think workspaces are also a great place to expand existing codecademy projects so if you're if you're working on a codecademy project you're in that project format you have the instructions on the left hand side you've kind of done everything that they've asked them to do but you want to spin that off and make it your own thing again a good a good way to put something in your portfolio that that is your own thing that you kind of were creative with and came up with on your own um workspaces are a great way to do that um copy that code over from the project put it in a workspace and then um start playing around with it start sharing it with people and you can really kind of develop that into your own project that they can show off for interviews uh this is an example of uh this is a connect four project that's at the uh that's at the back end of again a machine learning class um where two a i play connect four against each other um so i got to the the project gets you to this point um but now there's so many different directions that you can take this you can turn this into your own project and again it's kind of this this set up place where um it's super easily shareable so once this really becomes its own unique thing um be a great thing to share um for job opportunities um and then finally sorry i'm looking at chat here to see if there's anything worth saying um finally uh another use case for workspaces is practicing for technical interviews and we actually have another feature that will help out with this that i am going to very briefly demo in a second but that was my fourth example here um the knapsack problem uh this is a pretty common interview question and so this is a kind of using workspaces to model that technical interview of someone giving you a uh a technical question and then a blank file to write the solution in and tells you to go um this is a good way to model just like testing yourself on that create a new workspace um find a problem uh find a technical interview problem um and use the workspace to try to solve that problem so this is this is our attempt at solving the knapsack problem um which is a big crazy technical interview problem um you might be thinking how do i even find those problems um that is what this other new feature is that uh literally hours ago was was released if you look in the resources tab you will find challenges which is a big list of technical interview problems so um that's kind of uh if you're watching this stream uh you may be literally some of the first people on codecad playing around with uh this this new beta product that we that we put out um but again workspaces is a great place to um really kind of emulate that technical interview experience of like here's the problem uh here's a blank file um try to try to write some code that solves the problem um cool jamie any uh any questions you think would be useful to uh to talk about uh well people have been giving a lot of love to the projects you've shown i think they're really cool and i agree um i think i've been addressing most questions in the chat um i guess someone asked if this is a pro feature so did we do we figure out if you can access like the workspaces um whether you are a free subscriber or pro subscriber um i believe that you can do it as a free subscriber but i can check in on that and post the answer like in the comments of this youtube video or something um let's see uh jamie you created a data science one which we wanted to show off yeah i can try pulling that up i can send you the link let's see um i actually i got it oh perfect so again this is an example of um kind of the shareability of uh workspaces where you can see at the top here this is a workspace from jamie that he has made publicly available he shared the link with me and so i can now open this up um this is more of a data science project so you can see that i'm looking at a csv file here so even though this is a python workspace you can add whatever files that you want to this uh this file system so we've added a csv file and then this python file is opening up the csv file um doing some uh data science stuff on it uh jamie do you do you know the details of uh of what's going on in this one um so this is actually written by sophie um who's some of you may uh you probably would recognize her if you watch live streams a lot um so she this is a it's like part two hypothesis testing project so i think what's going on here is there's um some data on like there's some heart disease data and basically i think they're doing some like hypothesis testing to see like if you like if you like if you're likely to have like whatever specific heart disease um given like um some data about like a given individual um yeah very well commented much better than my code this is actually a project you can find in the data science um career path and also i think on masters to the master stats uh skill path which are both very great paths i recommend anyone to take them um yeah and also a really awesome project um as are all the projects she creates jamie i imagine that kind of a common question might be like how do i even think of projects to to work on like again you can you can use codecademy projects using workspaces where we'll we'll give you instruction and we can like lead you on but um do you have advice on like i want to make my own project i've opened up this workspace i know that it's a it's a empty canvas i can make a million cool things by just like don't know where to start how how would you tackle that kind of uh question so i think it would kind of depend on where you are in your coding journey so like i feel like the first thing i did like i don't know like i think like five or six or so years ago um or like i don't even know the numbers at this point like when i first log into code academy i just kind of started off by like taking like a bunch of courses and trying to see like what is actually interesting to me um sometimes i think i took like the learn python three course um back in the day and then i think i also looked at sql and i think i also looked at like you know just like a bunch of different like i start with just like some programming languages um and i think the way i'd use this workspace if i was starting off that way is like let's say i get to like learn python3 project i might like do it and then drag over that code to a workspace like this and then just like try seeing where i can take it from there like kind of like branch off like this existing project that i was kind of guided through and then go from there to see like where else i can take it and then let's say if you get more advanced and you start like working with like data sets and data science you know i might just try to say like okay i've worked with this um in like i worked with this data set on like this project like let's say for like hypothesis testing or like building a model i might just try like building another model with the data set and you know try taking it somewhere else without with like less guidance or um doing something like more hypothesis testing with it or like try finding my own data set and mimicking mimicking what i did in uh the existing code company project um you know stuff like that or if you know you're like doing some like web development course you know maybe building out like your own web page and the project is also always like a fun thing to do yeah yeah i think it's uh i think all that's uh great advice i think that i also do is trying to recreate something that i see that is really cool so a great example is um this is the connect for python project that cocademy will lead you through this is kind of your final product um i saw i think it was posted in the forums a learner took this and translated it into javascript and html i think a very valid complaint about about this project is that the it looks kind of bad right it's like text based it's like ascii code and so if somebody took this they knew a little bit of web development so they said okay let me take these uh ai skills that i learned in this python course and try to translate them into a website and uh you know their their final product is a website that does basically exactly this but it looks it looks a lot better um so i think that that's a really good piece of advice too is find something that you think is really cool and just try to recreate it yourself see how far that you can get um i think the uh the knearest neighbor one uh the the dots and the colors that i was showing earlier i think that's another really good example if you're that far in your coding journey that you can kind of follow along you'll probably be to the point where you can you can imagine the starting steps of that project and once you get started then you kind of know a direction to go um so i would say that that's a good thing too is like try to emulate things that you find really cool and then as you're doing that it's going to become your own thing eventually um let's see um questions in the chat i see carlos says from people that are already in the industry will be the best skill to get uh into an entrylevel job um that depends on what the entry level job is but um i always just say um really the skill that you need is being able to learn learn how to learn right where i think it's uh whether you take python or whether you take the full stack path or any of these really the thing that you want to learn is kind of what i was just describing of like being able to come up with a project not know the exact direction uh or not know exactly how to do that but know how to start how to start the the project and how to start uh and knowing how to solve your own problems really um which is which is a tough skill to learn and so i think for me there's no one right direction it's really like whatever you are most interested in but i would say for me the thing that is helpful is not the specific technology that you're learning but rather um learning how to learn and noting that when you're when you're learning python lists whatever um that skill is going to translate to java to javascript all of these other things and so um yeah learning how to learn is more important than the coding language itself um i saw a question about robotics um kind of kind of saying the same thing let me let me find that exact question um can i make code for my robot uh then i build it and put that code in the usb and put the usb in a robot again kind of the kind of the same thing where on codecademy we don't teach you the specific mechanics of like this is the language that you need to know in order to code for a robot or this is how you put your code in the robot whether it's via usb or something else but the thing that we will teach you again are those like fundamentals you'll learn how to um start doing this thing not not in robotics but once you've learned that the important thing is now you've learned the ability to now translate those skills into the specific robotics program that you want to build um someone also asked how i got the csv file into the workspace um so basically you can't actually upload the csv file um but basically what you can do is if you have your csv file just like command a i know that's how you do on a mac unfortunately don't know how you do it on windows um and then just like copy the contents and create a new csv file into the workspace which seems like a bit of a pain but it's actually just like yeah big copy and paste is the answer yeah copy and paste but yeah um good question john can i use my code i create after my pro is over um and richie uh answered not at the moment but they're working on that so good question um cool um anything else uh you think we should say jamie um yeah i don't think so i hope people have a fun time using workspaces yeah oh that's what i wanted to say if you're so if you're a pro member and have access to these workspaces and can uh make them public um i would love to see the comments of this youtube video just be a bunch of links to these shared workspaces i will actually do this um right when the youtube video gets posted i will post a link to um i'll post a link to all four of my my workspaces that i that i showed here so people can play around with them um but i would love to see that because that's that's really what we're hoping for is that these workspaces are a great way for people to share their code and to look at each other's code um so if you made it this far uh consider it consider giving it a shot um cool uh i think that is it from us um we should have uh another one of these sessions in a couple of weeks showing off that code challenge um feature that i very briefly showed so if you like this keep an eye on our youtube channel and yeah we'll see you later thanks jamie thanks for leaving this alex
