hey everyone this is Rob with code kata me a software developer based in Seattle Washington if you've ever wondered exactly what the blockchain is then you've come to just the right place in this video I'm going to discuss what makes up the blockchain and also how the blockchain is used in the real world ok let's get started in the following video we're going to break down blockchain as a distributed ledger permissioned immutable and also popular expressions such as cryptocurrency and other current and possible implementations of the blockchain when you think of blockchain you probably think of cryptocurrencies and big names like Bitcoin and aetherium Bitcoin burst under the scene in 2009 when the first Bitcoin was mined after an individual or group of people under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto wrote a white paper in 2008 called Bitcoin a peertopeer electronic cash system however blockchain as a concept was first discussed in 1991 not in relation to making money but as a way of verifying contents with an immutable timestamp of a document it was a way of authenticating a document to ensure it hadn't been tampered with while not revealing the document contents its original purpose was authenticity and mutability and privacy these are key to our understanding of blockchain today and how it's used let's begin by looking at a blockchain as a distributed ledger which simply means that a ledger is spread across the network among all peers in the network and each peer holds a copy of the complete ledger you can think of it as a Microsoft Word document versus a Google Doc Microsoft Word is a centralized item much like a bank or government institution with data in a word document there is one source of truth you can pass it to someone and while they have it you are not able to do anything or see what they are doing themselves however with the Google Doc you and any number of people can have access to the same source of truth at the same time it is decentralized blockchain is similar to a Google Doc in which everyone can have access to it at once everyone can read it and everyone can add to it and everyone can see those additions the significant difference is that while you can edit the content of a Google Doc it is not permissible to edit something that's already been entered into the blockchain this is a feature of blockchain it is immutable we are going to look at how the blockchain achieves this in just a moment right now the blockchain might feel like magic so let's talk more about what makes up the blockchain and how it achieves authenticity immutability and privacy let's imagine that we have a block depending on the type of blockchain this will contain specific data for example let's look at cryptocurrencies this data would likely contain the sender the receiver and also the amount of coin being sent another example of a block could be food tracking this could be data of where the food was harvested or where the food was manufactured and locations where the food was purchased in the case of food borne diseases the source could be quickly detected and other distribution sources could be notified in minutes or hours rather than days or weeks another example could be the automobile industry this could address odometer fraud because odometer tampering to make a car seem like it has engaged less wear and tear makes a car more valuable instead a block could contain the car date and updated mileage to the blockchain where a true record could be kept and accessed so how can we trust the data can't be manipulated or changed let's take a look at that next each block has a hash value a cryptographic hash function is an algorithm that can be run on data such as an individual file or a password to produce a value called a checksum this is how blockchain achieves immutability each block has a unique fingerprint called a hash the main use of a cryptographic hash function is to verify the authenticity of a piece of data two files can be assumed to be identical only if the checksum is generated from each file using the same cryptographic hash function are identical while there are several different classes of cryptographic hash functions they all share the same four properties let's go ahead and take a look at the four qualities of a cryptographic hash function needed to be useful the first property is that they must be computationally efficient this is just a fancy way of saying that computers must be able to perform a hash functions mathematical labor in an extremely short period of time the second property is that they must be deterministic for any given input a hash function was always give the same result if you put in the same input 10,000,000 times in a row a hash function must produce the same exact output then ten million times over a hash function must be preimage resistant this means that the output of a cryptographic hash function must not reveal any information about the input it's important to note that cryptographic hashing algorithms can receive any kind of input the input can be numbers letters words or punctuation marks it can be a single character a sentence from a book a page from a book or an entire book no matter what the size the hash function must not reveal any information about the input the fourth property is that it must be collision resistant this means that it must be extremely unlikely in other words practically impossible to find two different inputs that produce the same output while inputs can vary in length outputs are a fixed size and a fixed length meaning a fixed number of possibilities so the hash must be precise and not producing the same output so how can we really trust that the data can't be manipulated or changed what makes the blockchain immutable we can trust the immutability of the blockchain because blocks are linked together with other blocks by their hash value with a pointer each block has a pointer to the block before it and is pointed to by the block after it the exception to this is the first block also known as the Genesis block each blocks hash value is determined by the hash function that runs on the data so if you change the data or try to manipulate the data then the hash value will change you this means that if we change the value in the second block then we have a new hash value and the third block no longer points to the second block therefore invalidating the data this is where our shared ledger comes in handy unless you have control of over 50% of the computers with the shared ledger there is no way that this invalidated block will be accepted into the chain this makes fraudulent activity nearly impossible on the blockchain this means you couldn't alter odometer data records cryptic coin transactions or information about harvest location because all of this information is shared uniquely identified and immutable blockchain may have limitless expressions but a few things that they will all have in common are one they will operate peer to peer no central authority to control or manipulate it all participants talk to each other directly this allows for data exchange to be made directly with no third parties involved distributed the ledger is spread across the whole network which makes tampering not so easy cryptographically secured cryptography is used for the security services to make the ledger tamper proof and fourth add only data can only be added in the blockchain in time sequential order this property implies that once data is added to the blockchain it is almost impossible to change the data and can be considered practically immutable blockchain still has a few obstacles to overcome the first is education without adequate knowledge on how exactly to implement the technology many companies simply steer clear of it blockchain is new territory for everyone and the reluctance of many to put trust in the system contributes greatly to a delay in widespread use so a vital step is education educating the public on not only why to use it and why to care but how to use it easily and safely will make all the difference while banks and governments are looking to adopt blockchain they may see decentralized data or currency as a threat as their centralized data or money which are users or citizens may no longer need and appear to pure world would result in a loss of power which may lead to demotivation of government or bank institutions usability and ease of use can be a struggle as well while cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin can be used for a transaction it is closer to the equivalent of gold today as a way of storing money as our current means of transactions can make it not as easy to spend or not as fast to transact and finally technology the design of some block chains creates a bottleneck as the number of transactions grow the original design of Bitcoin limited performances to seven transactions per second by comparison the wellestablished Visa card Network can process thousands per second thanks for watching hopefully this video helped to demystify the blockchain for you this is Rob with code Academy join
