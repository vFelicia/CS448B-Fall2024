okay hello everybody we have people from all over the world and we are so so excited to see you guys we have South Carolina Colorado Budapest Lebanon South Africa like let's all code together this is going to be great let me just make sure there's for a check is everyone hearing me clearly can everyone see everything clearly let's just check okay that's awesome good let's do this alright so first of all hello i'm kyla some of you guys might recognize me from a livestream I did before I'm back again and this time I'm in my domain of web development we're going to talk about HTML CSS JavaScript and we're going to make some really cool interactive site it's a mini site it's really simple so if anybody is brand new to web dev has never touched any of this before in their life you're fine we will walk through this together and if you know a little somethingsomething then you're also in the right place because you will get to play around with the interactive side making a website we're going to use javascript and afterwards I'll talk to you a little bit more about taking what we learned today and doing something even cooler with it so to get started we are going to make this random color generator so you guys may or is it this side you guys may have seen some stuff about it on Twitter on YouTube but this is what we're going to make here today this isn't one of the exercises from our web development past so if you're a part of the path you may recognize it if you you're not on our web dev path this is probably new to you but feel free to check out our web depth in your free time and see other lessons like this what we're gonna do is make this from scratch and give it the ability to have an interactive have interactive buttons so we can click on these buttons to change the color or scroll over one of the buttons and create a mystery color is everyone ready alright so I'm going to reset this from the beginning also just so you know the way you can access this is through the link in the project description so when you open yours up it's probably gonna look a blank like this if it does perfect that means time to get started so we're going to go in first with the HTML of the website HTML creates the structure of a web page so it's pretty much saying I want my text to be here my images there may be a button here that's how we determine it what's already there is a little bit of boilerplate every HTML file should start off with this doctype HTML tag you're seeing in the beginning after that we have our HTML tag followed by a head tag the head tag holds a bunch of information that the user isn't necessarily gonna see on the website but it helps to make the website work we have a meta a link tag that link tag is linking to the CSS the CSS is gonna give style to the website but we're gonna do that later and then after that we have another link tag with our favorite font here at code Academy new neato I love using it we use it everywhere and I just wanted our website to be beautiful with fancy font so we're using that one and then after that we have a body tag and that body tag right here is empty it's empty and we're going to fill it so in order to get started filling it we want to add a section tag this section tag is going to hold all of the contents of the website I just like to do this as a best practice just to hold everything and I can play around with the section tag and make it fancy if I need to but it's just a great way of holding things together all of these HTML tags are like pieces of bread I am different layers of a sandwich holding all of the website together so you notice I have my section tag and then I have another section tag with a slash in front of it that's called the end tag all of the contents within the section tag go in between the two tags so you want your code to look like this at the end so I hit I create a section tag head tag section end tag and then inside of that I'm going to get going on this website okay so after that to recreate the what we had before I want to add a rainbow image there was an image at the beginning you guys might have noticed in order to do this I'm going to create an image tag an image tag is a funny tag that doesn't need an end tag I don't really know how to explain it's just like.how there's weird things in the English language like P and H make F who decided that I don't know but we have image tag which doesn't have an end tag to it it's just one soul tag inside of that tag we want to write s are see an equal sign and two quotations that is going to find the source for the image tag so where are we getting this image from you may ask inside of the narrative if you scroll at the very end I gave you additional information use the following image tag to add the rainbow image to the webpage you're going to copy this image tag and put it here sorry I probably should have explained that part before so in that image tag we have our source still and that source is a link and that link is holding our rainbow picture after that I have alt text and it says rainbow icon so if anything goes wrong with your website instead of seeing the rainbow image you're going to see the words rainbow icon just a little blurb about how the image tag works make sure you copy paste that after your site or your section head tag and before your section end tag it should be between those after that I'm gonna run my code as you can see it's kind of crazy and kind of big we're gonna be fixing this later but for now let's just leave it after my image tag and still inside of my section tag I want to create more things I want to have a title for my website and with a title for my title I'm going to use an h1 tag the h1 tag is a header a header tag that allows me to a heading sorry a heading tag that allows me to create a title in big text I want that title to be random color generator because that's what we're doing here today so you should have an h1 element after image tag inside of the h1 element you want random color generator though that text should in front of the after the header and in front of the end tag okay I'm gonna take a little break to let some people catch up make sure everything's going well and maybe chat with you guys let's see what's going on in the chat we have oh you want me to talk a little bit louder I will be sure to talk louder so you guys can hear me clearly and seems like we're confused what exactly is the meta tag cool that's an excellent question that meta tag it has utf8 in it it's pretty much saying that we are going to be writing this website in English and to follow to understand the different like it's saying that it's a funky old tag and this tag is in like almost every website it's just pretty much saying like the character set that we're using is like the basic English language that you're seeing probably on your keyboard using the ABCD efg as along with some punctuation and things like that it just helps the HTML to read the page better awesome any other questions please link the link at the beginning is for what so there's two links on our page right now we have the linked linked at a link inside of our link tag maybe I should explain the link tags first so the first link is linking to the H the CSS so you can see that it says style CSS inside of that link tag that's saying that we're going to connect our HTML to a style CSS file that's the second tab inside of your learning environment it's empty right now cuz we haven't gotten started yet we'll get there later after that there's another link tab that connects us to the font we like to use a fancy font from google fonts called new neato I love it and so that I stuck that in there so later on you guys can make add some thought to your styling but we're also not in the style yet then there's another just like plain old hyperlink link inside of the image and that is linking to the rainbow image that we see here inside of our environment and it's in a browser sorry and it's taking up a lot of room but we're gonna fix that later so now everyone should be at the point where you have a image tag and an h1 tag inside of your section tag let's run it so that we can see that random color generator pop up at the bottom and here it is and it's in this ugly default text we're gonna change that later on when we get to the style but for now let's focus on the structure so next we want to have let's have like a little paragraph tag so we want a P tag I cannot type we want a P tag and that P tag is going to hold a quick description let's say find your new favorite color that's our description so that will be there once you hit the run tag you will see that new paragraph after your h1 tag everything in HTML comes in in the sequence we give it to it unless we tell it to do otherwise so first you'll see your rainbow image then your title then your text if you see it in a weird order it's probably because you're not using the same order I have here cool now after we have our fun little description we're going to create two buttons and luckily the button tag is nice and straightforward you want to have button close start and end and we're gonna have two of those so I'm just gonna copy paste that and make another one the first button should say pick a color this is the button that we are going to use to click on and change the color when we click on it every time we'll get a brand new color in order to do that we're going to use some JavaScript later on today after that we're going to have a mystery color button that's what the second button should be called this one we're going to scroll over and every time we scroll it will randomly pick a color from the entire rainbow which is gonna be pretty so I'm gonna hit run again if I scroll down I will see incy wincy tiny little buttons one says pick color and one says mystery color just like I asked we're going to style those though let's fix up this website so it looks prettier because this is just like early 90s terrible let's get started does anybody have any questions feel free to throw them in the chat if you have them so far I'm going to head over to our style.css that is the second tab inside of the text editor now let's make things pretty let me make sure I have all my rules in front of me of what I want this to look like so first thing that I want is I want my body element to like have better spacing than it does you guys might notice where I'm at right now I have the rainbow image there and there's like a tiny white space between the edge of the browser and the rainbow image and the edge of the browser and my text and the edge of the browser and my buttons I don't like that so I'm going to call on the body element remember our sandwich in HTML our body element is right here it holds all of the elements that the user is going to see on the web page so I'm calling this element to make a change to it in my CSS so I say body and then I create two curly brackets those curly brackets are going to hold rules about the body element I want no padding so padding should be padding colon zero semicolon I don't want any padding I don't want any weird spacing the padding is the space inside of my body I don't want any of that and I also don't want anything funky to happen either outside of the body element so I'm gonna say margin zero semicolon that changes the spacing outside of the body element there should be none I don't want any of that so I'm just letting my my browser know that by creating this after that I to call on that new neato font that we're using that fancy font I really like that's linked inside of the HTML that forth tag inside the third tag sorry third tag inside of the head it links to a Google font called new neato I want to take this cut font so I'm copy pasting that title and I'm gonna say to my body element that I want your font family it's so cute that it's called a family to be in quotations new neato and you and I tio inside of quotations and then after that I need a semicolon again so I am okay someone's asking a question how do I get CSS your CSS is inside of this project already so before we were in HTML now we want to click on the second tab if you look at the very top it's probably over my head this way I don't know there's h2 index HTML style dot CSS and mange s we're leaving the index.html to go to style.css so just click over to that second tab and you should be all good you know someone from Scotland like this is amazing this is amazing okay so I'm going to run this now we haven't made crazy changes but what we will see is that there's no weird spaces in between the edge of the browser and my images and text anymore and also the text has changed very drastically for my title and my paragraph and I find that it looks so much better you might disagree but I think it looks good so after that I'm gonna go back into the body and I want to make one more change we had a beautiful red background before on our website I want to change the background color of this website so it looks like something that we had before so I'm gonna say background color colon and then what color should we make this I want you guys to decide what color do you guys think this should be gonna have some water while I wait red fire brick blue some of you may know if you've played around with CSS before that there are some really funky color names that you guys can use it's great what do you think the idea of purple mmm we got some blues we're getting a lot of Blues all right I'm gonna go with blue cuz Oh turquoise sky blue alright let's try something fun so what some of you guys may or may not know is you can use CSS to call on some pretty funky colors if I type in the word light I'll let me put a space cuz it just so it looks better and it's easy to read if I put the fate of the word light blue with no space it turns a color CSS understands what light blue means and I want to put my semicolon after that and let's run this and all of a sudden we have this beautiful sky blue for our rainbow image to sit on top of I love this let's keep going and also I used light blue feel free to use whatever color you want and test it out you can type out color names and CSS will understand awesome also I see that we have Vinicius lino i might have spelt pronounce your name wrong I'm sorry he's using this funky little code here you might notice in the chat that's called hexadecimal colors um you can also use like funky code for color before when I had my pretty red color in the original website I was using this hexadecimal color it's this weird thing feel free to join in on the web dev path check out some of our CSS courses if you want to learn more about it but it also makes colors like our original red that we had before but I'm a fan of the light blue so I'm gonna keep it let's run that again see that change beautiful so the next thing I want to change is this image it's been huge for way too long so what I want to do is call on the image tag from the HTML and I'm going to tell it I want the width to change put a colon after that and give it a width of about 200 pixels cuz why not feel free to make it whatever size you want I like it like this I think that this is fine after that I want to tell it that I want to tell the browser to put that image in the center I don't like it being on the side that's that's weird so let's first I'm going to say change your display to block this means treat this element like a block that sits on top of other things and has other thing or has something sitting on top of it it doesn't have it's not going to sit in line with the rest of the elements then after that I'm going to say margin we're gonna call net margin again and I want to say zero but I want to say Auto after that a uto Auto that is going to tell it to push this to the center there should be equal space on both sides when I run that it's magically in the middle I love this about web dev is that I can like control this whole situation and make everything beautiful that's my favorite part about this after that I'm going to go ahead and keep editing so we have our h1 tag that is our title and I want to also put that in the middle but I think I'm gonna do it a little differently this is also a really great hack to know you can say with of 100% I want it to have a width of the whole browser and then after that I'm going to say text align Center I want my text to be aligned in the center when I run this it's in the middle again I think I'm also going to do that for the paragraph tag so things are in line with 100% text alive center after that's awesome so we're already creating a far more beautiful website that we had in the first place pat yourself on the back because you're doing great I'm gonna check to see if any questions are popping up again let's see how aren't we doing we have a question about margin of font wow these are some really good questions so I'm gonna answer them the order that I see them first I'm seeing someone's saying isn't it better to use percentage instead of pixel there this is something that it shows me that you know love something something about webdev because you can use pixels to hardcode something that picture that I have there is always gonna be 200 pixels once I say 200 pixels that's called hard coding I could soft code it to be a percentage instead so instead of being 200 pixels I could say that I want this image to be 50% of my screen and it'll change it up now what's gonna happen is if I click this icon right here I can extend the size of my browser when I extend the size of the browser the picture is going to grow with it if I keep it at 200 pixels and run it and extend the browser it's always gonna be 200 pixels so really it's up to you I'll leave it up to you what you want to do for that image that's a really great question someone else was asking something about margin0 auto I had seen so what's happening there is the image is sitting in the center now because it's like really weird CSS speak but what I'm pretty much saying by margin0 auto is that I want I don't want any spaces outside of my margin which is the space outside of the element I don't want any space outside of the element but I want it to automatically sit somewhere and that is in the middle so zero Auto will push any element to the center but before I can do that I have to make sure I have displayblock so that there are no other elements on the side of the element I'm trying to change someone else mention something about the their font not working new neato make sure that one new detail new neato is inside of quotations I would also say that when go back to your HTML and make sure that you haven't changed that last link tag uh that should probably fix things make sure every the link is also inside of quotations I can't see your screen so it's hard for me to say exactly what's up but trying to try doing those two things and hopefully your font sites working again someone asked a question about the body element doesn't make everything in the middle no it does not not on its own we have to tell it to do that so the edits we made to the body tag are simply fixing the space of the body tag and assigning a font family to all the child elements all the elements inside of the body element and changing the color of the body body element if there's anything I said in the beginning that you missed this will be recorded so you can rewatch it as many times as you want share it with some of your friends and let's keep going so we have things in the center now but one thing I'm really not happy about is this spacing it's really weird everything's bunched up at the top let's spread things out so one thing I'm going to add is I don't want my image to sit directly at the top of the picture I want to have some space let everything flow so I'm gonna say margin again top adjust the top margin of the image and I want it to have 50 pixels let's say when I run this it's going to push the image down from the top so that there's a little more space to breathe I also want to add a margin below it because I don't want the random color generator title to be so close to it I'm going to say again margin bottom this time and let's give it another 50 50 pixels when I run that I'm getting a little more space I think that my elements are enjoying that they'd like to have a little space and let's change the title I think that I let's change the title I think that it's a little small and it can be larger so I'm gonna say font sighs to change the size of this text and I want it to be 30 pixels now once again like someone said before we can make these percentages if we want feel free to play around with that if you have the time but I want it to be hard pixels so I just know what I'm getting every time and now my text is bigger now that I've changed the font size to 30 pixels and I'm going to also make that paragraph larger because no one can read that and let's say 18 pixels looks better maybe more let's say 24 better I like that I think that I also want to change the color of my paragraph so I'm gonna say color what color should I do this time for the paragraph let's make sure we can read it so it should probably be a darker color a strange bug if you're finding that there's a strange bug with your editor and run your code one more time and refresh the screen what colors are you guys thinking about dark pink violet oh you guys are getting fancy navy blue purple dark blue oh good you guys are so into blue today let's let's do blue again I'll do a darker blue I think it'll actually look nice too let's try dark blue and there's also actually you can also type in the word Navy let's try Navy so I want my color call it Navy semicolon and I'm gonna run this again and it changed to Navy and I think it looks good so let's keep it I think that I want to have a little space underneath my title from my paragraph also so it matches what I had before and I'm going to have mark I'm gonna add margin bottom to the h1 and let's say another fix 50 pixels cool it just looks a little better so last but certainly not least we want to style these buttons these buttons are looking a little weird so first things first is I want to call on the button tags now there's two button tags but when I say button in my CSS it's going to find any button inside of the HTML file so both of these buttons are going to get styled the way I asked I'm going to say that I want my buttons to have a width of I want it to be larger so let's say a width width of 350 pixels and a height because I can call on that of 100 pixels and let's see how this looks it's getting better now you'll notice that they are now one on top of each other that's simply because they don't fit in the browser at this size but if I click on that icon again and expand it they're sitting sidebyside still and I don't want that so next thing I'm going to do is say display let me girl up so you guys can see that better display in line I mean sorry sorry not in line don't do that display block semicolon now let's run that again they're sitting on top of each other again but if I extend it it's still sitting on top of each other I want them to be horizontally I mean vertically aligned not horizontally so now that I have that it's looking a little better but I don't like this color at all so let's give these buttons a background color let's just say Navy for now to match the paragraph and let's give it a thought color of white so you can read the text properly I'm going to just add some spaces here so you guys can see this better cuz I think it's getting cut off oh wait someone else had purple I haven't seen purple so we'll just make this purple why not I'll make the the background color purple instead with a font color of white and let's run this and now we see it's looking a little bit better it's looking good I want my font to be larger so we'll do font size again and let's say 30 pixels so it's nice and big and now my readers can easily see the text but if you notice it's not new neato what's going on we need to call again new neato inside a button because sometimes lets CSS that's a little funny and it doesn't want to follow along with what its parent element told it to do so we're going to say font family again we're going to have a colon and inside of quotations we want to say new neato send me let's run that again there we go I don't know about you guys but I want this to be in the center to align with everything else so I'm going to say margin0 auto again the reason I can do this is because I've already said displayblock earlier up that's important to note I'm gonna run that and it's in the center again and then after that I'm going to say margin bottom and I want them to have a bottom margin of about 10 pixels so that there's some space cool I think that there could be a little more space after that paragraph tag so I'm gonna go back to my P tag I'm going to say margin bottom and I'll give that 30 pixels so that there's some space between my paragraph in that very first button and things are coming together how you guys feel you guys are doing really well we've made it pretty far for those of you who've never touched HTML or CSS before in your life like Congress oh thank your honor and now in my on can people hear okay before having so much fun right now and these got it okay people can I'm the guy that stays out of sight yes that is alex is my handy dandy helped me I just broke something and he's also a part of our data science path you're so in the news cycle right yeah and he writes really cool stuff for really intelligent people like yourselves so you should check that out sometime um I'm so glad you guys can hear me again I noticed that someone mentioned something in the comments about font family inherit so for some of my fancy people who want to play around um I can also say font family inherit and that would also adopt the new neato font from the body tag from its parent tag its inheriting the font let's play around with that I'm going to comment out that first font family that I have that is a slash asterisk and then followed by an Astrix slash to comment something out and I'm gonna run it and as you can see new nito's working again I wasn't sure if you guys would be ready for all of that so I didn't say it but thank you for calling that out because it's an excellent way to help other people learn thank you um I hope that everyone's like back um regulate the so you don't hear so much background noise will do I'm going to oh no sound how are you guys I'm gonna give it a second just to like see everyone it seems like most people can hear yes it is delayed by 15 seconds so I'm gonna keep going down things should be good um so where we left off we have a beautifully created website I still don't know which side of beads on this and we are we have our style we have our structure from the HTML our style from the CSS but now we want to have some behavior from the JavaScript so if you go to the very last tab the third tab that says main j/s we will see our JavaScript I provided some comments here to help you guys understand what it is we're doing so if you're ever like what the heck is going on Tyla read the comment above and I'll probably explain a little bit what it is where you've been trying to do but I will explain to you guys as we go on so don't worry what I want to do pretty much with my javascript let's think this through I want to be able to click or scroll on a button to get it to change its color randomly I don't want to have to tell it what color to change it to it should take one on its own and once it picks one it should stop and wait for my next my click or scroll again to do it again javascript is really smart but you have to give it the directions to do these things with so I am going to store I want to call on my pick a button and mystery button on elements separately so because of that as you guys can see in the first two comments I have this variable stores a pick a color button the pick a color button and this variable store is the mystery color button I want to go back to my HTML first and as we can see we have those two buttons here the only thing that makes them different from each other is the content and JavaScript we don't really want to have a script to be concerned with the content as much as the element of itself so I'm going to go into my button and I'm going to give it an ID ID gives me an identification for that button or whatever element is so ID equals quotation marks let's say original button and after that I want to say ID equals on the second button ID equals quotations mystery button this is really crucial that you guys do this so that your JavaScript works so make sure you have two IDs on both I'm one for each button tag and make sure you give it two separate give them two separate names I said original button and mystery button if you guys feel comfortable you guys can straight away and give it a different name if you choose to but make sure you remember that name because we're gonna go back into the JavaScript and call on it in order to do that I want to say to my JavaScript hey for the pick a button but button pick a color button I'm sorry I went to say call on the original button ID because that is how we can identify that button so first I say cost Const is a way to declare a variable in JavaScript and I want JavaScript to also call the original button original button but I want to do it in a way that Java scripts understand understands so if I take that original button button the way that it was inside of HTML it doesn't read the syntax the same way it's not going to work you can see it's already changing colors doing weird things we don't want it to do JavaScript reads something called camelcase way better so what I'm gonna do is say original button but I want the two words to be attached to each other no spaces no dashes and I want the B to be uppercase so it's easier for someone to read my code later on so Const original button equals we're gonna say document and document is a keyword for the document object or the entire webpage that webpage the webpage is the document but inside the document we want to say dot get element by I D so I'm going to call on an element using the get element by ID method this should be in camel case that is very important it won't work if you don't use that get should be lowercase element by ID should be capitalized and in parentheses and in quotations I will say original button which is the original ID for the original button what that last part after the equal sign is doing is going into my web page finding an element inside of the document with that specific ID I'm gonna do that again for the mystery button I just copy paste it and make sure I change this to mystery did I spell this right yes I think that um and I have those here I'm just gonna run my code so it's a is what I did and I don't lose anything and I'm gonna check to see if anybody has any questions so far okay how come many developers use ID instead of starting with class cool that's an excellent question so class is something that we did not put talked about here so if you're like class what is she talking about don't you worry that's okay feel free to check out the web dev path so you can use these fancy words but for those of you who do know what classes there is class and ID those are different ways to select or specify different elements our class is good to be used on something generally or something that can or things that can be used over and over again ID is better for very specific unique elements so I wanted to use ID on those two buttons because they are uniquely different I want them to do I want two different functions well I want two different things to be happen to them so I used IDs that's just the best practice if you use class then you're gonna have we're good there's gonna be some funkier things going on in your JavaScript it leaves room for funkier things to happen so I would highly suggest that you use get element by ID as well oh wow thank you why does the second variable have the same name it should not it should not that is Wow you guys are awesome you guys caught a mistake everybody makes them so it should not say constitutional button because if I call on that original button and camel case again it's not going to work it's gonna be like which one I don't know so get rid of original in that second variable and say mystery thank you so much for calling that out Oh people are getting fancy with borderradius I love this I love this so much so we should no longer have two original buttons your first one should be Const original button equals document.getelementbyid II in parentheses in quotations original button your second one should say Kant's mystery button equals document.getelementbyid d mystery button cool and you guys are ready to get fancy didn't get fancy so now you're going to do we're going to have a random number function okay so some of you guys might remember earlier someone talked about a product hexadecimals in the chat there are many different ways to call on colors in CSS we're going to play around with one of the ways to do that and that is RGB parentheses inside of the parentheses it would be a number okay I should make this a comment because you know what I'm doing right now is not JavaScript syntax so I'm gonna make this a comment follow along with my comment actually let me make this easier for you guys to understand this it's not javascript all right so there are inside of our CSS we can have an RGB code for a color that's red green blue the first number that would go there would be a number for red so if I want it to be full red the furthest number I can use is 255 that's a whole nother conversation for another day feel free to look that up in your own time but just know that 255 is the highest number I can use for RGB if I want it to be full red I use 255 on the first placement that's for read the second placement is for green I could say once again 255 and if I want it to be full blue I would say 255 per blue the last placement if I have all of them at 255 then I get the color white if I have all of them at 0 I have the color black anything in between that is all the shades of the rainbow so I'm gonna stick with 255 for this code because what well I'll talk about that later with you guys but I'm gonna just put these number signs here as a placeholder for our DB um what I want to do with my JavaScript is create a variable that will hold the RGB code as a string so I want to say Const equals random color and random color is going to hold a string which would be like a word or a sentence or it could be a number but this is something for it to read not for something something for it to add up so I want it inside of quotations so it knows that it is a string inside of that string I am going to say RGB like we read earlier and I'm going to have to parenthesis and this is a string I'm going to delete this last part here because we don't need this anymore I'm going to delete this this is not JavaScript comment because this is now JavaScript and we need it so I'm getting rid of that I have this I'm gonna take two seconds so everyone like breathe catch up questions cool someone was asking about ID versus class I explained that a little bit so feel free to like watch the recording of this if you have any questions or you want to hear something again it will be published as soon as we're done and we should be done soon so let's get there so now in line 8 after line 7 the comment in line 7 you should have line 8 konstandin color equals RGB parentheses as a string and which means inside of quotations I use single I could also use double whatever you want to use is fine and I'm going to put another quotation in between that so I want to have I want to be able to fill the filled the number placements inside of RGB things are gonna get a little funky here I'm gonna say numnumnum this is just going to be a fun way for me to stick in number values inside of this variable before each number should have + + + and that will add things in a moment sorry guys give me two seconds I'm realizing that this parts a little weird so I want to just give you guys the finished version and I am going to I wouldn't give you guys the finished version and then I'm gonna explain it to you that way because I think that that might be a little clearer for some people the way I'm doing it right now might be a little funky so how about we play around with this down there so I'm gonna get rid of this let's let's reset here because I'm realizing I'm getting kind of weird and funky there's there should be nothing after line seven anymore keep it blank first thing we want to do is create a function this function is going to give us a random color it's just going to produce a random RGB code like the one that we talked about earlier it's going to produce it at random it's going to randomly select then the numbers we want to put in the red green and blue placements that is what this function is going to do I'm going to comment that just so you guys have that in the back of your head so to start from scratch to make this easier let's just focus on our function whatever function wants to do is place number values inside of the parentheses so we're going to create a function with the word function we're going to say RGB parentheses as the function name and I want to give it a parameter of num that number an ammeter is going to represent the numbers after I've said my function name I'm going to do curly brackets hit enter and inside of there is going to be the code for the function so for those of you who are following along we are now jumping into this function and I'm going to explain how the color is being created as we go I think it'll be a little easier for you guys if you're following along and doing it with me I'm a handson person myself after that inside of the function I want to return spell return right first of all return a the math object in JavaScript so the math object javascript already knows I don't even have to explain to it math is all sorts of things about adding and numbers and doing fun things I want to give I want to use the math to randomly select a number so in order to do that I need to give it a limit or floor and inside of the floor parentheses I want to say math dot random so I can randomly select something and have parentheses after that and then I want to say asterisks no and that is going to be any num that I that randomly comes from the math object now like I was saying before remember everything in RGB has to be under 255 so my num in this situation is going to have to be 255 but I don't need to explain that just yet to the JavaScript the JavaScript just needs to have a function to work with so now we have a function for randomly selecting a number after that I am going to create a colorchanging function this function is actually going to change the color and change the RGB code itself after so in order to do that I want to create a function again with the keyword function and let's call it color change just so we know what it does easily and anyone can read our code and pick up where we left off and we'll have curly brackets and those curly brackets are going to hold what the function is going to do so we already have our random number function and after this we're evil and next we're going to create the colorchanging function I'm gonna check in on our questions do we have any great exercises to practice JavaScript yes so many um head over to code caddy me when we're done with this I actually put the link in the description so head to that link in the description after we're done with this and check out the web dev path check out our catalog we have all sorts of great JavaScript stuff this is confusing for beginners with okay if this is a little confusing I'm gonna break out down what we're doing one more time so we started off with two buttons calling them in the JavaScript so JavaScript can give behaviors to those buttons after that we created a function this function is here too because we need to change the color but in order to change the color we need to play around with the RGB code or the color code that color code requires numbers in it so because this is a random color generator we want to randomly select numbers to place inside of that RGB code in this next function that we're about to create we're going to create the function that actually changes the code the color code but we're going to need to call on that random color function inside of this function to change the numbers to change the color to change the buttons I hope that that is making sense please let me know if that's making sense and please please please post your questions if you have anything yeah so after this someone um has a let R and someone posted the let random color variable in there we're not there just yet but we're gonna get there so let's do this together so next with our color change function we inside of this we want to call on that color code RGB um as you guys can see at the very end of the JavaScript that I have here I have a variable for this already set up for you guys so you guys don't have to go through the craziness so take that that comment and put it inside of your function and I don't want it to be a comment anymore so I'm gonna get rid of those two slashes before it the first line inside of my function is a random color variable that random color variable is holding our RGB code our RGB code is a string and where the red number value would be I have my random color my random number function inside of it RGB 255 is replacing the parameter as an argument and so that red our RGB function that I created earlier the random number function is going to be run for red and randomly give me a number that is less than 255 or equal to 255 at random I have that again after a comma I have that again for my green placement it's going to randomly give me a number under 2 under or equal to 255 and then again for the blue if it's running these functions each time for red and green and blue I'm randomly gonna get a different color every single time so I could simply create it a variable to call this written random color will be used to call this in the function so I don't have to keep repeating this code over and over again cuz it was a lot I think we can all agree on that one so after that line after that variable I want to create a new line and in that line I want to call on I want to apply what I just did to the buttons of themselves so right now I have a rant I have a way of creating a random color but I haven't told my JavaScript which elements it's applying this to yet so I want to create something called an effect an event is something that just takes place in the browser whether you scroll or you click or you DoubleTap or you write swipe that is an event I want to create an event with the keyword event and then have a period after it because we're going to be clicking and scrolling to make fun things happen after that I'm going to say target because I want to target something specifically I want the event to take place on a specific target and then after that I want to say style because I'm going to change the style after that I'm going to say background color and I want that to be camp one word camel case it's very important that it is one word and that the C is uppercase and then I'm going to set that equal to random color and then have a semicolon so the event target the target of the event will have its style changed specifically its background color changed to random color it's going to and the inside of random color another function is taking place where random numbers are being given to create a random color so now I have the functions I need to make this happen but we need to do something so that this function this color change function takes place on the buttons so I'm gonna run this just so I don't lose any of the code I've done so far and I'm gonna check to see how people are doing yeah I misspelled background oh yeah that's important sorry guys let's get rid of that G that shouldn't be there thank you for helping you catch that bar and thanks I quit my job to become a web dev that is amazing oh my god that is amazing it's amazing you could also use string interpolation but we're not gonna get into that today not gonna get blood today but I want this to be something that anybody who's never seen JavaScript before can do so for those of you who know this fancy stuff and for those of you who want to know something with this fancier stuff and for those of you who are like I don't even know what's going on but I'm following along anyway that's okay head over to code Academy and check out what we have there because you can like what I'm teaching you right now is a part of a much bigger lesson which is a part of a bigger path that helps you to get to the point where you could be a web dev like some of these awesome people in this chat right now awesome if you can't clearly see the code I'm really sorry about that that um the best thing that you can do is head to this come back to this page when we're done with the live stream and check it out again hopefully you'll see it better there and if you can at all then click on the project link and look at the solution code and kind of follow along to what you're hearing me say I think that that would be really helpful for you to try this again and do it in a more clear way I'm really sorry if you can't see this um okay so can we do a picture as a background yes these are fun things that you can do head to the web dev pack guys it's awesome so I'm gonna wrap this up because we're almost done you guys have done it you guys have created HTML CSS JavaScript you're about to make an interactive website like you're walking away from this thing I have made an interactive website before congratulations whether this was easy or hard for you this is an accomplishment not everyone can say they've done that so I want you to give yourself a pat on the back I want you to breathe what's your drink some water and let's let's keep going we have two lines of code left or technically three because I like to space things out so finally what I'm going to do is call on original button so that original button can have color change happening to it so original button and earlier I was talking about an event taking place like double tapping let the swiping scrolling I want to click on original button so I'm going to say dot on click when I click on original button I want the color change function to take place cool let's run this when I click on original color a button remember that's one it's called pick a color when I click on original button oh gosh it should change and we have a bug when I click on it when I was clicking on original button I was expecting the color to change but it did not so there's an issue in our code that might be did I spell this right yes I did it's matches this yes does I called the element by the idea of original button let me make sure that the original button I wrote in Java swear it matches what I have in my HTML original button yes it does so there might be an issue inside of my function whoaohh so let me check on this function inside of my random number function let me make this a little bit easier and less confusing for people too maybe I should change that name of the function to random number which means I'm going to have to change it again here random number this might help people follow a little easier especially if you're depending on sound to hear me right now I'm just changing that you don't have to if you don't want to but it's just gonna help make things make sense Oh someone knows what's up so someone called this out and this is so silly of me sometimes you have a bug and at the end of the day you realize you're just going with the flow of things and you forgot to do something very simple so I want everyone to go back to their HTML file right now we made a mistake so inside of our head tag we have a link tag linking to our CSS so HTML knows that the CSS applies to it awesome right but we never told the HTML to be connected we never connected our HTML to the JavaScript so our HTML is like why are you clicking on me right now I don't know what you're talking about because we never said hey the JavaScript is gonna tell you what to do when you get clicked on so after our section but before the end body tag I am going to create something called a script tag inside of that script tag I want to call on main je s so that it knows to go to main de s so in order to that do that sorry I'm like looking and talking to you guys at the same time I need to say source equals main dot je s and let's run that so now our HTML and JavaScript are connected and did I do something wrong here and I think I did because it doesn't like that today he's just gonna tie currently see hmm so have my main J ass I did connect it to the main J ask which is good but uh hmm interesting so our JavaScript is now connected to our HTML make sure you follow that to that step it should be the third from the bottom inside of the body tag one of the last elements we should have a script source equals main je s and then an end script tag now I want to go back to my JavaScript because I'm still not getting what I want so let me make sure that I'm not spoiling anything wrong let me make sure that everything is where it needs to be it's going on oh my god yes no matter how the other day I spent like 15 minutes trying to figure something out only to realize there was no period somewhere so little mistakes happen all the time there's no issue with that someone's saying that it seems like the original button ah there's something wrong with the original button so HTML tag is original button let's see the HTML tag has the idea of original button cool and in JavaScript we have the original button also so that should be good I think you're not using the color function color change we do the color change here color change is here what else are we thinking you can always link more than one javascript file if you ever have one you just add multiple script tags well I have to in order to get the console to pop up on here and have to do all sorts of crazy backend stuff so we can't really make that happen and another person is mentioning 255 for RGB it's really funky thing but to 255 is the heart highest number RGB will go up to so that's why we're using it um let's see if seems like you guys have some really great stuff true yeah okay true okay so we're ready for that ready for that so I can also open the console here so I just hit command option J on my on a MacBook Pro for those of you who don't know how to do that you can also rightclick on your browser and go to inspect to inspect an element and pull up I want to plop console so if you're seeing this that means you're an elements go over to console to see what I'm seeing and people want to look through the console to see what's wrong we're really getting kind of crazy I love it I love it someone is getting an error inside of that console cannot read property type target of undefined so it seems like the issue is I'm going to close this console it seems like the issue is that it's there it's not understanding what the event target is I think that what I should do is hmm let's change this I think I need to change my color change function my color change function sorry in order to make this work so it doesn't understand that there is an event it's not understanding the that target that is and in order to fix that I wanted to take a parameter of event let's give it that parameter so that it knows that there's an event being run through this function so I pretty much put I just put the word event inside of the pair of the parentheses following color change and let me run this and let's see it's still not taking that it's not taking my event object so so yes tego mentioned I might be pronounce your name while I'm sorry shouldn't color J change receive an argument so I did put that that event in here but I don't have an argument here so let's give it an event argument let's run that still doesn't seem to like this interesting someone mentioned at event listener there's ways to do that without adding an event listener and we shouldn't have to do that to make this work see I will for those who are asking questions about math.floor I'll get I'll get to that after we figure out what's going on here is line 19 in the HTML correct let's see script I believe so did I just need to know someone seen something wrong sorry I'm looking through screens it should be fine that is correct so we have the script tag at the bottom in line 15 that is that should be there you should have that let's see we have all caps over here or just put different in the script I want to like stick to the most simple way to do this ever original button click someone's mentioning is the event supposed to be in the brackets you see that is yes it is as an argument and a parameter I did that on purpose but if you try it out without it and see if that works for you and let us know it is best practice to have I am being lazy it is best practice to have those semicolons afterwards but that's not going to affect whether it's working or not but that is best practice and you should be doing that um so if you don't have semicolons after your lines inside of your JavaScript functions you probably should put them there and yes so we could we could do it this way so let's let's try this cuz Moustafa made a good point of document.getelementbyid and we could use that instead as the parameter I mean use that I've set and change the parameter let's try this because I believe that this could work so we're going to get rid of that target and replace it with a element by get element by ID and I'm just going to put this here but the issue here is how is it going to know what the ID is so I'm not so sure that's going to be a solution to my problem so let me go back to my mentor okay so in this last slide we have an inroom and in house suggestion that last function you were saying that I should the parenthesis so my colleague Alex who is helping us out today he said that he thinks we should get rid of these parenthesis at the end of color change because that might be throwing us off let's try it and it's working and I like to save the day so um there is I'm going to go over what just happened so you guys understand why this just worked so really what this the very simple issue was in that last line before I had these parentheses here and that parentheses meant that it was expecting something to be passed through it or an argument but there is no argument that needs to happen here because I took care of what needs to happen inside of the function already with my event in my event target so I want to get rid of those two parentheses in that last line those should not be there inside of the function I want I have an event happening already and that event has been defined as it has on click and original button on click equals a color change so every time I click on original button I will have a color change so I'm gonna go through this from top to bottom I have my original button being called from the HTML I have my mystery button being called from the HTML I have a function that is coming up with random numbers and then I have a function called color change that is changing the color inside of that function inside of the color changing function I am assigning random numbers for a red green and blue value and then I decide that when an event takes place on my target the style will change specifically the background style will be changed to the random color value that is produced and then after that and the very last line I am assigning that function to original button when on click takes place when a click takes place on that original button and then when I go to my HTML after I run when I go to my browser sorry and I click on that button the color changes cool how are we doing and one thing I want to mention is people in the chat are like giving amazing suggestions on many different ways to do this that is the fun thing about programming there's so many different ways to do like one thing there are ways to optimize your code so your code doesn't have to be super long or ways to make something happen in live make something happen a few different ways so some of the suggestions that you guys gave I will definitely work but it would require a little bit of knowledge that not everyone has and I want to make sure everyone can umm excess access list so we're going with some of the more simpler ways to make this happen for those of you who are like this didn't feel simple don't worry that is fine because that's what practice is for even myself I'm still making mistakes so it's perfectly fine if at some point you felt lost or if you're currently lost just feel free to ask questions it seems like you guys are helping each other out which is so great for me to watch I love this and you can also watch this again practices at home join on join the web dev path and you will get way more information than you're getting right now you can't you can't build a tower in one hour yes so join in on the path someone ask some questions about some people ask some questions about the random color or sorry the math.floor and math.random and what's going on there so what I want you guys to realize is javascript already knows what math is math is an object that javascript already understands I added a method called s'more to math that method is saying what the limit is what's the floor of this and that's kind of weird because whether the limit is the but where it's too much or too little is I mean it's just the word that we use for the limit floor inside of that I had math not random and that is a another method on the math object and that is randomly producing numbers from you like the math object so I'm randomly getting numbers from math math holds numbers math holds different math operations like adding and subtracting all sorts of fun things and then after that I am saying for anything in num num is just a random variable that I had there because I just want to call it num it could call it anything really could be dogs cats anything but I just called it num so we have a better understanding what it is and whatever it goes in that num value is what will be the floor and what we will randomly select from so that is why you find num inside of the function but also in the parameter and when I come down to my color change function I have random number with an argument of 255 255 is now replacing num in the random number function and 255 is now my limit and it's what I'm randomly selecting numbers from so anything between 0 and 255 some people ask why 255 that is a more complicated thing but that is because random I'm sorry RGB the color code sitting inside of this sitting inside of this variable RGB color codes only take number 0 to 255 why that is is a conversation for another day but feel free to check that out on your own time or there's plenty of articles and informational Zout there on the web about color codes and why they are the way they are I made I used the number 255 because for the RGB color code 255 is the highest number so what at what's happening in this color change function is every time it is called it's randomly producing numbers and putting them inside of the RGB code for red green and blue and I'm calling it random color so I don't have to keep repeating this long string over and over again and once again in that last line and I have of the function I am call it I'm saying when an event takes place on the target change the background color to a random color and that is what's happening to my original button on click so we are almost done one more line of code to do we are going to say a change the mystery button so mystery button and this time instead of clicking on it I want to be able to scroll on that button in order to make it change so it misteriously randomly gives me something instead of me being able to control it so I'm going to use an event called wheel on wheel equals color change semicolon and then I'm going to run this so when I click on the original button I can change the color well this is a cute green have red we have another blue another green I can randomly change the color by clicking but if I just scroll I mysteriously randomly getting a color now with the on wheel event the color is changing and I actually think that these two colors look excellent next to each other so um how are you guys feeling how are we doing I feel like I'm seeing so much happening in the chat but it's hard to pay attention I mean yes so we just did this for the second button so I'm fall along with this code and you you have now programmed your second color and second button to work Oh in order to see the random colors being picked I would go into so if we go back to that council that we pulled up before this is how some of the other people in the chat we're able to see different errors and things like that when you rightclick on your page and go to inspect some of you guys might see inspect element you can pull up the console inside of that inspect the element inspect this makes you seem so fancy to like pull this out at work and my god they know everything you can go into the console and you can run these functions if you run the function for if you run these functions inside of console.log you can see the different colors being chosen or the different color codes being chosen different random numbers being chosen every time you click for wheel through a body so if you go in there and like copy paste your JavaScript over in there you can play around with the console and see like the background JavaScript working different browsers have different ways of doing this so on Chrome Safari Firefox for the most part you should be able to inspect the element if you're using one of those not as popular browsers you might have to do something different to find it but almost everyone can if you don't know how to google it you'll find it so someone wants to run through one more time no problem at all because we did a lot I'm going to run through this one more time let's start from the beginning we created the HTML that was pretty that wasn't simple enough we created the structure which is the elements like the pictures and the text and the buttons that we're seeing after we did that we created some CSS to make beautiful colors and give things size CreateSpace and then we went into JavaScript which is always a little funkier but once you start like feeling more comfortable with JavaScript you can do anything like legit anything with it it's crazy we went in and the thing that we wanted to do was give the buttons the ability to change color when an event takes place on them an event being something like a click or a scroll we called on the arm buttons inside of the JavaScript one is called original button and mystery button the way we were able to do this is by having a variable and setting it equal to the document I'm getting it out an element inside of the document so we call the document we get the element by ID and we use original button for original button the ID is inside of the HTML so button ID equals original button button ID equals mystery button you're able to call them inside of the JavaScript in the beginning after that we got funky and we needed random numbers for the call for a color code the color code reads numbers and converts those numbers in to colors with red the different values of red green and blue but in order to do that we had to find a way to randomly create numbers so that we don't have to code that ourselves every single time so we created this using the math object the math object is already to be understood but JavaScript already understands math so the math object so by calling the floor method of math and calling the random method of math javascript already knew what that meant and how to do that so we said we want the math floor you want math.random and we want you to use this number that were a placeholder pretty much that we have here after that we change the color we change that color by giving color the parameter of event that's important I will explain as I go so once we have our random color decided we have an event event is a keyword already understood by JavaScript an event just means something is happening to the webpage so an event can you click a scroll it could be anything and we want to target use a target for that event so if I click on the rainbow or if I click on the title nothing happens it might highlight something but nothing is happening to the behavior of the website but if I have a specific target like my buttons something is going to happen to them so when an event takes place on the target that I specify the background color is going to become random color so it was time for me to determine what those targets were so I left that function function was done and I said original button on click color change my original button is the target on click is the event and color change is my function that I just made so when I click on original button the color changes when I wheel or scroll through a mystery button the color changes now if you guys are still want to know more about events this is just one exercise and it's one of the later exercises inside of a much larger lesson about events understanding what they are and how they work and how can I use them now that I understand a little bit more about websites you can find information on that inside of the web dev path and enroll in that class and by the end of by the end of that class something as simple as this will be a piece of cake for you um you will start off though through the path learning HTML and CSS if you don't already know that or if you know those things already you can skip up to the point that you want to be at like JavaScript those things all links to those are all in the project description and you can look through if you look on the side here you can also learn a little bit more about events inside of this MDM reference link that we have here it just explains all the different types of friends there are so if you don't want to do click you can do something different likes like I don't even know like double tap or anything zoom you can create those use those events it will explain how to make those events happen inside of that reference page I've linked so feel free to check that out on your own time if you ever want you and yeah if on wheel is not working for you it could be a browser issue too because um if your browser is a little older it may not understand what unreal is so if that is an issue for you to check out that MDM reference page the link inside of the narrative and that will explain different ways to do it this code is available if you are joining in a little later I mentioned before in the project just in the sorry in the video description there is a link to this project that I'm doing right now there is also going to be a recorded version of what we did here today for you to rewatch whenever you want to share with your friends and also the solution code should be there so some people's buttons are not working for them and things like that feel free to rewatch this and work through it again feel free to grapple around with this content until you feel comfortable with it and that's fine if you got to the end of this and something isn't working that is completely ok watch this again check out the solution code yeah and also check out some of the cool things that these other lawyers have said in here because some people mentioned some things that are that provide other ways to do this so I am going to head out now and go back to writing courses and doing things like that and I really hope you guys enjoyed this we will be having other live sessions there is one next week coming up pay attention on Twitter pay attention on YouTube subscribe like this comment on this and stay connected with us so you guys know about the other ones dropping we have things from data science to computer science to web dev and funky things in between so just stay connected with us check out all of our paths especially the web depth path that they spoke to you and follow us on Twitter the link is in the project description um thank you so much for joining in today and I am signing up good bye
