google google alright here we go yeah we're live hello everybody welcome thank you for stopping by today we are kicking off our third hackathon in the community with code academy today and what we're hoping to do today is answer as many questions that we as we can about participating in the hackathon what to do what you are expected to do what you expected to submit for the hackathon hasla as well as answering questions about judging or prices or anything else that has to do with the hackathon so let me go ahead and start sharing my screen and i'm gonna walk you through some of the details everybody here we go all right i think if i go in presentation mode it will look like big for everybody right great all right so well community hackathon number three build a site with code academy workspaces so if anybody if you haven't heard code academy has this thing called workspaces now and it looks a lot like a code sandbox that you can do online so you can code you can edit it you can share with people and you can run your code online and the obvious benefit of that is that you have your code on the cloud so anything happens to your file so you go to another device or something all you have to do is log into codeacademy.com to get you your code so the overview for today and don't worry everybody will be sharing these slides after the presentation so uh you can take notes now or just look at the slides later we are going to be talking about the timeline the judgings and the prices for the community hackathon number three uh the timeline as you can see is split in four parts the kickoff is today and that's when the time the sign ups for the team start and you can sign up for your team all the way between now and monday december 13th at 9 00 am that's when we're gonna have the cut off to sign up for your team uh the project submission deadline that is when we are expecting you to submit your work and that you've done for this hackathon and that will be friday december 17th at 5pm eastern that's new york city time and the awards live stream will be the following wednesday december 22nd at 2 30 p.m eastern time uh some questions that you might have right now is uh what happens if i submit my my work late well it doesn't get submitted that's why it's a deadline uh what happens if i can attend the awards live stream well you should try to have at least one member of your team be there because that way we can you know give you proper clout and recognize your hard work during the week of the hackathon but i'll be obviously if you if there's absolutely no chance for you to show just let us know judging the we have three judges we thought for with us from code academy the curriculum team and the three of us the three of them are here with me in the call we'll have some q a after we explain the rules don't worry and you can ask them any questions that you may have about submitting work submitting your or running through the hackathon prices so um there's two prices uh it depends on what you prefer you can either get a free pro with code academy or you can get some sweet code merch like tshirts so some people like the swag some people like the free pro for access to the catalog depends on you hackathon theme we are going to be focusing in the holidays and the holiday spirit which is usually you want to help people you want to be generous so what we are hoping is that every team that will participate in this hackathon will build a site to their favorite cause or their favorite nonprofit organization imagine that you've been hired by them to build them a website sort of thing and you build the prototype for the website using html css and javascript we want to keep it simple so don't worry about too much about frameworks other more advanced techniques in web development and what you're going to deliver to us is the source code of your work of your team's work has a code academy workspace and a screen recording demo of five minutes or less explaining your work so this is gonna help the judges see better what you meant when you were working on your project because sometimes code might be buggy or because it's a prototype it might not work it's perfectly as you intended it so with this live demo you have a chance to voice over your work and explain to the judges what you were trying to accomplish or what you would have tried to do if you have more time or more resources for the judging guidelines we are going to use three criteria creativity design quality and the live demo so i think that they are selfexplanatory these categories creativity innovation cleverness uh you know the looks of it uh how you use your code the ways that you're trying to be you know do away from templates or what websites typically look like and be more personalized to you or what you think your vision for this website is the design quality obviously you know websites have images assets uh fonts titles you know everything that has to do with the design of your website and the live demo obviously we're hoping that you will put some time in the screen recording and make it as easy for us to judge as possible you're going to be scoring five points per category and at the end of the during the awards ceremony on wednesday 22nd we'll be sharing how all the teams are stacked up so full transparency for the live demo i'm sure that you have some questions well this live demo what is it how what should we do the live demo um there's some bullet points here for you to read essentially we are hoping that it will be the keyword of you sharing your work face to face with us so if you had imagine you know homework from school and you're sharing it with your professor this is sort of that idea of you want to record your screen you want to show the website you want to see you want to show us what you did what your team worked on uh the functionality of your website anything that you're proud of anything you know maybe you have drop down menus i mean you have dark mode maybe you have uh images that carousel through the website or link so you know anything that you come up with and you want to showcase to us and the judges uh feel free to include that in your demo and obviously try to make the demo uh be as easily watchable as possible that's why we recommend for example tools like loom where you can record your screen upload it to the cloud and then all you have to do is share the link with us but if you do something more traditional like screen software uh screen recording software on your computer then make sure that you upload it to a place like google drive dropbox or somewhere where you can give us a link to the video because otherwise we won't be able to watch it deliverables like i was saying um your code and the live demo just two things once your team once you sign up with your team uh and we have a list of all the teams we'll be contacting you with further details on how to submit your live demo and how to submit your code but like i explained at the very beginning code academy workspaces works a lot like any other cloudbased ide so as you work there and you run your code you will have the a button that says share publicly and you will just be sharing that with us the judges before the deadline submission and that's what we will use to look at your code and see what you did and judge you for it um all participants team will get an email yep so like i said you will get an email once you submit once you sign up with your team yes the awards free month of pro for every team member that you have or merchandise i think the tshirt is pretty sweet i'm wearing my hoodie right now from code academy if you want to represent and you want to flex around your friends and your family that you know you learn at code academy i think choosing the merch might be a better idea but up to you i think both prices are cool at the end of the day hackathons are all about learning and working and collaborating with other people so even if you don't think that you have a chance to win or even if you think that maybe you don't know enough to win the competition the competition itself is still a great catalyst for you to focus in doing something a lot of times we have people at code academy that are learning with us but they struggle finding projects to build or things to do so take this as a cue of something that you could be learning you could be building what you're learning with code academy all right so that's all the information we have for you today i hope that that was pretty clear and selfexplanatory like i said we'll be sharing this information with you later let's go to the q a i'm gonna stop my screen sharing all right let's check the chat so any questions that we might have let's see dennis earlier asked can i find a team to join if i'm alone would you want to answer that yes so let me just type it in the chat real quick so we have a discord server and what you can do oh they'll also share that so we have a discord server for community what i highly recommend that you do is go to your discord server and we have a channel specifically called find a teammate under the hackathon category go there and say that you're looking for a teammate uh or if somebody's already looking for teammates and you're also looking for teammates just you know message them or tag them instead of uh you know posting your own up to you but we're going to have that channel set up for there some people are saying can we use some libraries like 3js jquery um i don't know just what you think is that um what do you think sure i i don't see why not uh we made the i guess like we said you should be creating a css jsc um html website because we don't want you to be constrained about having to use those frameworks but if you already know those frameworks or if you won't even try learning a framework during the week of the hackathon go for it great yeah that's uh i think that kind of summarizes the the idea pretty well thank you yuan uh the idea is that we want this to be accessible to anyone so even if you only know html we want you to also submit something and work on this because it's just fun but if you know advanced frameworks you know feel free to use those too we just feel that it's more about what you build and how you build it at this point even though you get scored for some of that but we mostly just want to see the creativity and the design of the website itself we have questions here about uh oh yep uh we we specifically in the judging criteria do not include like complexity as part of what you're being judged on this is about creativity and you know the message you're showing and your ability to demonstrate it uh feel free to use the tools that you're comfortable with don't worry too much about making it super advanced and technical good point thanks nick yeah uh i think that's a third point let's see more questions how do i sign up i can be a oneman army uh so we're hoping that you can build a team of at least two it's gonna be two to four people per team and good point about how you sign up so let me share this with the chat right now thank you everybody for stopping by here is the form so take that form copy save it put it somewhere because uh this is the only place you're gonna find it so take the form save it um and that's the form you can use to sign up for yourself and your teammates questions can we add that link to the video description later maybe it'll also be easier to access we might yeah we'll look at it and see if we can add it to the description of the video um let's see other questions i see one about whether every hackathon is web dev related and the answer is no i think i've i've definitely seen a mobile one as well as a data science one i think yep yes uh hackathon number two a couple months back was about uh mobile development it was about swift ui using the strip ui course that code academy has so every hackathon changes we just hope to be as inclusive as we can for all disciplines and all fields uh somebody says frameworks out of js like django are allowed yeah so like we said before like do you want to network pointed out uh it's not so much about the tools that you use use any tools you're comfortable with it's more about the website that you build and how you present it how you demo it and why you did it the way you did it so uh we won't be judging you there's no criteria scoring criteria for technicality or difficulty of the code execution so yes you can go very deep and build an amazing super complex website but just keep in mind that there's no criteria for that in the judging but are our languages outside of javascript such as python allowed for this i think yeah because django is a python beast i think i was 21. really anything on the on the web goes for me really like if you prefer making websites using django sure why not really like the reason again like what nick said um the reason why we said html css and js is because we don't want the technical constraints to be a blocker for you to participate in the hackathon great i think there was a question earlier about uh video uh formatting so uh just you know something that we can play really i mean mp4 is pretty standard across the web but if it's another format as soon as we can play it it will be okay if it's a very obscure video format that we can play then obviously we won't be able to use it to judge your submission but if it's a pretty standard video format should be okay let's see can you please tell me what's this hackathon about oh uh hamid well sorry that you joined late uh don't worry you can replay this uh this video later uh once this live stream is over it becomes a video on a youtube channel so you can just go replay it back what is the theme just a website stefano so that was part of the yeah presentation the theme is find a nonprofit organization or cause that you are very passionate about and have your team build a website for that organization or that cost is the pro price for monthly on your subscription monthly so each team member in your each member of your team will get one month of free pro access do you need a subscription before you can sign up uh no uh the hackathon so i think workspaces is open free am i correct right we made them free yeah so all you really need is a login for code academy so once you go to codeacammy.com and you're signed in you will see that there is this uh area called workspaces and you can just create one and work there there was also another question about whether you should use backend also you don't have to but if you feel like you can and you want to for whatever reason why not yeah you could do a backend but obviously if you're running your html css service group you're running your web your front whether you're bank code on something like the workspaces it just runs it for you how we how can we get all the details of the hackathon is over so uh you can rewatch this presentation obviously and we will also be contacting all the signed up teams after they they've signed up for the hackathon so like i said i will share the uh the link again and the chat that is the form you want to use to sign up for the hackathon and then we'll follow up with that any other questions from anyone maybe the cat has a question david is a cat is the cat a front end or a black end developer he's definitely full stack full stack i don't know [Laughter] it's full stack the main target is design am i right uh well you're also getting score for creativity and the live demo so uh yes it's more front than heavy the back end heavy i would say that's a fair that's a fair assumption can you put me in a team so hamid um we have a community discord server and we have a channel inside the community server called find the team for the hackathon you will be able you should be able to go there and ask people if they are looking for teammates or find your own team how many should be on a team two to four minimum two maximum four people per team should we do a quick round of um intro my fellow judges sure thing they could kick us off sure uh so my name is david patlett i'm a senior curriculum developer at codecademy um on the web development team um and i just my background in general i study computer science and i've worked as a software engineer and also as a curriculum developer and educator in the tech space i passed it over to you g1 thank you my name is jiwan shin i am also a senior curriculum developer in the web development domain uh a little bit of my background i also have a cs degree but i've mostly for the past couple years have been more in the creative tech space so creative coding so if you are interested in it we have a lmp5 course that you can also check out and incorporate into the hackathon sorry shameless um plug there um and yeah and i will pass it over to nick hi i'm nick stern uh i'm a curriculum developer here at codecademy uh i have a background in cloud engineering and i was a professor of computer science for several years before i joined here and i guess i'm not a judge but i'm here hello uh i'm feder and i'm with the community team uh code academy are you sure i thought people would know you well at this point you know what it's the internet is a really big place um oh yeah i think we had a question here everyone doesn't know do we have to find a nonprofit organization or can we build one based on what we think about so that's an interesting question uh i guess since we are including causes in general as well it doesn't have to be a specific organization like you know doctors without borders or something uh if there is just a specific cause that you believe in or that you're passionate about i think that is fair game to build a website around that too and i guess if you want to make up a organization based around that cause uh go for it that sounds fun i think a good any cat organization is a good organization i'm more of a dog person but i will let it slip um can any of you say okay that's not related okay somebody asked about the slow mode in the chat and the team fine match so the reason we added the slow mode is uh to allow everybody to have a good chance of posting you know they're looking for a teammate so uh i think one post every 10 minutes is pretty fair when you're looking for teammates like that's not a channel that we are if you want to chat with your teammates or if you find somebody want to talk with feel free to tag them in the general channel and other channels that we have on our discord server and doctor we want to keep that channel just to find teammates i think we have one more question um does it have to be live website or just coding workspace well if it works when you run the workspace it will render the website so if i'm understanding this question correctly does have to be a live website of so if you're asking do you have to host the website the answer is no so you can you can just submit the link to your public workspace to us the to the judges me and we'll be able to see your code and to run your code uh you don't have to worry about you know going to digital ocean or you know haruku or somewhere to find to host your website now it doesn't have to be like a hosted website it just needs to run i mean even if it doesn't run like we said it's a prototype so even if it doesn't run you can still submit it okay um yeah should it be deployed on aws no no no yeah no no hosting no problem uh yeah workspaces works a lot like riplet or code sandbox or things like this where you can just put your code hit run and it renders the website for you on the site so that's that's all we need okay well we are time so thank you to the judges and everybody else to stop by i'm going to share the link to sign up one more time in the chat there you have it the form um feel free to go to this store if you want to find a teammate feel free to use that form to sign up for your team and also just go anywhere else you're looking for a teammate i mean you know our facebook group is pretty it's pretty full of people there i'm sure that some people are looking for teammates for the hackathon or find friends and family that you know in your other social media and all the connections online you know it doesn't you don't have to be a code academy student just find people all you need is the code economy login and technically only one person needs the login to use the workspaces so get creative with it and hope to see all of you and what you work on next week submissions thank you thank you everybody bye
