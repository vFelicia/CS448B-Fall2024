foreign hello hey everyone welcome back to this final live stream in our threepart journey through code Academy's Evolution today we're looking at one of our brand new courses intro to generative AI I'm Corey c code Academy's content marketing manager and I'm joined by Betty Garcia Lorca our community manager who you probably recognize from these live streams and forums and Discord as well as Adam Herman curriculum manager at code academy who will be walking us through this lesson and then over in the chat we have Alicia grama a senior curriculum developer who is on hand to answer all of your questions live so in case you haven't heard it's code Academy's birthday tomorrow we're turning 12 almost a teenager um the tech world has has changed a lot since we started out in 2011 and one of the biggest Transformations happened just last year when the research company opened AI launched the generative AI chatbot chat GPT and I'm curious how many of you here use Chachi BT to code or for work or just for fun let us know in the chat we recently launched a bunch of brand new AI courses and case studies that'll teach you how to use and build AI systems like these in a thoughtful responsible and inventive way uh but today Adam's going to show us how to make an original children's book with generative AI using our free beginner friendly course intro to generative AI as a guide this is a fun use for AI but it's also a very practical one if you say need some more bedtime stories in your rotation or you're a teacher of young children or you just need a clever gift idea for a kid in your life but keep in mind that you can go and take this course whenever you want on your own time and it's linked in the description below before we get into it let me tell you a little bit about Adam he started as a classroom teacher before moving in to Tech and now he's the curriculum manager at codecademy where he does strategy work for articles and code academy docs and has recently been working on producing new generative AI content for us hi Adam hey Corey hey I wanted to ask you a question before you jump into it um do you use generative AI Tools in your daily life and if so how that is a great question Corey so I think what's so interesting in general about like this moment with chair and of AI is that we are in kind of like a state of play with it of this is such a different cool interesting technology and we are still constantly finding new ways of integrating it both into our work lives and into our personal lives and something that was uh really drove this home for me was um like a month or two months ago I I am a fairly mediocre Chef um but I I try and I wanted to make a meat sauce and I was very intimidated so I went to Chachi BT and I said you know I'm a beginner level Chef I want to make a meat sauce I want to be this many servings what do I do and it spit out a whole recipe for me and the part where it got really really cool was I can then ask okay well how do I get oil out then or how do I chop the garlic pasta properly so you could keep digging in in a way that you don't get with things like a Search tool or other research tools and it is okay that's what I'm wanting to know surprisingly yes um there is a screenshot that thank you for asking um there's a screenshot of the recipe on my phone I'm very proud of it um so yes the the robot had good taste in food somehow love it thank you and that's the kind of thinking I think we're all working on and something I hope to encourage in all of you from today is not just what can these Technologies do it's how can they interact with each other how can they interact with our lives to change how we work and interact so go I'm going to share my screen with all of you and let's get into this course we'll be going through so the course is intro to generated Ai and as the name implies this is a introductory course going through different types of generative AI tooling and how people are using it we'll also be going into as Corey implied earlier how to use this technology responsibly and some of the interesting ethical conversations happening in this space right now I am not going to go too much into how to program with serendive AI we do have a lot of really great content around that that this is more for people looking to see what this technology is and how people are using it so why are we going to cover we're going to be doing an intro to the course and what it is I'll be going into this generative AI content workflow so I'll be showing you as I create this children's story how these different Technologies can be used together and what responsibilities we have as human users to make sure that the content is accurate and safe and as well as going into those ethical considerations I talked about before and then finally we're going to do a wrap up with some q a between myself and FedEx so over this you should be learning what generative AI is the different types of generative AI in their use cases and as I said before those ethical concerns and considerations so let's hop into the course so the course as I said is intro to generative AI and the author of this course Alicia grama is actually in the chat uh here today so she's here to answer any specific questions you may have about the course content so before anything else just what is generative AI um generative AI is a very Advanced learning uh model that uses that is trained on millions of different texts images uh code samples and what is more than anything is a synthesizer so it can take all of that information look for certain patterns and create an output system so to address the first thing is is it intelligent depends how you define intelligence uh a generative AI could not create something wholly new per se what it does is create an amalgamation of other things that have been input into it if you want to get philosophical about it that's everything that anyone makes is that but obviously it doesn't make it in a selfconscious way which is arguably where that intelligence happens but um whether or not it's AI it is really cool and very inventive and efficient in what it can do and what we're trying to figure out is at what point does the work that the AI can do end and human work begins and how I typically have learned to divide it there's a uh great book called range uh by an author named David Epstein and he talks about the difference between kind systems and wicked systems a kind system is something like uh chess it's something like uh maybe um certain types of legal work where it's happening within a very set system in which there are defined rules uh AI do very very well in kind system problem solving it's why AI um initially when I came onto the scene one of the most high profile things it could do was play chess uh humans are very good at Wicked problems they are good at high level strategy taking disparate pieces information and creating something cohesive out of it so throughout this I'll be showing you how to use AI to get to a point that you can begin as a human iterating on what you're using and making it something wholly better in original and suited to your purposes foreign so the first thing uh we'll be talking about is textbased generative AI this is probably the most famous or splashiest of the technologies that we've seen uh most famously chat gbt but there are also resources like bards that you can use I'll point out that within this course we have a fake GPT that uh we have a really brilliant interactive developer named Wesley on the team who made this for us and it simulates chat TBT right in our learning environment so I can click that and click play and it will generate an answer similar to in the chat TPT experience is right now the most famous but you also have other resources like bards produced by Google that are very popular I would say like anything else different tooling has different strengths and weaknesses uh chat gbt in my experience is a little bit more um quote unquote creative in one can come up with whereas Bard I think is stronger as a research tool in that it has builtin citations so it's August if you're in the southern state you've already started school if you're uh in New York where I live Schools starting up in a couple of weeks and then you're an educator may be thinking about how to use these Technologies in the classroom um that's a situation where I may recommend something like Bard and it's better citation unless you're doing something like a creative writing exercise which is what we'll be doing now actually so I'm going to take chat gbt and share that here and I want to create this children's story now on a personal note I am a uh proud Uncle of two uh fiveyearold nephews they are entering first grades this year and like many fiveyearold boys they love dinosaurs and they love jeeps and I I want to as a start of the school year gift make them a story so something I think is really cool about Chachi BT is if you're not sure where to get started with your prompts you can just ask it ask for a prompt so I'm going to open this up and I'm going to ask it for five prompts for a children's story about twin brothers who go on an adventure on the Dinosaur Island to be clear in terms of Dinosaur Island I'm thinking more um Savage lands from XMen versus um you know the island in Jurassic Park I would not send a child to the island in Jurassic Park that would just be irresponsible but of those five prompts I asked for I asked for two prompts that would be funny two that would be scary and one that would be random this is a way of me engineering my prompt to see different options this is me leveraging what this generative AI can do versus me acting as myself in a brainstorming capacity so ask that to run and we can see some of these options come up and we have a dino race day Dino picnic party lost in a dark Roar of Doom love upon fantastic and Dino Dance Fusion uh We've also named the twins Max and Leo that's fun and I'm looking through and I think the picnic party sounds good so I'm going to start I'm going to copy this and paste it and we're going to continue but I'm also going to refine refine this prompt a little bit more so I'm going to type create a 1000 to 1500 word story about off of the following prompt and I'll click play Emma watched that story show up now this is where this um human AI relationship comes in I am not going to take this story and immediately read it to my nephews there may be things that are not ageappropriate there may be things that are nonsensical there may be things just that I know within my own personal taste I wouldn't want in the story so that's where I am going to go in and refine that process but just in the length of me giving that explanation this entire story was generated and I can copy it to this clipboard and paste it separately where I can continue to work on it so going back to the course we're going to talk a bit more now about image based generative AI so what I just showed you was chat and some of those different techniques for the prompting process within chat and now we're going to do image image very similar of whereas instead of being trained on text these sharing of AIS have been trained on images so different art styles schools um kind of considerations like that that allows to make some really cool stuff and it is technically text to image we are including text and getting an image back so generate a futuristic version of the Mona Lisa and we might get something like this now for the purposes of this live stream I'm going to be using uh Dolly too but I encourage you to look into other resources like midjourney stable diffusion like I said with Google bard and chat gbt different tools have different strengths and weaknesses and I encourage you to explore that there are also more professional resources that you can pay for to use because this is based off of a free course I'll just be going through free or fairly inexpensive Resources with you today so I have uh Dolly up here and I'm uh as Corey mentioned at the beginning of the presentation of the live stream my background is as a history teacher and I am a dork for a good map love a map and I think that's something that would really enhance this story so I'm going to ask uh create a another create a map of a Dinosaur Island in the style of a 1600s nautical map when I say A nautical map I'm thinking of those you know kind of old school Maps where you have the dragon in the corner and you know there's sea monsters all over the place um and this is what we've gone in here are a few of these different options that we can click and go through and I have to say I kind of love this one I love the abstract shapes I like how there's this idea of signage but I'm also curious if we can drill down on just this format a little bit more so I'm going to click on variations and this is a way of continuing to prompt and guide this machine to give us an output that we want um ultimately generative AI is still a computer and computers want nothing more than to make us happy but we need to ask them for what we want correctly and this is an example of that the more specific and targeted are prompts the better the output is going to get and we have some more of these Maps more of this weathered style I actually like this one I like that there's kind of this foggy area around that that makes it feel much more serious and you'll notice here that I have the option to save this share it download it and it's from here I may move it into something like a Photoshop where I can continue to edit it and work on it and I think this will be a great cover or companion piece to our story so before I go to the next one I'm curious uh Fede or Corey are there any questions in the chat I'm taking a look uh seems like we are answering them as they come so we're good all right fantastic I'll just keep keep on keeping on them all right all right this is actually a really good thing to know so you'll notice that this hasn't loaded for me yet I can just go over here and say restore default workspace and that will allow me to see this applet again so the next thing we're going to be talking about is audio based generative AI this is something I think is both really cool and probably one of the most interestingly challenging gerund of AIT utilize compared to image and text so this is something that can be used in things like Music Creation audio creation um while we're getting into some of those ethical considerations think about how different artists have very distinct musical styles so if you're creating generative music are you allowed to say I want this to sound like a Bob Dylan song where that's an artist who has a very specific sound and feel to his music there was a really interesting case uh fairly recently of someone posting a song on Spotify that sounded like a Drake and the weekend song and it was entirely made through generative music where it's less ethically messy is if you're um a video editor if you are trying to maybe get started with mixing music and playing around with that yourself it's a great way of quickly creating a background track to take and then use as a base to work on so similar as this create a calming song and we have this recording here I was fortunate enough to get a um trial into music LM which is Google's attempt at getting started with gerund of music it's free and it's very fun to play around with so the reason why I said this was interestingly challenging is you know our our eyes are our primary sets right so we're very good at describing things we see and we're very good at communicating so for asking for a text or asking for an image we intuitively know how to be very exact in what we ask for I do not have a particularly strong background in music theory so I can't ask this program to be specific you know to ask for it to be in a certain chord or something like that I don't know how to do that but what I find really cool about this tool is that it can work within a certain mood so I had that up there before but I'm going to say a happy song um with an adventurous tune good for exploring a jungle and I'm going to see how it does with that it's going to give it a moment of looking and I actually like this quite a bit um I apologize I'm not sure if you're able to hear the audio on your end but it came in a really interesting way what I do find with the music LM is it can sound a little tinny which is really interesting to me I'm not sure why that is but again this is where you can take this download this track and go forward I'll also add that there's a really cool um rating system that they have this is how they're training their AI so for every prompt you actually get two song objects and I actually like this one more so I'm going to give it a trophy got a little confetti oh all right um I'm glad to hear that you were able to hear it and from here you can click it and download it or send feedback and continue to work on it all right so let's go back over to the course oh so right now um I now have my text I have my cover and I have background music to play now there's other things I could do I could get a voice to text to read it out although most voice text tools are not guarant of AI they may use AI button um sharing of AI is a fairly specific thing and I may want to create a video which would be the next slide now I am not um going to take you through that process just because video editing is obviously a more extensive process we would be here for the next hour as I click through and check audio levels that's not going to be fun for anyone but I will talk a little bit Ah I think it's having a little trouble because I'm zoomed in that's okay so this is really interesting though and there's been a lot of very interesting controversy around uh the applications of AI and video you know there was um Prince's likeness being used during the Super Bowl in Minnesota a couple of years ago a lot of this um current strike in Hollywood is around actors being paid a lump sum to have their AI likeness used in perpetuity by Studios and what does that mean and that's a really interesting place of what we're talking about in a bit which is this intersection of new technology and ethics of what does a technology like this represent for people's labor for their control over their likeness um these are things that will have to consider over the coming years and we'll have to figure out a lot very quickly on the plus side generative AI videos boost productivity it allows you to create things faster and will likely lead to furthering this you know really incredible artistic explosion we've seen since YouTube was invented of this democratization of Art and in overall increase in quality so I'm I'm really excited to see what generated video can do as long as we're using it in a way that isn't uh alienated for people and that is something if you're someone who is considering using generative video themselves um to consider all right risks and limitations of Darren of AI I really like this and this is something I'll say is really important to us at code academy is as I've said a couple times this technology is really exciting and there's so much it can do in so much it will do uh as a transformative thing but we need to also understand it for what it is so that we don't overly rely on it or use it irresponsibly so the first thing I'll say is at least for now these AIS view any information that's input into them equally so it won't necessarily know what information is private versus what information is public that you would put in so you'll know this when I was creating this story I didn't add the names of my nephews I also didn't add a picture of them when I was playing around with an Island map for Dolly that's because there's a chance that once I click in that information that now lives within the generative Ai and may be used in future models there's a lot of controversy right now um I was reading even this morning that the New York Times may be suing open AI because of how much chat CBT was trained on the New York Times articles I've also seen comic artists who have very specific Styles or viewpoints have their work used through generative AI by different groups maybe groups who don't represent their political Outlook or social Outlook but it still looks like their work so there's a lot of interesting conversations right now going on of again like how do we use this correctly and responsibly I'll also add this in terms of data so tactivities are really a good tool for coding we actually have a case study up right now on how to debug your code using chat gbt or how to simulate paired programming with chat gbt that's something we'll be having out on the website within the next couple of weeks but keep in mind any codes you put on to chat TPT now lives there and is now within that system so if there is code that is unique to yourself or unique to the organization that you work for you really should not be testing it within uh chat gbt another limitation to talk about is hallucination so Hallucination is something really interesting to me because it's something that feels very alien but is actually something humans do as well in that what this machine does what DDT does and other alternative AI is that it looks for patterns and then takes those patterns and says okay based off these patterns I am going to come to these conclusions and it doesn't know if it's true or false it just knows that within the pattern it would make sense for that to be true so it's the same way of you know maybe looking at something and saying okay um so I Ferris wheels um thinking okay that is was probably invented by a guy named Ferris which by the way it was but if it wasn't that would be a hallucination of because it's a word and then a thing after it I am going to assume okay actually the better example uh if I'm using duct tape there is no uh Mr or miss duck in the world it's just called duct tape so that would be a human hallucination a pattern misunderstanding and the problem with cat gbt is that it will deliver this information factually so this is why while something like this is a very useful research tool in a limited capacity um you shouldn't use it to make more complex decisions so to give an example I recently wanted to take my wife out for a date in Queens where I live so I asked for 10 data ideas in Queens for under thirty dollars and I promise I'm generally not cheap I was just curious to see what would come from it and what came out was a lot of different answers but not everything was in Queens some was in Brooklyn someone was in Manhattan because what it probably did was look at hundreds if not thousands of websites that have fun date idea or fun cheap date idea lists in New York City and didn't narrow it down correctly so the process of verification is very important when using generative AI for doing any kind of research if you're doing something like what I just did which is a more creative exercise that's fine don't have to worry about that as much um but definitely if you're doing something for work all right and last is these ethical questions which I've been talking about throughout so things like where does work begin and end and how this credit for that work work we are actually talking about this a lot internally at codecademy so at I help manage something called codecademy docs which is an open contribution tool and we've had discussions internally of if someone submits something that was created by a generated AI did they write it and we've had conversations and we still are not 100 happy with the answer that we have which is if someone used generative AI as a base and then augmented it and made it their own to a point that it's their own work that's fine but that vagueness of at what point does it go from being more artificially intelligently created versus human created is a very interesting and sticky question that will probably be working through for a while again going back to the writer strike just because that's such a big thing in our cultural conversation right now if someone gets an idea for a TV episode from gerund of AI and then writes it do they get credit for that idea um think about highly serialized shows like a law and order or Chicago Fire or an um Gray's Anatomy generative AI could probably write at least the beginning of a script for those shows because they've been going for so long there's a certain flow and feel to those scripts so what does it mean for things like that in the future there's also issues of data and how it's interpreted so chat TBT again doesn't make assumptions it merely takes things in and outputs what it sees in terms of the patterns so if it's looking at things like government data things like that and ask for reports it will not be able to look at it through a human lens only um through exactly what it seats so there's a lot of stuff where we don't again go through the trouble of verifying checking coming to our own conclusions it can lead to um incomplete views of the world thank you for someone who said duct that was I I actually uh questioned myself and I was like is it duck or ducked it is ducked but again there's no Mr dot as far as I'm aware or misstocked all right so that is the overview of the course but again we have a lot of other really great AI content both for introductory levels like our case studies our um docs entries we have tutorial articles we have our intro to chat TPT course we have a lot of great content we also have more advanced AI content um that you can check out on our site we have an AI Hub it's awesome I would highly encourage you to check it out so that's everything for my presentation so if um buddy if you want to do any questions we can use that time for you know next 10 minutes absolutely thank you so much for the presentation that was awesome very instructive I think everybody enjoyed it in the chat uh yeah so I'm going to just ask the chat to collect their thoughts and think about questions that they want to ask you I'll be reading them through as they come in and then Adam you can give us your thoughts and your takes on the questions from the audience so please do share them in the chat I will ask you a question of my own while we wait for people to submit their own questions and I was wondering looking at generative Ai and how the term AI in general is thrown around uh you touched on this during the representation that generative AI is different it's very specific type of AI so do you see that uh misconceptions of what AI does between the different types or like different flavors of AI is that something that you see people confusing and maybe leading up to uh maybe using AI wrong like it's an amazing tool but you still need to know what is it that is going to give you what to expect that's a really interesting question father um I would say it's there's two aspects to it right which is people are using generative AI machine learning in AI interchangeably a lot of the time and they're not interchangeable so we had AI in our lives for a really long time um maybe just not in ways we see or ways we think about so for example on a lot of our smartphones we have a Siri or you know a Google Assistant Siri actually just turned on for me so that that's on me um helping out and it will creep me out when my phone will say hey it's um 6 a.m like you usually take you know you eat at this time so like do you want to eat breakfast and that's so creepy but it's just pattern recognition and that's the kind of thing that AI is good for is that I'll put them into my calendar a lot like eat breakfast or I'll you know um a better example would be on Thursdays at six o'clock I call my parents and I might get a reminder for my phone to call my parents that's AI or the ranking we see on social media of knowing how to kind of curate our feed a certain way is an AI being used that's not a generative AI it's not as smart as what we see but it is an implementation of that um machine learning I don't have the strongest background in admittedly um but I'll say again it's a use of large uh amounts of data to come to different conclusions it's not necessarily generative there's perhaps more of a human component in there in terms of how people think about it we're already seeing companies um lay off certain employees because they think they'll be able to replace some with gerund of AI I think they're going to be sorely surprised um how much they miss people because I think it this will not destroy jobs so much as displaced them so it's not that a job will fundamentally disappear it's that perhaps a starting job as a copywriter you'll be doing a lot more copy editing of content that I generated AI created which is ultimately in my opinion probably a little bit more interesting work you're thinking a little bit more strategically about content um but I think people are in a little bit of a rush to say this is going to like utterly change the world I I don't think we're there quite yet okay fair enough thank you for your answer I see a question in the chat from Matthew uh has someone who is learning to program at the present moment would you recommend using the AI to assist with code now on an early stage of learning or learn to write code without a without Ai and use it later that's such an interesting question um I've wondered about this a lot myself of everyone remembers being in math class and being told hey well everyone over 25 26 remembers being in math class and being told you're not going to have a calculator everywhere you go so you need to learn how to do math this way and surprise we have calculators on us everywhere we go and I do wonder is that going to be the case with coding of there's so much that's going to be taking care of you through the generative AI that um the amount you'll have to learn or how you'll learn will be different well I will say though if we stay within this math example is even if you are using a calculator you still need number sense you still need to know the rules of math and how different equations relate to each other for how to implement them so I would say if you are just getting started out learning to code it's still important to learn how that code Works what's unique about that language what it does um and the Mechanics for it before going to generative AI because if you go to Giant of AI immediately you'll be more using something without fully understanding it and especially if you plan to work as a programmer that puts you in a very vulnerable position it sounds to me a little bit like the analogy of the bicycle and walking where the bicycle will make you move faster but you still need to know where you're going I love that um I was also thinking it's like the difference between knowing how to drive from a car and being a mechanic uh um I know it has four wheels but I couldn't I think it's very selfexplanatory for anyone that thinks that AI can do it all if you just don't have like you said any knowledge any sense of the code I becomes very obvious very quickly that you you're not going to get very far tools uh let's see looking at the chat somebody said generative AI doesn't always give facts but rather recognizes patterns this can become very convincing how can we ensure that we don't fully believe it I guess the question is about how to vet the answers you're getting from AI how do you know because it can be very convincing sometimes it's just you know the AI sounds like it knows what it's talking about yeah um this may come as a surprise to people but sometimes there's misinformation on the internet just in general um and again this is the former history teacher in me of it's always good to verify information and we know there are certain sources that are more trustworthy there are the Wikipedia is actually shockingly trustworthy in a lot of ways um respected news organizations uh scientific journals that we can check in on information I would say again it depends what kind of information you're looking for if you're a look if you are planning um a vacation and you're just looking at things to do in Dallas that's probably fine you don't have to worry about it too much maybe if you plan to book something you'll end up verifying it that way however if you are looking up something um more scientific then yes you shouldn't or certain treatments for something first of all call a doctor don't use generative AI to treat a cult um but also make sure to verify I'll also say I feel like some people are worried about that when they talk about Job displacement what if there is a cheaper medical tier which is AI enabled and for and to talk to a real human you have to get through an AI first right so that that is really interesting um give me a moment so a uh podcast I listen to It's called philosophize this did a um the host is a man named Stephen West he did a whole episode on gerund of AI and its meaning and he actually talked about medicine specifically and how there could be really exciting applications in that there are just so many doctors in the world and you do see kind of a natural um choke point in that you have a lot of people that need care and only a certain amount of doctors who can provide that care and we don't have it now but maybe in five years ten years there will be a generative AI that is sufficiently trained to accurately provide um medical advice to people at least for lowlevel things so that doctors can focus on bigger concerns I'm thinking specifically of um a family member who recently had a child and has been calling my poor cousin who's a pediatrician every two days saying is this normal is this normal is this normal having a generative AI tool that's trained to reliably help provide medical information would really be a game changer for situations like that but again we are not there yet another jail right I think we are this might be related to what we're just talking about a little bit uh there was a user in the chat asking about the degradation of AI by saying if AI generated content enters the data sets the future AIS will be trained on do you have some sort of vicious spiral where the data just keeps getting worse and worse because it's you know it's sort of feeding itself have you have you read into this do you do you think that this could become a problem no but that's scary um again it's one of those things of we just need to be mindful of the pitfalls with any new technology and build robust systems to incorporate it and use it responsibly like maybe this means um and I've had conversations with people on our data science team um about this that we need to be really disciplined about having clean clear data before inputting anything into a generative AI which is again something we should be doing anyway and is a big problem in the field of data is bad data so we're kind of there already so it's it's more of a matter of again like making sure we adapt in a responsible way and I think in terms of it being a spiral I don't know about that I could definitely see it getting worse before it gets better because humans are reactive we like to create a problem for ourselves before we solve it but I don't think it will cause you know some kind of data apocalypse uh going on about the pattern recognition that you talked to during the presentation someone is asking in the chat if generative AI could be used to leverage business Analytics so I guess the field of statistics and math is something that ji jnai can work on um yeah so this is where I was talking about different types of tooling so chat EBT can do very basic things so in my own work I think a lot about search engine optimization so how well things rank on Google and you can go on chat gbt and say what are best practices for SEO and it will give you something pretty good I can't go into chat TBT and say give me a full SEO strategy based off like these metrics in the company because one I'd be giving chat to BT a lot of information about code academy that I shouldn't be and to it doesn't know enough about the specifics of our context to give good information in terms of business analytics that's a long way of me saying yes I imagine there is Jared toong that could do that very well it would likely be a paid tool and we're in a bit of a wild west era where maybe in a year or two years there will be a tool with that sophisticated um to be able to do that if there is I don't know of it yet nice I think it reminds me do you feel like this is a bit like the revolution with computers back in the 80s or the 90s where computers were getting fast enough that they they were actually useful to solve scientific questions and problems and simulations and at the time uh there was this problem where you not you didn't always know why the computer was giving you the answer it was so it became very important for scientists at the time to know how to how to ask the right question so you would know that is answering your question and it's not just spitting out numbers that you're not really sure what you know if they're actually about what you asked the computer so do you see some similarities with that nowadays with AI where the ability to craft a good prompt and to know the limits of AI and how far that prompt is gonna go how it's going to be interpreted uh it's almost as important as knowing how to use the tool itself uh like your example with uh looking for restaurants in Brooklyn but I can only say yes that was a great I agree yeah um I think that makes complete sense and it's also that these Technologies happen in stages um where they typically start off invented existing being used in very specific Circles of specialists and then you get to where we are where certain applications are found potential is understood and the next phase is building out that infrastructure and systems of use that will allow it to fully be employed in the general population and be as transformative as it has the potential to be so to go way back you know people knew the steam engine was a big deal when it was invented there was another 50 years before we had railroads so we are in the steam engine moment um I'm very interested to see what the railroads will look like fair enough someone was asking about completing code academy courses and then what so um thinking about the AI content that we've released recently we have several courses on it uh how do you see somebody is this sort of do you see these AI courses uh something that goes alongside of machine learning and data science courses do you think that is something complementary or something that should come before or after how do you see the the catalog for somebody that is data curious I guess I think that's a that's really interesting I I would say it depends what you want your outcome to be so if you are just looking to understand what generative AI is um I full you can take these courses do these case studies to see how you might implement it in your work and in your life and that may be enough um how we're thinking of it and how we hope to evolve our curriculum over the rest of the year is to really find a way to work it into your workflows and practices be it as a programmer or a data scientist or a cyber security specialist so we'll um we just put out a new data science course Alicia if you could actually put that in um the chat that covers aspects of data science and AI um I'd also say things like machine learning would be a direction to go in if you're interested in the nittygritty of how it works I would say regardless and you know if you're not doing this already I would encourage you to do so in the chat think about those moments at work and recognizing them as okay this is a place where I could use gerund of AI to make my life a little bit easier and then you can start working to establish yourself on your team in your company as a leader who understands how to use this and put yourself in a real position to be successful in that way okay well I think that I was very solid advice for anyone trying to get into the data field so we have run out of time for Q a and I want to thank everybody for attending today's live stream if you've attended or part one or part two of our series thank you again for coming back for part three if you haven't please check out our YouTube channel where you can find the other two parts of our threepart series on the evolution of code academy we are celebrating our 12 years in online so thank you everybody for for joining us in this journey I hope that it was a fun experience I hope that everybody took something home with them today from Adam I think it was very very good the explanations I learned a lot today and I really hope that if you enjoy this content and you want to see more of these content you consider con creating an account with code academy or at least signing up for for free one don't forget to subscribe to our socials Twitter uh LinkedIn Facebook that sort of thing Instagram so you can stay up to date with all the events that we're having and the ones that we'll have in the future and thank you again Adam for being with us today have a good weekend everybody all right thanks everyone have a good day all right
