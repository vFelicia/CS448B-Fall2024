I'm Jack I'm a software engineer I work on the curriculum platform team well I was working as a like a junior web engineer at a very small ridesharing startup after coming from that I was looking to work on a larger team where I would have people around me that knew what they were doing and could kind of like educate me about what it means to be like just like a professional software engineer be prepared to be humbled you might be like kind of confident cuz you just finished it's like whatever learning program you did and you've acquired all this knowledge and now you're like excited ready to apply it you're gonna feel like wow I've acquired so much and they're gonna get there and they're gonna ask you to do something you're gonna be like oh my god I have no idea how to do this and I think a large part about being an engineer is realizing that that's what being an engineer is is over time you're going to acquire knowledge and know how to reproduce things but I think your biggest values in engineer is being able to like think creatively in new contexts and be able to use the tools that you do know to kind of build a new strategy that you didn't have before I don't even know how you view things it's not a computer scientist anymore but you might you might see things like oh this like operation they have going on here you can think about it as like a procedure of like making a coffee and selling the coffee you can think about modeling the coffee cup is like a class in Java and you can think of modeling the barista as a class and oh what's the relationship of baristas to coffee cups to customers and and you can start doing that with just about anything you experience in life and it's applicable then to various contexts because you can then do that you don't have to write a single line of code but then suddenly you're walking in and making a coffee shop more efficient because you were able to abstract the relationships that people perform and identify points of slowdown and communication breakdown
