everyone my name is elisa and i'm a community manager with codecademy today's quick tip video is about communicating the purpose of your meetup rather than just the category of the gettogether that it is um this is a more theoretical and less practical quick tip than i would usually share but it's still quick and very applicable and once i learned about it from actually this amazing book here i knew that it would make all of your meetup organizing lives better also so i had to share it um so what's this quick tip about a category of a gathering example as being like a wedding or a funeral or a coding meetup is not the same as the purpose of a gathering so like what's that mean i'm going to go example by example to share what that means and how this is going to help you be a better community organizer a wedding for example is a type of gathering but the purpose of the wedding could be to celebrate the love of two people who are starting their lives together or to celebrate to established families who are now blending together but the purpose is to celebrate love and that sets a tone for the type of event that we're going to have a funeral one of the other examples is a type of gathering but the purpose can be completely different depending on a few factors a funeral can be a time to support a family in a time of grief absolutely or if the recently deceased happens to have lived a really good life save some money and have a sense of humor that funeral would be a reason to have a really big party and to celebrate that life those different purposes don't fit the category per se so finally to land this example one last time a coding meetup a meetup is a category usually it's going to be about networking when you end up in a networking event you uh you sort of become robotic and you figure okay well i'm here to meet people so i'm going to hand out business cards but what is the purpose of meet up that's what you as a chapter leader get to decide so some examples of really great purposes that i've come across already and having conversations with you are like to give a safe place to practice uh a judgmentfree song if you will to give a space for sharing ideas about technology um some have been really about the who we are this is a safe place for women and nongender conforming people in tech that is excellent because we now know that the purpose is about this sort of safety that we are creating for those types there's still tons more purposes that you could choose out there but for what i've just stated the purpose is about creating a safe space judgment free everybody belongs here so as i said before a purpose can really help glue your attendees together because when we all know why we're here we actually want to be here versus like oh man i need to go to a birthday party for a threeyearold we're gonna be there and watch them eat cake or it just becomes formulaic and people fall into uh into a routine that has us playing a part rather than being ourselves and when we are playing a part not being ourselves it's difficult to connect so knowing a purpose gives us something to share with fellow attendees that gives us a reason to connect and i can't think of anything better than that so this has been your quick tip um i got the idea from this book again it's the art of gathering by priya parker she's a genius on gatherings in general and i hope that this little tidbit has been helpful for you have a great night
