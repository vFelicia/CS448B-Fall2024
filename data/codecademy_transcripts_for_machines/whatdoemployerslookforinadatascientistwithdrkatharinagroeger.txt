everybody i'm going to pass it on to laura and feel free to introduce yourselves hi everyone welcome to the stream my name is laura i'm the chapter leaper called academy soul and i'm here with fedor who's the community manager for cool academy our guest today is dr katharina groga or dr kat for short dr cat graduated with a phd in chemistry from the humboldt university of berlin in 2018 and she started working for basf a year prior since then dr cat has gained a wealth of experience as a manager some of which she would like to share with us today welcome dr cat and thanks for joining over to you yeah thank both of you thanks peter thanks laura and also thanks for the opportunity to share my expertise with you in this in this round i'm diving in from berlin germany right now and before i also jump into the topic i also comment a little bit about why i'm so interested to talk about this this topic and why is it so so close to my heart so the topic about what do employers look for in a data scientist or also in a data engineer so i also prepared some slides so i start sharing the screen so that we can follow also the logic of the talk together so i hope you can see my screen now maybe this is a brief introduction um about myself thanks laura um yeah as already introduced i'm located here in berlin germany and actually i did my thesis and and also my studies in the area of chemistry more specific by organic chemistry which does not sound like the easiest topic to now go to data science but i come to it in a minute why data science data engineering is so interesting to me with my background in chemistry i joined bsf as one of the biggest chemical companies in the world directly after my studies and within my time with bsf i changed a couple of positions so while starting in data management for chemical data i then switched to as large just mentioned to the role of becoming also hiring manager for other profiles than just the chemical process so starting with data management i was also working as disciplinary leader for topics of profiles in the area of data science data engineering but also developers and during this time i really enjoy working with with data scientist data engineers but some experiences during the interviews made me think whether it wouldn't be valuable to share some thoughts and some experiences that i gained with especially young people who want to enter this area and this is why this occasion and this talk is so close to my heart because this is the option and the opportunity to do so so what's the talk about i switch to the next and what it's not about so i see this as an opportunity to share my experiences so i will also talk as me as a private person so even though i made a lot of experience in the job context with bsf i'm not here to speak as a representative of the company i'm here as a private person to share my experience and three steps or three stages are relevant here so ideas you should have and and thoughts you should make before the job interview the job interview itself and also what's important in this area when you are in your work environment so the title says what do employers look for a data scientist but also as i said and mentioned um my experience is not only based on data science but also data engineering development so this is more like broad term for all this kind of i.t and data related profiles however i'm more focusing on junior positions so i hope this is also something which um you as an audience are more interested in it also just um comes with with the simple fact that i am more hiring in the junior profile area and also questions are highly welcome we'll have a q a section at the end but also um laura feder feel free to jump in and ask questions if you if you feel like it also to clarify what it's not about i will not talk about prioritizing any kind of specific languages or coding skills this is very individual for every employer and every position um if you want to really make sure that the position you apply for is covering or is in alignment with your skill set read the job office or call the recruiting team and ask them so i will not do prioritization here also i will not comment on cvs cvs are very regional specific so any piece of advice i would give here might be wrong for you a certain area and last but not least this is also no job promo it's an exchange so i'm here to share experience not to promote certain positions and with this being said let's then jump into the first piece here what to look at before you apply the position sorry sorry uh just just to really jump in really quickly because you put your um linkedin plug in there so um just to double check what are your boundaries can people add you can people follow you can people get in touch um about certain positions or applications like what's what are your boundaries here sure um so i shared also the the linkedin name so that you can also find me um please feel free to to reach out to me by a message um for for all kind of different topics if you're interested to learn more um and i think linkedin would be the best way to to reach out to me okay yeah so now let's imagine you're there you you did some studies in data science data engineering you um or you come from a different field and you enrich your knowledge by by doing um some some coding trainings and you're there thinking what what to do with your knowledge now and one important thing and this is pretty general for all positions but here specifically um you need to be clear for yourself what you are expecting from your job there will never ever be the one job that covers every every everything so when you select for positions you need first of all to think what is really important for yourself is it the salary which is on prior number one which is just perfectly fine um is it your development chances that really matter to you is it important to you that your job offers you the opportunity to learn new techniques new tools how important is the location um is it very interesting to you in which industry you are in or actually does the industry not matter and it's more about the content what you do or how much do you want to identify with the purpose of the company or or the task all those questions you should ask yourself beforehand because this is very important to be at the end happy in your in your role that you take and when you rank those parameters for yourselves you will also already answer a lot of questions like is it a big company you should join or is it more startup they are very different in in their mechanisms for instance if you want to have development chances within a company you should go for a big company where there's a lot of opportunities there to change within one company if it's more important to you to have more freedom within the task that you that you wanna that you wanna do maybe startup with flatter hierarchies is more suitable for you and one aspect i want to advertise for here do project as much as you can um because projects give you then the opportunity to understand more about yourself what kind of environment fits to you another aspect which you should consider before applying to a position is your personal stage of experience where you're at so when you're pretty young to the to the area of data science data engineering um i would recommend to look rather for teams that are already more established where you have maybe a senior data scientist who can teach you things where routines are in place so where the team is already running smoothly and you don't have to take care of such things and can really focus on doing your job and learning within your job if you're more experienced you can you know you can also join younger teams which are more in the build up phase because those teams will also offer you more opportunities to develop faster into let's say leadership positions for instance if you're building up new teams there's permanent growth and the demand for leaders right so this is something where you should figure out at which stage are you and what fits for you and again specifically if you're more in the first part so in the less experienced section i again advocate for do projects so what i mean by by project this can be literally anything which translates a real life problem into a coding or data science evaluation task so projects do not only help you to train your skills it also teaches you a lot about your own strengths and weaknesses it helps you to to learn this translation step from like the problem to what needs to be done and also helps you to zoom between those different levels so being able to speak about the high level purpose of the project as well about the deep dive how did you finally solve it so you learn also a lot of organizational aspects and how teamwork works when you want to get something done which is bigger than a oneman show okay so at this point i think i made the point how how important i think projects are when you're entering the job search and now let's say you found some some jobs you you reflected on yourself and you got invited to the interview so first of all the interview is a dialogue um sometimes people come to the interview and think they they are expected to be brilliant at everything um we're fully aware that people are people everybody has strengths and weaknesses and the interview is a dialogue where we can see whether our expectations meet so whether what we offer is what you expected and what you can offer fits to the job role we have so one thing i want to raise awareness for is people that you meet in the interview do not necessarily always need to be technically first and knowledgeable people take me for example i came from a from a completely different area uh and i'm also responsible to evaluate how you fit into your team or whether it works out so you should be aware of the fact that you do not only need to convince by your heart skills but you also need to convince people like me who rather want to understand what is the benefit of what you did did you really translate this this bigger problem into into the smaller pieces and find the solutions and here again what's really helpful the examples and the projects if you can tell about a story where you accomplish something based on a bigger problem that's very valuable to really understand how you think and how you translate those those issues and also here it's very important i said on the slide before to be able to translate between the high level idea and the deep dive how did you do it and and um how did you solve the issues this way um sorry sorry about it again um but can i just ask you sorry do you have any sort of cases any sort of stories without giving away personal information or any private information um did you ever have someone come in for an interview and they talked about a project that really impressed you a project that really impressed me so um i cannot give a specific one because um actually every interview covers at least give me one example and there are a lot of nice examples what mostly what i mostly enjoy to listen to are stories where people develop something on their own without having um a fixed framework so i also enjoy listening to i did in my master's thesis or i had an internship here but i really enjoyed those examples where people come up with a problem they're observed on their own for instance they are they have a hobby in a certain field and they realize this would be much better if i would be able to um to have more data in this and figure out certain certain aspects and then they just do something because it's valuable to them um and why do i enjoy those uh examples most because this has all the pieces of bringing a business case into a real solution yeah it's it's it shows me that you don't need to have like a predescribed problem where everything is is already described in detail but you can understand a real life problem and you just are also motivated on your own to find your solutions so those those tasks or those examples where someone translates something from a personal world and just looks for solutions that's very inspiring and i enjoy it a lot yeah and when we're in the interview of course besides uh nontechy people like myself of course mostly there's also someone who can evaluate the tech side there are companies who who use those kind of test mechanisms beforehand um for us it's it's more use or we use it more widely to really have the interview with a tech person because as we all know there are more than one way to to solve a problem and this is something you can figure out better in an interview with tech guys and here um one one thing which is important be honest and be the open um sometimes people are so so afraid not to make it through the interview that they start to try to oversell themselves and are not very honest about how much they did on their own i don't say that it's the majority for sure not but just to let you know we see this and even even if i'm not the tech person mostly even i see this when it becomes a little bit blurry and when people start to to be hesitant about describing what they did so be honest and say okay i'm not so uh knowledgeable in this part but i solve my problems using maybe the other language using another tools that's totally fine to say it's better to be clear about what you can do and what you cannot and also companies are very very open in giving you trainings so the typical example is when cloud experience is important it mostly doesn't matter whether it's azure or aws if you work in the cloud environment that's fine and if you need one of the other tools we'll train you no no worries but it's more important to be honest and open about what you can do and leave the impression of you being an honest person then trying to to um to pretend there is something which isn't there um how does it normally work do you have someone who is a nontechnical person plus attack person at the same time or do you have them sort of at different internal intervals it depends it really depends um how the team is set up we have uh we had already both cases so um sometimes it's the tech person and and myself and then i mostly leave first of all the stage to the tech colleague because this is more the discussion that that needs to be also um have the room and the freedom to go into depth uh and then i add my questions which are more team and and soft skill correlated but there are also other cases where um for example the tech colleagues also develop a challenge um send the challenge prior to the interview so that the applicant has some time to work on it and then after let's say an hour the interview takes place and you can discuss the result what i really like about this approach is that the applicant also sees what are our problems because we develop the challenge and also it's not just um you hand in some code and then it's either right or wrong but you as an applicant also have the chance to describe why you chose this way why did you um select the why why did you do it the way you did it and i think that's that's nice if you have this dialog here yeah and last but not least you being there in the interview um be clear and honest as i already said so um tell us clearly what you bring to the table of course an interview is also about selling yourself so we be proud of what you did give us examples give us examples also where you struggled to achieve something but achieved it at the end and also tell us what's important to you um as i said there won't be the one position which is covering every every everything but if your expectations and what we can offer come close together then it's a good fit okay and now let's look at the third stage so you managed to go through the interview we got to know each other and now we think yeah that that will work out and um you're a part of our team then of course the dialogue continues and i want to um have a brief reflection on on two different aspects the one being the feedback culture and the other being the work culture um so feedback culture is something which is um i i don't know whether there are companies who would not value a good feedback culture and feedback always means feedback in both directions and for us specifically we have at least twice a year a dialogue between the manager and the employee where we also reflect on the personal strengths and weaknesses and where you can also address your your perception of your tasks and uh what fits better to you and where you would like to have some some more support and this is important in order to also shape your development path right you can be interested in digging deeper into into problems and learning more different tools different languages which is more an expert path or on the other hand side you can also be more generalistic um in in your skill set and be also more interested in leading things so this is a complete different development path and this is something we can just also figure out in the dialogue and with giving you feedback on how we perceive you in your job role and also um please address any kind of improvements and suggestions that you have in in the workplace so one important piece is this trainings you know best what kind of trainings you would need to do your job better so you need to address this to a manager and say hey i can solve those tasks but actually i would be also interested to learn this kind of tool sets because i think i could do the task even better and you're you're we're happy to hear this and you will get those trainings and also another part where you can always give feedback is also the kind of job organization so house the task distribution within the team those are always regular discussions that you should have with your manager so that we're aware of what you need and you are aware of what what we think of of your performance so far and um the second part of the slide the the work culture that's that's something pretty generic so i will just briefly briefly touch on those four pieces but this is basically how how this things work together you you have always an organizational component which is um very dependent on the company you're working for there's the cultural component which is correlated to the values of the company um there's always the team perspective and your individual role within the team so when you're looking also for jobs this is something you can also reflect on beforehand um look at the company you're applying to what are the values how do how is the structure um are you a big fan for flat hierarchies or are you okay with a more hierarchical structure this is something which will be important for your daytoday life so to give you an example here big companies mostly have very s or more complicated processes so in order to to change something something big you will have to to get through a lot of process steps in a big company right so that's just something you have to be aware of and if you say that's um that's stressing to you maybe a smaller company or startup would be more suitable for you work culture as i said that's part of of of the values that a company has and this should also ideally be something you can identify with uh if you don't identify with the path and the strategy a company goes on the long term run this can be also stressful team setup this can be very very different and you should also reflect for yourself where you feel comfortable so is it for instance that you want to be part of mixed teams so where you have a lot of different profiles and you learn a lot from different people but where you also have to be very good at your job and explain it to others or would you rather prefer to be a data engineer among data engineers where you are where you have an easier living in in exchanging on on job specifics but you will not get so much from the outside perspective that's very individual and that's something you need to reflect on and the other points team fit so how do you communicate with your team colleagues does it feel comfortable natural work management um most jobs in the area of development engineering are working in an agile work mode but there will be of course also teams which are not structured in that way so you need also to see how this whole work mode fits with you and last but not least um always reflect on your hard skills ask for trainings if you need some um and also reflect on your soft skills so if you find yourself in a role where ex communication is expected and you're uncomfortable with that that's not the best situation so again you should talk to a manager whether it's whether it's some kind of training that can help you or whether there is also more backend role that you could fit in and with this being said we're already already at the summary so in the beginning think about what's important for yourself articulate this clearly in the interview what are your strengths what you bring to the table what are you expecting and then continue the dialogue with your team and your manager so back to you laura all right um let's have a look look at um okay uh let me see if there's anyone who has questions um i think maybe people are still thinking about questions so maybe i'll just bump in and get my questions in first um so uh what i wanted to ask you sorry you having is a very academic sort of research background right was there anything that surprised you or anything that took you back when you started hiring anything surprising um yeah actually so i'm thinking now of an example um when hiring specifically for data analytics and data visualization positions i was surprised to see how many people apply coming from a different field and this was not only feels like i'm used to natural science um where you have also a clear connect to data but also very very different other fields from psychology social science uh languages um and on the one hand side i think that's that's a very good trend um as we see digitalization is is a big part in in all kind of different business functions so i think in the future we will need more and more people who are able to think crossfunctionally so who combine this kind of specific business knowledge supply chain finance whatever with expertise how to work with data how to design the tools i think this is a very good trend on the other hand side why i was also so surprised is this transformation process from from one profile to to data science data analytics is not easy and i saw a lot of people who had one or two certificates um entry level of whatever and they expected to have this fulltime position which is just focusing on data and this is unfortunately mostly not how it works um so be aware that this transformation process is challenging and i know this is again this kind of like hannah neck problem where people expect you to have experience but nobody gives you a job to gain experience so this is where i come again back to the point of the project you know certificates and then do the projects and when you are in the interview i see in your cv okay you did this kind of project and we can talk about it and then you can tell us um what did you do there why did you come up with this idea and you are much closer to the real job if you already had some kind of project where you had to translate this real life problems into a technical solution and your chances are much higher to be invited to the interview right um just looking at the questions so somebody's asking um does it matter if you have skill training or of yourself so i think that you just kind of answered that sorry um if you have those projects because of have that you know other things to back you up um like you say you know you don't have to be data science major all the way is that is that correct exactly exactly so uh let me also um give you here an example this specifically from from natural scientists um i see this quite frequently if you come from a background in physics where you had maybe some kind of molecular physics where you also use programming and coding languages and then you use this to jump more into this kind of coding profile and you started to do your own projects encoding etc i totally see why you want to have a job in this field regardless the fact that your cv says i'm a master of physics okay yep fair enough um somebody's asking the steps to learn data science um i feel like that's kind of a big question it is um and it really depends on your individual um case where you're coming from so as i said there are there are some some education paths some careers where you have already the contact with data and um you will maybe not need to have this certificate based um trainings but you more or less jump into this um if you if you're coming from from a completely different field i think coming starting with um uh yeah like like codecademy or udemy or whatever they're called so we're start with a platform that helps you it's it's it's really a good start because here you can first of all learn a couple of things understand what this whole topic is about and just step by step um enrich your your training um and then some people are asking about sort of hard skills and projects i think you kind of answered that earlier where you said um what you like to see so like a like a passion project like a sort of pet project and then sort of apply your skills to it um okay um so maybe also to comment on on hard skills so um this this now uh goes a bit to the area of cvs which i want to say again as a disclaimer it's there is no onesizefitsall but what regularly and what's very helpful is when you have a summary of like the languages or the tools you used um some people also like to to rate themselves so uh like like in an amazon style from one to five how many points would i give myself um that's helpful for first um for first impression but then i would always look for what kind of tasks or project did you do where i can see where you used python so if it says python files then it would always look on your cv where does it come from right what drives you what are you doing why are you doing it um okay right um i feel like what you mentioned earlier where you said that people are coming from different disciplines and there's of um venturing into data and you say that you like that i feel like that's very encouraging to a lot of people um because it shows that even with a nontech background you can still do it okay um all right important things that we can put on our resume to get call backs um i feel like you said earlier you're not gonna do resume feedback yeah so is that right um here i'm i'm a little bit hesitant because i cannot speak for being managers of the world and also here um the cultural aspect might be um might be very very different um but you will always have to have to be able to depict your heart skills whether it's now you have a list um where you rank yourself but or whether you just put the projects um the cv needs to be structured so even if i need to understand what you did and why this role might be interesting for you um some people like to put their github links that's that's also nice it shows that you're in this community um but those are now what i'm mentioning now this is something which i personally do and which i know some other managers also do but i wouldn't speak for everyone here right um so actually um since so many people are asking about nontechnical backgrounds um would you maybe be able to comment on your own nontech background so you being um very research focused um was it helpful or was it a hindrance at times i mean you still being in stem though yeah um that's an interesting question and i uh i actually think that having a background in natural science was actually very helpful um i see a lot of parallels between natural sciences and uh data science and and all kind of data related fields um what those fields have in common is that you need again to have the the understanding of a broad topic so you need to understand um how does cancer work and why is it bad and you need high level a business a business issue a business problem that needs to be solved but at the same time for both you need to be able to translate this down to a very very specific thing to do so even though i understood cancer is bad i need to know a lot of experiments and how they work and how they are done properly and i need to be able to do them properly in order to achieve some results so this would be the chemical perspective and when you work in an area with data you kind of have to say you first of all and don't underestimate that you have to figure out where to find the data and the statistics that's that's unfortunately true 80 of the time of a data scientist are spent not by the actual data science but looking for the data doing the data cleansing and the data preparation so you need to do you need to be able to translate the business problem to where do i find the data how do i prepare the data and then comes the fancy part to generate the insights and translate them back to the picture right you need to explain this then back to the business guys why your insights are so valuable so i think there are a lot of parallels and as you said i i would totally encourage people who are interested in in changing their role into a data related role to do this i think there will be an even more growing market for this kind of profiles but be aware that this is a transformation process and not just done by two or three certificates yep um was there anything that you wish you'd known beforehand before starting as a manager that i wished i knew beforehand good question um i mean what would i enjoy um but i did not think would be so important is that you really need to be able to jump into new new perspectives and new problems very very fast um and that that also always implies that you need to leave behind your your own ideas and preassumptions um and take the other person's perspective to understand the way the other person thinks um i i hope this was kind of understandable if it's too blurry also no i just feel like um yeah no that's that's good yeah that's all good okay um we're kind of at the wrapup stage let me just check any important questions um how many projects do you think people should bring to the table like what's what's a good number is that kind of difficult to say oh it depends on project apps difficult to say also because this um depends on the the job role that you're applying to so as i said in the beginning i'm now more focused on on those entrylevel jobs where if you have a very interesting master thesis that's already a good description um the the higher the job position that that you're going to goes the higher the expectations of course okay okay um we're kind of at the wrapup stage is there anything that you would like to sort of summarize anything you would like to say any parting parting remarks anything from fedor maybe uh no it was very informative you know i keep seeing parallels between data science and web development i talk to a lot of recruiters that work with uh juniors in web development and you know the disciplines are different but the principles sort of apply the same where they always say that you have to put an emphasis on building your own projects being very confident in your own code if you find the kind of interview where they send you a project to work on ahead of time you know spend as much time as you can in it make sure that you that you take the time and you know don't wait until the last moment to work on it of course take it seriously and also be very honest doing the interviews all the recruiters always say you know um to you know to give an example if you're working with a react that's a from the framework and you're not very confident with a certain part of the interviewer is asking you better to say i don't know for sure and explain your reasoning because at the end of the day what they interview especially for a junior developer role somebody that they understand is somebody that is growing into that role and developing into the career they really want to know how you think and how you approach problems more than the actual technical hardcore knowledge because you can learn that on the job you can learn that like week after week so i know that i've seen a lot of parallels between what dr cattle is saying and and our own recruiters saying you know we really want to see people a junior but when they apply for junior roles showing that and demonstrating that they can learn that they're really you know eager to learn and they're very passionate about the subject totally so laura this this was actually the summary i i couldn't summarize it better thanks very much be willing to learn and and shows that you're that you're able to jump into new topics and again this is also something which is becoming more and more valuable in our in our world today um whatever you learned yesterday might be obsolete tomorrow so it's way more important that you are curious to jump into those new topics and that you're eager to learn okay so we are down for today i think laura is that correct all right well thank you everybody for stopping by uh it's been you know i've had a good time listening to the dr cad there's always something to learn always a new perspective to learn uh when you're applying for jobs and when you're trying to learn you know interviews and the whole intricacies i think a good point was saying that every company is a little different so be mindful of what you're applying your country your culture your background there's always a lot of details that go into this and you have to be persistent i always apply and sometimes people get it at the first try sometimes you have to apply for 100 different roles just be consistent and be persistent thank you everybody and we'll see you in our next live stream have a good weekend thank you and that's it
