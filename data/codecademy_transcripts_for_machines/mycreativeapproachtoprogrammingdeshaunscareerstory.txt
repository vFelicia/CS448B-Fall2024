so this is how I like to think about coding coding is writing but it's not just math and numbers if I have a song that I want to write I can write the song and you can hear the creation when I code the creation's there it exists it's real it's the backbone behind everything Co Academy teaches you how to write it how to function it teaches you the syntax you have all of the opportunity right in front of you being able to code kind of help me get a coding degree and then the next day I was working at Nasa I was only able to do that because Co Academy showed me how to learn to code coding is not always easy uh and I love that about it it's it's fun it's it's challenging um but in the midst to the challenge you get to create and that's amazing to me without Co Academy there's a huge chunk of my life that would have been gone if I hadn't learned the code then I don't know where I'd be
