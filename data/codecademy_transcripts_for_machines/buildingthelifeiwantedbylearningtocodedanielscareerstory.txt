coding is like drumming you know with coding when you're in that like Flow State you're hyperfocused you're not really aware of anything that's around you that's kind of the same with drumming you're not thinking about what you're playing you're just focused on what you want it to sound like before I was working in Tech I was teaching at a drum school and doing gigs on the weekend the lifestyle of being a musician was getting quite a lot you kind of don't sleep right you don't eat right I was just looking for something more satisfying when I tried code academy it felt like magic it's very up todate very easy to follow every day I wanted to get up and I wanted to learn more but one of the best things as well is definitely the kind of group project you can kind of talk to other people that are in the same position as you um and build something together which I think that's really unique code academy is the reason I am where I am today I went from knowing nothing about code to being a fulltime software engineer in 12 months I wish I hadn't wasted any time going on YouTube not knowing what I was looking for if IID have found code academy straight away then I would have been even quicker to get my first job
