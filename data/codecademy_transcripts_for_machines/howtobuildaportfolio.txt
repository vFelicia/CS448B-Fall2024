hello my name is Farish and i'm a californiabased developer and in this video we're gonna cover how to build a portfolio but before I get started I'm gonna take a moment to go over why a portfolio is valuable to have and you may be asking yourself why have a portfolio let me give you a few reasons why a portfolio is valuable perspective employers or clients want to see your current body of work just seeing trust me I can do this is it enough you're asking them to take a leap of faith without showing them you even know how to jump secondly a portfolio brings credibility because it showcases your work you are proving what you are capable of by taking your code and turning it into completed projects lastly this also has the benefit of being an online resume consider this to be a marketing tool when a person visually sees what you have accomplished that makes a greater impact than just reading about your skills through a resume do you make sure to put in your contact information social media and specialized skills let's treat the portfolio like a set of stairs as a beginner you may be concerned with where you should start so at the bottom step I'm gonna recommend codecademy projects they're already available for you to use and as you put them in your portfolio it shows your commitment to learning if you're unsure on what projects to choose just pick ones that catch your interests in your specific path or any of them in the catalog now after you've done that we're gonna head to the next step which is to build a project on your own try to pick something you're interested in and if you're not sure what you're interested in one thing I would recommend is to go to Google look at local businesses take a look at their websites and maybe redesign them I'm gonna do a quick overview on the redesign process first come up with a plan this site is outdated what modern look could I use to give the site a fresh design if I'm not sure I'm gonna look at comparable businesses any site that looks new and well built I'm gonna see what elements of that site I could fit in the theme of the business I'm redesigning I'm also gonna make sure to write this information down the worst thing that can happen is I find some inspiration but because they didn't write it down forgot where I saw it second let's start with wireframing consider wireframes to be outlines of your website they don't need to be perfect they're just general guidelines don't be afraid to make changes because of something that you end up not liking later on lastly don't be afraid to experiment or make mistakes play around with colors positioning CSS tricks and whatever else you may like to try this is all part of the learning process remember the long term goal here is improvement not perfection after you built your project on your own you may be wondering what to do next the answer is to keep building and I want to explain this further even though there is no fixed number having two to three projects that you have built on your own is a good starting point part of the value in doing your portfolio is to show improvement and growth with your skill set maybe after doing two to three projects you're having trouble with finding inspiration on project ideas a good alternative is to add features to your existing projects keep building can also mean keep iterating your first site could be built on HTML and CSS then you're feeling uninspired to build a second site take advantage of this site and add some vanilla JavaScript to this to expand your skill set then your next site may have all the features of this first site expand your skill set again by adding a framework like react now lastly you can take your react app move it to the next level by building it back in using nodejs whether it is through making new projects or adding to your existing ones the goal is to keep building so what happens when you reach the top of the stairs well that leads to the step of cleaning up and what I mean by that is we're gonna clean up your portfolio remove older projects that no longer reflect your skill level if you have too many projects your portfolio can be overwhelming plus you may not want to showcase that project you did four or five years ago there's nothing wrong with taking some time and refactoring your pro folio and making it more uptodate and relevant with today's technology now what if you aren't doing frontend do you still need a portfolio well if you're doing Python data science or machine learning the earlier reasons to have a portfolio still apply you still pleated code online and you want to make sure to include detail instructions on how the program works and what is the expected output and I might want to recommend doing stepbystep writeups with juniper notebooks I suppose she says you can share them with github if any of this has you concerned or scared please don't stress out this is all taught on the code Academy platform so now we need to discuss where we're gonna host our portfolio now the first option is standard web hosting also known as shared web hosting this is great for frontend web sites but it has many limitations you only get a small slice of the server resources clusters very limited back in support for example my shared hosting only supports node 1.0 the current version of node is version 11 in return for these limitations usually shared hosting is the lowest cost and it is perfectly fine for hosting websites built on HTML CSS Anila javascript and jquery now the next type of web hosting is a VPS which stands for a virtual private server and what is being done here is you're renting out a small part of the server to get a bigger slice of resources this gives you more power than traditional web hosting you can host Brenden and back in applications the drawback is there's some configuration involved in some deployment knowledge that is needed some major players of VPS services are digitalocean Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services and the last type of hosting is dedicated and dedicate is renting a full server you aren't sharing any part of it as you can imagine this runs out the higher cost and requires a high level of deployment knowledge now we've just gone over a lot of hosting information and I'm not gonna recommend any of it to start out with really take a different direction but I wanted you to have the knowledge of what your options are now what I'm actually gonna recommend is github and github should already be used to host your code now don't let that statement stress you out this is depending on where you are for your development path and if you haven't gotten to that part of the path yet just be aware it is part of code Academy's curriculum the great thing about already having your code up on github is you can convert your frontend code into a github page and this is a free service for using github so you don't have to worry about any outofpocket cost for python and other related languages store your completed project code on github as I mentioned earlier make sure to include instructions on how to use your code and they expect it output from your program a great place to put this information would be in the readme file of your repository along with our github courses code Academy offers an additional course and article on how to deploy your code into a github page now the last reason why I recommend github is that almost every major tech company uses git this makes you more hireable you are putting your portfolio on a platform where many companies are already familiar with by doing this you've created an additional marketable skill why not take advantage of this platform and increase your skillset to add to your portfolio we've reached the end of our video let's do a quick recap of what was discussed first we talked about why you should have a portfolio a portfolio helps your marketability whether it is to be hired by employer or a client as a freelancer second we talked about what to put in your portfolio I gave them analogy of climbing the stairs to help you I gave a suggested starting point and discuss what to do when you got to the top what you do in the middle is up to you lastly we talked about hosting I went over different hosting options and in the end I recommended github I did so with the goal of market building in mind while hoping to direct you to another skill set that is commonly expected to have from prospective employers thanks for watching this is Farish from code Academy now if you like to join the conversation
