hello everybody welcome to code CAD me live today's Friday July 17th we're doing a special event today to celebrate world emoji day as well as we just did a course job on learning mojiko my name is sunny I'm a senior combed Avella / here at code Academy and I have here with me the star of the show Theo the creator of emoji code Thea hi everyone my name is Theo tail Lightman as we would say here and yeah I'm the creator of the Moshe code I'm really excited to be here today it's such an honor to appear here and have an real course created for Moshe code and I'm so excited but we're going to demo the code in a little bit right yeah yeah it's gonna be super fun it's a very different episode I guess we're gonna do a little QA in the beginning and some of the questions that we come up came up with were from our learners from you know Facebook group discord Twitter and as well as some of the questions from our team and we're gonna dive into a little course demo towards the end of the course end of the livestream but we highly encourage you all to to ask questions in the YouTube chat throughout and we'll try to you know answer some as we go but if you you can also wait to the very end of the end of the lecture to cool should we get started yeah absolutely cool let's start with a simple one and I need you to answer that answer the question just like that okay okay the question from a learner from Facebook group very easy question ready okay yeah what are your top three emojis well I mean the emojis I like the most like we surely are probably the grape the clearness yeah I mean you could have guessed that and also like all of the animals like the pig I really like the pig or the Swan or the donut I mean the donuts but not anymore but and I liked it because they wish using a thing but it's not these are not the ones I'm I'm just a regular emoji use it with I don't know laughing face smiling face okay nice so a lot of these are actually like made their way into the language so that's done yeah certainly cool here's another question from discord our learner from discord how did you get started coding and also how does one get from you know learning you know starting to code to designing their own programming language like you did yeah that's an interesting questions though and maybe how did I start to code and learn to code actually when it was about seven years old so have questions experience in that and yeah what does it take I mean actually creating a language is not that difficult with today's tools and if you start slowly you don't have to create like I don't know another C++ on day one and then it's not not that difficult to actually push these tools like LLVM enriched emotion code feels today it's anybody can create a language really I mean it's not that it's not like you can just throw together some language structs like it's been a while and then you have the language you need to think about it but I think most people that really know to program can also build language nice yeah I feel like you know learning how to write your own compiler learning you know how to design your own little language on paper is part of a lot of CS undergrad courses but um but let's dive because you do just say this this this part I did not know you started coding when you were 7 years old what yeah not to you know no not many people code when they're 7 right that's so yeah well well the reason really is that my father is a professor of computer science so yes I had a bit of a background there and but the story is really that I watched I really enjoyed watching my father do all kind of things at his computer and one day he was was just automating some of his work I think using AppleScript I don't know if you know AppleScript that's a really basic trip yeah I was watching a Steve Wozniak or Steve Jobs like memory and they taught by Apple script very nice yeah but it's kind of a weird language but it was actually its language I first picked up I watched my father use it and I was like oh can I do that too I want to learned it too if I thought it was like oh yeah sure you're going to learn Apple scripting when you're that young and yeah sure here have taken my manual and go and what I did was actually I opened the manual I realized it was in English I didn't speak English at the time so I just started to type out the examples from the book and we're doing that I actually learned to program somehow and I also learned a bit of English I mean one of the first words I learned from doing that was public code yeah because there was there was an example where you could enter or select the city's name and then it would show you the zip code of the city and right yeah just like that but also a lot of of Scratch programming at the time and yeah yeah okay so just just so that the the viewer is know so your basin are you based in Zurich right now yeah and we search right now yeah that's awesome and yeah I mean I think I told you this before I mean I used to live in Germany around that time 2nd 2nd grade so that's crazy that you kind of learn English through a program like Apple script right that's yeah we're we're use case yeah that's actually actually funny because when like sometimes in the early days of learning English I would like refer to the programming structs and try to use them in not like words in conversation but if I was like in vocabulary I would think what's it called in the programming language and oh ok so one day was looking for the word to return right to return something and I couldn't come up with return and it was things yeah I know that from programming and actually I used the word repeats then and the people I would was talking to were really confused yeah yeah cool that's a that's a great story so here's another question from our learner from our learners what dev Anju so his question is what are some of your favorite projects that were built in emoji code oh that's a funny question and I mean there's a desertlike console argument parcel written emoji code and you repeat that one more time I like a console command line interface argument parser I'm not sure what's the right word for that CLI argument parse or something like that I really like that one because a lot of thought went into it then there's I really like that one too there's a machine learning notation yeah there is there is a machine learning implementation promotion code really it's written from the ground up in emotion code and it has its own like you probably know from pipe numpy and there is numpy another piping program we're really not sure how pronounce it and and it's called number all correctly like lol okay like that yeah probably I really know if that's the creator of it is watching now I love how here and what I also love I mean I created myself but I also love to chase in parts because the chase of course that's integrated in a motion code is written in emotion could I mean I wrote it myself but it's it's really funny to see how you can really write like a parser in emotion code to see I mean you definitely put a lot I mean as we're doing research so me and my coworkers Kenny we we we actually work with you to to write the Larry Moe G code that that just went live on code cam and we look through your documentation and hopefully you know a scuzz can link out the documentation page in the YouTube chat but you obviously you know put a lot of love into it's the pretty deep language I was very surprised because last year we did all code and this year we did mochi code said Stefan what did you do a sorry and didn't get you last year we did for April force we did a language on a course on lock code lol code oh oh yeah programming language and I think we talked a little bit about before before this zoom called weather emoji code is a Satori program manager or not but yeah but you obviously put a lot of thought and research and years right into this so you know definitely big thumbs up alright here's another question so cook enemies based in New York City and we have learners all over the world but sometimes I feel like you know people in tech in America are don't really know that much about the tech industry internationally you know in Asia and Europe I mean when we think about you know European tech companies we I mean the only three that I like you know usually people know her you know Spotify SoundCloud from Sweden what's the one Skype from Denmark from back in the day when they started early 2000s I've been following this flying car company based in Germany called lilium but besides but outside of that like we were pretty oblivious to what's going on in Europe so can you give us can you give me at least this was a question from me what are your thoughts on the tech scene in in Europe right now okay yes so actually I work with quite a few startups and I think I mean it's the first thing that comes to my mind right now because you mentioned so many many American companies that have become really large and I think one of the major differences is in I think it's it's way more easy to to fund a new company in the u.s. you can easily say okay I found I get I don't know what you call it an LLC I think and and start working as a company right without all of the liability on my own person and that's that I think is a huge difference because it's it's way more difficult in Europe or at least the countries I know to to you either work under your own name with all of the liability and I think this is one of the big differences in in culture in general I think it's quite similar maybe people in Europe are still a bit more like uptight not not as much open to for instance working remotely I think during the last months they have has been a huge shift of course and working remotely but I think this is generally something where the u.s. is yeah in the lead actually yeah interesting yeah so that's very different okay that's that's that's a very good to know because I world cool and then before we jump to our course demo do you have any tips or coding advice for learners for kogami learners like what any any any tips and tricks for people who are learning to code in 2020 learning to code in 2020 is of course a lot different from when I learned to code but I think it's important and this was really important for me at the time to remember you can't or if you have a normal computer you can't destroy your computer by programming it so I can't repeat I'm real quick yeah you can't destroy your computer by programming it right you can try everything your computer is not going to blow up and your computer unless you delete the operating system is not going to stop to work right have a compiler or an interpreter that instantly gives you feedback whether your program is syntactically correct and I think this is really really the really great thing about programming you have instant feedback about whether the thing you do works and you can try pretty much everything without ever risking I don't know money your life marchings justjust try it and see what would happens that's usually that's really what I did of course right I also tried to see could I write a programming language with emojis and it obviously worked yeah what was that was that the why behind the emoji code well it has always been a dream of mine since I still own to program at very young age to create my own language so maybe kind of what just wanted to try yeah maybe maybe that's it's one of the reasons that I feel like that's a very common question I think we discussed this before like why do yeah yeah sure people people keep asking why all the time multiple issues on github I think about the topic and yeah that means like I still work on emotion it's very recent it's very simple to answer because it's just such a deep learning experience there are so many things involved in creating a programming language so and yeah that's just ya know I think that's a great great great great reason actually I think people a lot of times in tech just kind of think about things like how I feel like the mainstream technology is just think about you know whether it scale or not whether it can you know drive revenue or not but a lot of time people forget like some of the greatest inventions in tech aren't just from people who are trying to challenge themselves try to you know learn about things tinker with things you know build things you know break them down pick them apart ain't even like the world wide web for example like it all started from a proposal right so big thumbs up you know right on I think you're definitely on the right track you know and this is a great inspiration for a lot of our learners to that you don't have to you know build something so to you know you don't have to learn a code to you know try to get that salary or try to you know creators don't absolutely really great point I mean I come exactly from from just learning to code for fun for me out of curiosity yeah that's this really curiosities I think really a key point in learning to program oh yeah now this is a great I'm so we did this I mean we've been yeah we've been working together for I mean since april fools really like yeah it probably says March alright yeah this is the first time we actually never did an interview live so I'm very happy this is going anyways I think that's all for our Q&A bit if you have questions in the chat if you have questions you know make sure to type in the chat on YouTube and I think we should just start get start with showing people what what the heck is a mágico like what the you know do the demo yeah sure you ready absolutely I'm gonna share my screen real quick ooh there's a new option who can share only host cool all right so we're now on the learn emoji code web page let me know if typing the chat if you see it in the YouTube chat people seeing it I oh wait the YouTube chat is a little bit delayed it looks like it's like one minute delayed okay so type in the chat if you can see it yeah at least I can see it and you get a call yeah but just wait a minute just in case okay so I think we're in cool hello s suck girl Nalla oh fed a cool we got a little you know a bunch of familiar names in here very awesome cool so learn emoji code here's a Laney I think we should just get started with the very first module which is hello world hello world a little quiz a little project cool so introduction to emoji code and you know Theo make sure to chime in if you if there any you know teaching teaching moment so you find I mean not a teaching moment but I absolutely adore that illustration of the right hand side it's it's all right absolutely it's so emoji cooked a lot yeah it's great yeah so this is done by 10 one of our designers I cook at me you know just brilliant designer cool so emoji code is an open source fully blown strongly typed programming language consisting of emojis and here's a little history from Theo about why he did you know why he created emoji code and here at Konami we believe that emojis have a very powerful and expressive force that brings smiles and fun to conversations especially in text messages and slack messages and also emails and we built this with you and hopefully it will inspire you the learner to you know down the road create your own programming language or create your own compiler okay so next cool the first a little symbols the emoji symbols that we see so when we write emoji programs and files they usually have five extension that looks like this dot emoji see emoji see okay but here's a very cool part that didn't want to do tell me an email that you can actually have a grape emoji as a file extension yet oh cool I mean maybe I need to say something about this because I was always using emoji file names but it turned out the emoji code community really enjoys using emoji file names yeah one of their requests to use an emoji file name so we decided to introduce the hips I mean really embodies what you know emoji code stands for right so this file is called hello dot emoji see and here's the first little emoji that we're gonna see that we learn about I'm not sure how to pronounce this emoji see but it's basically like a race car yeah it's called the starting flag a starting flag call right India's document I call it that I don't know if you're something official yeah like I've seen on Wikipedia called like checkered or something like that okay but you know you've probably seen this with you know a NASCAR or fast and furious right it's the beginning of a race and that kind of means the beginning of a blog the beginning of the code that would be executed when the compiler X about a compiler when the program runs correct because some of the stuff you mentioned I remember we talked about this Ashley live outside of the checker block sure yeah so I don't know if you know Java or C sha or counseling courses right now o or C obviously or C++ then you always have a main method of a function and just does this starting flag block is just like the main function actually main method because obviously you can also have classes or where you type some in improve methods in emoji code and these would of course not be defined inside two main function so they'll live either above it or below it correct exactly cool and then we have two more emojis to learn the grape emoji and the watermelon emoji so the grape emoji means the beginning of a code block and watermelon emoji means n difficult block so I think of them as like the squiggly brackets the curly braces and you know I guess like C++ Java JavaScript but what so I was looking out here github repo what made you decide to use these two symbols like the checker one meets like that starting point one it makes a lot of sense but the fruits one is it just like personal preference or yeah it's pretty much well it's personal preference and in the early days of emoji code I thought it would be a good idea to use emojis for language like syntax or let's let's put it in another way I decided to use emojis that are very rarely used to express something meaningful for things that are just boilerplate actually right it doesn't really matter if you put I don't know a curly brace there or a dollar sign in C right yeah the curly brace can weigh as little meaning as those scrapes and watermelons I mean just except for the fact of course that we we as humans perceive like those braces curly braces as belonging together but it's actually just a matter of time and you will perceive the watermelon at the grape is belong to head yeah cool yeah and also I see it has the squiggly bracket but yet totally understand the the dollar sign thing cool so let's try this out real quick so provided program has a single line of code hello world will learn about light too in the next exercise but this basically prints out a message the terminal hello comma world exclamation mark so it prints out everything inside here okay so here's basically what I think of as like the print statement right the print method the smiley face opens that starts it and then the exclamation mark that ends it and inside we have a text string so ABC means it kind of wraps to ABC's emojis basically wraps the the string that's inside of it so here's something I actually do want it you know I guess it's like a feature request again for me okay so sometimes you know when you you know emoji emojis yeah emoji picker right like here you have the control command space among Mac right now so control command space and then to have this stay persistent after you if you just press one if you just use Y emoji the emoji picker disappear right and then to have to make it persistent you got to drag it and it'll stay so you can type more and more emojis and after a while you know the emoji code symbols the syntax will appear in the frequently use but I was thinking it would be really cool ever super easy if we just actually create your own sort of like emoji picker only that only has it's basically like you know this what screen guys this big but but it only had the emojis that you know yeah obviously to think about that quite if your editor syntaxes and plugins for for sublime text there is one at least for text made there is one and so these are the 20 to see use myself so know about them and where you just have to type I don't know some letters and hit the tabulator key or whatever key and then we'll insert the right emojis and there were also people who had the idea to create a custom keyboard layout and assign I think I was a burglar laya to the keyboard key easy there are all kinds of ideas yeah ultimately emoji code is a language and not my ve so yeah we leave that up to the operating system providers to provide emoji boot support okay well I tried yeah so let's run this code real quick so it prints out you know somebody's name right here right Thanks so strings and I think we kind of learned this in the last exercise right strings just similar to other you know data types other types in other languages string is we're words or pieces of text that the computer treats as a single item so here's an example of a string is another one and here's another one and here's another one so you can have numbers and also other emojis inside the string cool so we're gonna let's just do one of them so let's print out a string so this is actually how I do it I just put all the emojis in there and I copy paste so prison that's pretty made up all we have you know number of characters so let's do 2020 run cool my copy and paste this so we want one with just letters blah blah and then when I do one with both numbers I guess whatever we want so let's do showcase three different members emoji code just like every most languages it kind of like goes from top to bottom left to right cool I actually really like this exercise because the errors even the errors and emojis are a little bit different which I really appreciate just like this so here's an example of emoji code air and for most learners at code cami you're gonna see plenty of layer errors in your journey to learn to code so let's you know kind of break this down a little bit the first bit of the error is the filename okay so in this case it's example died emoji see this number right here is the line number where the compiler thinks there is a mistake okay and the second number is a character number in that line so the zero character it says index zero index zero zero indexed line three and what is there it says unexpected end of the program okay so for this little exercise right here we want to run the code and then we need a pin point where there is I really like how you know you even have emoji code like err emoji right here and then you know usually you have like an up arrow arrow to point to where you know the compiler thinks is a problem and you also have an emoji here so I really appreciate that yeah and really like I mean I really like this step of the lesson because it's really something people struggle with an emoji code because if you're not yet used to reading emoji code you're just overwhelmed by all these colorful little signs and people tend to miss that the places where the errors in the code are so I think it's really great that you immediately teach people to to like deal with errors exactly what you mentioned I think yeah it was really important to me that the error message be customized with emotions yeah that's true that's awesome this this exercise actually was created by Sarah one of our coworkers all my coworkers so all credit goes to her great let's see also by the way for all the learners like sometimes the error they're weird that error think there's a mistake can be a little bit misleading like compile errors sometimes are not exactly other it can be before it right so you really got a look in the code so this is saying that I like to the character three zero one two three somewhere right here it's actually right here cool I'm gonna run it again ooh there's another problem okay so line their character three and think it's missing a they pull up the emoji picker one more time oh sorry here it's a great I'll run it one more time okay here's your Moyers line six character one cool I think it's missing a smiley face and then this one see this one is pretty misleading right it says line six and then but it's actually right here cool I think we're good cool comments so here you know just like every programming language and markup languages they're usually comments in the syntax in the program so there's single line comments and multiline comments single line comments this is pretty selfexplanatory it's a thought bubble right it's almost like things that it's not said unspoken I really like that that looks like this and then for multiline comments let me zoom in real quick to begin the comment you use these two emojis a thought bubble and this sort of like arrow soon emoji and then to end it you have this arrow and in thought bubble to end the multiline comment okay so everything here will be common to that will not be executed by the program cool so let's try this out real quick let's say somewhere in the program we're gonna create a thought bubble that says emoji and as you can see the the terminal the message will not has not changed right because we this stuff is actually not printed out only this line of code like four is printed out well and let's at multiline coming here what should we say yeah how you feeling today Ashley what do you what are your a pretty great actually it's well emoji day so pretty great I think yeah that very nice okay and then here's some review that we did for this lesson and it's a pretty short lesson this is a basically like a preview a hello world the traditional hollow world with comments you know explain what you know all the little symbols mean let's try this out let's try it let's try the quiz out with the view to chat actually this question is pretty simple we should going to blank to output a message in the terminal okay so this is basically fill in the blank we want to complete this program right here cool got it nice true or false emoji codes the real program language that can be used to develop applications true is that false well the app would be for a program like this so type in the chat one two three or four well zoom that zoom in a little bit what would the output beef or program like this 1 2 3 or 4 so type in the YouTube chat so I'm getting a bunch of slack messages I should actually be oh boy I wish oh wait I think I think this to the YouTube chain is a little bit delayed so we might have to wait this out okay okay so Sarah Baghdad said three and she is correct because only the stuff that's part of the only the spec string is printed out remember this is just the syntax that says this is a text string so the ABC emojis won't be printed oh cool which one is a single line comment in emoji coud type in the chat one two three four we won't we went over this pretty quick but hopefully you caught yeah you you you there's definitely a lag so as we wait for the chat to to answer this question one two three four what are some of the another question for you Thea what are some of the upcoming features of emoji code and so as you might you know might not know the current version code is 1.0 better this means we're actually nearing the grand release of version 11.0 so what's really coming up is some improvements to the compiler so the compiler will be the compilers sometimes can be a bit bad at sizing certain certain uses of well you types in the Moshi code and there's what going what's going to be optimized in the next version or yeah awesome so people says some people are saying three and some people are saying in wine that you did chat so the first one is actually multiline comment here it's a checker block so this is one is not correct here is a text string so this is also not correct so it's for a thought bubble right a single thought bubble very nice cool so now we have block letters do you want to do this or do you think we should do this or move into the next lesson okay I think we should move ahead because there's really something for people to figure out on their own I guess well they completed the lesson alright so folks watching make sure to check out the first project we're gonna move on to variables we have about 20 minutes so we should we should be good to go well actually let me go here real quick okay cool variables similar to a lot of strongly typed languages there are types right we're not gonna die you might you deep into types in this lesson but here's just so that you know one two three four and that represent integers such as zero such as 420 such as negative 34 we have decimal numbers or floatingpoint numbers a hundred that's a symbol for it which I really like okay this one is not a decimal yeah this was actually this was the chest but somebody from the community too so it was in former times it was a completely different symbol and it was quite a bit of debate about rights and floatingpoint numbers and it finally turned out most of the people like this one the best okay so I mean I like this yeah so so 3.14 negative two hundred point zero anything with a floatingpoint ABCD text strings sequence of characters as you seen in the previous lesson you know it's wrapped with ABC emojis here's a really good one the okay emoji represent truth values the thumbs up true and thumbs down on these false cool okay Hostin therapist this one is pretty selfexplanatory if you've programmed before in another language so constant variables are variables that you can modify the value in the program right so you create it and it'll stay the same throughout the program so for this very similar to other programming languages step there is the sort of assign operator right in other languages usually the equal sign so a mojiko we're assigning we're declaring a constant name pi PI that's the name of the variable and we're storing the value 3.14 into this variable pi okay I think because the version of Unicode or something that we're using on code kami this symbol actually looks a little bit slightly different than what you have on your documentation but it is yep so check yeah it's that's actually a little tiny detail of emojis as there are today because some of the symbols we know as emojis were actually in Unicode before they were emoji picker so there are two versions of those Unicode symbols but the compilers doesn't care about whether you know use the emoji one okay plain old one so let's try this out we want to declare a constant name year with a value of the current year 2020 I'm sure that copy and paste it something wrong we come to this grill quick pace of the scent all right string interpolation okay so here's another feature that I'd love to have loved to have and in a 1.0 so I feel like if you look at all the other you know top the most popular programming language is JavaScript Python and so on I've notice that usually what they've I'm they I'm sure each every language of their own problems as a scale right for a different use case it's that they were used for but I feel like they've all gotten the very basics right and one of the basics I think is so necessary for like programming is the ability to to print area so I love I might you know make a poll requesting your every boat like it'll be great if you can you know just print out a variable without using stream table yeah so I mean I'm going to respond to it and the reason why there is knows that feature today is because as you've mentioned before emoji code is actually I really designed emotion code light like any proper language every reason there is no such print function or something like that is because we don't have we don't have functions the emoji code has just objects like each other that would mean we would have to introduce a class like system and then it would be like a child system dot out dot print whatever and this just doesn't feel right I did such such a function or method okay again I tried yeah but open open it open an issue and be test and we we can go into lengthy discussion right there anyways so to pronounce train you something call strain to it's basically construct a string with you know and you can sprinkle in a constant and a variable or other things as part of the string literal okay and to do so you use the sort of magnet mo G's that wrap around the variable so suppose we have a constant named height right we declare a variable constant variable called height and we assign a value 3,000 if you want to print out a string that basically that want to print out the value of three south through the value of height instead of then you know the name of it then we then we wrap this variable in magnets so the output would look like this Alice Honnold climbed El Capitan which is three thousand feet without a rope so everything is the same here except this right here as you can see instead of printing the variable name it print out the value of height which is 3000 okay so let's try this out real quick so people understand you know a little bit more so to output the constant year using this print method Oh so we're basically throwing in the year as part of this print message so that's that let's do this real quick I copy in this APC the current here is a copy this in right here Oh something's wrong turn your is here oh boy oh whoops mr. closing ABC emoji is it weird to look at somebody programming or in a program language that you like past weeks I've gotten used to people creating a lesson about language I created so I kind of used it now but it is somewhat strange and funny at the same maybe I'm a tester right it's almost like you're getting customer feedback yeah I mean I have seen other other people friends and people are taught or talked to about emotion code use it but it's still different to see like a whole company look for course about totally it's still different than you demoing it's on YouTube it's still a lot different cool all right so arithmetic operations this is pretty selfexplanatory addition subtraction multiplication division a modulo symbol looks pretty cool it's like the garbage symbol right it's like the remainder whatever is left so you throw it out but you like it I like it up yeah okay that's great because when I first introduced it the first feedback in god was pretty negative because the person told me and something like nada loop is is a really useful operator why would you use the waste to make for his turns that was not intentional but no I I love it I think it really separated from the pack of these ones right here so that's a pretty selfexplanatory here we're doing a addition right so we're declaring a variable called score score one we're storing the result of this into square one which is six right and so on so in the coeditor we have already declared initialized a variable called amount that has a value of 18.9 now they're a new variable named tip actually I'm gonna pull up the emoji picker I feel like it's a disrespect to to copy and paste well well I copy and paste all emoji code samples all the times so let's do a mount we're gonna do multiply 0.2 cool something's wrong mmm maybe there's a testing problem yeah I think so because your code looks good looks good and maybe if you use the emoji multiplication sign like the third in the first row oh I probably know it maybe if you copy and paste it from your error message you know right there a couple but they all look the same yes okay so there's probably with the testing good yeah okay but anyways that's how you do it I'm gonna change this for after the lecture it's funny actually because I mean I've tested and it worked for me yeah I'm not sure it's we use regex regular expressions on the back end so it's usually like probably like extra space or missing space or something like that okay mutable variables so instead of constants with immutable variables where the values can be modified throughout the program and here's one way here's how we need to clear a mutable variable so instead of just doing that a sine operator the like right arrow there's two new emojis that you have to throw in the crayon Moche and the new emoji okay but pretty much the same thing so to clear a mutable variable named quarter so let's do crayon and that let's do and then let's do right arrow whoops putting the variable value eight there so nothing should happen and there is a warning oh I like this I never noticed this but this is the warning saying that quarters even though it's a we made it as a mutable variables was never mutated was never modified so this is not a error it's a warning it's basically saying that consider making quarters variable into a constant variable scope operator assignment so here's ways here are ways that you can modify a mutable variable there's something called addition assignment subtraction assignment multiplication assignment division assignment module assignment and they're pretty much the same thing as they're equivalent to so suppose I have something that looks like this actually let's let's copy this code in there I'm going to comment this out suppose we declare so only look at this code line six right here so suppose we declare a variable called I little mutable variable high and we start it as zero now let's say we want to print out let's do so let's do it we want to print out I and then we want to comment let's just comment out line 10 line 11 for now okay so only focus on this code right here so we're creating something a variable called I storing 0 into it and we want to print out it should be 0 cool and this is a little warning that you can ignore when we do something like this on line 11 a line 12 sorry we can comment this out what we're doing is this we're incrementing I by 1 so now I is 1 and what this means is this is actually the equivalent of something that looks like you know I I plus 1 something like that we're adding 1 to I itself and when we do something like this let's uncomment this line of code on line 16 we're basically saying instead of incremented by 1 we want to increment it by 5 so if you print this line of code again it will be 6 because 1 plus 5 is 6 okay so a little little shorthand I guess for not only adding but adding and also reassigning and this is subtracting and reassigning what multiplying and reassigning dividing and reassigning finding the remainder and reassign okay so in the coeditor we have already declared and initialized a variable called level so use addition assignment to increment level by 2 so I'm actually just gonna copy this code right here instead of doing plus 1 wouldn't do to and I'm gonna do level so here this is saying that we're taking level and we're adding 2 to it so when we run it oh whoops oh I common this code out before so I'm that uncommon to back cool there's a little bit it's a little bit buggy right now because I have cool and now we want to and for I don't know if you can see this for learners at home there's actually a plus symbol right here plus emoji right here due to our coeditor background it's a little bit it's hard to tell so we're gonna do the same thing but instead of addition assignment we're gonna use subtraction assignment okay so now we're decremented by one and now we want to print out the result of level so let me just go in here smiley face a PC for the text string we'll do string interpolation two of them and then we want to print a level and if you really want you can actually have you know the current level is blah nice cool so that's emoji code for for a hello world and and variables make sure to check out the projects there's a piggy bank project there's what emoji are you projects when you know you get into conditionals with emojis there's a block letters projects a lot of projects but that's pretty much a demo of the course we're already an hour into the the stream should we should we open the floor to more questions yeah sure sure so YouTube chat make sure I'm gonna unshare my screen cool and then maybe we can let me go over to our YouTube page real quick so that we can make sure to ask any questions for Theo about emoji code about the emoji code course about software compilers language whatever whatever and I guess I can start one off before the questions start coming in but what are some of the what what are some of the things that you really learn what are some the highlights like that you spend you know months and years on this so like what are the highs and lows of building this language out like what are some of the findings the learning components of designing your own language hmm so I think something you will really soon is that the most like natural and obvious things in modern programming languages are the most complicated ones for instance automatic memory management we all in I don't know child csharp sweep we all create objects and they simply disappear when they no longer need that you garbage collection or automatic reference counting and this turns out this is actually one of the most difficult things to get right you don't want to slow down the program you won't want to come to collect it also for unlikely the right moment and so on that's this is actually one of the the like deepest learning experiences that had to the looping emoji code interesting memory management yeah yeah and sorry just for learners at home like new coders so garbage collection is a form of automatic memory management and it relieves the program or the coder from performing manual memory management okay and this is where a memory management manual memory management swear you know programmer specifies what objects to allocate or objects to deallocate and returns to the memory system oh it's like a like a CS concept a lot of coders who are learning you know Python JavaScript might not know right now and they shouldn't care about it that's what I mean right this is something so natural when programming today it said that but actually it's quite a bit of work that that's that's what I meant right yeah and and also with with with typing so things like we we also in modern languages we can just cast values at runtime we can say okay this is I don't know an instance of object or instance of any or something like that and and I cast it to whatever whatever I want to cast it to if it's at least of that type and it just works and implementing debt is actually quite difficult because you need to somehow know the type of the value at runtime and probably that was already a bit complicated I don't know who wants to yeah let's see let's see if there are questions from the YouTube chat okay this is such a great question from will filled Minh how much time have you spent developing emoji code and I don't know how I spent questions I haven't counted any hours I mean it has been developed over the course of six years I guess so but but that doesn't mean I have been working on emoji code five basic research is obviously not I can't tell you yeah that's still wild oh that me six years is a pretty long time so definitely you know thumbs up easier so from nine from from it from nan myself on YouTube chat is there an emoji editor out there is there what an emoji editor yeah I think it's like a mojiko editor is there an ID no and in former times and there was an emoji ID eat like anybody at an editor but we I gave up supporting them because ultimately was too too much work or yeah but a benefit let's put it like that and then somebody saw this actually very common I totally agree with this from the high span does link who's in vine this link I think this language is perfect to visualize how code works and I really think so they really make I think any sort of newer fresh program it was like this really make you rethink about really like help me look at growing mean in a different light absolutely yeah certainly that that's that's what I meant in the beginning when I talked about the word it was was looking for and it was speaking about code and that's there's also thing I realized we don't code thinking about the words that actually are there by type for it doesn't really matter to if it says for or if it's I don't know emoji with some arrows in it that's not not how we program actually it's the same with mathematics by the way those are also just fine somebody made up here's another question from hosing mine again so hey Theo are you from Germany no I'm not in Germany am i as I mentioned before I'm in Zurich Switzerland right now but then actually from Austria and I think I wonder I wonder why that question came up possibly I don't know but I can we talked about this before you know I used to live in Germany I think you know I've been to Zurich when I was a little kid so I'd love to love to go back sometimes from Nanny mins oh no where would you want to see this in five years and where do you think it's going I have no idea I wouldn't never ever gonna have thought that that would be a code Academy course about it when I started I would have never thought that people were actually going to build things in it and I have no idea where they will be in five years maybe also after everywhere is gonna be written in oh she couldn't we'll see yeah I mean I think it's a great such a fresh such a cool language hopefully hopefully more and more people you're using the brand to you know make more people aware of it is it possible from non myself again is it possible to create a script font of tiny animated emoji is it possible to create a script a font of animated emoji hmm I understand don't get to the question if you I mean you can't create a custom font with animated symbols if that's the question but not sure how yeah cool I think that's around and we I mean we've did it for a whole hour so I'm very happy how this turned out thank you Jeff do for for you know I mean we try to do this course on april fools and you know Kobe hits and you know we didn't want I think the marketing team didn't want to be too tonedeaf so we kind of backlot this until we found a better day which is now world emoji code I just want to thank you so much again for helping out with the course for reviewing the course for giving me ideas for the course it was absolutely my pleasure it's great fun if you're if you're ever you know in New York again I'd love to you know grab a drink with you to thank you again in person so yeah thank you thank you everybody who's watching let us know in the comments below on facebook and youtube if you want to see more interviews like this and say bye to Theo everybody and I think we're gonna call it happy moving everyone cool
