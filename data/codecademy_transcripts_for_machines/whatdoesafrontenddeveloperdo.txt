hello my name is john and i am a software engineer at smartsheet frontend engineer is someone that likes being at the intersection of art and logic so if you like programming but also like the artistic side of design and working with customers being a frontend engineer is the perfect role for you a common thing that frontend engineers do is you're working with program managers and designers and customers to figure out what's the best way to implement a solution for a customer problem my favorite part about being a friend engineer is being able to work directly with customers and designers so figuring out like whether this button should be a certain color a certain size like all those fine details that ends up creating the best user experience that's one of the most uh rewarding aspects of being a front end engineer one easy way to get started is just to build your own personal website uh your website can be a expression of who you are or like what you want to do um once you're done with that that's the awesome way to start marketing yourself saying hey look i built this awesome website imagine what i can build for you next so i wanted to go to art school um but my parents strongly urged me not to go to art school so i ended up picking mechanical engineering i went to a hackathon because being a college student free food and swag that's awesome but i ended up staying and joining a team to make a game and they needed someone to make the art assets so i was like cool i get to do some art stuff well while being here but then uh i needed to put our assets into the game somehow so i had to learn how to program our assets into the game so that got me hooked into programming and then i eventually learned that frontend engineering is a thing so it's a great combination of like being artistic and also being able to program
