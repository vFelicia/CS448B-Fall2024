hi everyone I'm Sam and I work in curriculum here at code Academy we're gonna get started in just a minute on that I wanted to do a quick sound check so react in the chat if you're able to hear me cool it looks like people can hear me if you need help for any reason pop on into the chat my good friend Kenny is here helping me monitor the chat and respond to people if you have any issues so today's session is on interactive storytelling with twine and if you want to get started you can go toot winery org to download twine twine as it says here is an opensource tool for telling interactive nonlinear stories so when I was a kid oh I hear a quest to speak louder I'll move my shirt up a little bit and I'll talk a little bit about her hopefully that's better thank you yeah so twine is an opensource tool for telling interactive nonlinear store uses so when I was a kid I really love reading choose your own adventure novels that is one of my favorite things to do and now it's really easy to make that kind of experience for a website a lot of people have been watching and talking about that Netflix series Bandersnatch and while we won't be making videos for this you can totally make that type of like forking interactive experience yourself so just go toot winery org the link to download is up on this sticky note on the right I would recommend downloading the latest version 2.2.1 that's what I'll be using today they have options here for Windows Mac Linux you can also use this link to use it online I'm not as familiar with this online editor it looks basically like the desktop version I believe everything's are the same but I'm not as familiar with so one of the great things about twine is that it's really just based on HTML CSS and JavaScript so even though we're making this game we're really using all the core web development technologies that you might have been learning cool so if you haven't already go ahead and download twine I'm gonna move into twine I actually have a few slides just to set up our overall presentation that I'll go through so why interactive storytelling well something that really interests me about interactive storytelling is that nonlinearity is really cool before I went into coding I did a lot of writing and you know stories typically have a beginning middle and an end but with interactive storytelling each reader each user carves their own path kind of like this maze of working paths in the image so every user has this unique experience it also introduces a different way of engaging with a text for the reader so the reader is not passively going through the text they're actively making choices throughout and they're forced to really identify with the protagonist the protagonist is actually that making the choices I also think that interactive storytelling is really interesting because the way you navigate through these interlinked documents is just like navigating through the internet right if you're browsing on Wikipedia you're following hyperlinks you're kind of like carving your own unique course through the text that is the internet and I think interactive fiction is very similar so beyond why interactive storytelling you might also ask why twine twine is fun it's user friendly you can get up and running very quickly to make an interactive story with twine and it helps you practice the HTML CSS and JavaScript that you might have already been studying so these are just some notes for me for what we're gonna do in this session I'm gonna provide a general introduction to twine then I'm gonna show you how to creative links in twine and links are the tools that take you from one passage to the next and allow the user to be presented with different options then I'll go a little bit into styling twine passages with CSS so the same CSS that you learned oh and says please turn up your microphone volume I'm going to try to do that and I will also talk a little bit louder hopefully that's better I'll try to keep my volume up hi Kenny please remind me if I'm dipping down a little or if you see any other comments yeah so we'll talk about styling these twine passages with CSS really feels just like styling a web site then a tool that twine gives you to be a little bit more specific with your CSS is creating twine tags then we'll talk a little bit about adding images to twenties that just adds a little bit more flavor to your story and at the end I'll kind of demo how you would publish a twine story to a website there's just a easy button for you to press and it spits out HTML CSS and JavaScript if you're familiar with those languages you could look through that code and see what code was generated if you're having any issues with twine actually I found that opening up the page and viewing it with the chrome inspector isn't the best wave that I have for figuring out what went wrong and debugging my code then I'll also show you how to import stories from an HTML file into twine itself so at the end of this I'll share the the HTML that was generated put it in the project link that if you're following along on YouTube the link to this project should be below in the notes section I'll actually put the code there so that you can copy/paste that save it as an HTML file and import this story that we started together into twine and finish it off on your own time awesome so with no further ado let's go into twine itself so this is what the twine editor looks like it gives you this kind of like blueprint space where you can see each component of the story as like different cards on a storyboard the key to adding passages here is in this green button on the right where you can add a new passage this looks a little bit small can i zoom in I'll just make this fullscreen then if you want to play through the story that you're working on you can press this play button these are some passages that I wrote just to get have something to get us started together and when you click on them you can see you can edit delete or play from that that passage itself starting right there so let's start from this welcome page so this is what I have so far pressing play it just says a Valentine's Day murder mystery I just came up with idea that you know we're doing this live stream on Valentine's Day could be fun to work that into the story you know I think like murder mysteries really work well for our interactive content because the user progressing through it is trying to put clues together to figure out whodunit so that's a concept that I've started here so let's make this a welcome screen look a little bit better this is a little boring let's find an image for it so I'm just gonna go before this I search for some anatomical hearts in Google Images I thought that is a fun thing that both connects to the Valentine's Day theme and the murder mystery so I kind of like this one let me just copy this link address I'm also at here so I really just want an HTML image tag alright that looks like that didn't how would I actually need is the copy of the image address and this shouldn't just be for the image not for the whole webpage cool so I have this link here I'm gonna go back to twine and use my HTML image tag to put this in so the HTML image tag is just like other tags surrounded by these triangle brackets and then the link that I want to specify I use the SRC or source attribute and then I paste in quotes the link that I want to go to so let's see if that worked I'm gonna press play there we go so just using standard HTML image tags I can add an image to twine this page still looks a little bit boring I might want to play with the colors a little bit so what twine lets me do is if I go down to this left part I know this is a little bit small I can edit the story stylesheet so style sheet that reminds me of CSS cascading style sheets so this CSS that I can enter here will be applied to the content that I have in twine and one thing that I just learned from the twine documentation is each individual time twine passage that I write is is labeled in actual HTML that's generated as TW passage so any CSS rules that I want to apply to those passages I use this TW passage as my CSS selector again if you're not familiar with CSS this is all optional you can make a fully functional interactive story with twine without it but if you want to provide a little bit more customization we can dig into the CSS here so let's say I want the color to be green I don't think that'll look good but I just want to check to see if I'm doing this correctly if my selector is matching so I'm going to close this go back to the start yes so my font is now green I don't know I actually kind of like it I thought that was going to be just an ugly example but I think I'll stick to it okay so let's press play so down here there's this next passage the link to the next passage is just called welcome so I can press that here and this is the story that I started to set up for you so I'll just read it by the time that you arrived at autumn Grove Manor the Sun is set and the moon is just rising over the western horizon you've never visited the manor before but you have heard all about it from local legends apparently Cornelius vana Thor and the first mayor of the town of of they're in the 18th century I won't read all of this but your friend invited you to this Valentine's Day mixer in this like creepy old mansion the houses of rising up in front of you as you approach it to your right there's this barn that was used briefly as a laboratory in the Cold War but has been inactive for a long time so do you walk up to the ivycovered Manor for the party or do you peek into the abandoned barn so that's the first choice that we're presenting the user with so let's go back to this passage I want to press the edit button and show you what I've done here so if I'm just entering text into the passage there's not really no coding that I need to do all of this passage narrative I can just enter right in here and then the options that I give the learner the way that I show a link is by these two square brackets and two square brackets to start and two square brackets to close and then the text of the link goes inside I'm just gonna close this for now since I added this little demo link that should actually make a new link for us and that should also make a new passage where the user will go if they click on that link so I'm just going to close this here I'm gonna play from this welcome screen and yeah here we see a new link so I'm just going to click on this to demo what it does and it just takes us to this empty passage that says double click this passage to edit it so that's really the mean twine specific syntax that you need to master in order to work with it just these surrounding links with double square brackets another thing that I used here was I have these arrows that I'm creating just with a hyphen and an England bracket and if I have kind of long text that I don't want to be the title of the the next passage that they're going to I can use the arrow to just assign a shorter title so everything to the left of the arrow will be linked as text and then everything to the right of the arrow is just the shortened title so I'll add that here so text of the link that goes inside let me come up with a better example here let's say we can like stare foreboding Lee into the night sky I will give our reader another option so that's the text we want to link but that's a little too long to use as a title so I'll just use the arrow and point it to sky so again when I close this now I have sky as a separate route that our reader can take you'll notice here now that initial passage that I that was generated with that first link that I put in that was just text of the link goes inside that's this like orphaned passage that there's no way there's no way to get to it so as we work on our story we want to make sure that there's no orphans like that and that there's always a way for our user to navigate to every branch of the story that we want them to explore if I press this test button that will give me a little bit more information and help me identify bugs in my story you like that so it tells me what card that I'm on and if there's any variables that are in keeping track of so we're not going to go into JavaScript in this session but if I'm keeping track of like their game state a common example is letting the user like pick up some items and then keeping track of that in an inventory it'll tell me the value of all of the variables so I can three debugging yet like it's all my own code and so for now I want to remove that orphaned passage I'll just hover over it and press this delete button and confirm cool so we've really covered a lot so far we've talked about the basic interface of twine how to make new passages with this passage button how to link one passage to another we've used our HTML image tag to add an image we've gone down here to edit this story stylesheet to change the color of the text yeah are there any questions so far yeah it looks like there's been some conversation in the in the chat one of the questions is are these types of technologies based on react that's a good question I don't know off the top of my head let's go to since twine is opensource it should be pretty easy for us to actually look at the source code and see what powers twine so I'd back here on the twine home page and what I'm looking for now is some link to a github repository this support its development that looks like a donate button not a contribute let me see Oh repositories are linked right here yeah so twine is an electron app so it looks like it was all built in JavaScript let's look at this package JSON also for anyone who might not be familiar with react react is just a really popular JavaScript of what JavaScript framework for making web applications and these are all the tools that it looks like twine is using under the hood so I see that's using electron as the as the framework and it doesn't look like there's any other big tools that I recognize here so let's look up electron J s just to answer Ron's question a little bit more so it's a JavaScript framework that allows you to build desktop apps with JavaScript HTML and CSS so if you can build a website you can use electron to convert that website into a desktop app pool it's a good question and one of the cool things is since twine is opensource they're readily updating it if there's anything broken in twine you can actually see it here in issues and you can click onto these issues and see if there's maybe if something that you know how to fix so when I was on the job market after I you know learned a lot of programming wanted to prove that I had to learned programming well and I was ready to make you know coding my career I started making open source contributions so yeah if you're into it check out the twine repo see if there's any issues you can help fix cool any other questions oh I think Anton is looking for a link to the twine repository let me go back to here I'm gonna just post that and then I'll go to it looks like a v show and has a question so that's the link to the github repository for twine so V asks could you show us again how to make a passage great question let me go back into twine so there's two main ways of making a passage one is with this green button in the lower right hand corner to add a new passage that just gives us this blank passage here we can doubleclick it to edit this is my new passage and typed package since we're talking about JavaScript akka jiz so I'll close it but again this is this new packet in passage it's just no kind of an orphan it's just hanging there until I create a way to link to it so let me change the title of this untitled package their passage and keep doing that and let me think what might I want to let them navigate to after after the manner let's say they can go into the kitchen so this passage will just be called kitchen and I'll just say welcome to the kitchen I'm gonna close this and then within this manner passage that I have made I'm gonna create a new link go into the kitchen and then I know the name of my passage is kitchen so I'm gonna make sure that this text after the arrow matches that directly so now when I close this there's a link between manor and kitchen and it actually looks like this made a new passage with the title kitchen instead of linking to this existing kitchen passage so that's a little bit weird I want to delete this new one and see if it's possible can I drag that no what if I drag kitchen here no let me try again maybe it I have this space here yeah it looks like the space was the problem so whatever comes after this arrow needs to be exactly the title of anak next passage because I had this space here and made a new passage titled space kitchen not like outer space kitchen just the character space kitchen if I delete it then I can close this and see that the arrow goes correctly to the passage I wanted cool let me see are there other questions Oh where can I get the template for the start of this project yeah so at the end of this presentation I'm gonna publish two HTML and then I'm gonna copy and paste that into the actual code academy project that's linked to in the YouTube description so you can from there copy and paste that into an HTML file and use that as a template to continue any other questions that I'm missing I'm just going to scroll through any tips on finding a good repository to contribute to other than twine I've looked around a little bit for me I chose tools that I was familiar with so I used react and redux a lot so I made an open source people request to the reactor redux library if there's nothing Munir that familiar with I think I was able to find some interesting information and just doing a Google search for like beginner friendly opensource projects let me pull that up now yeah so it looks like there's a lot of results here for open source projects that are very beginner friendly there's this firsttimers only tag that's used pretty frequently and github repos so that someone who's really pretty brandnew this is often times something like cleaning up a readme file or cleaning up documentation excuse me or something that beginners would be pretty ready to dive into cool I'm just gonna scroll back up through the chat to see if there's anything else any other questions that I've missed cool thanks Chris grad thought that our answers are useful and thanks to him for stepping up and also helping field questions so I want to show you a little bit more within twine so I can do really regular inline HTML and CSS in here so twine doesn't really parse this in any way it just ends up being used directly in the code that is output by twine so if I wanted to style this a little bit say this is a little too big for what I'm looking for I'm gonna press play again yeah let's say I don't want my user to have to scroll down to see this welcome link I want to write some inline CSS to make this image a little smaller let me try setting the height attribute I'm just going to try setting that to about 40 pixels let's see that might be too big might be too small but we can go from there I'm gonna close this oh that's way too small 40 pixels is not big enough okay I'm gonna go back to edit this let's make it like 200 pixels you see how that looks cool I like that I mean it there's definitely some other CSS things like it fix maybe I want it centered or lined up differently but it's big enough you can see it and it's small enough that we're not distracting people from this welcome link that we want them to find cool what else I want to clean up a few of these first few slides just so like our first few passages so I can leave this in a good State for you guys to continue and write this story so I think we welcome is kind of confusing here you're usually games have like a start button I don't want to rename the passage so I'm just going to put start here and then I'll use my Indy arrow to signify the the text that I'm entering to show the user is not the title I want the title of the passage should be welcome but I want them to see the text start I'm gonna close that let's see if that worked yep now start is popping up and I can click start and it's still working it's still taking them to this next page speech is a lot of text I think I want to find another image here there's probably some image I can find of like a spooky mansion that would really like set the mood so I'm just gonna go to standard Google image search spooky mansion there's a lot of these I kind of like this excuse me this one kind of like oldtimey one I had mentioned that this house was like from the the town's first mayor from hundreds of years ago so this one looks a little bit more realistic for that Oh Olivia I see your question I will get to it after I add this image so I'm just going to right click here copy image address I'm just gonna paste that in and see it in chrome yeah it looks like a good image for me to use that's on my welcome passage so I'm going to click editing here so I'll put in another HTML image tag and again the source SRC attribute is the link to the image that I want to display I knew from before that specifying the size is useful I think this mansion should be a bit bigger than the heart so let's just specify height equals 300 pixels and see what that looks like hmm it didn't pop up what did I do wrong so I have my image tag I have my source attribute and that's the link and then I have my height attribute that is confusing now it's starting me from start oh there it is looks like it just took a few seconds to refresh but there I seen my HDL no image okay so Olivia had asked this question where did you click to input your CSS info earlier when I change the font color so if you click on the bottom left this is the title of the story then it gives you all these options at its story stylesheet at its story JavaScript so clicking edit story style sheet pops up text editor where you can put in your CSS rules so that's saying if I wanted to change the like text alignment center I think that's the right CSS property sometimes I make up CSS properties and I misspelled that they should be in a tee at the end of Center let's close that and see if my text is now centered looks like it is I think that would be kind of weird for all of this to be centered I feel like centered fonts should be used pretty sparingly so I'm gonna go back to just a normal left justified I'm going back to edit story style sheet and I'm just gonna remove this line textaligncenter see a question from Daniela can we put an image to the background instead of the black color yes we could there's the CSS property background image that'll take a little bit of finessing I know there's some options for like tiling the image if it doesn't take up all the space or like resizing the image but let's give that a shot and actually I'm not gonna want to do that for you no actually let's let's just jump right into that so I'm just gonna go to google image search and see if there's anything that I want maybe something like mist or like fog it could be useful as a spooky spooky background it feels like it was really the wrong holiday to do this but I'm more of a Halloween guy than Valentine's Day guy so a lot of these are interesting as background images since they're like black and white we'll need to pick a text color on top of it that will really pop let me see if there's any of these that I like I kind of like this one this will be simple and really my big concern here is I just want the font on top of it to be readable I'm gonna copy the image address I'm gonna open itself on its own tab it looks like it's a plenty big cool so let's try editing our story stylesheet and I'll do background color not background color background image and then this URL I'm not sure if that's valid CSS let's just see if it maybe it worked I'll probably have to consult documentation yeah it doesn't look like it worked let me go back to my browser I'm gonna look up CSS background image yeah so it looks like if I'm going to pass a URL in I need to use this like when you are a helper function to tell to tell the browser like this is a link I want you to go to this image address and use that as the background so let's see if that works you are then and close my parenthesis Oh looks like there it is it ends up not actually taking up like the whole viewing screen so there would definitely be more CSS that I would want to play with to make this a better experience when we see it just tiles vertically if there's more content and we kind of obviously two tiles there's this harsh border there because the top of the image is much lighter than the bottom of the image so I would probably want to you know pick a different image and do some CSS tweaks to use this for real but good question and I was glad I was able to demo that I'm gonna go back to the story stylesheet and remove this for now cool are there any other questions that went in here no so okay I think I'm gonna just export this as an HTML file open it up in a browser and we can look at it in the chrome inspector tool and then I'll move it back into the project on the code Academy platform and you guys can download it from there and import it from there if you want to so Olivia Wright is asking what sort of applications would an app like this have that's a good question I mean a lot of people do play games like this um textbased games are pretty popular they work well in your browser they work well on your phone if we go back to the twine website there's some popular games and you can check out so I'm just gonna go to twine org so there's a bunch of games here birthday simulator all healed the King display of weakness so yeah you can see this is more of like a side project or prashant project type of thing I don't think there's tons of businesses doing interactive storytelling but this could also just be a cool way of making your own portfolio site like maybe you just have an interactive about me page and there's forking paths' for people to learn more about you or like that's your way of telling your life story it's really just ultimately generating a website for you and you can use that in any way that you want I think it could potentially be like interesting for like employee training so I kind of like roleplay different scenarios that you might like want to put an employee through just a little bit more engaging then then just like passive videos or an employee manual so yeah there's all kinds of applications yeah and really I think the philosophy behind twine that's described here is that they want to transform video games into something that's not only consumed by the masses but also created by them so that idea is that you can make like fine interactive games there's a lot more interactivity that you can build into these twine sites than I've shown you so far especially if you have some advanced and JavaScript knowledge cool good question so in order to publish this I'm going to click again the bottom left where there is the name of the project and this is I just called this Valentine's Day when I made it then my first option here is published to file so when I press that it lets me name my file I'm just gonna say starting code for murder mystery I'm going to press save and now I'll see you that this was downloaded for me and my downloads folder I'm gonna open this up with a text editor and just so we can take a quick look at it Adam is a pretty standard text editor but feel free to use other things if that's what you're more familiar with so there's a lot of this year that's just generated by twine so this is twine CSS I'm imagining that this is you know just creating the standard twine the layout that every story will have in common then when I scroll down I can see some of the things that I created that I inputted so here I see the TW passage data remember that TW passage is what I was using is my CSS selector to style these passages and these are the narratives that I have you can see the links that I put in I can see the HTML tags that I put in this like and lt I think those are just like like character codes that's really just an open bracket for starting that HTML tag so if you're debugging your story and something's not working exactly as you planned sometimes in the into the code will help you figure out what's happening and what might be broken and then down here we just have more like twine twine application itself logic so this like this is all the JavaScript the twine is giving us to navigate our user through the story yeah it's a lot of code it's really too much too much to read through and it's been minified so developers will minify code in order to make it more efficient so like every character is actually taking up some space and requires some time to run so by minifying this code makes it basically impossible to read but provides a little bit of performance gains so that's why it looks the way that it does and I can open up this HTML file in my browser just like any other website that I would be working on so I can open with Google Chrome Firefox anything and here I see the story that we've been working on and there are some things that twine itself doesn't preview like audio so if I if you wanted to put audio into your story you can use the HTML audio tag but it actually wouldn't work when you're pressing play here you would have to publish to an HTML file and actually run it in your browser to see that the audio is working cool so now I want you guys to be able to pick up where we left off so I'm gonna go back into Adam looks like I might have closed this I'll just open it up again I'm gonna select all of it copy it onto the clipboard looks like Eric gross is asking how does one on minify code I honestly don't know I've never had to do that usually one code is minified it's some resource that I'm using that I'm just kind of taking for granted but I'm sure that there's some tools for it let's just see what Google says so unmanned if I Dom allows us to paste code in and I'm modifying it I'd imagine it's not going to be perfect let's see what it comes up with though this is not the whole thing okay so that actually looks like it's working pretty well so this CSS is being spaced pretty properly things are on new lines things are indented correctly yeah so this looks like a good tool good question okay cool so I'm just going to make sure I have all of this then I'm gonna go back into into Codecademy learning environment and I'm going to paste this HTML and now let's run it and now this story that we worked on together is just playing here and within code Academy and actually let me see so now you guys should be able to follow the link in the YouTube video back to code Academy and cop I grabbed this code from the code editor then what you'll want to do in order to import this into your own your own twine application is just open up a text editor start a new file copy paste it save it I'm gonna call this story for imports and dot HTML since it's an HTML file I'm gonna save that and I'm gonna go back into twine and if I go down here if I press home it allows me to see all of my stories and I have this option here to import from file so I'm gonna press that and choose file and I called it story for import HTML and when I press open how it recognizes that it already exists I'm gonna say we can replace the old copy of Valentine's Day just a demo how this import works so I'll press replace one story and now I have it and it's all still here so everyone watching you can go to that project link below download the code imported into twine and pick up where we left off there's a lot of cool things we can do we didn't even really get to the steamy romance or the chilling murder or the mystery so there's a lot of story you have to be written there's a lot of CSS to be cleaned up to make it more engaging more visually presentable and when you're done with that our community manager really wants to see your completed projects so just do the same publish to HTML process that I showed you and then she wants to get those by email so I'm gonna put her email address into the chat it's ELISA al Y SS a at code Academy calm so that's the community manager and we would love to get your completed stories and if there's any cool ones we'll share them on our blog so yeah code away apply your HTML CSS to interact a storytelling if you really want to go for it you can try adding JavaScript too but obviously that's an extra challenge yeah and just have fun thanks everyone
