hi i'm alex i'm zoe nguyen as curriculum developers we design all the courses and paths that you take here at codecademy one thing that i would like to say to all the students is to not think of this year or this semester as like a stagnant period but rather like an opportunity over the past few months technology is the way that we can continue staying connected to one another it's the way that we can continue learning it's the way that we can keep having fun i think what's really important is understanding how that technology also works you have the resources on your laptop right there to learn a lot of computer science and so i think codecademy is really good at getting your foot in the door where we make the process of just starting really easy i don't know if this is a bit cliche but i would say keep calm and carry on we here at codecademy fully support you and hope that you have a really good year
