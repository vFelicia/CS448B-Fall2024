the terms front end and back end are thrown around all the time in web development but what exactly do they mean let's think of it this way imagine you go into a computer store they probably have decorated the store nicely to make you feel comfortable and put a few computers out front for you to see however when you actually request to buy a computer they will go to the back and retrieve a new computer for you to take home similarly in web apps the front end is the part of the app the user will see it is nicely designed and easy to interact with the back end is where all of the data is stored and requests are processed like a warehouse or a storeroom the user can make requests from the front end to do things in the back end like place an order for a computer however they can't go in there themselves let's say we're building a website for a restaurant this site contains the restaurant's hours of operations its menu and directions to the restaurant when a user visits this site the html and css files for the site will be retrieved from the back end and displayed in the user's browser what the user can now see the rendered version of these html and css files is the front end of the site
