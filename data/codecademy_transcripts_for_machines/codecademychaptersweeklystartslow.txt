hi everyone my name is elisa for those of you who haven't who i haven't had the pleasure of meeting yet i am a community manager at cook academy alongside mike who you already know and i will be around in this discord channel for all things onboarding and inviting and growing your meetup i was thinking that i've been building community for like five or six years now and community is good work and it's also hard work mostly good work but one of the things that makes it hard can be getting started so i was thinking that i would each week create a little video like this where i just share a snippet of encouragement um i knew that in the early days of building some of the communities i've worked on i definitely needed it and each week we'll have a theme so this week's theme for this video is start small and keep going and i think that that's a really important one to to note because i know a lot of you are starting your your chapters here and they're going to have just a few people um unless you're an absolute rock star or like isabelle here um at cuny or you already have your your community when you're starting it it's gonna be small and um personal experience when i was starting the codecademy meetup at headquarters in new york city for the first like three or four only a handful like three or four people came like it was tiny and i was like certain that i totally failed right um but by the fourth time it was clear that okay what people needed to see was a few meetups had already happened to see that okay this is legit and i'm gonna come so those first three or four stick through them the only real failure is not trying and you're already past that you're trying you're doing a thing it's brave you've said i'm whatever your goal is i'm sticking to my goal of learning these modern technical skills and i'm bringing other people with me you already win bringing new people in will happen over time you're awesome that's all i have i don't want to go on for much longer um you know where to find
