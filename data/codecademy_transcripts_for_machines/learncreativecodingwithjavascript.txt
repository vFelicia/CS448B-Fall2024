okay look at that we're live and look at all of our attendees filing in city Lance hi everyone how's it going go ahead and try it open the chat we have the Q&A panel as well here we go well uh I'll take a few minutes to let people file in here and then we'll go ahead get started my name is Alex Koontz curriculum developer academy look at that we got a question coming in awesome Kenny's that what you guys want to introduce yourselves hey guys I'm Kenny I'm the Kirkland developer here at OCAD me as well and we're really excited to have you all here I'm seeing a lot of hellos panelists but feel free to say hi to everyone to watch a sauce yeah and folks from all over it looks like seeing Paris Dubrovnik South Africa England side Zoe I saw people loving your background of OMG it's full of stars I'm actually currently doing project in Keith's eyes and it's all about space oh yeah I've had space and stars on on the mind you could say oh yeah I also feel it's funny because my my headphones kind of make me a Princess Leia buns oh cool we have some questions in which lessons have you worked on yeah Anna Lee is a I've written a lot of the Python data science stuff Kevin's that you want to talk about what you guys did on yeah I've done a lot of random stuff I worked on our learn HTML learn CSS we're done some data science stuff we've done our learn Alexa course which was really fun I created the learn how to code course and code foundations pass that was really great and csharp so kind of all over the map yeah so we actually created a so that this learn from me what's the name of the course though learn how to code Morse you use a bunch of p5 in making like the visualizations today's that we used to create cool yeah so you can see it all in action yeah I guess I'm also like so in that respect that I've just worked a bounce between so many things started off working a lot in our learn JavaScript introduction to JavaScript course I've done learn go lastly learn Swift and also some phaser work that also uses JavaScript so well bursting this but I have never done p5 yet as of today so I'm very excited to play the role of this student yeah I see I see we got a question that we're saying do we already need to know some JavaScript to do this absolutely not this is built for complete beginners if you if you know some JavaScript already it might it might help but totally totally good if you're a complete beginner so let's work on getting people into the course that we're working on in the chat I am going to post a link to the specific project that we're working on let's see so if you go to that that URL this should be this should be the project that you're working on you'll need to be signed into a code Khadem e account and so so we if you haven't signed up for a free code cat me account we also have a link to do that let's grab that link again the this project should be open to free users so if you don't have a code Academy account sign up for a free account using that link that I just I just posted and then go back to this project I see a question in the chat is do we have to install a lot of stuff for this project nope we're gonna do it all on code Academy and everything should be like preinstalled for you is this a custom made project yeah so over the past week I put together this project for this um for this session and so yeah it kind of kind of custommade for a live you know sixty minute maybe ninety minute coding session it's not another question about we work with technical writers to build the course or if we mostly do them ourselves most of the Suffolk Academy has actually been created inhouse but now as we try to expand our content library we're also working with other content assessed against other technical writers also some subject matter experts so yeah question I'm currently reading a we're building a lot of course it's on our right now and we're we're making a course that's about like linear regression and a little bit more like advanced in terms of like the math or the stats behind it and so we have the great author we said a grad student at Columbia that's working on that so we'll like reach out and get uh get subject matter experts for when we don't know uh don't know the material okay cool so I'm gonna share my screen which will be this project that we're going to be doing today and if people in chat could like start giving thumbs up set you are sitting on this project page that would be that would be great we won't get started once we kind of have a critical mass of people that are that are on the project page I saw a question from Rebecca can you advise how to log in if you already had the free the free to trial so this project should be free for everyone correct Alex yep yeah so code can be is actually entirely free you can always upgrade to our pro offerings but this project should be free so you can use the same email even if you've already gone through our free trial and re4 user yep and again if you don't have an account you should be able to sign up for an account and not have to like put a credit card down or anything to get a free version of an account and then again go to the link which I'll post one final time and that's the project that we're going to be working in post again just in case for people funneling in a little bit late okay cool and let's go ahead and get started so you should you should see a little bit of code and then the output here and we'll talk about like all the different programming languages that go together and what we're actually working in here but before we get started we want to start with just like a little bit of interaction and experimenting with the code that we already have so the first thing that I want people to do is to just change this number inside background from 200 to 20 and then hit save you should see you are visually the visualization update where the background turns blacker one of the things I really want people to I want to encourage people to do is totally experiment as we're going through this um like oh what happens if I change this first number in ellipse to ten rather than 100 what happens if I change it to 300 rather than rather than 100 right so really you can't basically you can't break things if you ever get your code in a state where you think it's broken or not working you can hit this refresh button down in the bottom part of the screen and that will send you back to the kind of starting state so that will delete all your code which might be scary but if but you know don't be afraid to play around change things up and go through what all of these numbers mean how things are working but I really want to encourage people to experiment on your own as weird as we're going through this okay cool so let's talk about what p5.js is what javascript is what hTML is so one thing that I want people to do is to take a look at the files that we currently have in our workspace you'll see three final three files one is called final yes that's kind of the final final project that we're going to be working towards so we don't need a look at that right now but the files that I want to look at right now our sketch Jas and index.html and so if you've ever done any sort of web programming before you might have heard of index.html and yeah I will do me anomaly screen a little bit hopefully that makes it a little bit better yeah right so so we have a HTML page and we have a dot J's file and so what we're doing is we are making a website and you know right now my output doesn't really look like a traditional website basically it's only this kind of canvas that I can draw this shape on but if I wanted to I could incorporate this canvas into you know any website that I was building where I could and you know any sort of HTML or CSS or any of the kind of web development stuff that you could learn elsewhere you could take the skills that you're learning here in this very specific like p5.js course and apply that to a website that you are making on your own so I really love p5.js at just a learning tool I think it's like it's a really interactive visual way to learn JavaScript fundamentals and so that's what I use it for I use it like not in a website type of way I used it as a teaching tool for fundamental programming topics but really what it is is it's part of like this JavaScript ecosystem where you could be embedding these things in in websites and HTML pages and all that sort of stuff so I know that you're a p5 expert what's your sense of like how p5 is used within like creative coding versus you know web design that sort of stuff sure yeah so p5 is actually sort of the second iteration a set of creative coding tools that originally started with processing so if you've heard of processing that is written in Java and it was started to get artists and educators a way to get into coding so it definitely comes from the standpoint of bright creative coding using it to do interesting art projects or anything really where you can express yourself creatively so p5 yeah where I'm most often seen it are in art projects but also as an educational tool so the New York Department of Education actually has a program called CS for all and they have a lot of curriculum materials for teaching students how to build stuff in p5 you can see things like data visualizations as well or just creating sort of like yeah fun animated things to add to your personal website people are doing really interesting things with the 3d aspects of creative coding right now as well so yeah lots of different applications before joining code Academy I taught high school cs4 for a while when I used I used p5 in like all my intro courses and even some of the most advanced courses I have some some projects for my students that I want to demo at the end of this course if we have time because you really can do really really cool things with p5 and I was proud of them and want to show it off but anyways let's get back to talking about kind of this setup here which is kind of the most boring part of this so we'll try to get through the setup quickly and then we can get on to making some interactive drawings if we dig into this that looks really quick there's also a poll going on so for people who are super focused on what you have to say if you just have a chance select an option there in the poll so that we can see the range of experiences of everyone chimed in that would be fantastic pull yeah it looks like already we have most people have never used p5 before which is really cool and we will link to awesome awesome p5 resources as well I know both Zoe and I really really love p5 and so it's exciting to see you know 94% of people that have never used it and are being introduced to it all you guys have to sell it on me today before so he will be playing the role of the students ok so going back to looking at this index on HTML file which basically we are going to ignore for 95% of the session and we're just going to talk about it here in in the setup you'll see that me we have a we're connecting the HTML file to a file called sketch j/s that was the first file that we were that we were working in where there's like references to an ellipse and a background and all of these kind of you know visual elements that this is what's producing the canvas over here and so basically all the HTML is doing right now is saying connect my HTML page to that specific JavaScript file if you want a preview of where we're going you can switch this file name which you'd finally us and run your code and what that does is that's going to switch the the file that the HTML the HTML file is talking to to this other file which has a bunch of other code in it and look at this we got a little game then we're gonna that we're gonna make so basically that that's all the HTML is doing I'm gonna switch it back to sketch touch I guess which is our starving starting jobs for file there's one other part of this HTML file that I want to cover and Kenny might be able to actually answer this well where here's this script up top where there's this kind of like random URL and so this is kami you want to describe what this URL it was doing or like what the idea of a library or a package in JavaScript is oh so kind of like two separate questions there right like let's answer the script part first what we have here in the script is called the CDN or content distribution network um and that's basically saying like I have a lot of code that's stored at this web address and I don't want to include all those lines of code directly into my project so I have no idea how big p5 actually is but it could be like thousands of lines long so we directly include that into our file but it might just look really clunky and it might be hard to navigate so what other people have done is create at this CDN this content distribution network so that we can link directly to that to that code and it works really fast because there's different spots along in the world so depending on where your location is you will get the closest distribution network so whatever server is actually spinning it up and providing it to your computer so that's that's the heart of the script there as far as libraries go a library you can think of as prewritten code right so I saw the question before about what's the difference between vanilla JavaScript and p5.js and we've kind of mentioned that p5.js is a library so what the creators of p5.js have done is they've taken then the vanilla JavaScript just plain JavaScript on its own made it easier to do a really specific task and in this case I'm seeing some comments about Candice as well and that's right we're working we're using p5.js to manipulate that canvas this and you're an artist you also know the chemistry draw on it to make shapes that's what we're gonna be using javascript to do so p5.js is that subset or this library of JavaScript that we'll be working with today yeah I always kind of think of it like if you're a video game player like libraries or packages and I saw there was a question that like is this like a module in Python and yeah they're all kind of similar where it's kind of like blowing its content that you can add on to your programming language where you know noir vanilla JavaScript wouldn't know what what an ellipse is but if we install p5 or if we like addon p5 that will give us access to being able to use this ellipse function and the create canvas function and all of these like p5 specific things if you take a look and you certainly don't need to do this if you go to this web address you can you can see the p5 code like the source code for p5 so this is like you know I certainly don't understand what's going on here the people that wrote p5 wrote this code but this is like what we are importing into our into our projects you give us access to p5 cool that's all of the set up again but all of this is kind of like the really technical set up that when I'm teaching this to my intro students I don't really go that far into the depths because the fun part is like diving into p5 and starting to experiment with all the cool things that you can do with it so let's go back to our sketch dot JS file again make sure that your index dot HTML file is talking to that sketch lock draya's file it should be by default and let's go ahead and get started so again feel free to play around with all of these functions and things that we're doing on your own as we're going through this we're going to kind of walk you through a couple of little exercises that we drew up for you so the first is player this this ellipse function we have four parameters here and I think a really good exercise is to go into the p5 documentation and try to understand what is going on with these four numbers this is like an essential skill that all programmers eventually learn is to learn how to dive into documentation so this is the p5 documentation specifically for an ellipse and you can see that an ellipse has four parameters X Y W and H and so those correspond to the x coordinate of the ellipse the y coordinate of the ellipse the width of the ellipse and the height of the ellipse and so if I go back to my p5 code I can make another ellipse and I wrote in the exercise here try to make a perfect circle with a radius of 100 in the center of the canvas so right now my canvas is 500 pixels wide and 500 pixels tall so if I put on ellipse right at 250 250 so 250 pixels over and 250 pixels down now don't put the center of this new ellipse right in the center of the canvas and then let's make it let's make it wider than it is tall so I'll make it a hundred pixels wide and 20 pixels tall cool and pause for four questions there feel free to play around with making multiple ellipses on your canvas you can make them overlap so any are you seeing any kind of common questions that are happening yeah I'm all in each one of them cool yeah a comment I saw in the chat is that you can make it a perfect circle by removing the fourth one there the parameter so that one set the width and the height to 20 in this case looks like an eye yeah it does okay cool so next I wanted to show this is again a little bit of like setup or technical stuff that is less fun than like all the cool experimenting that we're gonna be doing in p5 but it's something that's gonna be useful and that's kind of debugging your code so what happens if we make an error in our code how do we know how do we know what's happening it looks like nothing is changing or nothing is showing up so I'm going to produce an error in my code I'm gonna delete one of these commas so this ellipse function is now not going to work and I'm gonna run my code and nothing shows up right so if that happens that usually means there's an error in your code somewhere and we want to learn a little bit how to debug this again hopefully we're gonna be doing stuff that is simple enough that we'll be able to kind of spot errors by hand like oh I'm missing a comma there but if you want to look if you want to see the error messages the way to do that in JavaScript is to open up the console in your web browser and so there are a couple of ways to do this and depending on what web browser you're using there are different ways to do this but I'm going to right click and click on inspect this opens up this big panel over here that you might not have seen that before if you've never done any sort of web development this is showing all the HTML on our page so you know there's a lot of different HTML sections on a code Academy page but if you go over to console you'll now see where error messages are sent from JavaScript one thing to note is that there are a lot of there are a lot of warnings that pop up based on like things that we're doing on code Academy behind the scene that's right there's like some devtool thing that you know there's a lot of things going on on the code counting backend I hid those warnings just to get them out of the way and you'll see that okay now I see an error on sketch j/s on line eight and it's something about oh missing parentheses after argument list that's not a great error message because really the error is like I'm missing a comma rather than missing a parenthesis but you can even see that okay there's an error somewhere on in my sketch dot J's file on line eight so that's that's the way that I would recommend to debugging again that was rightclicking going to me inspect and then opening up the console over here cool can he'soh any any thoughts or compliments about any of that stuff all right a question just came in in the chat though so guys if you have questions try to use the keyway because I feel like chat is just running through easier for us to identify but one question came in about semicolons right now because I see in the setup function we're using a service with a semicolon don't need semicolons is there something going on their house yeah so I will preface this with saying I am NOT a JavaScript expert I would say that I am like an expert in p5 where I make these like the way that I use p5 is to hack together cool art projects basically and so I definitely don't know a ton of like proper JavaScript I would say I'm certainly not a web developer I've never made a website in my life and so I don't know like proper JavaScript so maybe this is a question better for you Kenny okay what's what's the deal with semicolons in JavaScript um there's like a meme that says like yeah you kind of need them kind of Donuts it's optional honestly but the goal of the semicolon and you'll see this for a lot of other languages is that it terminates a line so each line contains like a statement of code javascript has an interpreter that automatically inserts semicolons for you so when the computer reads it there will be seven colons for it it knows when to or it smartly guesses when she insert that semicolon for you and there's like really rare cases in which a missing semicolon is actually going to break your code but since you're sharing your screen right now Alex in June you want one thing and take line seven and put it on line six keeping the semicolons there yeah and save your code yeah okay so that's still make sense right because there's background 200 semicolon eclipse with all the arguments semicolon so the computer actually reads it as two separate lines yeah if we remove that and try to save it yeah we got an error got higher and we can look up what that error is by going into our console stop telling on yourself Alex and Sam right we can go into our console we can see oh there's an unexpected identifier again kind of a confusing error message basically what that means it's like oh I'm now seeing you know JavaScript is seeing the closing parenthesis and isn't expecting to see us face and the letter e after that it's expecting to see something like a semicolon or a new line but you can basically see okay we have an error on line six somewhere that's about two police siren four chat my admirers are like installing a refrigerator right house there's like horrible drills going on in the background that was concerned uh would be loud like five hundred people for people asking about how to open up the console in different web browsers another tool that all programmers use is pulling it so if you're on Safari or if you're on Firefox and the and the behavior is slightly different I know I know in some web browsers you need to like dive a little bit deeper into the Preferences and like turn on a click box to to allow access to developer tools or the console but basically my recommendation is Google open console in Safari or Firefox or JavaScript and try to follow those instructions and one question I want to answer I saw so people asked about doing this off of code Academy so you can definitely do this on your own computer with a text editor like yes code slam text but p5 actually has their own editor that they've built in the browser and what's great is that it already gets you set up with the correct files and the set up and draw functions so I'm gonna drop their editor into the zoom chat so people can check that out I also like using a glitch if anyone's used switch before or repla so those are two different browserbased IVs that you can run p5 from as long as in glitch and rumblin you'll just have to link the library but in the p5 editor the library is already linked for you cool oh okay I'm gonna I'm gonna move on if again the I think the discussion about like opening the console I think that's a good one but I want to get to some of like the exciting parts about p5 so can always link back and talk more about like debugging and error messages and the console at the end of the session um step six here again I'm gonna kind of fly through a little bit quickly it's basically introducing another function of drawing a shape which is a rectangle you can look at the documentation for this rectangle but it's very similar to the ellipse where I'm gonna give it a coordinates and then a width and a height so I'm gonna make a let's see I think I said try to draw one that overlaps of my ellipse so I'll put it at 200 so 200 in the xdirection let's see 150 in the ydirection so that's coming down and then I'll make it really skinny and very tall hmm one thing to note about this rectangle function is that unlike the ellipse one where the position was in the ellipse the position was measured from the center the rectangle function this position is measured from the topleft corner so this point 200 over and 150 down that's the top left corner of this rectangle so that's just another shape that you can that you can draw p5 has a bunch of other shapes triangles quadrilaterals you know a bunch of other shapes cool all right here's where things get fun um what I want you to do is to replace one of these the xcoordinate of one of your ellipse with ellipses ellipse what is it with the variable mouse X and we'll talk about what this variable is and what it means and where it comes from but go ahead and replace the xcoordinate of an ellipse with mouse X and run your code and then mouse over your your canvas you'll see that the ellipse and follows your mouse now I also skipped fill so let me quickly do fill and then we'll talk about what's what's happening here another function that you might want to use its fill this sets the color of all of your shapes and it takes three numbers between 0 and 255 so again just as an example I'm gonna put any kind of three random numbers here at all my shapes have turned green and I'm gonna go one step further and I'm gonna change let's say this second second number to announce Y and now as my mouse goes up and down the color of my the color of my shapes change okay cool so we just did a ton of new stuff Zoe do you want to talk a little bit about what these in the house X and mouse Y variables are and how the Drollet works sure so Mouse X and that's why our values that are part of the p5 library and what they do is that they grab the current coordinates the current location of your cursor so Alex do you mind passing over the canvas again yeah cool so as you can see I know it's kind of glitchy because of zoom video stuff but this circle is currently following where Alex's cursor is on the xaxis specifically so as he moves his cursor to the left the ellipse will move to the left similarly with the fill function right here it's changing the color you of the green value based off of where Alex's cursor location is on the yaxis so that's why we're getting the color changes as he moves the cursor up and down it's changing that green value and changing the overall color a draw loop so the drama loop is something pretty specific to p5 so as you notice we started off this project with two builtin functions already our two functions that are written they're already set up and draw and to do something p5 you really should have both of them set up runs just once at the beginning of your program so that's why we have the create canvas function there that's where we're determining the size of our canvas and then in the draw loop the draw loop runs I believe it's 60 frames per second and what happens is it's going through everything that's in that function 60 times in one second so if you're familiar with the concept of animation animation is really just a still image that gets repeated at such a fast time that to our eyes it appears like movement is happening same things happening in the draw loop and I can demonstrate this Alex would you mind moving the background to the setup function here's one way that you can actually see this happening in real time if we move the background to the setup function that means that it's only going to be drawn once and then everything that happens in the draw function is going to be drawn right on top of that so it should happen now is you can actually see every single iteration of this of the shapes getting drawn and it leaves this kind of trace element to it which is kind of cool and something you can play around with creatively too if you like that kind of look especially because you can get rid of what do you call it the line that goes to the stroke yeah like a stroke stroke so we have this built in no stroke function that will take off that black line that you have on either side and then you can actually see how this can become really interesting paint program if you had something if you had a circle that was attached both your mouse X and mouse wine curse so if you want to yeah Alex will change the second program return bass why here's a good demonstration of commenting I'm gonna comment down some of these other shapes just so I know I only have the ellipse that's connected to my nose so now the circles are just gonna follow wherever alex has this cursor on the canvas and you start to get this really cool paint program and you can change the fills so again it's dependent on where the cursor is and so he just summed out the red value so it's equal to wherever the cursors position on the campus for Mouse X yeah so I wanted to talk a little bit about one of the other things that we did very quickly here was add this film function which takes three parameters so the way that colors work in p5 by default is by you using RGB color values so you can kind of think of it as the first value is the amount of red you want in your color the second value is the amount of green that you want your color and the third value is the amount of blue that you want your color and the amount goes from 0 to 255 and so you can you can actually see when I mouse over past 255 the color kind of stops changing right you can think of like okay this this number here goes beyond 255 it becomes 500 right when I'm down in the bottom right corner where I'm 500 pixels over and 500 pixels down and so it's as if I had subbed in 500 500 there and that's gonna just be that yellow that we saw when I was down this bottom right corner so you can see if you go past 255 it just kind of maxes out to whatever the 255 value would be can I also say something specific about the film yes function so Phil is going to determine the color for any shapes that come after it so if you want to change the color for a shape so it's different from the one before it so if you notice before when we're drawing and we had a bunch of shape stuff they were all the same color and all changing the same way but if you call the fill function again before another shape that you want to have a different color then you yep so you just took call fiddle again with a different set of values for the color that you want yeah so this will make it so the matter I feel I fill with certain color and then draw the circle that's attached to my mouse and then I changed the fail I changed my paintbrush and I draw two more circles so we should see one circle it's connected to the color is connected to my mouse and then the other two circles are just this ugly gray colors I made one good a tool that I use and this is like you know a very basic tool if you just Google RGB color picker Google has this nice little color picker and you can see that like okay this blue value would be 64 37 196 so if you want to like you know if you don't want to do the guesswork of what is this color gonna make if I put in these three values you can you can use this tool and get or you know whatever pretty colors that you want let's see I see someone says no stroke is causing my shapes to the shape to disappear that's probably because you don't have a fill see if I turn off my fill meaning the fill is just empty and I've also no I feel is white so if I also if I also didn't have a background oh so if you turn off your if you do no strokes and their shapes disappear you're probably painting white shapes on a white background with no border hey guys it's ELISA I've been over here in stealth mode sorry there's a question from an anonymous attendee if they joined late how do they find the lesson yes um so let me grab I'm asking that because if we see it one there's probably number of people totally so in chat I'm posting the link to all of the lessons that we're doing for this entire conference and the one that we are working on specifically is the fourth one creative coding with p5.js so if you want this specific project it's that link and then if you want to do later sessions you can click on this learn from code a home conference and that will take you to all the other sessions that we're going to be running today thanks thanks for guys Natalie so yeah thank you there is a question about why are we using functions that we're not calling them yeah which is a question that comes up a lot of folks that program before and they get into p5 so people is a little interesting in this way the set up and the draw functions are two functions that you actually don't need to call I looks I don't know if you know a bit more about about why that is but I think you know p5 was really designed for folks who actually don't have familiarity with coding and so I think they're trying to make it as easy as possible for folks just start would be my assumption yeah I think that's probably true you can always think of like the setup function gets called once at the start of your program and then the draw function gets called 60 times a second so if you're familiar with loops and programming you can imagine as if somebody has written a loop that happens 60 times a second and the draw function is being called in there okay cool so again we're able to make cool drawings but we're also learning some kind of programming fundamentals I think the the fundamental programming concept that we've seen so far is this idea of variables where this variable is storing a value and then we are plugging that value into this film function so that's kind of big programming concept number one that we've learned is this idea of variables if we have time we can define some of our own variables the other programming concept that I want to cover is the idea of so a conditional is kind of a branch in your in your program where if one thing is true then a certain certain chunk of code is nothing to run and if it's not true then another a different chunk of code is gonna run so you can see that kind of the pseudo code for this is if some condition of walk a else code block the and so I'm gonna show that off in well first of all I'm gonna clean up my my canvas a little but I'm gonna do just an ellipse that follows my mouse maybe we can move the background back to write the background you can kind of think of that as like painting over all of your old work so when I move the background into the draw function now what I'm doing is I'm still drawing an ellipse sixty times a second but I'm also painting over all of those old ellipse that's okay cool so I'm gonna write a conditional here and my condition is going to be checking where the checking to see if my mouse is on the right side of the screen and so that condition is is now is Mouse X greater than or or equal to I suppose 250 so before we hit run and in fact their abuse index error if I hit run right now but I mouse greater than or equal to 250 is false false false false false well name right now is the double here and then as soon as I pass that 250 mark which is somewhere in the center of this canvas it would flip to true right now my mouse X is greater than or equal to 250 so if that condition is true I want to let's say fill my circle with red if that condition is not true which is this else statement I'm gonna fill my circle with green so depending on where my mouse is I'm gonna set a different fill and then no matter what right I'm gonna draw an ellipse afterwards right the ellipse is outside of these curly brackets saying what to do if if this is true or if it's not true let's go ahead and run this we'll see so the condition is false right now now sex is not greater than or equal to 250 and now it's true right so that's that's the idea of a conditional and programming where I'm able to ask a question I'm able to say is my mouse on the left side of the screen or the right side of the screen and do different things depending on it so Zoe what are some cool creative coding things that we could do with this I mean changing the shape the color change the shape of it too you could even have things you can actually add I mean this is getting a little far advanced so probably know what we're gonna do but just for the sake of examples you can bring shapes into p5 you can bring shapes videos gifts in so you could have the video change or image change depending on where it is on the campus but yeah changing changing what the shape is changing the dimensions of the shape that you're working with yeah so here let me run my code again so now you'll see both the color and the shape will change depending on if my mouse is on the left or right side of the screen okay we have how light does this go to this goes to new as well good so we do have we do have a good amount of time so maybe we can slow down a little bit and answer questions are you seeing any super common questions that we can answer well to Joseph's specifically you just pasted his code in the text and when I copied and pasted his code in it seems like there that you have background in the stouts so I see background instead of back ground with a G yeah and ellipse as well it was two Wells rather than one yes yes caching errors so that was the power of debugging yeah and again I'll show this off and so I'll run my code with a typo with ellipse and now you can see that so running yeah maybe my connection to code captain e has gone out and i refresh that page questions coming in the Q&A panel we have to answer a hundred and ten so far have the chat to money bad typing yes you can see hey I just introduced the typo and it's not working so again I'm gonna just demo opening up my console and you can see that ellipse is not defined with one L so basically it's saying hey you're trying to call a function that I don't know what it means because I don't know what this this type of week and you can see that it's on line 14 of my code any other any other common questions that you think is worth we're talking about right now Kenny or are people see me pretty good one really early on I think this will probably relate to our next topic but it seems like my mom was trying to run final that Jay has to see the final project and they weren't able to get anything happening so once we get up to that point I think it'd be nice to just like really iterate but what we did to get final the final solution mmhmm sure yeah if you want to see the final final solution if you go back to your HTML page and again this is kind of all we're doing here is creating an HTML page and we happen to be connecting sketch js2 that HTML page if you change the file that the JavaScript file that's talking to this HTML page from sketch to final we now have we have now have this project maybe this is a good time to talk about what's going on in this project so Zoe as you'll see how this project is like a long game where you're trying to get to the end and if you won but if you walk into the walls it says you are dead go back to the green school and start over so how do you imagine conditionals are being used in a project like this yeah and I'd imagine something that is able to detect if the lip sees this is really interesting challenge actually this is edge detection so somehow it's able to determine if it has touched something that has value hmm yes so maybe you can somehow right basically you have to think about the question that is being asked which is the question that seems to being asked here is have I running to the wall where has my mouse gone over the wall and Zoe is Zoe is saying like okay maybe one way to detect that is this be able to say he's my mouse over this red filfil value the way that it's actually working is rather than saying is my mouse over this red fill value we're saying is my mouse in a very specific like region of this dream and so you're doing it with coordinates yes I'm doing it with coordinates there might be a way to do it with color color value but I'm not exactly sure I don't know I would love to know this because this is actually something that comes up a lot with building games and b5 is edge detection collision detection right yeah so let's step back Dental I'll come back here let me okay ready movies well I'm gonna draw a rectangle in the middle of the screen or like middle issue of the screen so what X 200 Y 300 I'll make it a hundred wide 250 small and then I'm also going to put on ellipse that follows my mouse 50 so I want the xcoordinate of the ellipse to be Mouse X the y coordinate to be mouse Y and I'll make it a small little circle really fast people reading we get to friend this project I've noticed I've been doing this a couple times the questions but p5 has their reference online so I seem just got a lot of questions about how do you add text how do you change the kind of color type if you want to use like names of colors versus RGB values I highly recommend you go check out p5 p5.js org slash reference a lot of those questions will be answered for you there yeah we've linked it to a couple of places in the reference over here on the left and so if you click on that this one sent you two ellipse then you can say you can look at reference and you can see there's a bunch of stuff about color here are all the other shapes that you can draw lines and points text is I know text it's called the text function so typography here's how you write text but you can change the font you can change the font size you can change the style you can change the width all that sort of good stuff so again that was going to p5 and clicking on the reference if you've been documentation for all that sort of stuff and as you can see there's here's the builtin Mouse stuff there's also one that's kind of useful is mouse is pressed so you can there's a builtin variable that will be either true or false depending on your mouse is pressed here's a little example where if mouse is pressed I draw a circle otherwise I draw a rectangle so Mouse's press is the cool little thing that gives you more more interactively alottoni there I'm seeing two questions in the Q&A panel where they're asking about rotating or turning it looks is there can we look into that yes that unfortunately is not super easy I think unless unless I don't know an easy way to do it the way that I have done that in the past is so you can rotate the entire canvas and then draw normally so let me bring it in this and this gets like fairly complicated so in setup I'm going to rotate the entire canvas you can see that this parameter has something to do with pi you can think of that as like the amount of like you know the angle that you're rotating it around so if I do this I lost my can actually cook anything I do this that didn't work well I'm flying eight I've never oh I deleted my opening curly bracket that didn't even work I thought wrote a tribute rotated the entire canvas so like basically zero zero was not no longer that's in the top right corner it would be down here and then it would draw everything on the diagonal oh no that you want to get I believe it's translate translate okay I think that's maybe what you're looking for yeah so translate and rotate are used in conjunction with each other all the time yeah again this is me kind of your learning live mmm also do not cease work okay um but that's a that's a good thing to just grab the exact code here sorry Alex what are you trying to do we're trying to draw a shape at an angle so rotate the shape okay there we go yeah interesting so maybe maybe if I threw it down in the draw function work but there's a there's a square that's rotated where basically I've rotated the entire canvas what I believe changes the origin yes exactly yes so 0 0 is now in the very center of the screen rather than the topleft corner yeah and then rotate is we're taking that canvas yeah that's a good question though and that's the kind of stuff that's super fun where it's like if you want to do this sort of thing you can you know basically google it and you will find somebody that has that question before and then you can play around with it so thanks for them I don't know I'm curious though like if he if you put that yeah click code that you have highlighted directly into draw instead would that work the same way or let's see what happens so that is working the same way and now let me switch I'll see if I can get this worked I'm gonna follow my mouse what do you think it's gonna spin Oh oh yeah like so I believe that translate it only it kind of like defies the draw loop I remember because I was actually doing this for my 100 days of coding I was trying to get us like an earth to rotate and so it actually it will end it doesn't apply cumulatively like other animations do in the draw loop I actually just linked to gene Kogan has really great peopie of transformations article online so I just threw that into the chat but he he talks a lot about getting things to rotate and I believe he has a specific thing about animating rotation that he does that has to do with using a certain so whether you're rotating something a lot so max s are rotating it along a separate access yeah yeah I'll put a pumpow stuff so yeah Jason in the chat I mentioned try rotate see is that something in the documentation that sounds like that's part of the 3d stuff would be my guess yes so Z values only exist in 3d space so I see that so that's the 3d documentation is also cool but good call on looking into the documentation that's exactly what you should be doing great okay I'm gonna go back to this idea of kind of edge detection and so the the problem that I'm gonna try to solve here is how do we tell when this circle is inside the square so so far we've been able to say I know when my circle is to the left or to the right of this square and so or the left left half of the canvas or the right half the canvas the question of is my circle inside the square is a little bit more complicated there are in fact four statements that we have to think about it's is my circle below the top of the square and is my circle to the left of the right of this where and is my circle above the bottom of the square and is my circle to the right of the left side of the square right there are four conditions that all have to be true at the same time you don't know for me to be inside this square and so this is a really good example of using something called boolean operators which kind of lets you combine your your conditionals that you're writing in these if statements so I can say something like for right now let's just do use my circle in the bottom right corner so is it below the halfway point and is it to the right of the halfway point so to the right of the halfway up at halfway point is is Mouse X greater actually I'm gonna do this above drawing in a circle because we're gonna change the color of the circle so so that is my mouse on the right side in screen that's is Mount X greater than or equal to 250 and again it's only 250 in this case because my canvas is 500 by 500 now I want to say okay it's the right it's on the right half the screen and it's on the bottom half of the screen getting that it will be in the bottom right corner to use and in JavaScript it's two ampersands so mouse is on the right side of the screen and my Y position of the mouse is on the bottom of the screen so that's Mouse y greater than 250 and if this is true I'm going to again just for like testing purposes I'm gonna film red otherwise I'm gonna fill with our G so not true here because I'm only on the right side of my screen I'm not right and bought them but it is true down here right answer we can almost even like draw where this is true right if I got rid of this rectangle I can kind of draw where this condition is true and you'll see that it's only true in the bottom right section of the screen so an exercise that I that I would do with my students as like a homework exercise is I would draw out different regions and I would say you know how how would you like write the write the conditional that changes the circle to read when you're in the bottom right or the top left you know write a conditional that's true when you're inside a rectangle in the center of the screen so let's do that let's do rectangle in the center of the screen so I'm about to call on you to do some math one of us should be able to answer it so okay all right okay so I'm drawing not a friend Kenny so I want my circle to be red when I'm inside this square and so I need a rate of conditional and again it's gonna be four conditions because I'm gonna say I might below the top am i above the bottom and like the right of the left side and then to the left of the right side so what would the condition for am i below the top of the Missis we're V alright so we're drying it at 100 or 200 sorry why see already yes exact infuse because of this zero zero starting talk about math the zeroes are starting up left corner not in the middle so why those increases as you go duck yes so 200 so it's Mouse y is greater than or equal to 200 that means I'm below the top of my rectangle yes and all right let's do let's do above the bottom of the rectangle so it's 70 okay so it would be 270 so less than 270 what is less than 270 I'm sorry that's why yep so we care about them else why because again we care about that why they thinking about the Y values yeah so I want mouse Y to be less than 270 and so I just got that from looking at the Y value parameter which is 200 and then the height parameter which is 70 and just added 70 to 200 cool and then let's do left wall so left is being drawn at 100 so greater than 100 for Mouse X yep now it's X we care about left and right for this case its greater than 100 and then we're done yeah so the edge of the right wall is gonna be a hundred and fifty because the width is 50 so adding that to 100 so we're gonna make it less than 150 I can do that the support was you know what it took me over the edge I gotcha Oh ha ha I wrote Mouse X so that one's good that's my Y is greater than the top my Y is less than the bottom my X is greater than the left side but then I was checking the mouse X for the right wall when I want to be tracking me sorry I was checking the mouse Y but I want to be checking them out sex there we go that error that I made actually is a it was unintentional but it's a good learning moment in that that was a logical error there was nothing wrong with my syntax so if I you know I have that be have them house why and I'm like oh shoot it's not working if I went in and looked at my console there wouldn't be an error being thrown anywhere right the JavaScript is happy with this but it was a logical error in that me translating my you know my thoughts to code I didn't do that correctly and so it wasn't behaving as I expected to do Alex I always just blame the computer as I don't think I do anything yeah why don't you understand my intentions changing color yeah so the condition the thing that we are branching on in this condition so again we just did a bunch of work for the logic of am i inside the rectangle or am I not inside the rectangle oh but sorry I think I misunderstood your question you're saying why is the rectangle also changing yes yeah so that's it that's a great question the rectangle is also changing because basically it's on the next opening of the the draw function so I set the fill I draw the ellipse and then the draw function starts again and the fill is still set I started the draw function again I draw my next rectangle and the fill is still set to whatever it was set based on this conditional so it's like you know I never if I changed the film down here to black I believe this will make the rectangle always black because I set the fill for the I set the fail I draw the ellipse I then set the fill to black and then draw the rectangle and then I checked to see you what the next well that should be drawn as I see the code that makes the ellipse trail this was this is because we're currently not drawing the background I draw a background I make it background or some color the background again you can kind of think of the background as painting over all of your old all of your old drawings where at the start of the draw loop I just paint over everything that I previously did and then draw a new a new rectangle so the you know the stuff is still there but I'm just like painting over it Alex I saw a request in chat for us to drop the curtain code might be ugly do ya play around with it that's what we're doing right now so encourage you all on the chats also play around with it yeah absolutely your output doesn't have to look anything like art but you can change the background color you can change the color of the rectangles or the circles there you like time check is almost 1140 cool okay so I I think there's so much stuff that I want to do I think can we see in the chat would everybody like a fiveminute breather in between now and the next session can we just see yes as a knows in the chat okay okay so for the final 15 minutes what I want to do is I want to just show the code for this pretty little maze game that I made and we can talk about it I want to show off cool projects that you can make with p5 and then I want to answer questions if people have questions so let's look at this final J house code the first thing I want to point out is run it whoops and let me again switch the HTML to be talking to final right so there are a couple of things here that we haven't talked about yet where I'm creating my own variable based on whether or not and you know I'm dead in the game and that variable is changing so that's something that we we didn't get to is like creating our own variables so far we've only used now sex and that's why the thing that I want to show is the really really complicated conditional statement that I wrote to check whether I'm inside these walls and so that is this mess again I can like I don't know if it's useful posting this in chat or not but this is a giant crazy conditional that is checking am i inside this rectangle or this is a this is a logical operator that we didn't get to just like I was able to use and to say am i below my below the top and I both my the bottom and my to the last and am I to the right another logical operator that you can do it or so basically what this is is am I in this rectangle or am I in this rectangle or am I in this rectangle or this one or that one so it's this big big big if if statement that if I'm inside any of these rectangles I said that two variable comb is alive so actually actually what I did was am i inside the path not the not the rectangle so am I in the path so am I in that rectangle or that rectangle or that rectangle so it's a big crazy conditional checking to see if I'm on the path I'm storing that in a variable named is alive and then if I'm alive and I'm not dead again don't worry too much about this am I not dead and basically what that is doing is that's making it so when I die I have to go back to the start to come alive again so if I'm alive then I set the fill of my circle to what is that so the nice steel and if I'm dead I set it to red so that's kind of what basically I think that's as far as we got into this game of you can make really complicated you can make really complicated edge detection now based on ands and ORS so we have any we have any questions about that in chat someone asked if s which case yeah so a switch a switch statement is similar to an if statement I think a switch statement might be more appropriate if we had more things that we wanted to do right now we're only interested in doing one thing or the other a switch statement might be appropriate if there were like four or five things that we wanted to do so if case one is true do thing one if case two is true do you think if these three is to do things three right now we're kind of binary we only have two different cases but yeah switch a switch statement is similar to what we're doing there um Deborah the entire code from this example is in your you you already have access to that it's named final dot J s and again to see that open up the HTML file and change the change the JavaScript file that your code is talking to from sketch which is the first file that you were working in tune final J s and then if you run that code should pop up question about if we did it based on the the color that the mouse is touching would that be easier that would certainly be easier but I think I'm not aware of p5 i don't think the p5 we don't have actually we don't have like variables associated with the mouse of what color it's touching we only have the position of the mouse so if you look at the references in the reference Docs yeah that's a good point here's all of the things that you that p5 who knows about the mouse it was its position in those if the mouse button is pressed in Italy stuff about the mouse wheel but it doesn't really know that the mouse is sitting over a certain color excellent question from Alessandra are there good p5.js opensource projects so this is a good time to shout out really awesome p5 creators my favorite and I think Zoe's favorite as well is one of Zoe's professors from NYU he runs a YouTube channel called the coding train where he he does projects in p5 I would really recommend looking at the coding train yeah is that awesome dude yeah he's a great teacher and he makes really really cool projects it's like you know these are these are basically 15 minute long videos where if you want to code along with him he shows you writing up the code but then you get to see his cool output too if this one ends with coop it's part one of two bleed yeah it's great and some of these are actually real classes that you teach is that nyg oh so he has his whole section on nature of code which is also a book that you can find online but that was a class in my program at ITP so you can have access to that without going in way people yeah I know I know Schiffman is like part of the people that build p5 were part of that organization yes so he's part of the processing foundation the person who actually started p5 is Lauren McCarthy who also used to be a teacher ITV she was with my teachers she's over at USC I think UCLA weren't one of those close in LA and she was the student of Casey Ria's and then fry and MIT were the creators of processing so she and Daniel Shipman kicked him off p5 at ITP nyu actually the year i started in 2015 but it's open source so if you're also interested in working on the project and on the codebase itself they were really he's saying opensource community yeah I wanted to show off something that my students did women uh when I was a teacher this was all done this was all done in p5 this was these were my most advanced students they they had done like three or four years of computer science at this point and so they were you know they were pretty comfortable with coding and so this was a project on genetic algorithms which is like a type of MLA I thing so they wrote this program to algorithmically draw different drawings so in this case the most everyone so you'll see as the program runs we're finding better and better and better drawings of Mona Lisa so this was a this with a cool little one cool any uh I feel like now is a good time to answer questions we'll hang out for a bit if you guys want to take off or take a break before the next session I suppose I should like a link to the next sessions that in chat right now thank you for joining everyone this was super fun i yeah yeah I'm putting a link to the discord server in the chat also so if everybody here wants to keep chatting with each other the people that were over in the HTML session right now they've all moved over to discord so maybe there's some opportunities you guys are awesome it's ELISA thanks ELISA I just like the question about glitch Alex do you mind a gating to glitch sure I by the way I just posted the links to the next such and where's it glitched on iOS I believe said yeah no that's not it JK sir my mommy it's just glitch calm okay so glitch allows you to do projects just right from your browser rather than doing it on your computer and then having to upload your files to get them online and it will generate a webpage for you so if you saw I'll just create a new project and it gave it the automatically generated name marble classic fire plant so if you Alex you go to show for a second that's right this little sunglasses are and you go to in a new window actually in a new oh there we go so you actually have a cool new web page right now that anyone any of you guys can visit at marble classic fire planet dodge I think it's like glitch dot me is the full URL do you mind going back to the the picture or a second so you can see the full URL yeah dot glitch dot me so if you want to have a project immediately hosted online it's super easy to do that with glitch the other great part about glitches Alex if you don't mind going back to the home page so the the really powerful thing about glitch is it's can it's a community of creators and you can remix different people's projects so if Alex you can go back to there's a way to get back to the home screen quickly but glitch will have like different projects featuring you can go look through curated collections that people have woo ideas that's a great one why don't you go to starter charge a yes so this is what it looks like when you're looking at someone else's project it would load the project below and you can see the project itself there should be a link yeah on the there's there's usually like a remix your own button so it's kind of right below where the project is so let's if you click on that remix your own if you scroll down so if you click that you it immediately Forks that specific project basically makes a copy of that project with all the code in it for you to play with so actually when I'm teaching p5 I usually do a template in glitch and so then learners can just take what I've built and then remix the code from there so it's really fun to be able to like experiment with different projects if you see a project that you think it's really cool and want to know how it's built or you want to modify it glitch is a really great place to get started for that yep I'm seeing comments in the chat about like coach Adam II Pro and paid paid coke Adam II one thing that so for people that don't have Coke Adam a pro so coke at me pro gives you access to a bunch of courses and and our projects and quizzes and all that sort of stuff but we have you know the you know the address for the scholarship thing so if you don't have a pro account if you we started a cocaptain scholarship so right now due to Kobe 19 and everyone being at home we want to give access to two scholarships for students that are stuck at home and teachers that are second home and you need resources so if you go to if you Google and Coke Adam a scholarship or go to Coke Adam EECOM slash learn from home if you have a dot edu or a dot k12 or other email addresses I think work at this point you can get a 90 day scholarship for pro and that will give you access to all of our courses so go there if you want to want to play around with coke add anymore until when so when we started the scholarship we said that it was going to be 90 days the idea was going to the end of the school year I think that is still currently the plan and so we're like thirty days into that so if you sign up for a scholarship here you should get about sixty days of free Pro again this is only people that have a dot edu or like a education email address yeah exactly and even if you don't have a dot edu but you have like a I think we're working with this new system that Spotify uses to to check out educational credentials and if you have any troubles will see mail or customer service team yeah yeah cool question are there curriculum resources for p5.js it's not on code Academy yet although Zoey and I would love that to be the case perhaps give us feedback I've talked with my friend who works at the New York Department of Education where they use P five in the classroom and so it'd be a really great opportunity for their students but I think the lots of students he finds an awesome introduction and its really kidfriendly too I also used to teach with girls who code I would use P five for projects there too but it's also you know just because it's great for beginners doesn't mean specifically for kids tons of adults use it tons of professionals use it all the time so it's really really adaptable for everyone yeah I really think it's the best way to teach you know programming again it's like it kind of wrapped up in all of this like web devs system where it's like a little bit clunky at first of like oh this is a JavaScript page and it's connecting to HTML but like as soon as you get set up and going I find that it's an amazing way to teach the core concepts because it's so visual it's so interactive you know back when I was in high school learning computer science it was like you know write an if statement and print out hello if it is true and like you know I'm sad if it's not true it's just like so much more fun to be able to do these like super interactive drawings so yeah yeah I know I ate a Python class when I was at it and graduated NYU and it was like build a mortgage calculator but I think you know valuable for some people but I was like man my first class was with Dan Schiffman learning p5 I'm like really really happy about that even that's not something you end up using in your professional life I think yeah it's still it's still really fun and a great way to practice programming so the next session is starting at noon in three minutes so we're coming into your coffee time guys if you want to go grass take a break something I just posted the links to the registration page for the two other sessions we're doing in Curtis Swift which is the permanent language that Apple uses to make hot and then that we are doing learn CSS so if you're if this like web dev related stuff interests you and you want to learn some web dev stuff in earnest of like making actual websites as opposed to little canvases Lauren CSS would be a good place to go there yeah absolutely and you can combine HTML CSS JavaScript last les plug pp5 works with dom manipulation and interactive stuff like that too so you can combine all of this stuff together to make really awesome websites yeah so cool thanks for thanks for joining up really thank you everyone Kenny's gonna be in that CSS lesson Kenny is doing backtoback sessions he's doing Kenny is doing four and a half hours straight of teaching so good job Amy no I'm taking in our audience participation sitting here and looking pretty that's what we hired you for exactly alright I'm gonna stop the I'm gonna stop the if I can figure out how I do that thank you for joining everyone yeah thanks secure as they say talk to you later
