i think we are live yeah i think we're probably good to go okay cool hello guys welcome back to our live series on creative decoding this is session three and today we have a new face who i will let her i will let them introduce themselves but before we do that my name is jiwan i am a curriculum developer at co academy and we also have hello i'm alex i'm also a person developer at codecademy super excited to have cassie here today um very fun to get some guests talking about creative coding um yeah so cassie do you want to introduce yourself yes um hi everyone i'm cassie tarakagian um i use they them pronouns and um i am just here to talk about a little bit about my work and then um a project i've been working on for uh five years now which is the p5 editor which is like a platform that will let you write p5 sketches in but i'll just kind of like introduce myself first so let me do the screen share thing and um play this did it work oh no it's thinking looks good to me oh there we go um so hi it's me um and so i am a like technologist and educator and artist musician so i kind of do like like a bunch of different things um i like i'm a technologist like i write code um i make this you know uh web editor for p5 i also have like a bunch of experience just like working on like different types of creative coding software in general i would say my work is really focused on like software for creation like i've worked on um i worked at um cycling 74 which is a company that makes software called maximus c which is like a different creative coding tool um and um yeah i also have just like worked as a worked as a web developer but i also do a lot of teaching so here's a picture of me teaching in the you know the before times um i was teaching a like max msp workshop here and um i also am an adjunct professor at nyu itp um teaching there this semester a class on like culture like internet culture and memes and that that kind of stuff online yeah class on like cursed content if you're familiar with cursed content um so that's really fun um and yeah i also have like some creative projects that i do that are kind of like in the space of like art and technology so i have this project a few years ago a few years ago called wiki sonnet which like generates which like scanned all of wikipedia and found like all of the sentences that people have written that were in iambic pentameter which is like a stress unstressed things you know like the form of the unstructured and then it like assembled them all into elizabethan sonnets so like sometimes they were kind of like nonsensical but you know just kind of i it's one of those things that like it's so difficult if you're like i want to sit down and write a sentence and i have a pentameter it's quite difficult to do but if you were like constantly doing it accidentally all the time and i think it's fun to um take like transform sentences that were like used for just to you know be information right like like wikipedia is a place to share information and then like re recontextualize it it's like poetry um you know i really like proposal for a hypertext project is like i am i have a century um yeah unfortunately the project is like very it was like costly to like run and like generate these sonnets so it's like no longer a real website but you know that's just like a past project and this like was a web application that had like a whole server back in i was like you could generate some real time which was which is fun and maybe we should like try to just get the ones that we generated i was staying up but you know future um i also um have an app that i made that tells you whether or not you're holding your phone just more just like a dumb dumb kind of project this is this is part of um made the set like the stupid hackathon at nyu itv oh yeah yeah um i also had like a musical project i was part of called blob eyes for ai which is about like making music for like the the like machine learning artificial intelligent like children were bringing to the world like showing them how to like exist in the world and be like loving loving creatures um and i also just like want to give a shout out to like neopets because it's just like i think it's just like vitally important to like how i like experience computers i think it was like the first website that i like spent a lot of time on and like put a lot of energy into and it was also the first place that i ever learned how to write code like on this website you could um like you would have like a bunch of pets that you could like give them different like colors you can like build a home from them and have a shop there's like a stock market you can do so much on that website and um but you could make like a like a website for your pet and so they would just give you like this giant like text like no syntax highlighting just like literally like a text area or whatever and you would just like edit the html you like put any css like in line and that's how you would have your your web page and i like wish i had an example of one of the ones i made but when i like logged back into my account many years later it had like been hacked and like all my accounts were gone that's funny we hear i i feel like i've heard that story a couple of times that's really being like the introduction to coding i mean yeah i'm curious how so this is a this is a series for basically beginners to create coding where we're just introducing them to p5 i'm curious like how how do you even get started with creative coding where you're talking about like oh i made this like silly app that's selling if i like i'm holding my phone or not or i'm you know i i have this cyanide contaminator generating thing how do you even like get into the community how do you like what would do you remember what your first like creative coding project was or how you even began i i don't remember um i'd have to like really oh you know actually i think that i i got into it um because i think i like you know i kind of would like make websites on neopets i also you know i think it's sort of like the same era was really into like making myself have like an awesome email uh an awesome emo myspace page you know that was like that was like my vibe and then sort of like i like studied um like engineering in undergrad and sort of that that felt really like divorced from that world where it was more like oh we're like learning we're just kind of like learning how to code but it wasn't as much focused on like output and like this is what we're like going to do with code and then i um i like ended up taking a course that was about making like computer music um because like i have like a background in music as well and i was just kind of like i don't know maybe i'll maybe i'll like see what this is and we used this um this like coding creative coding language called pure data which is kind of like the the predecessor to max msp and so that was that was like my first experience of creative coding was like using this tool and like what i would do with it is um kind of like jump between different like audio samples and like be processing audio and like cutting that up i also did a project where i like used like a like a wii like a wiimote as like a input on the so that was kind of like my start and then and then from there started like learning about um like processing um and then just like started making making sketches and that and just found it really like satisfying as opposed to like the type of software development work i was doing yeah i think it's interesting so i used i used to be a high school computer science teacher and i use p5 all the time uh for like introducing people to programming and i i do think that no matter what the software is for you it was this this music program i think p5 is obviously like a really incredible um tool to get people into into coding but yeah it's for me it's just like getting that foot in the door and then as soon as you can make your first project you can take it in any sort of direction that you want to where it's like okay i'm into music let me like dive deep into how audio works encoding or p5 is obviously very visual but yeah being able to do something that is so like output focused rather than just learning to code to learn how to code i think is is great and it's one of the reasons why i love um that g1 that you made this this creative coding class but i also think there's a huge value in people seeing that coding isn't just something like scary that you know runs your computer which it does but like it does but like you know for an example of like neopets it kind of like really um makes coding to something like just a tool to make a little website for your pet for example so it gives you that purpose and it gives you that visual feedback of what you're doing with code and then it like i think when you put programming in that context it becomes a lot easier to digest and a lot like more interesting i think immediately for some people i'm not going to generalize it and say that everyone would feel that way but i think it's just a different perspective of like you might want to make something practical super practical and want to dig deeper into like web programming and want to like learn about backend programming and all that kind of stuff but like if with creative coding it really is um not necessarily thinking about the end output but really like getting into that feeling of using coding to be more of a creative outlet totally cool should we move on from your pets you could talk about it all day yeah i kind of have like some slides about like the history of like processing and stuff um yeah so maybe we can um um give a little bit of a context cassie about like how we've been introducing creative coding and p5 basically in our first live series we talked we introduced p5 js is a javascript library right it's an open source javascript library that makes drawing with code really easy and actually one of the questions that we did get when we were talking about p5 for the first time was someone in the chat asked how is this relevant to processing what is the difference between processing and p5 and i did my attempt my best attempt at trying to answer that but i think you might have a lot more context about the history yeah i actually have like some really i like spent some time like looking at the history it's pretty fun um i like i think like i i just like in general and really interested about like you know how like just sort of seeing the evolution of technology and how that like impacts the sort of like things that people can make with with like computing or technology or whatever i'm sort of like how it's also entwined in like political things and stuff and stuff like that um but yeah so here i can like go go back to to slideland um so yeah like i think i think one one cool thing about what about processing is that i actually it comes from this like lab at the mit media lab called the aesthetics and computing lab and it was at the time and this was like in the late 90s early 2000s it was headed by this person named john mayda and um i don't know if he was specifically the person who like coined the term creative coding but definitely like was a person who uh he's still alive is a person he's very very much living um is a person who um i it was it was just like a figure in that way and just like advocating for creative coding and like using technology and like specifically using like code syntax as a medium for art not just like computers but like code syntax which i think is is really important when talking about processing in p5 because like one of the big parts of it is that you're writing code syntax it's not just like you're connecting there's no like graphical interface right it's like it's like teaching you to interact with computers in that way or that's just is the medium so anyway um i came it came out of this laboratory um from two people who were um doing phds there casey reese and ben frye who now are my colleagues at processing foundation um and they the the first release of processing was actually august 9 2001 the um the executive director of pressing foundation dorothy told me this recently and she was like processing is a leo which i loved um yeah and it um it like kind of consists of like three different things um which are like this language which you can see like on the right here it has the specific type of syntax where you see like this void setup and like void draw and like it has this whole scaffolding of um like what like this specific code syntax of what it looks like to like draw images that look that you can see on the left you can see that this was actually like the beta version that's something like early version of processing which is pretty fun um so right you have like the like syntax of the language you have like the environment that it's in and that's like what this code is sitting in and like what it what um the code renders to right it's all part of this application that you download and then it like makes it simple to write this code and you know all of this was driven at the time by like you used to have have to have like really specialized knowledge in order to like use computers to make this kind of art and like at the time that ben and casey were working on processing it was like cheaper it was like the type of graphics hardware and the type of computers that you needed were getting much more accessible so it was sort of like at this at this perfect time to be like what if we tried to make a language that made these tools and like an environment that made these tools really accessible and like the last part of the last like really like big piece of this besides the environment and the language is like the community and they started off um just like the processing forum you can actually see that it's called like discourse which i think is like a um which is funny since now there's like this um i actually don't know if discourse is open source um might not be but there's like a the forum tool is now called discourse right full circle yeah it's like a really full circle but um i'm curious about um if you go back to that like the previous slide um what is the relationship between processing and java because when i used to i also used to teach with with processing and i used to say like okay p5 is kind of this um javascript library um that you can add onto your to your normal javascript i always used to describe processing it's like processing is just java but with you know the setup function and the draw function and these like special little addons so is is processing its own unique language is it a like you know variant of java if for our viewers if you're watching this you'll see that you know the the things that stick out to this as being java like are the like square brackets to indicate an array um so yeah i guess i guess what's the relationship to java for processing yeah it's actually like processing is actually also like a library like it's a library for java um but i think what makes it like feel really different from p5 is that like it's not like the typical like environment that you would write java in they're all these different tools like one of the big ones is called um eclipse that people the environment that folks will write java in and um you know and the the reason is that like java i think in general is just like a more difficult um tool to use just because like the the way that you have to like connect all the libraries together and stuff and so like what this environment was created to do was to make that easier right is so that like you wouldn't have to be an expert about um you know how to like compile java code and like right when you're writing java code there's like a separate step of like translating this um this code into like the machine code like to the zeros and ones that like your computer can understand whereas like in javascript it like it like literally works differently where it like reads each singular line of code and like translates it to like the like zeros and ones like in real time so like because it has this like extra step of like compiling it all together you have to like pull in all these it like makes it harder to use right even getting that window with all the graphic stuff inside would be difficult to do if you were to do it from scratch using java so this was really like a hit i'd say when you could just download like a little software and you didn't have to worry about building your application application or anything you can just solely focus on creating visual things inside of it yeah i mean this is like incredible i mean like in 2001 2002 that you could like download this app and like make java and like at the time you could um you could run java in the browser you could make like java applets which now i think are um at this point are basically defunct um and no no one uses them anymore but it's kind of like the similar similar thing where it's like you could write code that like you could share in the same way and that that is so powerful um so yeah i think i think what also really like held the held the like processing together like was the community and having this space and i think um you know one of the one of the like main um sort of the canonical processing things that i always think about is like the the like one post on the board that's about like introducing yourself and like who you are um man i wish i had it i feel like dan schiffman um the creator of codingtrain has a really good email that he sent like when he like introduced himself to the processing community that's just like i live in new york with my like two cats and like it's something like that's really sweet [Laughter] it should be like a perma pinned on community processing no it's really it's really sweet um yeah and so like you know this community like stayed really strong and i i think um you know at this time a lot of the folks who were who were like using processing were um kind of like tied to the academic world and that's you know like uh like casey is like a professor at um ucla and had sort of like been able to keep like keep processing afloat like via all these like academic spaces and um you know so you know processing existed sort of had like a cult i mean i would call it like a cult following is really really like the way to put it um and then like this tool called processing.js came out and this is actually um not created by anyone at processing foundation though this time the foundation didn't exist but actually just someone named john resig took processing and basically just like translated the whole whole thing to javascript and you know this was in 2008 was the first release and you know it sort of marks a time when like folks were moving from java to to javascript is becoming a more and more popular language and um you know now it's like javascript is like the the most you know or it like literally is the most popular programming language um and uh yeah but this is this was this was created and maintained by someone not at um processing donation and um you know it's sort of it sort of marks like a clear denomination of like oh like folks are starting to move towards towards javascript and then in 2012 the foundation was created and i think that really the idea here was like there had been so much you know like uh like really what was like holding processing together was like academic support and like the foundation was a way to be able to expand that like having a nonprofit entity that could then like fundraise and then be able to like pay people to like create um create new things and that's that's how um p5 came about is that like lauren lee mccarthy got um had a fellowship project in 2013 to like reimagine um processing for the web and you know this is different from processing.js because like uh here yes this this i think describes it where um you know it says however this is a description on the p5 website about what p5 is but it says however you're not limited to your drawing canvas you can think of your whole browser page as your sketch including html html5 objects for text input video webcam and sound and so um the reason this is important is right if you look back at um processing you were you were like kind of tied to this like 2d canvas and the browser gives you like so many things beyond that and p5 is really about like reimagining what it could be like in in the context of a browser thus this project and so this project was started by lauren in beginning of 2013 and you can think of like p5 js like just the library itself as you know if you look at the like language environment community part of this like the language you know there's also the community here but just just like the library itself is the language here right um and then you know as that is that uh you know that's where this project started to gain traction in 2015 there was a contributors conference and i marked this as something important because i think it it denotes a sort of like coming together of like a solid vision of what p5 is and one of the things that came out of this contributors conference um is this community statement which talks about like what p5 like what the community is right and it's not just about like folks gathering together on a forum it's about like creating a space for people and like i um you know i often think about this statement and often just like read it to like remember um the kind of space that's being created and like i kind of want to like go this picture for a moment because like when you know i think that a lot of folks have sort of like stereotypical ideas about like what it means to like work on technology and like who it's for and like some of these are enforced by like representation and like seeing and sort of like negative or just experiences in technology of it being like a group of like cis white men like working on like technology and making like cool stuff and like coming back to the community statement and like creating a space that um is about inclusion and like making people feel welcome um and just like yeah i might just i'm going to read this yeah so p5 is a community interested in exploring the creation of art and design with technology uh we are a community of and in solidarity with people from every gender identity and expression sexual orientation race ethnicity language neurotype size ability class religion culture subculture political opinion age skill level occupation background we acknowledge that not everyone has the time financial means or capacity to actively participate but we recognize and encourage involvement of all kinds we facilitate and foster access and empowerment we're all learners and like you know me sort of like coming upon p5 i had like never read anything like this from a technology um space uh and i just really wanted to be part of this like who wouldn't want to be part of this sounds fun and like nice sounds like everyone's going to be nice to me it does it does do you feel like this has changed in the in the past five years you feel like more sub subsets of technology have like adopted you know missions or community statements like this or do you feel like p5 and creative coding at large are still pretty unique and like really making that a forefront of what you're doing i think that both of these things are true i think i still have yet to like really know about another community that puts like like inclusion and access and being beginner friendly like as the as like the most important thing um and i think that there are lots of spaces that are are really making an effort to um to like have a commitment to like making making a community that feels like uplifting and nourishing and welcoming and like full of care i have a maybe a little question um i wonder if this like openness of the community spirit i'd say um the p5.js has has anything to do with like how the tool itself is open source and so a little bit said going into that maybe we could also talk about what does that even mean what does open source even mean and how does that impact the kind of people that join the community as well totally yeah i definitely have like i kind of like have some slides about that [Laughter] i got you but yeah i want to talk about first like i think like one of the other really powerful things about p5 is like this concept of a contributor and i think that um again like lots of folks folks uh see contributing to code as like oh we're just contributing to a code library is like just writing code and i think one of the things that um lauren has has really developed is like this idea of contributing as something like more than just writing code you know like teaching documentation making art activism bug reporting outreach curating organizing it's so many different things and like these are all these are all different things that are part of the p5 community and like all of this work is important um and vital to this this project like staying alive and you know that is true for all open source libraries but i think especially um or i don't i don't even think it's like especially p5 but i appreciate that there is an emphasis and sort of like a a willingness to view contrib contribution to to a project as as this and um i'll talk a little bit more about like what like kind of like how open source functions but just to sort of like tie the loop of like my work on this and so like you know we had like i've like talked about like p5 as a language and p5 as a community and so sort of the missing piece of p5 was the environment right and so for a while there was a desktop editor for p5 um that originally was created by a person named sam levine and um this kind of became difficult to maintain like whenever you create like this was like an application that you could download and so it's it's difficult to maintain an application that you can download because it has to run on different operating systems like windows and mac and linux and also there are difficulties with um if you have it on like a school computer it's sometimes difficult to download software um and so it just like was um it just wasn't working for the to uphold the idea the like ideals of p5 of like making this tool accessible and so then in may 2016 i started making the web editor that was my my first commit which i think in the beginning looked something like this i don't know this had to be like the really early version because i think you couldn't even like log in or log out this must be like you know like august 2016 in july august 2016 i'm so curious how did you even start was it was it you completely by yourself were you like working with other people from the community like how did you even uh start this project cause it's obviously grown into this yeah we'll show off yeah uh well so it started through like the foundation fellowships i like applied for a fellowship that i didn't get but then i just had been in in contact with with dan and was like you know i just like really want to be involved in open source i think i had um i was like in a place where i felt really like frustrated with with tech communities because like i really wanted to be in a space that like uphol upheld things like this i felt like i was this person who was like asking all these questions and like everyone was like don't think about that and i was like no like i wanna i wanna be talking about this and thinking about this so um i was like in contact with dan and then you know he and lauren reached out to me and were like you know we have some funding from um nyu itp to um work on this tool like would you would you want to like work on it and it was it was like really exciting for me like i had never contributed to open source before and um was like had been working as a web developer for like a couple years and like still pretty new to me and i was like yeah sure i'll do it i don't really know what i'm getting myself into but i mean i mean i think that that underscores like the importance of community where the reason that or like one of the ways that you got really into the space was knowing other people from the community and so whether that's p5 and creative coding or other communities that people might be interested in the tech space just yet getting to know folks in the community can help you um totally yeah totally and and there's like so many spaces like online to do that just like get to know you know p5 people um and now the editor kind of looks something like this maybe the ui is more like refined whatever has more has more features um but yeah and you know now i've been like working on this for a few years and um it just like my like my my role is to just like keep keep it going and i think like uphold the values of like access defined as like accessibility and inclusion and like making making a tool that um can reach can reach people and like you can you know have the same environment that really feels you know i like to me it feels important to like leave leave the like remnants of processing in like this play button and like what like what is what is like processing or p5 without the play button the giant play button yeah and that color too yeah and the pink yeah i mean i think i think that um yeah it's like a friendly it's like a friendly color and i think that was a very very conscious choice of lauren but um i think one oh and then also like there's another contributors conference in in 2019 and again like i think i think one of the things that that came out of this was really um centering adding features to 2p5 that are that are really based around like increasing access over like making a new like something that's like more optimized or like or like flashy or awesome um yeah and that's that's something that's really important to me and then i kind of have like some slides about how like open source works which is fun but yeah enough sure do we want to go into that do we want to stop and ask i don't know if you have any specific questions here if you want it's also time for uh if you're in the chat if you're in the youtube chat right now and you have questions for cassie um i think kind of the the plan for the rest of the session is to talk about open source in general we want to show off the p5 web editor because you want i think you're um uh you're going to be using it for the rest of the series hopefully introducing people to that but yeah any uh any questions from chat um that would be a good time i guess um or do you want if you have anything i'm eager to talk more about open source let's do it um i kind of have more like word slides i couldn't really find any like a lot of good images but um i think it's okay so like i like i i feel like i learned a lot about sort of like licensing and like how that kind of stuff fairly recently like within the last last year i never really like thought about it too much of the last like couple years um so like processing and p5 are it's you usually you use this abbreviation called floss which is like free slash libre open source software and the the reason that it's like free slash libre is because free does not mean free of cost it means like just it means it like implies like a freedom and so like what the what these tools what these things mean is right so like open source software is a type of computer software in which the source code right like the the like text that you're writing is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants the users the rights to use study change and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose and the reason like you need a license is because when you write software it's actually protected under like um intellectual property law like it's it's something that you write and so if you don't have a license it's actually not it's protected by like the ip law so it would be um so like you can't actually like use that code and then repurpose it you need to actually give it a license in order to make in order to be able to um edit edit that source code so these types of licenses started coming up where um you could you could like attach this license to your source code and then folks could like remix that and like make their own versions and yeah i never knew that so without the license that's not in fact open source and you couldn't be able to have somebody else out of it or no interesting i never knew that yeah so like even this is true of of um code on github actually like if there is no license on your repository like technically it's like not open source uh that's just like a yeah just like the fun world of like intellectual property law i think i feel like this could be like a whole session on its own because there's so many much new ones into it and you know like there's different levels of how much freedom you can give people who use it as well but yeah exactly like there's different types of licenses i think one of the really um important ones is like this concept of like copy left which basically there were like certain types of licenses where you could like take the source code and like make your own copy of it and then make it like private again and what copy left does it makes it so like you can't then like change that license so it's like the code is private and that's sort of like an like enforcing of it being it being public um so that that was like a really important license that that came out um and then like there's also this concept of like free software and um this these are this comes from like the free software foundation and the term free software has like four essential freedoms which are to run the program to study and change the program in source code form to redistribute exact copies and to distribute modified versions and so this is about like how how you use the software and these are the things that make you know the abbreviation floss or whatever um and just you know there's just terms but and so and so you're saying something like p5 is both open source software and also free software yes exactly um and this is important and on purpose and i think um i have this quote from casey or this is pulled from a like a blog post he wrote about processing and why why it was floss and um i'm gonna read this this whole thing because i think i think it like really describes it well but um this is like from his his perspective talking about processing he says we believe visual artists and designers should be in control of their own software tools it's not enough to rely on corporations to make what we need the code and systems that we use shape our work um yeah i really like that i mean just just this so far like this this concept of being in control of the tools you use like if you think about you know getting a license from adobe or you know getting a license from um i don't know the company that makes maya but they're very expensive and like at any time the companies could like choose to shut down these tools and here is like showing a real dedication to being like we need to be in control of the tools that we make and shape them right so here when we release proprietary when companies release proprietary platforms and we use them we don't have the freedoms to modify and expand them as makers we feel it's essential to have have tools that we create ourselves tools that are shaped by the needs and desires of the communities and creators that use them and so open source is a way that allows folks to like have control of their tools and the community um and and that's that's really powerful this is a question that you might not not know the answer to i think alex froze a little bit we'll wait wait until he comes back [Laughter] hello yeah he's back froze for a moment so if he asked a question we don't know what it is it said my internet is on this table so hopefully i don't drop out again um cassie do you know of other communities in the tech space that are similarly like open source minded like have similar values like this or again is this something that seems pretty unique or pretty um yeah pretty unique to like creative coding i think blender is has a big open source community blender is maybe one of the most similar because i feel like blender just like has such a big community because i was just like thinking of like what are other tools that that feel that sort of have these these like three things the like language environment community and i feel like yeah i feel like blender blender is really rad tool for those of you who don't know what blender is just to really quickly say it it's an open source software they can do 3d environment creation in i think that's like a really small little thing that you can do with blender but basically um i think that their goal essentially is it aims you to go all the way from like creating your 3d um you know assets all the way into like reading like a whole scene and movie with your 3d um 3d what are they called product models models yeah products animations it's yeah it's a really cool tool um yeah oh man i forgot to say one really important thing about processing and p5 is like one of the other like core values it's like the low what's called like low floor high ceiling and that like it's it's like you know tried to be like a low low barrier to entry but also um i think because it uses code syntax and it allows there are lots of folks who who write like addon libraries and i think really really tied into this statement here of like you know the community being in control of the tool like you can make an addon library and be like oh like p5 doesn't have this thing i wanna i wanna make like a text editing like a text manipulation library or like you know processing doesn't have this thing i'm i'm gonna work on it um and that's really powerful and that like you know if somehow p5 changes and your library breaks like you have a say in that process versus like you know if you wrote like an addon for photoshop or something and like that changed it would just kind of be like you know and this i think an example of this happening is um like a lot of folks have made like like art twitter bots and like the sort of over the past few years the api for like using twitter has really changed and caused like cost a lot of um like art to just like perish i do want to make sure that we have some time to demo the web editor too yeah okay i'm going to go through the recipes real quick but i think another thing i want to talk about is just sort of like some of the pitfalls of open source um and just like some of the things i'm thinking about and so there's a survey in in 2017 from github about open source software and they found that the gender imbalance in open source software remains profound 95 for in the survey 95 of respondents for men just three percent for women and one percent are nonbinary and like why is this you know i think i think there's lots of um not only gender disparity in in the tech world but it's it's like especially uh bad or especially uh prominent prominent yeah in in open source and like why is that and you know one of one of the reasons is that like there's sort of this this um implicit narrative of like unpaid labor in open source and if you think about like who has the time and like who has the privilege of like you know free time in order to work on open source it's like going to be predominantly people who are in a position of privilege and so this is this is pulled from a blog post called the ethics of unpaid labor in the open source software community and um just like pulls from some tweets where it says whether free time activities are called worker play the existence of free time to do them is a privilege and so when you when you have when you have a space that relies on free labor in order to do work it's going it's only going to be you know it's going to like perpetuate sort of like um structural inequalities and so um here's a tweet that lauren asked for she said how do you how do you make a volunteer based open source project sustainable is this even projectable or is this even possible i really need some help figuring this out and this is something that i think about a lot and you know have talked to talk to lauren about is like how do we make these projects sustainable we're like we're releasing the software free of cost and like you know lots of folks are using these tools for free and you know that that i think is one of the reasons for having like the foundation um but also just like a a real dedication to paying people for their work but they're also different types of giving people value for their contributions but i want to read this quote from lauren where she says um for me sustainability means not just preserving the sanity of the people in charge but also extending the opportunity to work on it to people who would love to be a part of the project if we could provide them a means of access um and so yeah i think to me to me this means like reaching out to people who are not represented or people who don't feel welcome and like giving them what they need whether it's like you know money or care or support or whatever whatever they need in order to support them um and i also like you know just to like sort of wrap wrap this up and then go go to the web editor like i was talking to someone about this project i don't know when it was like working the p5 web editor and they were like i was like talking about how i was still working on it and they were like well it works so like what like what else is there to do a lot so they meant it they meant it like really really genuinely it was it wasn't like a um like they were trying to be a backhanded compliment no no no it was like not intended to be like patronizing at all they meant it like totally genuinely and it sort of like made me think about the invisible work that goes into these projects you know whether it's like managing all the issues that come up on github or like you know for example this is some screenshot i took of like they're currently like over four million sketches on the web editor so it's like managing a huge amount of data and then also just like thinking about how to make these projects sustainable and creating a structure in place so like lauren made an open call for a new p5 lead to sort of like replace her and like be a new steward for the project and so that's something i'm thinking about all the time but now let's talk about the web editor now that we know about open source um cassie before we before we go there i uh could you give a plug of like if people are watching this and feels like everything that you've said that really resonates with them like how do they get involved i feel like something that i feel a lot of the time is feeling intimidated by entering these communities feeling impostor syndrome all that kind of stuff so if somebody wants to get involved specifically in p5 and processing um what's the best way to do that yeah i mean what i would say i'm gonna share go to like a like a browser window i mean i think a great if you're like i don't know anything i mean obviously it would be like you know learning p5 from like the code academy it's a nice vlog it's great but also like our course is also free yeah that's true which is nice yeah but also like dan's youtube channel is i think a really accessible place um there's the five days or you know i think um like here here there's like a forum that you can ask questions on um and like yeah if you want to get help um yeah i think like also just looking on twitter and kind of like seeing what other people are up to um there's oh there's also um gotta move things around processing foundation there's also like a processing community day that happens um i think that's under uh yeah there's gonna be one this year like i think an official one in the summer but um yeah i think yeah and and we can put like all those links in the youtube description or if you want to i wonder if putting this kind of stuff in the codecademy course might be it might be helpful but yeah i think just like uh for me i would struggle to do this and i think i even do struggle with this where i don't really participate in as many open source products as i want to or like p5 i i love and i'm a huge advocate of but have like never interacted in the community so i think just encouraging folks to like take that first step and get involved in the community if this is something that speaks to you um just that for example is like probably the hardest part yeah and i mean i think getting involved is like as simple as using the tool you know like by using it like you're you're supporting you know like you're you're just like another person who can like then share your experience about like what it's like to learn this tool and like how to make it better and for better for me is like maybe more accessible and like more more stable and i think like that is really one of the the big parts of creating the web editor is um making it making it accessible right and one of one of like the cool things about the webinar is like basically you have this setup where you have like code on the left and like a preview on the right and then when you open it you get like a a sort of like generic gray square which is not that exciting but if you're like oh let me look at some other code you can go to the examples and i think i wanted this one yeah you can sort of like look at the other code that folks have made oh no that's not the one i wanted um oh no sorry examples examples um video um i think video pixels yeah you can sort of like see what it looks like so here's an example of one that is like pixelating a video and i can be like oh cool this this is fun but then if i'm like you know i want this to be um rather than it be this fingers one i want it to be like a webcam of me i can just easily like comment this out right and then make this rather than it being this video i can be like create capture video i think i have to do fingers dot size um 640 oh wait yeah 320 240. right and then now i have this webcam that's like me right and so i can like right and then from here i could be like oh rather than all these dots being black i want them to be um where it could be um how would i do this darkness darkness but this is but the color i think is just being default black yeah why is this oh times darkness oh i could just do like fill 255. we can make it like red let's see if that works yeah right and so then i could start like playing around with this and like have my own version of this and i don't need to like download anything you know for so many coding languages it's like okay download a text editor then like add this library as a dependency or whatever and you're like what are these words um yeah and i think like all of the stuff of like getting p5 loaded into your sketch is really hidden and you know like once you make an account on the web editor then like all your work is saved so if i like save this now like now this is part of my account and then if i go to like my sketches i have like you know whatever [Laughter] yeah um and you can also you can you can like manipulate videos and images in here and so here i can um upload files to like images and stuff um i can also and the other cool thing is like i can share my work so let's say i was like i think this is great you know i can then like have this version that's just like this in frame or um the embed is really cool it looks like so you can embed that in your website if you have it or yeah um i think this is the one that just doesn't even have the bar like yeah can it's great for sharing um what else is really useful and then i guess you know the other you know there's like keyboard shortcuts you also can link there's a link to like the reference if you want to learn um get familiar with the p5 library itself um and then also like want to link to the um like report a bug and like the github repository because like one thing that you can do as a person you know contributing to p5 is to like report bugs and if like you notice that something is wrong like you can just be like hey i feel like this like this website isn't working as i think it should and like no one here is going to be like um you know and like maybe it is a bug or maybe it's you're not doing something right but like no one here is going to be like wow i can't believe you couldn't figure that out like it's like um you know i mean first of all it's going to be like me you're responding and i'm just gonna be here to like be be friendly and support support you but this is a really big way that you can contribute it's just by reporting bugs or just like putting ideas on here of things you would want to see and you know for example like and one thing that you could contribute is like there have been some folks who have been doing translations and so now it's in spanish and japanese and hindi so like the canal experience a lot better in hindi which is really cool um and that's the thing you can contribute yeah i think that's a really big thing though it really opens up this like not only just p5 web editor but like programming visual things in general to a wider community than people just speak english yeah yeah that example tab is amazing i want to go look at some of those other uh other example things and play around with it yeah and like all of them are pulled from like the website like the t5 website but it's just here you can just quickly be like oh i actually want to change something and see how it looks and and that i think is the biggest that is like the fundamental way to learn how to do coding i think is to just take what other people have done and be like how can i change this and make this different like what does changing this number do you know that's the biggest thing i think it also like the thing that i really like u5 web editor for is that not only can you share the code that you've written for someone else but also if you open the file tabs you see that it is still a web page that it is it has an index.html it has um sketch.js so it doesn't hide the fact that it is just like a little blank space but it shows you all the files that goes into creating that window in the preview yeah and like i think this is something that's like a little bit different from like other code editors like codepen i mean definitely on on glitch you can do this but to me to me like upholding this idea of like low floor high ceiling was like in the end i want to be able to like just download this sketch as a website like i could just download this and then i have a zip file that's like all of these files together and um then i could literally just take that and like put it on whatever hosting platform i want like if you could use um because it's all front end you can put it on github pages or whatever whatever you use neocities [Laughter] yeah i love i love neocities um yeah so yeah to me it's really important that like you can kind of see and really uphold that ideal of like when you're writing p5 or processing like you're writing code syntax yeah and like understanding that i think this is a great way to like if you if there's um people watching who are going through the learn p5.js course if you want to like really go deep down into um you know the creative coding and p5.js in general this is a great way to take your projects off of our codecapping platform and move your code into the v5 web editor so you can keep track of the different versions of the sketches that you are building you can you know even load your own sketch and then make a different version of that and try out different things with us you know same fundamental code but maybe doing different styles and things kind of things like that to it so i like i said i think did i mention this i forget but um from next live streaming series we're going to be using the p5 web editor to um work on so that you know what during the during our live series we'll start um programming from scratch on these on like a blank um the 5.js sketch on the web editor and then after the live stream we'll add the link to the web editor into the description of the youtube video so you guys can take that code and then remix it even further and make it your own if you want do you want what project are you working on next week next week we're going to be looking at what we call the um genitive art creator so we have these like little visualizations that you can trigger with a mouse press and then you can create your own little um generative art drawing and you can also click on the canvas and download that as an image file that you can use anywhere you want and we're going to build that on the web editor cool it's awesome cassie anything else you want to say or plug or tell people to check out or anything at all i guess the only other thing i want to plug is that there's currently a fellowship application open for the foundation it closes uh however long april but i wanna i wanna emphasize that like you don't need to be a coder in order to apply and it's open to any type of any type of work it's really just about being being part of it's just like an opportunity to get some money to be part of the community so if you're maybe like you are familiar with p5 but um you know wanting to get involved more this is a great way you're familiar with coding and not familiar with p5 it's a great way and this is how you got started right this is like similar to the fellowship yeah kind of i mean this is like how i got started yeah it's cool thank you so much cassie for being here with us today yeah thank you for having me so much fun cool okay well um yeah with that i guess we will be back uh next week for another another project that jivon's gonna walk through um yeah thanks so much cassie thank you talk to you all later thank you bye
