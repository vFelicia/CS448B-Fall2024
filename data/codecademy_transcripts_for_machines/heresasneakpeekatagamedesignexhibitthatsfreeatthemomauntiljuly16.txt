summer is here and it's a perfect time to step away from the computer and take yourself out like to a game design exhibit that's currently free to attend at the Museum of Modern Art the exhibit is called never alone and it's all about the way video game and interactive designs have impacted how we engage with the world around us there are about 35 video games featured like PacMan and SimCity and as you walk around the exhibit you actually have a chance to play them as you learn about what went into their designs and programming the exhibit also has some really cool retro home computers and notebooks with the original sketches of classic digital icons that are so recognizable today one of my favorite things that I read was this no matter how elegant the code how realistic the animations are how witty the dialogue a video game cannot play itself and when it comes to software development in general putting the user first is a really important rule to always think about if you're in New York City you can check out this exhibit for free at the MoMA is there a video game that's had a huge impact on you let us know in the comments
