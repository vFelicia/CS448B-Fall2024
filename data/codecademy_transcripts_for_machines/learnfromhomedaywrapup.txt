okay here we are Wow thanks everybody for joining us today no this is this has been a wild day of learning you thank you for being part of a really special day we have thousands of people calling from all over the world and code together and build websites and learn Swift and analyze data and we hope it's been a great start for you and has inspired you to learn new and valuable technical skills from home because you can as you saw today so I'm gonna check in see tell us in the chat like how everybody's how are you feeling penny is our hero and I'm just happy to be included also on the line with us is somebody who you may or may not have seen depending on if his camera was on and off on or off Mike Mike it is here current director of community platform Mike give us give us a few thoughts on what you think is next for learners after today yeah so we learned a lot today I think we learned that I mean this is the first time we've done something quite like this we've tried some other various live streams before but to put it all together and like a fullday conference with tracks that's something that this was the first time and you know just based on everybody's engagement and your comments and your questions all of which were really awesome I think we learned that there's really a need for this and you know one thing that Alisa and I talked about on the community team a lot is you know ways to humanize the learning experience with an online platform like code Academy I mean our our curriculum team writes you know in our opinion the the best curriculum in the world and it's really engaging and we have a great environment to learn interactively but there's still that aspect I think that a lot of and maybe you you know the reason why a lot of you attended this conference is because I you still want to learn with other people like you do in a classroom and so if we can you know one of our missions on on the community is to really combine that worldclass curriculum and figure out how to rebuild those classrooms virtually online so that you can have that experience of working with others working with experts professors if you will alike the people you see in this room and that's that's what we're gonna try to do so you know going back to Lisa's question about you know what comes next I mean we definitely I think are very excited about today I think it was very successful and we want to do more of these and we're going to put them together I'm gonna figure out you know tweak the format figure out different parts of the curriculum to to offer but it's something that yeah I think you can expect to see more off thank you Mike oh my gosh someone has been voting for a podcast in some of these sessions and I really appreciate that it is Thomas that's cool okay so to follow up on what's next I want to put something in the chat right now it's gonna have a bunch of links so if you can't I'll put it in a few times just in case it gets lost because it will get lost as the track continues to go on but in wrapping up I want to share some resources for what's next that Verte well first joy is my discord its realtime chat it's a great way to if you if you want to ask a question maybe you you want to go to the forums that discuss cook enemy comment you like oh my god I don't know how to ward this question you can start at discord first and like work that out with somebody there I put in there the course that was just opened up for today so hey Zoe Zoe's here to join us to you probably the most important part of this is if these Koch Adam II backgrounds are available to you too you too can have one of these Co Academy back we put a link to the blog post or our content marketer Megan actually just made those lights use sort of like a virtual goodie bag everybody came today and finally when you continue learning to code and when you get stuck visit the forums that discuss coding this code Kathy calm and get help from other learners like you okay so today was learned from home day these are all your educators and your instructor is these wonderful people I'm asking the question to you attendees and I'm gonna go around and ask everybody here one by one what's one thing that you learned today I'm gonna start with Nick because my my view is accusing you of writing bugs so let's start with you okay I have to first I learned how to better set my alarm okay because it's LA and it's early over here and I woke up kinda late and put sunny on the spot but I work it out so I guess we went up learned how to wake up quickly and I also learned about the tiny purse for some reason the name just like really does something for me if you took the learn are you learned about the tiny purse for packages and you know thank you um ASCII what's one thing you learned today question um I learned that it is so much more fun to code with people than just by yourself that's excellent I like school what did you learn today oh man I put Kenny on the spot in our JavaScript one and asked him to like start opening up the the console and start doing some crazy JavaScript and he he handled it like a champ so I learned that Kenny is good at going with the flow and if we do these again I'll uh I'll ask him to do more more wild JavaScript stuff stop trying to sweettalk me Alex wonderful golina what's one thing you learned today umm I learned how to a webinar this was my very first one so I was very nervous but I'm really happy with the waking up that's so excellent I love how I did not know that even when you were presenting that's so great Mike let's go back up to you what's one thing you learned today one thing I learned yeah I think just that that this kind of format can can really work and you know even though it was you know at first we thought like 90 minutes felt like a long time for the session but then as we got through them you know a lot of attendees I saw posting that you know they wanted more time and so just trying to figure out like how we can get better at these you know is something I'm going to be thinking about and and do more of them and just help people learn in like a classroom type environment like they did today okay yeah I'm seeing in between the praise for Kenny I'm seeing that ninety minutes flew by speaking of Kenny what's one thing you learned today well I was a student for Alex and Zoey's p5 creative coding course and so I learned a good amount of p5.js today that's excellent sunny today I learned that I think everybody on curriculum like there I'm seeing a lot of people here live stream before but is the first time I rode this in slack but I was the first time seeing Alina and outs T doing a stream and I was very very impressed with that so shout out to them camellia what something today I learned from our learners that when I get really excited about statistics and data science I start talking too quickly so they told me to slow down but now I also learned from Ian how like he was so patient and going through all of the code and that just like I was really impressive to Ian what you learned today well I definitely learned some more forecasting analysis from Camellia definitely helped bring bring the insights into the code that I was writing so thank you for that but I was also reminded from all of our learners how global we all are and how people are coming from everywhere and it's always refreshing and exciting to see that you know you're learning and you're engaging and everywhere so keep getting out there but that's fair Zelly what's one thing you learned today I learned that there are a lot of people out there her interested in creative coding but haven't learned about p5 yet so it was really awesome to very quickly jump on that panel this morning I wasn't originally on it so thank you again to Alex and Kenny for being so welcoming and it's really happy to be a part of it and really excited to share our p5 with hundreds and hundreds of people so excellent I think that too well let me ask is there anything that we're missing can we do a group photo with these zoom backgrounds one more time one more time okay we're trying to get Kyla in here too I know something that we're saying that uh she's not in but uh she may be in a meeting missing me we try to get her in here right now okay now now now now our learners are like where's Camilla okay well if she comes yeah if she comes we will do that um I think that unless there's anything else Oh apparently I'm frozen I'm gonna keep going and this there's anything else here from this group of people I want to end us on a massive giant thank you to everybody for a moment let's realize what it's like to be coding at home and learning alone versus what we did today and how cool this is and it's cool because every single one of you showed up so for my what I learned today was I it's the excellent one that I swear to God I was gonna say but if Ian did it is that we're gonna do it again like we're doing more of these more of this you asked for it we want it this has been the greatest ever find us in our online community spaces we are there and we hope that you all have a great rest of your day morning night afternoon wherever you are thank you it's fun one more thing up oh yeah what were they one last thing just want to remind everybody that at least and I are gonna work on getting all the recordings together we're going to put them on YouTube and also email everybody with links to not only the sessions that you attended but the other sessions as well just so you have everything but uh just need a few days to get that together so hold tight and you know we'll be in touch over over email you know what I haven't heard in a long time is applause or at least a month like I haven't you want to like unmute yourselves and like just give our learners around of applause and then we'll sign off are you down is that gonna work all right three two one it sort of worked Kenny Rogers oh my god what okay so good screenshot that okay bye everybody
