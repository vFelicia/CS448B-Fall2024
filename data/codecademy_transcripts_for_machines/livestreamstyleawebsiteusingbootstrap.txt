all right I guess we're streaming was that a thumbsup oh okay so we are streaming hey hi everyone Kenny I'm a curriculum developer here at code Academy and I want to welcome you guys all to today's live stream today's topic is going to be bootstrap 4 so we're gonna be styling a website using bootstrap special shout out for those coming in from the CLL slack community code Academy lifelong learners hello and I want to say hi to everyone in the chat if you want to say hi is back that'd be great I love to learn a little bit about you guys where you're from maybe what you want to learn today and if you're on youtube and you want to access this site that is right behind me you can click on the link in the description below kind of all oh and hey Rachel vod's I oh wow there's so many people Lillian if I mispronounce your name I'm so sorry and you are from the passo you're a developer from the Paulding that's awesome Wow so many people from around the world Romania excellence hi Robbie that's a tough one bill bill guy hi bill Gahan hello and yes Alex here is with me too he's he's moderating wow so many people teach to employ carousel clickable image using bootstrap yes that is gonna be part of the agenda all right hi from India hello awesome we're gonna wait just a few more minutes I'm gonna just go over some like technical details so like if you guys are actually on YouTube and in the chat I can see you guys being active awesome click on the link in the description below and that'll lead you to the boot sorry code caddy website that is gonna host the code that you can then code along with us as we make this project happen sorry if I missed your names everyone but I want to say hello to everyone who did say hello back thank you guys if you are coming in from Codecademy and you found this through the news and noteworthy section if you want to check out the youtube link and it's full screen click on the title in that little iframe and it will bring you to the YouTube page so that you can join in the chat as well and I would love to hear from you guys love to hear from you all hi from Toronto hello back from New York hi Patrick all right so let's just wait another minute and then I want to go over a little bit of our agenda today what we're gonna build out as you can see if you're on the YouTube sorry code Academy site you can see a little example of what we're gonna be building out nothing too flashy but it's gonna have some cool little things that you might not have known before I'm also hoping to learn a little bit from you guys today about maybe some things you know and bootstrap that I don't I'd be super cool well oh welcome for your first time here Raj and beer Raj I hope I said that right okay with everyone down acquainted hope you guys are comfortable at home I think we're gonna get started then okay got it right the first time sorry alright so today we're gonna be learning about bootstrap 4 and so bootstrap 4 is a frontend framework now when we talk about frontend we're talking about the display that you're seeing on a website compare it's like a backend where that's where you would see the logic that takes care of the the stuff that goes on in the front end and so when we talk and then when you hear things like full stack it incorporates both frontend and backend now I also mentioned that it's a framework meaning that someone or a team of people have already written this code for you so that you can use in your project and you don't have to rewrite everything from scratch because that really defeats the purpose of this right like if we're trying to style a website why don't we jump straight to just writing our own see which is the cascading stylesheets you'd normally see on a website to make it look nicer okay now bootstrap is really great is because it allows us to create like responsive sites if you've seen the term responsive before it just means that it's it changes the layout of your site to accommodate different screen sizes so whether you're on mobile or you're on a desktop despite the screen differences you'll still get a pleasurable browsing experience so let's say let's if we take a look on the site behind me right now that's let's say a small screen and if we expand it you'll notice that things the layout of it changes ever so slightly but it's still like the same sort of material same elements there okay the goal of today's live stream is not gonna be to just make exactly this I want you to guys feel comfortable with using bootstrap so we are gonna be looking through documentation today I know that's like a scary word sometimes at first but bootstrap off like has great documentation it has great examples and the way I use it and I hope a lot of other people are using it or just grabbing examples so we're gonna take examples directly from the documentation and we're gonna make it into our own little code let's see I'm glad you guys have all said those highs I hope you guys are gonna feel comfortable asking questions as well I love to hear you guys about that and I already saw a suggestion about the carousel example making clickable carousel images that's gonna be this little tidbit right here for those who don't know a carousel is like the slideshow of images and you can click through that so if we don't get through all of it or if you guys get lost at any point too if you click on this folder icon you'll see another folder called steps and I'm gonna stop at each point and you guys if you get lost you can check out what code we have so far and some of the comments that are in there so that you can jump back into the code along okay currently I have the final final page set up right here on the right but I'm gonna remove that and we're gonna go to our blank page which you guys should all have okay let's take a brief pause right here are there any questions before we start where any problems with connecting wait for a few seconds in the chat if not I just really have to assume that we're all good and dandy alright let's go let's do it alright so first things first I'm gonna need the documentation so let's look it up everything seems okay let's go so we're looking for a bootstrap and I'm just going to Google bootstrap and look it's the first result that pops up alright so for us we want to get started because that's what you guys are asking for in the live stream and that's exactly what we're going to do so it has a little bit of information for us like an introduction a QuickStart if we just want the CSS we can take this link right here copy to clipboard bootstrap also offers some JavaScript files which allows us to add more interactivity so like that carousel component that we had that we were able to click through that was because we have JavaScript in there and they had some like other libraries like jQuery and popper here for us and if I scroll down a little further because I know I've gotten acquainted with this there's actually a starter template so for all you guys coding along at home just copy it click the copy button or you can manually click through everything and select it but I'm gonna be lazy and click the copy I'm going to just paste it right over I'm just gonna refresh that real quick okay so notice that we have the title hello world and our body elements let's see we have going to make this also bigger so you guys can see what I'm coding along with we have a title hello world we also have in our header hello world but I don't think our title is gonna be a hello world let's do something like bootstrap livestream that's not gonna show up and we don't really need this hello world's text either so I'm going to clear that out and currently we're gonna have a blank page and that's the end of our first step we've incorporated bootstrap into our projects thumbs up for you guys we're just gonna keep on going from here I will also look over chat as I said I'm gonna stop along every point and this is the end of our step 1 if there's any questions feel free to ask ok I know because I've kind of worked on this that the next step is going to be making or adding really a navigation bar and so the navigation bar in our lesson we talk about components utilities and the grid system and a and it sounds like the navbar is a component because it's it's an element that is that has some sort of default styling and it has a function for us right so the navbar is going to be found in this components tab and we'll just have to locate where the navbar is so then for the navbar documentation and examples for bootstraps powerful responsive meaning that it's gonna change its layout depending on screen size navigation header the nav bar and it also has ironically well an example of it at the very top and so you can read through about how it works but let's just jump right into it and ooh this example looks pretty close to what we need right so again I'm just gonna copy the code and I'm going to place it right in and that looks good to me there is a little bit of spacing issues indent issues so I'm going to edit that's I'm just gonna select everything and press tab once and that should clear it for us let's enter it say you to run the code you're gonna click Save or press command enter or control enter command enter for those on Macs control enter for those on PC I usually asked what's a bootstrap and bootstrap is the framework that we're gonna be working with today to style our HTML pages okay let's see so right now we have awesome we have the actual navbar located there for us and we have something called a sandwich menu or a hamburger menu that when you click on it it has all the different links okay so this is great for us we actually want to change a few things so right now if you look at how these elements are laid out they all have classes Anton I don't think we're gonna have time to build a tinder clone but maybe you could do that as an extension of what you learn here today okay but like I was saying for classes notice that they each have some different variants and some name attributed to their classes this is what bootstrap uses to style the web page to style the elements so it has its already predefined CSS library that we saw and you're gonna have to find what classes to add through the examples so see how you should style it okay so let's just backtracking real quick right here if you just want it the CSS you could have just used this but we know that because it comes with a brief predefined CSS for us we don't have to make it ourselves okay and I want to change this around a little bit one point that I made in the lesson is that this right here navbar expands make this a little larger LG the LG part represents a break point and LG is for large screens so if we change it to something like SM which is for small screens you'll see that because our screen size is now bigger than that small display the hamburger menu actually disappears and if I put extra large or even large and save it it appears again but let's find the happy medium and I want to change this for let's see medium sized screens so that when I hit that medium break point notice I'm dragging this window across and well there we go we hit the medium breakpoint that menu disappeared and we have all the links again let's see let's also change this instead of navbar let's see let's do boots boots and straps that's that's gonna be the idea for our little web site today boots and straps it's gonna be a website about boots and straps using bootstrap okay so cool and you can you guys can follow along it all right are you sure you can follow along and you can make it as we build it together dogon is the navbar sticky it's not but we can definitely make it sticky so let's change that a little later I'm just gonna edit a few other links first and so like if you guys are familiar with HTML which is probably the only prerequisite you'll see the traditional elements here so you have all the tags and mmm nope not gonna go there you'll see all the links and elements like the a tag for our link let's change the name of that let's say instead let's say it's boots I want a link for boots and for our dropdown types of straps and you guys at home you could name it whatever you care for I'm just coming up with things on the fly so like what's nylon maybe some rope here something else here let's see is look let's say it's the actual bootstrap framework oh thanks for that Alex yeah and for anyone else in the chat if you want to click code along with us click on that link below I roll that was posted and the great thing about the examples is that like I said we can tweak it to how we want we don't always need anything need everything so this list I'll list item right here that's nav item it's disabled you can't you can't click on it it doesn't do anything and sometimes you wouldn't want to implement that logic if your website has a specific user who's not allowed to do something but for our case we don't need it so I'm just going to delete it and I'm going to save it again and look it's disappeared and we have our site and it's super responsive awesome I'm gonna leave the the search bar up for now since we're making a mock site anyway it's not really doing much but I think that's gonna be it for the navbar if you guys have any questions about the navbar please ask them now otherwise I'm just gonna see how to implement that sticky top option for the navbar okay and I have a bad habit of opening new tabs but let's use the one that we have currently okay so I know that a sticky top it's not an actual element and I know it's some sort of styling so to add additional styling to bootstrap elements and components I used utility classes so for utility classes I'm gonna have to do a little thinking it's gonna be something about position how I want that nav element navbar component placed and so we can look through the common values that we see for CSS like static relative absolute fixed and there's a sticky option if I scroll down a little further I see examples about a fixed top and fixed bottom and a sticky top so I'm just going to copy that class right here and you'll notice that for the navbar that there's actually a lot of classes that goes with it so navbar itself is the class that makes the whole thing a navbar the expand navbar expand MD that's what we talked about for the the sandwich menu navbar light is going to be the color of it and BG light is going to be the background color for it so if I simply add this class sticky top and save it it's a bootstrap once we have more things you'll see that it stays at the top and Neal asked is it possible to customize bootstrap CSS classes and ID's yes so two parts of that if you want to directly download that file and include it into your project you definitely can but another thing you could do is also make your own CSS file and overwrite certain things that bootstrap provides for you guys in our example today we will include like one line of CSS for the jumbotron so you can see how we can add like a background to the jumbotron class I'll talk a little bit about that later and so Neal definitely possible okay thanks for that question you should I hope you're not actually scared everything seems to be working fine so far okay all right and again if you guys are lost or need some sort of help the step two part you guys can just copy and paste this directly into the index.html select everything in order to just get like a clean start but be caught up to where we are I'm not gonna do that just because I like where we are right now but let's keep going in the next step I know that my website has a little banner if you will and it has a let's see if I could pull this up again steps heats fun and I know it says like if I buy using the site you agreed to only eating cookies just kidding you can eat any kind of pastry and so I click and unclick click click and it's gonna display something else and that's using something called collapse and this link right here is actually a button ok so I'm gonna go back to index by just removing that last part refreshing the page Oh probably need 8,000 but the great part about this I guess is can actually take we can take the code from part 2 and we're up and running again okay and I'll know not to try to find or look for the final products okay and before we do that's I just want to add that last part about the sticky top just because that's our own little touch to it and here we go so the next part we're gonna do is add that little button that banner for us and so I'm gonna again go to the bootstrap documentation and I'm gonna look for a component and the component of letter once is a button that is right here the button with a button link it just renders as a button as a link even though it's a button but I could have also used any other buttons here as well I could if I chose primary it would render a blue button a secondary a grey button green success a green button so forth and so forth so what I'm gonna do here again is take that example and underneath the navbar I'm gonna put a link here and it could have whatever saying that you want could say like thanks for chiming in look let's say thanks for chiming in and I'll save over it so it has thanks for chiming in but currently it doesn't do anything because I didn't add any sort of collapse functionality to it instead we'll have to then go to collapse right here in lofts and so we can use this to toggle the visibility content of your project with a few classes and our Java Script plugins so this one actually does need a Java Script in it if you didn't include the optional Java Script files from below this is not going to work okay and here are another set of examples again so I have the button already set up but it looks like there's some other attributes that I would want to copy so I'm gonna take those the only thing I'm not taking is the class cuz I already have the styling for the class and I'm gonna paste that right in oh and I have an extra angle angle bracket right there and I have another error somewhere see class type is button oh I've declared type twice don't need that's great so this one is going to have a target right here a target attribute of collapse example and what it's targeting is another element that has that same ID so we can add in a div right here that has that collapsed example and if I press ENTER and I save it noticed that nothing popped up on that page but if I click it appears so that's really what's going on under the hood this target is looking for something called collapse example and by defaults when we have a class of collapse that means that the the content inside it's not going to load just yet on the first load it's gonna show up as empty or hidden okay if I remove this you'll see that and I save the page you'll notice that by default it shows up and when I click it then it disappears right but we want the collapse there and so for those viewing thanks for chiming in glad to have you here glad to have you here yeah that's it okay I'm gonna fix some indenting and saved it and glad to have you here awesome one thing that we might want to do though is maybe Center this right like it's off to the side right now it doesn't look that good and so to style something we would use a utility class so the utility class we go back to our documentation we look up utilities and the thing that I want here is text related no it's text related and if I look through the examples I see there is some example about centeraligned text along all viewports viewports are just talking about the screen size really when you see a viewport it's talking about the content that is displayed in the browser so however big that sizes that's that's your viewpoint right and I copied that utility class and I'm just gonna go to the class here for the button and I'm going to add text align text Center and that didn't actually work and I'm going to hmm let's see if it works for the div if i text Center it I'll add it and save it oh the text is centered there so something's happening here where text is not aligning the button is not aligning and I think it's because of how it's actually displayed so this takes a little bit of background CSS knowledge but if our text isn't displaying centered it could be because of the button element itself it's just being pushed off to the left so even if the text is being centered the element that contains the text isn't pushed to the center so we can look on spacing click sizing spacing and what we want to do is set the margin to auto so right here we have class m4 margin and we want the left and right margins to be set to auto so that it will automatically Center for us let's check that out see if it works Center no oh and let's see displayblock awesome now it's centered so we had to change the display from inline to block a little CSS for you guys and you can see a little bit of the frustrations of working with CSS too I guess but now we have our little banner for chiming in and we're glad to have you here okay let's take a break I'm going to look at chat for a bit and see if there's any questions Anton so that's exactly the goal of bootstrap we could build faster websites and it also has additional benefits of being cross browser compatible so you don't have to worry about how it would look on edge versus Safari versus Firefox versus Chrome and build on can we design with bootstrap for a site that uses WordPress for the CMS panel that's an interesting question I'm not entirely sure but if I were to venture a guess I would say that WordPress probably has its own styling for you guys or or some way to style your website that may be under the hood could use bootstrap I don't know if it uses it directly that'd be something we'd have to look up together and if we have time later in the end of the livestream I'd be glad to look it up with you okay I don't have to go can we can watch us yes so Daniel after this stream ends so we're trying to aim for like an hour if for some reason you can't follow along with us yeah this stream is going to be uploaded as a video so you can follow at your own pace okay awesome and again if you are a little lost you can click on three and banner and take that code and paste it into in the index.html you're welcome Daniel and continue following along okay let's see after our I'm gonna do a little sneak and OH after our banner of sorts we're gonna make our jumbotron but thing I didn't really mention that is gonna be included as well is the grid system so our jumbotron is actually going to fit inside the grid system so that it's sizes properly it looks better and that we can take advantage of the grid and change our layouts to be that to have that responsive aspect of like showing up differently on large or small or medium or extralarge screens right so to make that I could actually do it off the top of my head now but let's go to layout and I want to look at grid and so how it works that's something really important to read up on but basically at the heart of it we have containers so bootstrap has containers that contains rows and inside the Rose we have columns so that's always gonna be the standard layout containers rows and columns we can have multiple columns inside rows and we can have multiple rows inside containers but that's always going to be that set pattern if you want to make things a little bit more complicated later on you can add rows inside columns but we're not really going to touch that for this livestream just know that you can do that you can make your site fancier than what we have right now okay so for the grid system let's let's just copy this for now and paste it right in and you'll see that we have a container it does some spacing for us and a little bit of layout just fix the indentation there but we don't really need some of this stuff in fact we don't even need the next two Rose we just need that first room okay and and we're gonna take that from here all right so I said we wanted to use our for Daniel sorry I just saw your question we do live streams every Thursday ah thank you around 130 p.m. Eastern Time we would love to have you in other chats and other streams as well thanks for checking it but back to the topic at hand about Jumbotrons it sounds like another component right it's another elements already styled for us let's take a look at how to formulate this so for the Jumbotron a lightweight and flexible component for showcasing hero unit style content if you're not familiar what a Jumbotron is and why it seems like a madeup word it's gonna be if it it comes from the fact that when you're at an arena or a stadium there's a giant TV called the Jumbotron or the company that makes it no wait Sony makes it the name of the TV is called the Jumbotron and it allows you guys to like if you're in in really bad seats or you need to know what's going on but you're not up close to the action you can see what's happening so like you paid money to be there you want to see what's going on and so the name of this Jumbotron component is to showcase certain important details or important work and we want it to stand out all right we want to take up a lot of space so here I'm just gonna copy the Jumbotron component class and I'm gonna paste it right where it says one of our three columns because we don't have three columns anymore we just have one but I want this Jumbotron to be in our component and notice that here on the sides we actually have a little bit of padding and as I make this bigger and I open up the screen the size of this Jumbotron and the padding also changes along with it that's like the great aspect of using the container and using the grid system it's making us making this convenient for us to have a really adaptable and responsive layout but we don't want a hello world here either let's see Stan let's do let's do a background first all right I'm gonna remove all this extra stuff I just want the jumbotron it's gonna be a blank space and so also for you guys coding along I'm gonna use this this little URL right here which is going to contain background of our jumbotron so I'm gonna copy that and this is the part where I mentioned we're gonna use a little bit of CSS this is the part we're gonna do it let's see in Jumbotron in our class we can do something called inline CSS where we assign the style right and to set the set background CSS and I know it's a URL that I want to use CSS I'm gonna Google search it's usually try to avoid w3 go to MDM here and it says I need to do a background image and a URL and I just have to pass in what the URL is let's see so I want to do background image URL and I'll paste in the at the URL there press ENTER and I'm not sure if you can tell but it's it actually did change all right I think there's just a few other elements that we have to put in there so let's see background image a no repeats CSS let's see what this has right here background repeat repeat why but it should be no repeats as far as I remember I want a no repeats okay fine I'm not gonna look at w3 schools anymore threepeat threepeat X okay here's the one that I once enhance on your rights let's use something else instead okay so I want backgroundrepeatnorepeat nots repeating and as far as I remember its I want something about cover to wonder if I could just find it here cover so bad habit of looking up things and new tabs edge cover CSS looking for scaling background images okay and what I want scaling image up containing and cover where is it so once Oh background size CSS tricks usually has it good no that's not the one I want either cover let's take a look so it would be background size and then cover okay so let's add this into our code background size cover oh sweet it's there okay I'm taking a quick look on the chats awesome cool all right and let's add some other thing div it's not another div inside here and let's see I want this div to also have text eventually so I'm going to style it a little bit with a background color and I want it to have a RGB value and I want it to be slightly dark just so some text can show up so if we do that's and we start adding some hello there some text it's not actually showing we can see hello there but we're not really seeing the background change so how do I do that background color background color let's see RGBA and ants on you're making me go click on the fifth link thank you and we have backgroundcolorrgba it looks right but if I'm doing this correctly it should have some sort of it should have some sort of like greyish tint to it and I'm not seeing that I wonder what's going on but for the purposes of this livestream I'm just gonna try to speed it up a little bit and take a look at what I did before so at the end my jumbotron class is there I am setting the background style here and I wanted to have these attributes so I'm going to just take that and save it you guys can feel free to do that as well I just don't want to take up too much time with trying to debug this and honestly that's my biggest gripe about CSS in general anyways is trying to figure out what all of this does whereas bootstrap documentation is so much cleaner awesome it's showing up I'm not sure entirely what I did there but it's got to be something about the classes that I didn't add before that are adding that additional styling to it okay so we had a little fun you saying there before so boots are great I don't know what to say what else to say not the best quotes but it's something for us to work with for now and you guys are free to change it at home however you want it to do it but that's really it for the bootstrap part the Jumbotron component and if you guys want to find the finished code for that go to step four all right and if you've lost your way go ahead and feel free to do that as well see you know I'm glad you guys can share with us share this pain CSS is a little frustrating to work with sometimes but without it we wouldn't have had this this nice little background image to put in so sometimes just has got to wrestle with it the next component we're gonna do is cards and so if you think about cards cards are like mini containers of sorts and they hold a little bit of information that are similar across for the various cards that you have so for our cards we want to make like little tiles to showcase information about boots or straps or perhaps the bootstrap okay Daniel good luck with your exam thanks for chiming in and I'm gonna look up how to I'm gonna look up how to find that as well on the components page so we have a card here and it looks exactly what we want notice that they also have some included CSS where they put style with is 18 RM so that's just it sets the width automatically for them to be that set size regardless of screen size and so when we want to add another thing to the container remember we want to have additional rows and then we want to have additional columns inside those rules rows excuse me and so I'm looking at where my Jumbotron component ends so I'm gonna just quickly comment bet it jumbo and I'm gonna start a new row jumbo and this is gonna be the end of jumbo row comments are really important guys when you want to understand ooh and I guess I misplaced that jumbo first if you want to understand where you are placing things and you want to revisit code because otherwise you're gonna get lost well or I'm gonna get lost and we won't know what's going on but let's do card room here and I want to do another div oh another div and this div is going to be our row and I want to make three columns inside this room might have been a little ambitious here if we want to get done with all this but and I want three separate rows so I just copied and pasted that row sorry that column in that row three times and now we can go back and we can copy our card and paste it right in we have some indenting issues as well so I'm going to tab those over awesome and great we have our first card that shows up that's gonna be a little difficult to see because the image is not loading and we don't want the card title you don't need some quick explanation but let's see how to fix that if you go to the lefthand panel we have our first card image and I'm gonna copy this and I'm going to paste it inside where our sources because right now it doesn't lead anywhere it's just three three dots or no ellipses and while I'm at it let's just put an alts text in case it doesn't appear old boots enter and bam we have it right there we have a row and we have a column and have a card inside that column cool please cover how to align images in the center mmhmm images in a row Adam oh uh let's see um maybe we could talk about that instead of cards then real quick but I do want to finish this one up real quick the reason why this spacing looks a little odd right now is because it's expecting three columns here so so this is actually gonna it's accommodating the space for this image but it's not but there's not any other content inside the other columns so it looks a little weird but if I copy this and I paste this over three times press Enter oops mess up right here and paste this three times over second one I think this just has to do with where I am putting this material so I'm having a lot of divs and I'm having a lot of columns so that is the right row and we want a column and this should be spaced hmm oh you know why that's because of the bootstrap example it's taking up a default width Oh should have noticed that we talked about that oh we gotta fix it now Oh awesome and we have the third one but it doesn't fit because it's just taking up too much space I think it's just that our image even as its smallest it's not gonna fit very well but if we stretch this out let's see we stretch this out notice that all three images are aligned okay I'm now gonna style it exactly like we did just copying and pasting for now just so that way I can try to sort of hit that deadline for the hour okay a few quick questions and I'm all aligning images in the center with bootstrap is actually quite well it's easier than you would if you were to use like traditional CSS just quickly go over something like that the the premise here like for let's say for our cards right they are centered because the columns that we put in automatically align so the grid system that bootstrap has in place we get more into this in the lesson in the bootstrap lesson if you guys are interested in that code Academy does have a 7 day free trial for pro users sorry 7 day Pro trial so if you guys want to check out any of the pro subscription material please do so and we talk more about it in there to give you a bit more guidance in the documentation we might look at something like for layout if I wanted to Center the images in a row I might go to the grid check out the examples here and it looks like so for the first one if that was the case I want to just Center columns I would just enter justified content MD Center MD being the break the break point for meeting so we might just eliminate that if I wanted to center something like I did before with text it could be text center like we saw here for text where was text center this class otherwise I might look towards spacing or or sizing no spacing is right and I could look at the margins and I could scale the left and right margins to auto so that our browser is gonna automatically space and Center those images for us okay I hope that helps we did that directly with the button here oh man let's scroll up a little bit with the button right below the nav bar right here so without this MX auto and dblock which an image would already be displayblock it would be aligned to the left right so let's add those back in and notice that by including that the the button is now centered you can apply that same sort of logic for the for the images that you want okay see checking in with the chats thanks you guys awesome so I'm gonna keep going and we have a few more sections to go through the carousel I know that was really important why not it didn't show as you vote ah thanks guy where were you before man um yeah that makes total sense and I'm so sorry that I missed that but thanks someone's paying attention appreciate it okay and I also have some extra F here for some reason but let's keep going we have our cards set up it's a little willynilly I do think it's a little important to talk about break points though so let's take a second to go over that by defaults our cart our columns have a they kind of like an auto just thing going on but each row should have I can fit up to 12 individual columns and so if I set 12 it's gonna stretch out to take up the entire row so that's gonna be for any screen right because by default it has extra small listen and it's gonna be for any screens bigger than Excel and bigger so that's all the screens but I wanted to show up as just having a width of let's say six columns for like medium sized screens or let's do let's do small and big it's small then once I hit this breakpoint oh and adjust it for my other ones as well then you'll notice that that goes side by side and the last one still takes up the entire span of the room if I have three cards and we can only have twelve columns in a row and I have three cards three columns I guess I shouldn't make it for each then a span of four so for small screens let's instead of making it six let's do four and we should be able to see all three cards show up on the same row answerthere BAM now if I minimize it again notice that after I hit that extra small breakpoint that they're back to taking up all 12 rows in the example that we do lists it's it's a little bit more intricate than that we Center it a little bit and we also justify it to Center the images so I hope if you guys want to to take a look and and implement that into your own code you can do so I really want to try to hit this 1230 deadline I'm sorry 230 deadline I'm not sure how much time I'm actually gonna get spend with styling the images from here on but the options are there for you guys if you so want to okay so I'm gonna go and keep on moving take a quick look at the chats okay and that's gonna be for my column so I know that at the end of this let's add another column comment here and of cards I'm also being a little haphazard about my commenting but it helps so any little bit helps and just like knowing where I am and how this how this ends up where to refer back to so the next one that we're gonna do was the asta of carousel no I don't want that spacing carousel carousel and of carousel Oh ants on that's just crazy talk streaming another day yeah we're gonna get that we're gonna get through this okay just just gotta believe let's see class is gonna be Rove yeah so we're adding another row and want to add another div here and I want add another column okay okay cool trying all right so this next column and by this point we're almost done I'm just finagling with some of the the names and making sure that they're they're all appropriate tidying this up a little bit before we go on awesome so we have the last thing second the last thing that we want to add is the Jumbotron and it's also another component it's already styled for us it has a purpose and let's see here I need to find carousel carousel and carousels before they're like a horse carousel you can go on it cycles around same sort of idea here we want a set of images that we can cycle around and they have various examples of slides only with control and with indicators with captions so there's a lot of examples to choose from think you know what um I think I'm just gonna use the one that has the controls that was one that was asked for in the examples that we provide for you it has the ones with indicators as well so if you want to use that feel free and I pasted it in a lot of code and I have to fix a little bit of the indentation okay okay so let's save our code and here it's here it is on the bottom it's broken images again we can have we can access the the images here in the left the carousel images so I can paste those in let's see provide an appropriate alt text boots on no excuse me while I try to copy and paste as quick as I can boots on this is gonna be a book bag and the third carousel which is missing a D on that word and an appropriate boots on stone alt text save it's scroll down and here we go cool and we have images that we can click through grant it if I had more time I'd probably style this and space this out a bit more and have different images for the cards a little trade off I would love to just go back and answer questions instead though and so really like with all bootstrap stuff what I find super useful is just looking inside of documentation and figuring out what it is that I want and then copying it and once I have it I can then see how it renders I can play around with it a little bit more sometimes I might have to look on forums see what other people have done I've checked on sites like MDM and like CSS tricks to see what goes into actually styling it if I am having trouble and so that's that's really the thought process behind it and bootstrap makes it really easy for you to do the last thing that I want to include here is a simple nav component which is I just want to include because it's it's not the same thing so I just added outbreak there but the nav is not the same thing as a navbar the navs is more specific to certain pages you might not see it on every page but it does have a collection of links that you might want and so depending on how you the layout of your site goes you can use one of two examples here provided you can also customize it to your own liking but these are like safe bets that you know are gonna display a certain way so once again we're here we're gonna copy the example and since it's going to be the last real major parts of our websites I'm just copying pasting code because I don't like writing those angle brackets but this is going to be our nav components and end components so the nav component is going to be like a series of links that you got that you might want to include let me set up the row classes grow and also another div that's going to be in our column and I can take this copy and paste it all in if nothing else today was a simple quick copy and pasting exercise brought to you by code Academy it's important stuff and exit out of that save it okay awesome so we have our link so how I'm not gonna get any more descriptive with these links anymore than they did but you guys are definitely welcome to put your own little spin on it the only thing that I am going to play around with this is removing the disabled link like before don't really need it and so we have active first link no that's not our first link anymore but yeah but you get the idea maybe we can do one last thing on let's see styling or centering this so if I look up that last parts and look up some utility classes to style it maybe we could have some success all right and let's see I want a spacing and I want to set the margin again to MX Auto if this is gonna be a display if it displays block then it should work if not then we're gonna have to find another solution but I want to set this as an export oh and maybe we could do what we did before and setting it as a display block Oh hmm what if we set our column so that makes a lot of instead let's see how my Center links maybe they have it back in components and I just missed it let's see components and I go down to NAB's ah okay I think I'm seeing something so write a line horizontal a line here we go copy that class slap that bad boy on alright fix my quotes very important boom okay awesome and then we have centered links okay I think we just made it in time for the hour it's not as styled as I wanted it to be if you want to check out the more stylized and finalized version you can go click on eight final and copy and paste that over but I think there's also some merit to being able to do this in an hour with bootstrap so that's also something on its own if you guys were following along congrats to you guys as well we're gonna stick around on the chat for a little bit but I think that's really it for the livestream I'll stay here for a few more questions if you guys have it have any excuse me and thank you guys for joining in really appreciate it it was really fun doing this and nervewracking I should say too but it was great thanks if I stop this livestream is a is the chat still gonna be there alright catch you guys later okay I gotta find this
