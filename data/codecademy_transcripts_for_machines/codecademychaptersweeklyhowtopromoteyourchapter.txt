everybody here with another weekly tip piece of encouragement for you this one's i think big because a lot of you been asking about it i think that's just where we are in the program and that's promoting your event and uh this one's big coming after last week's on the attendance formula because it's like okay cool so i know that i'm probably going to get about 25 of my rsvps to actually show well how do i get that many more people to sign up for my chapter so that i get actually more people to show up at my event and we get to have awesome conversations promoting your event is how so four ways i want to take a i would like you to take away from this quick tip number one you're on social media so you may remember back to the application form where we asked you if you have like a twitter handle or a instagram handle please share that with us because i would love it if you were to share on your social media channels and then you ping me in discord and i can ask our social media manager if she'd be open to retweeting or reposting your event on our accounts so number one your social media in partnership with us let's see if this works number two codecademy facebook group if you're on facebook visit i'm not gonna remember the url go to facebook type in codecademy community and the group will show up join and uh myself and my colleague lil are the ones approved and a team of moderators that's not that's not they're amazing um all of us together are approving posts so you share a post to promote your event we'll approve it there's 40 000 people globally in that group i think it'd be a great way to get you some exposure number three admittedly the most experimental um visit meetup.com see what other coding meetups there are in your area a number of these won't be able to meet right now and they're probably looking for ways that they can still stay connected so go to meetup.com search for a few coding meetups in your area and reach out to those organizers um again haven't personally tried this one yet but if i were building a chapter this is totally something i would do because people just want to meet and connect and uh if there are people out there who've been stymied because of the mess of this pandemic there might be a partnership opportunity there and number four finally if you're getting started we have two slots every week in the community newsletter that our colleague lil on the community team sends out i think that this is probably like the coolest way to get some uh exposure for for your chapter caveat we really only have two so i think that um it'll probably be best if you're new and we're just wanting to get you some exposure right away um this would be something that definitely reach out to me or mike about on discord so recapping from the beginning sorry this is a long video but i think this one's really important since so many have been asking about it number one you're on social media hit me up on discord if you've posted something on your own social media i'll try and partner with our social media person to get that retweeted or reposted number two codecademy facebook group that thing is busy and love to see some chapter representation there number three the experimental one visit meetup.com and see what other organizers there are out there that you may want to partner with to take their meetup virtual and number four probably the most surefire one but we only have two slots in the codecademy community newsletter that's another one where if you're just getting started you're probably working with me and mike already and we'd love to get you that support okay um i expect that we'll have some stuff to talk about after this one major major major if you made it this far in the video congratulations you're awesome putting this easter egg in here if you don't yet have access to codecademy pro and you've already set up or you've already scheduled a meet up dm me because i got to get you your free access as a thank you for being a chapter leader have a great week
