what's up everybody I'm Brendon and this is my cat Lou and today we're going to go a bit beyond the basics we're going to take our gritty site that we've been working on and add a little more zip and sass to it so what does that look like well the first thing I'm going to teach you is how to add shadow to images and I think this effect works very well with PNG s which is what I've used for my gritty site so we're going to make gritty kind of pop off the page using this shadow effect then after that I'm going to teach you how to add a static navbar to a site static meaning wherever you're navigating to the site up down left right the navigation bar will always be at the top and last but certainly not least I'll teach you how to replicate the Twitter slash slash slash Facebook little avatar image and then we're going to render the message aligned with that avatar image so let's jump into it alright so the first thing I want to do and I think this is just like a nice little touch for most images is add a slight border to this gritty image so it looks as if it's kind of popping out so let's go back to our index dot CSS and what I want to do is grab that small gritty and I'm going to use the filter and give it a drop shadow 1px 1px 1px the color of black and I recommend looking the drop shadow in the filter option up online just give it a quick google just to give you a little taste of what it's actually doing but when i refresh you'll notice how all greedy now has this nice little border and it just kind of gives it a nice pop one thing I actually want to do is change the HTML a bit so I would like to have a nice navbar up top and we can accomplish that by using an unordered list in HTML so I'm going to change this a bit and I'm gonna say now far section I'm going to use a nav tag and this is part of html5 but it's just a semantic tag it's really no different than it it's just used to specify that hey I'm building out a tap bar component and I'm going to put in order to list in here I'm gonna put a bunch of link components and anchor tags and within the anchor tags I'm going to link to things so rich fine this will kind of be like my home link add three links gritty landing banner and then link to the gritter Twitter clone down at the bottom of our site now what I want to do with this nav component is well as you can see it's pretty ugly right now but I want to do is take these link components are these list elements and have them displayed in line so it looks like a normal navbar I also want it to be static so that when we scroll it's always located at the top of our screen so we can do that with CSS so let's give the nav component or the nav the navbar here a class of AB bar save that and then at the top I'm going to add a nav bar class AB bar class selector and to get it to stay where it is at the top of the page we use the position fixed and then I'm going to say all right it's going to take up the entire width of the page and it should be located because it has a fixed position I want it to be fixed at the very top like literally brushing up on the very top of our window and we can do that by using top and setting it to a value of zero so let's see what happens when I do that okay cool so it's kind of stuck there but let's add a background color background color I'm just gonna give it a nice background color of white oops background color white again cool alright nice so it's kind of staying where it is which is exactly how a normal nav a nav bar on a site works so there's one thing though that we have accomplished and that's a getting rid of these dots maybe getting rid of this the text decoration on this link because it's an anchor tag it's kind of it has that blue look to it I'm gonna get rid of that I also want these things to be displayed in line so let's switch back over to our CSS now below our nav bar I'm going to say nav bar and then all of the list components within the nav bar I want you to have a display property of inline block what that's going to do is push all of these lines right next to each other cool but I also want to add a little bit of a margin so let's do that by saying padding30px 3px to the top and 20px to the left and right alright so that looks pretty pretty good it's actually a little too wide at this point so let me let me actually change this to zero and see how that looks this is actually how most CSS is written you kind of figure out as you go now so I don't like that actually that's not terrible the problem is now because we specified a certain size or certain margin for this banner section that at the top when you're scrolled all the way to the top the nav bar seems like it's super wide when in fact it's really only this wide but yeah it looks okay for now so one thing I do want to do is get rid of that text decoration I don't want it to have that underlined so I'm going to say grab all of the A's within class navbar and textdecoration textdecorationnone see what happens when I do that alright cool so that looks pretty good actually going to open up the Google Chrome developer tools real quick and see what's going on sizewise so I want to see how big this thing is it's it looks like it's 50 pixels high so I'm that means I'm going to add a margin to this banner section of 50 pixels high 50 pixels refresh all right now that's starting to look pretty good right cool one thing we can add is we can change the styling of those links so let's make them black cool yeah it looks pretty good so let's add an ID of blue to this anchor tag actually now let's add a class class of blue and then in our index dot CSS let's say all of the every anchor tag with a class of blue should have the color of blue now why am i doing a dot blue it's just a special syntax if you use with anchor tags when you're styling them I don't know why it's just something you have to memorize so let's refresh that and that looks good all right so I now want to redo this gritter section I'm going to get rid of these dots here that make up our unordered list and then for each one of these list tags I want to add a little image like a little avatar image of Grady's face so let's first go to our HTML and then let's let an ID of greets okay greets and then we wanna grab the unordered list all the unordered lists within the div of the class of or idea of greets and then we're going to say let's style type none save that all right so we got rid of the dots and that's looking pretty good you know what I also want to add a little padding to this section because everything's kind of spaced out and it doesn't look so good so let's go back to what you next I teach tml grab this outer div and give this a class of critter section copy that and I'll put it put it above the greeter the idea of critter critter section and then we're going to say padding and then for the top and bottom 20 picks for the left and right padding up 50 picks save that alright so things are looking a little better now nice and evenly spaced away from this side here okay so let's get back to this we want to add images in line with each one of these tweets so let's add a class of Avatar to these divs and notice there's nothing in this div okay so all of those dudes have a class of avatar let's move over here to Avatar okay now this is a little tricky now what I'm going to do is I'm going to say background image and then within here we pass it or URL I'm going to give it a relative file path now the dot dot slash means to go up one level in the folder structure so we're in here and I wanted to exit out of this CSS folder so now we're basically at this structure where the CSS folder and the images folder is located and I want to say go down into the images folder and grab that image and use that as a background image okay we want background size cover and we want to add a height of 15 pixels width of 50 pixels for this div and then what we're actually want to do is give this div a border radius so what we're doing is we're creating a circular div we're assigning at a height in width of 50 pixels and we're saying I know this is a div but give it a background image and use that image to cover the space of that background image oh I recognize the typo here so 50% border radius and let's see what that does refresh the page cool so you'll notice now that things aren't being displayed in line that we can quickly get around that by changing the display of this avatar to inlineblock save that and things still aren't lined up but that's fine because I know what we can do with that we can use a property called verticalalignmiddle and these are just things you should google because they're very specific based on the types of HTML tags you're working on but let me refresh that and boom everything is nice and lined up right in the middle the way we wanted it to already all that's it for today hopefully you can take some of these things we learned today and try incorporating it into your own site so I guess I'll see you in the next video good luck bye
