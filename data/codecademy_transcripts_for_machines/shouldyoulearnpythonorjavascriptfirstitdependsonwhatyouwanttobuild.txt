how do you feel about JavaScript versus python I know that a lot of people ask well which one should I go for first yeah it's a great question and as a CS educator it's one I personally go back and forth on um python is an extremely powerful program that's similar to JavaScript has a lot of different applications um and it's not surprising that pythons are first most popular course in JavaScript is our second one so you know with python you can get into data science applications if you're really excited about AI I would definitely recommend Python and then if you are interested in very creative applications or doing more web development web design I think JavaScript is for you and the great thing is honestly is you can learn both like when I was learning how to program I started with JavaScript and then I took a python class and what I found is that learning a second language really helped ground me in the basic principles of you know programming topics say pick one language python or JavaScript and then you can always come back to the second one
