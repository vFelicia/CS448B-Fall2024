what's up everybody I'm Brendon and today I'm going to be showing you how to add CSS to your HTML website and we're going to be doing all of this on your own computer so now is finally the time to rip off those training wheels we're going to be taking what we've learned from the learning environment over on code Academy and start doing it on your own personal computer so what's on the docket today I'm going to be showing you the kind of standard way of setting up a folder structure for building out a website with HTML and CSS I'm then going to add some content in the form of HTML to our site and then style that HTML using CSS which is going to be located in its own separate file I'm then going to show you how we hook up CSS to an HTML file switch over to the browser show you the result and then at the very end if you'll stick around with me I'm going to then kind of take a deeper dive into CSS and get our site looking semiprofessional already so let's jump in if you saw my last video on setting up a basic HTML site you're already very familiar with gritty the world's best looking mascot and we built him a very very basic web page with just HTML now what we're going to do at long last is give gritti a much more beautiful site and in the process you'll see how we set up and use CSS in the real world in the next 15 minutes or so we'll quickly code up and style a web page using HTML and CSS linked together going from scratch to this and then finally to this and if you're interested in seeing some of the styling that goes into making gritty site even prettier using some techniques comment across the major sites like slack and Twitter stick around and there's another optional 10 minute video to follow with some tips and tricks so that greedy can be proud of his gritter Twitter clone later on with code Academy in a future video when I show you how to link HTML CSS and JavaScript together that's where we'll be able to add some more interactivity to greeter site like being able to add more content to the page live like you'd see on Twitter but that's just a little teaser for the future for now let's get our static site styled first alright so step one to building out our site is creating a folder structure to house our site so I've got finder open over here if you're on a Windows computer the equivalent is called Explorer but anyway I've kind of designated an area on my computer that'll house all of my code academy projects and I suggest that you do the same see I've got a folder up here called code Academy and what I'm going to do is create a new folder that's going to house our site so I'm going to call this one dev project and hit enter all right and now I'm going to switch over to my text editor and the text editor I'm going to be using today it's called V s code okay so I've got V s code open I'm gonna go up to the file whatever you want to call this file tab hit open and then find that directory or folder that we just created open that and it should pop up over here get this welcome screen out of here alright cool so it's hard to tell actually if I go over here you can see it but dev project is opened up in our text editor so let's now add our index.html file my goodness index dot HTML cool all right so the next thing we want to do is actually create a folder and I'm going to call it a resources now before we dive in here I just want to point out that a welldesigned folder structure will help you navigate between HTML or CSS files more easily because you know exactly where they are so in the resources folder a very common scenario is to add another folder inside that called CSS and then in here is where we're actually going to be adding all of our CSS files so the one we're going to be using today is index dot CSS and it's just kind of semantics in terms of the name I'm using here you don't have to use index dot CSS you could call whatever you want but I'm just gonna call it index dot CSS because it's the standard way so yeah and I'm actually going to do another thing I'm going to click on resources and add another folder now what you'll see in a minute is I'm actually going to add a local image stored right here in our file structure instead of linking to an image located somewhere on the internet it's actually going to be low within our folder structure here so I'm going to create another folder called images and switch back over to my to finder screens I've got this image downloaded over here I'm gonna drag that into dev project if I can and get it into resources and then plop it into images cool let's just make sure it's there all right back to the text editor okay so step two is finally adding some content to our webpage so I'm going to type in my index.html file HTML and then I'm actually going to the the great thing about vs code is it has all of these builtin commands ready to use for us and what I did is I type HTML and I went down in an arrow and then I'm going to hit tab and it gives us a little boilerplate code ready to go for us which we need to set up a proper HTML website so we have our head and we have our body and now within the body is where we can actually start adding some content but before we do let me add a title to our site and I'm gonna call it grit root 2 Phi good 2 Phi all right so now is the time to actually start adding some content to the site I'm not going to go indepth into what I'm adding here there are a few things I'm going to point out but this next I would say in the next 30 seconds or so I'm going to speed up just because I don't want you guys to waste your time because you probably already know HTML but there are a few things I'm going to kind of pause the speed up as I go and explain what I'm doing the first thing actually is I like to add comments for myself when I add certain sections to my index dot HTML file so I'm actually going to start out with this banner section as represents kind of the main landing page of our site but anyway time to speed this up okay so one thing I want to point out here is I'm using span the main reason I'm using span here is because I know that each one tags in each two tags and all the heading tags in HTML come with their own custom CSS and span is kind of like a hack to get around that instead of using h1 and then going in with CSS and customizing or kind of overriding the default CSS that comes with h1 tags what I'm doing with a span is I'm saying all right I don't I don't want any of that of that default styling just let me start with like the standard styling that a span tag comes with which is very minimal compared to an h1 tag or an h2 tag so anyway back to back to speed and stuff up all right and one thing I want to point out here is the different types of inputs here within this forum element specifies what types of input I want to use so for an input field with a type of text that allows you to type in like a normal text input would and then for a type input of submit it's a submit button that has a special connection to the form element that surrounds it but don't worry about any of that stuff it's more that's more for when we get to JavaScript eventually in the course also value here is the value of the button so whatever text is within the button is what you can customize here with this value attribute so yeah all right so this is my boilerplate code one thing I want to show you is how to link to a local image located within the folder structure of our website itself so I remember I added the image to my images folder which is located in the resources folder now how do we link to that if it's a relative image I'm going to go up to my image HTML element tag here within the source attribute I'm going to type dot slash now dot slash represents a relative path and what a relative path means is it is a path relative to wherever we are in our folder structure so we're in the index dot HTML file and we want to provide this source attribute with a relative path meaning relative to the index dot HTML file of this image so relative to index dot HTML this dot slash means stay on the same level that index dot HTML is located there's two things that are located at the top structure of our folder structure and that is the resources folder and the other thing is the index dot HTML file so the dot slash represents hey I want to link to something that's located on the same level as where I'm currently at so that is the resources folder now within that I want to link to the images folder and then within that images folder I want to link to that better than Drake PNG and that is how you use a relative path to link to an image located within your folder structure all right so now let's actually switch over to the web browser in view our site with plain old HTML no CSS has been added what I'm going to do is click on index or right click on index dot HTML and click on copy path and then switch over to the web browser type that in and boom we've got our site now it doesn't look great but you know at least we've got a nice image that is located locally within our the folder structure which is cool and you know we've got this stuff and there's no SOT styling yet actually I want to change this because these should be different okay so there's a few things don't want to accomplish with CSS I want to make this image smaller because it's a little a little too in my face right now the other thing I want to do is add a background to this banner section a nice maybe blue background color and then I also want to make this gritter text here a little bigger because this kind of represents gritties social media presence on his own platform called critter and I just think it should stand out here and it's really kind of I literally hate everything about it so we're gonna change this a little bit with CSS let's start off by adding a background color as well as maybe a margin to the top of this banner section and this banner section goes from this header here down to well let's check our HTML down to the button subscribe me subscribe to me or I'll eat you all right cool so we're going to start off by adding a class to this div and we're going to call it banner then I'm going to switch over to my index dot CSS file and using a selector because it's a class I use a dot selector to gain access to that div with a class of banner and let's start by adding a background color of I've gotten already I have one here some 4 D 0 0 save that I also want to change the color of the text because with that blue background it's going to be hard to see so I'm gonna just make that text white and then I'm going to add a margin top of 75 pixels and I want everything to kind of be aligned in the center so I'm going to do textaligncenter save that go over here refresh and nothing happens and why is that well it's because we haven't linked our CSS file to our HTML site or our HTML file and how do we do that well we're going to use a link tag up here and hit tab and then we have to provide this link tag with a reference to that CSS file so again let's use a relative path here we're going to say dot slash look in the resources folder resources and then look in the CSS folder and then use index dot CSS and that's cool I think that's a builtin part of es code it kind of tries to guess what you're linking to based on what you type so let's save that and remember we're putting this link tag in the head that's where we put our links to our CSS style sheets so let's refresh that and alright oh you know what we need to add a few things here first I want to make this this image smaller but at least it worked right we changed our checks color and we changed the background color of this big div to blue which is awesome and the text away so let's do one more thing let's go back and change the height or the size of our gritty image so before we add some styling let's add that a class to our CSS so we want to style the image this image so we're going to add a class or an ID you know what let's use an ID because we're going to use an ID when we want to style something that's very specific and I have a feeling that this image is going to be very specific as in we're only going to be using this style selector once hence I'm going to use a ID and I'm going to call it small gritty okay so let's use the ID style selector which is represented by this hash here and then type small gritty and let's give gritty a height of hundred pixels oops oops oops and a width 100 pixels all right so that looks much better actually what I want to do is add some padding so we have some margin I want to add some padding within this box here so the padding will effectively move this greedy landing banner down and and I want to move move this subscribe to me or I'll eat you button up a little bit so there there's some blue between the edge of that button and the border of this blue box as well as up top for that h1 tag I want some a little bit more blue space up here so let's switch back over to our CSS file and add some padding to the banner section now I just want the padding to be added to the top and the bottom I don't care about the left or the right it's already you know padded it enough for me so how do we do that we do that by typing 100 picks for the top and bottom and for the left and right we don't want to give it any padding okay so let's refresh that and all right that actually looks pretty good now one last thing I do want to change the style of this gritter text here just to be a little bigger because it's small and you should be able to tell that it is in fact you know a header down there right now we can't really tell what's going on down here it just looks like some text that's kind of floating so let's style that up all right oh let's open up our index dot HTML file and add an ID to this span and call it Ritter and then select that by using the hash and then we're going to give it a color and I've got one down here already yes for D 0 F F and then I'm going to specify the font size make it 100 pixels save that refresh all right and that looks much better but I actually want to make this bold so what I actually am going to do is I'm going to create without adding anything to my HTML yet I'm going to create a bold class and then I'm going to say anything with a class of bold make the font weight 900 save that so this is reusable a class by definition should be reusable so anything with a class of bold will give it that font weight so let's let's give a few things the font weight that font weight or that class of bold start off by doing that here and what else do we want to make bold let's make let's make this P tag bold so when i refresh the page this should turn bold as well as this so let's see what happens all right very nice alright so that's wrapped up the basic things I wanted to cover today I added HTML when we use CSS in a separate file hook those files up together and then we were able to view this website in our web browser now don't forget if you're interested in seeing some optional extra tips and tricks to get greedy site a pinch more polished stick around for part two alright so that is it for today we have officially ripped those training wheels off no longer working in the code Academy environment we've done all of this on our own personal computer what did we do we set up the folder structure I was using finder I created a folder and then we use the text editor to select that folder we added a resources folder to that directory we also added a HTML file and then within that resources folder we added CSS folder and images folder and both of those folders respectively held to their own types of files we did this because we want to keep our files as organized as possible we know exactly where our CSS folders or files are located within the resources folder and within that resources folder at the CSS folder and same with the images and again we use relative paths to link to all of these things to hook our site together so we used a link tag we placed in our header of our HTML file to get our CSS working and styling our site the way we wanted to so yeah I hope that was kind of a good dip into the world of CSS and I will see you in the next video bye
