hi i'm xavier i'm an engineer at codecademy and i work on the conversion team the conversion team's mission is to improve the user experience when learners visit the site for the first time i'd say there's a common misconception that you maybe look at code or work or write code all day long but in reality there's there's a lot going on you are reviewing other people's code you're meeting with other people to talk about how to do things you're researching a lot and you're relying on a lot of people to do your job it's not just you coding by yourself but a designer a product manager a data scientist all of you work together to build something for for the user for the company yeah i don't think there are a lot of practical differences between a web developer or a software engineer or a programmer i've worked in places that use the title web developer some other places use front end engineer others use ui engineer or software engineer and i did the same thing at all those places at the end of the day we're all trying to solve business problems with code by writing code you're you're actually solving real problems in the world it's it's hard to see when you're in the code you're just you're kind of having fun as you write the code but as soon as you're done you're putting that code out there and you are solving a very complicated business problem for millions of people and another thing that i like about software is that there's a lot of demand for it so i can support myself and my family for years to come based on the skills that i've learned and that's that's a very important part of what we do this it's not just the flow state it's not just how you improve the world but also how you improve yourself and the people around you um so when you combine the three that that's that's how you know you have a good job
