all right hello everyone my name is Kyla I'm a web development curriculum developer here at code Kadim II and we're going to do a fun livestream of our Python chat bot the ileum bot and it just goes to show like even if you know a little bit about programming anybody could do this one so we're really excited to have you guys here if you have any questions at all feel free to ask them in the chat and let's get started in a few we'll wait probably like two more minutes just to let everyone join in and get comfortable all you need to do is click on the link below and you can join the project and follow along in the meantime oh we have the Kayla oh that's so funny people always called me Kayla but my name is Kyle oh that's funny hey Kayla I'm really excited for you to get started on computer science I hope it's going well for you we have about one more minute before I'm gonna get started can I increase the sound please will do let's see all the way up right now I could talk louder is that better that should be better quoi okay all right so I'm gonna be nice and loud so everyone can hear hopefully this is good but if I need to talk louder just keep commenting I will make sure I project my voice more but right now let's get let's jump right in is everyone ready okay so let's start off with in nineteen the 1950s there's this guy named Alan Turing he's a computer scientist he started thinking about what would we need to do to make a machine think and this is kind of where AI or artificial intelligence was born Alan Turing created the Turing test which pretty much is a test for how how can we measure whether or not a machine can think like a human being and or convince a human being that they're talking to another human being many people took different knocks at the test some people tried to create different conversational agents to pass the test but in 1966 a guy named Joseph was weddin bomb I'm probably bombing his name created Eliza and Eliza she did fail the test she wasn't the perfect human machine but she came pretty close and today we're going to create a chatbot very similar to Eliza so let's get started hopefully you guys can hear okay so today we're building a chatbot similar to Eliza if you click that link if you click the link in the description you'll you should have this screen open this is our project today we're gonna create an alien bot it's going to be like Eliza but out of this world if you want to get started on this there's not too much you need to know if you know a bit of Python already great and we're also going to talk about regular expression if you have some experience with regex expressions I'm sorry regex or regular expressions that's awesome if not don't even worry cuz we'll go over it so this is how it works I'm going to run it this is the finished version so yours probably won't be able to do this just yet this is solution code we'll go through it together later so if I got started Python 3 script got py to call this file up says hello there what is your name my name is Kyla KY LA and that it greets me back saying hi hi my name is etc and I'm not from this planet will you help me learn about your planet my job is to tell it about my planet so I'll say yes I will help why am I here I can have a conversation with it what should I tell it why am I here hmmm maybe because I work here please tell me more well I work code Academy teaching people how to code do they code on your planet he says my planet is a utopia of diverse organisms and species that's awesome but it didn't quite answer my question ok have a nice Earth Day cool so we're going to go through and program this chat bot to be able to do things um you guys ready to get started everything all good to go cool so if I start it off when we start off there are a few things if you read through our project description there are a few things that we already have in place for you our project has some code sitting there waiting for you and we're going to fill out the rest so that this works first thing we have is we've imported the are e and random libraries re is the regex library for python so that's going to bring in all our methods that we need to use in order to make this work with regular expression import random imports the random library so anytime we need to do something at random we can call on that methods from that library to make it work let's get started so we have our negative responses this is in case anybody says no or not or anything else that would be a negative response to something that etc our alien bot says we have exit commands which are things like goodbyes which lets the alien bot know we can't talk anymore we gotta go we have some random questions these are starter questions to get the conversation going we have an empty name variable with an empty string that's going to be whatever our name is and we have an alien Babel tuple that's filled with dictionaries we'll go into that a little bit more as we get started and then as we move through the code there's some blank spaces here these are functions we're going to create in order to make this chat bot work and then later on we're gonna have to use our reflections like a dictionary sorry and that dictionary is going to help us grammatically transform these sentences so when I say I'm the alien bot notes to say you're and then after that we are going to use the reflect function to make that make changes in the sentences so and then finally calling alien bot so let's start from the beginning from instruction one step one we're using regular expression right and regular expression helps us to process text in this case we have two first first up add in some responses to potential user prompts where you see empty strings you can be as creative as you'd like what do you think an alien would say in response to these prompts notice the first response we added for why do you dot dot dot question has a curly brace zero curly brace this represents the regex group which is this little group of punctuation here we have a parentheses a period and asterisks a square bracket a little caret slash question square bracket Asterix parentheses I'm sure you guys can see it this part is the regex group we'll explain that in a few which captures the rest of the users questions I think da da da also has the parentheses a strict parentheses representing the remainder of the user statement you can capture this inverse in your response if you wish which is cool so let's look at it what we're referring to is inside of our alien Babel temple our alien Babel temple has a bunch of different phrases that can be extracted from the user's response these phrases help our alien know what to reply so inside we have a dictionary right that dictionary has a key which is what we were referring to in the step sorry and we have our values there are two values in this situation our first key starts off with an R and an ' that are in the apostrophe tells python that this expression is a raw string next we have our period that period says there are more occurrences of a specific Karros re matches to any character sorry the period is matching any characters that may be coming before the your planet favor phrase the asterisks following it is saying zero or more occurrences of this character together they work as a catchall and they match any of the strings characters to something that was inside of the users response after that in our value we have our what our alien could say back to the user we have another one why do you it's kind of hard to read because there's a little bit of weird code here but we now know what this code means that our apostrophe once again it's a raw expression I mean sorry a raw string next we have why do you and then following that we have another catchall that catches whatever follows why do you and then we have a series of regex parts syntax that is used to catch those pieces inside of the description we have a link at the very end to wwx are calm if you guys ever wanted to play around with regex and get to know it a little bit more you could take this code right here and plug it in to figure out what it means and how exactly it works we don't have enough time to get into the nittygritty of regex but we'll learn a little bit of it as we go if you have any more questions feel free to check out that link it's a really awesome website that we use here at code Khadem e all right so this prompt is pretty much telling us it wants us to fill out the rest of these so this is where I want your help I want to know what you guys think we should ant should be answers from the alien to a question that begins with why do you after that we're going to fill out things for why what it's I think and then we have catch all's at the end of please tell me more tell me more why do you say that so on and so forth but let's start off trying to find answers to why do you one of the ones we have here is what makes you think I well I'll start throwing something in and answers to what why do you could be why do you because I am on a great mission period have you been on a mission I'm asking a second question because I want to keep the conversation going with the user it'd be great to get one more that would be a response to why do you and drink some water why do you have big eyes I like it so in this situation we have the user asking why do you so the user might be asking why do you have big eyes in this situation we can have the alien say I have big eyes well I don't think that's gonna work because what we have here is a question from the user and we want to use a have a block of code that could easily transition into the conversation going further so why do you may not completely work but because I'm bored would work in this situation that would be a cool response from the alien to the human asking why do you da because I'm bored it's like a bratty alien I guess and then like alien could ask a question to keep the conversation going like what do you do for fun around here cool so the next part is why if the user asked the question to the alien that includes the word why what should the aliens say um why this could be a question like why are you here I could say I come in peace this could also be a question like why are you funnylooking everyone on my planet is funny keep being bratty why not I like that why not we have a sassy ale here I do not wanna have a conversation with that okay so I'm gonna keep filling stuff out you guys if you're following along go ahead and throw whatever you want in but we have a few more prompts to do we have a what if someone asks something like what why go to sleep we could ask we could answer back with what's a question they would have what is it like on your planet my actually let's save that actually no let's use that my planet is out of resources so we also have some possible responses in the hint so if you guys are ever like what else should we do we have plenty right here so let's just copy paste these make our lives a little easier there's plenty of more opportunities for me to ask you guys what else you guys think we should add so yeah for it is we have some responses like you seem very certain why is that or do you have any edit evidence for I think we are going to use but you're not sure and why do you think now if you guys you guys may have noticed there's that curly brace with the zero and the curly brace again once again that is the placeholder for the group it's really important that we know this so what are what Eliza did that our alien bot is doing is rule matching it's matching parts of the sentence to things that already knows to keep the conversation going so it's going to grab parts of the sentence and replace that little placeholder with that sentence part but we'll figure out how how to do that a little later so I'm going to keep going one thing I want to do is see if anybody is a little lost is anybody have any questions okay you people know so little I love I like you guys alright I'm gonna add that what did I mean at the end of this this alien may not want our resources okay um one thing that I'm doing to that you guys may not be noticing but at the end of every one of these on responses I am putting a space just so that it doesn't look weird when we have it in our terminal so that's a good practice just so that the next sentence can start properly I really like some of these responses open brace oh thank you see ah yes thank you for catching that typo one question chat bars are hard coded with sentences like this few strings so that was the issue with Eliza and issue with her alien BOTS is that it is pretty hard coded so at the end of the day if we start asking questions that hour of chat bot doesn't know how to answer it's gonna get really bro body that's why I can't pass the Turing test because it really isn't as smart and capable of thinking like a human being it's just capable of matching things to things it already knows anything else let's do this all right let's move on we're gonna move on to sorry we're gonna move on to set two so we're gonna define the greeting for greet you should be at line 69 ish that's where I am where we have a comment saying define the greet function below define greet parentheses below here we're going to create a function so we want to start off defining the function function name is greet parentheses we have the colons following next we want to greet our user so let's start off just saying hey what's your name name equals we want it to be an input and whatever the user says following what do they call you once again I'm putting that space at the end so that it's formatted properly so after we we have our name variable we want to use that name will say will help sorry will underscore help equals that whatever the input of hi I'm so two questions for you guys first of all what should we name our alien let's see what shall the aliens name be oh boy he knows fight me oh boy hmm I feel like we need something out of this world they knows it's kind of out of this world but I also don't want they knows coming to visit earth like that that's not a good look for all of us not an alien matricula I this creatures Marvin because apparently they have very English names on whatever planet Marvin is from let's go hi hi I'm Marvin let's have Marvin what if we had Marvin talked back to us now we have Marvin saying hey I'm Marvin will you help me but Marvin is really trying to make friends and he wants to get to know your name so let's put in a little placeholder right here because we want him to say hi soandso I'm Marvin for grammatical reasons let's move that comma in order to add the name to this we need to use the format method inside the format method we'll say name this way where the placeholder is will now be filled with the name variable so when I say hi i'm kyla he'll say hi Kyla I'm Marvin cool any questions on that I think we're pretty straightforward so far um next oh you know what I did forgot a parenthesis there we are cool next we're gonna have to use an if statement now if statements are conditionals they say if this condition is true then do that if it's false do something else that's if using else but we're not going to use an else we just want it if if this condition is true something else is gonna happen if will underscore help is inside of the negative response this is sorry then we want it to do something this is saying if whatever their response to hi will you help me if that response is inside of negative responses like no na any negative of command then we they don't want to talk to us so we want to exit this so we will respond saying print okay have a great Earth Day and then we will return that function and that will be that but if they don't say no and if they give us something positive then we'll return true and keep moving throughout this um throughout their own code so I'm gonna add the end of this change alien bot to greet so we can run this let's run it just to try it out I want to say pythons three once again script dot py to run this we have an issue invalid syntax on line 72 what I do wrong we have will help input hi help me for my name interesting ah the issue is right here I should not have this parenthesis here I made a mistake in line 72 after that Coach ate that quotation mark the format should be attached to the string that's very important so if you got the same error I did go into lion 70 to get rid of that parenthesis you want your for your format being directly appended to the string so that it knows that this is the placeholder that name is supposed to fit in then you should have two parentheses after the word name a parenthesis a close name a parenthesis close the input let's run this again there we are what do they call you they call me Kyla hi Kyla I'm Marvin will you help me no and exits now if I try this again if I try this again I have cool so it's waiting on another command because it doesn't know what to do yet so let's let it know what to do we just made we just got through our steps two three and four and five we're moving we tested greet in step six so now we should be onto step seven does anybody have any specific questions let me check I did it exit instead of printing the negative response because the negative the negative response is being taken from the user me so I put in a negative response and it knew that I don't want to help it so it can leave the program there was nothing to be printed in that situation what was being printed out was asking me for my name and saying hello will you help me after I say no it doesn't want anything to do with me anymore but if I say yes if you notice there's a space right before we have we restart the program that's simply because it doesn't have steps on what to do next so we're going to get started on that in these next few steps any other pressing questions let's see we can't add lower I did not add the lower we can do that yeah thank you alright so in step seven next up define make exit and give what give it one parameter reply this function will check if a user wants to exit the chat bar or not so we already have the responses no but what if somebody says goodbye what if somebody says what else do we have here in this one we have in our exit commands quit pause exit the user just can't talk right now so we need the alien to know how to leave a conversation like that too so I'm going to go right under that comment define make exit function here and I'm going to define make exit cool after that I'm going to we're going to want to loop through our exit commands so we want to check against the user respond and check the user response against What's in exit commands we want to see if it's saying pause exit by so for exit command in exit commands we want it to do something now that thing that we wanted to do is exit one more time so we're also going to have that if conditional if exit command if exit command in reply print once again okay have a great oh I see what someone was asking earlier about printing yes you are right Chloe P chalupa and Kayla yes okay I'm sorry that that lost you let's talk about it in just a second because that is a problem let's figure this out so we have earlier it did not print if will help and negative responses have interesting ah so the issue here is what that I use the capital no when we don't have a capital no in our exit commands so this is where the lower would come in I'm very sorry you guys were definitely having a whole conversation about that but it's hard to look at the little of the screens at once so what do they call you let's love cool let's use that lower I said here I believe let's run this this is where my Python may be rusty so let's find out guys okay what do they call me they call me Kyla well I help you if I say no there we are that is I you guys have some fun names yes thank you Z Z Kiwi bluebirds thank you for that so what it's pretty much doing with that lower method is saying that whatever that response is just make it lower all lowercase so that it matches these exit commands since all of them are lowercase we didn't want to go in and say no no uppercase no no lowercase no no all capitalized it's hard to go in and list every single option for an exit command so it's easier to just make whatever the to read whatever the user says as lowercase using the lower method lower method cool that isn't there are many ways to do it so if you find another way to do it that I didn't do here please share because it'd be really great to get to test out different methods for getting the same thing done especially if it's a more optimal method you're welcome Caleb sorry about that okay so I will go through what we've done so far we had our greet that greet now how's the lower method if that will help is a negative responses it will print okay have a great Earth Day if not it will return true and keep moving through the code let me make a change here because I realize that's a mistake next we have the make exit function for an exit command and exit commands we will check to see if that exit command is inside of the reply from the user and if it is we will print okay have a great Earth Day return that function if not we will return true once again to keep moving through the function or at the whole program sorry there is a slight issue I for I didn't put the reply perimeter in now it's really important that you have that reply parameter inside of make exit that is pretty much taking the reply from the user or whatever is given from the user and running it through this function if we don't have it there it's not going to know what it's running make exit on or so yes getting an error thank you okay so once we've done that you want to make our alien bot function next so we've done steps eight we're now at step nine so let's create that alien bot function we have we are defining that alien mode function here that alien bot function is going to be used to create an alien bot to continue the conversation if the users response is not negative or an exit reply so in this situation if greet let's say it's the greet function if that is true in this situation when we say in that conditional if something it's just saying is this a truthy situation or a true situation for those of you know JavaScript know why I just did that sorry okay so in this situation reply equals input we want another input and in this situation what we want to do is take that reply from the user and figure out if it's and take it and have it be an answer to from one of our random questions we have a list of random questions that the user could possibly ask us we want to keep the conversation going if they ask us those questions so we're going to use our random library in this case to randomly choose one of the questions to ask random that choice using the choice method you have a random question let's make sure we use that lower this time so if you remember up at the top these are the random questions we can ask to keep the conversation going after the user has agreed to talk to us you need to ask them something new so that they we can keep going back and forth with one another so we're doing in that line is taking a random question any random question at random from this lift this tubble we have right here next once that is done we are going to loop again while it's not a make exit we want to apply pools so so in this line and these two lines what we're saying is if it's not inside a if it's not an exit command as make exit will check for then we want the reply to now be the come in Converse function with the reply parameter I'm so sorry guys sorry okay so in this situation we don't have the comment converse function yet what we want to do is create that next but this alien bot function but this alien bot function is going to keep a conversation going before we get to that point so now we've done the step 9 10 and 11 so now it's time to get to number 12 defining the converse function once again we want to use reply as a parameter to run the function on and inside we want to iterate through each response pair an alien Babel so if you guys remember we made this lovely beautiful tuple of dictionaries called alien Babel inside of a dictionary you have your first part your key you have that colon and then we have a value following in this situation are we have multiple values that we can choose from what we're going to do is look through a user's response to check to see if it is matching to a key inside of alien Babel and if it is will produce one of these values for example if the user says something about the aliens planet hey what's your planet like we respond with one of the values my value my my planet is a utopia of diverse organisms and species so let's make something like that happen this is where things get fun so for a pair an alien Babel we want to Luke one more time saying for let's call it a regex pattern and an alien alien answers in pair items what we're doing here is we're saying for regex patterns which is the key of the dictionaries comma alien answers which are the values inside of that dictionary as well like your planet as the key and my planet is a utopia and whatever else we set as possible responses as the values those values we are calling alien answers inside pair dot items what we're doing is we're taking that pair and where you're putting items method on it the items method returns a view object that displays a list of given dictionaries keys and values as tuple pairs now what we're gonna say is found a score match so let's call it found match when we find the match we're using the regex library here what we want to do is say re dot match the regex library with the match method let's match the regex reply or the key I'm sorry the regex pattern or the key to the reply look and this is pretty much looking for the key like your pattern inside of the users response or reply after that we'll say if found match if this is true then alien underscore answer the aliens response is going to be once again let's make a random choice if I could spell from alien underscore answers ooh all caps is not a good look alien underscore answers or the values so at random we're choosing between in our example we're choosing between my planet is a utopia and I am from if I am from whatever planet you choose to call it it's randomly choosing between the two so that we can keep the conversation fun whenever it says your planet it will only choose between the two values that are associated with that key let's get back down to our converse function that we're working through and once we have done this we want our reply to be an input of alien underscore answer well does anybody have any questions yeah once we do that we are going to return reply let's see seems like we're good on questions so far but once again we have our moderators if anything so in this situation we have our aliens response our alien is able to keep a count start the conversation up after the user has agreed to help them and it's able to keep the conversation going based off of whatever the user responds so let's run this well but before we run it we need to make a change the very last line we changed it to the greet function so that we could see greet but now we want to check on the alien by function all together so now let's run this Python 3 script py what do they call me Kyla hi Kyle I'm Marvin will you help me yes there's an issue random question is not defined so let's go up to check on line 89 so what my error is telling me is that the random question is not defined and I know exactly why that is that is because if I correct our variable is random questions not question so let's make them s if you guys did make that mistake yourselves you want to go into that line line 89 and change that to an S at the end it's all about the small details so let's get back into our terminal after we fixed that and what do they call me Kyla will I help yes hi Kyla I'm Marvin will you help me yes what planets have I have only visited earth see it did not keep going so there is an issue here after it asked that first random question it's supposed to take what I have and keep going with it but it didn't really have anything to say because it doesn't know what to say if I didn't use one of the keys in the dictionaries so we need to fix this now we're at line steps 13 by the way take a look at alien babbling n each response pair is a dictionary with a regex pattern as the key and a tuple as a poly possible alien answer as the value we want to see if any of these regex patterns match the user reply base pass into the function iterate through each regex pattern we did this part already sorry scroll cool so now we're at 18 wait a minute you may be thinking what about integrating reflections into our chat so at this point we've given it the opportunity to look given it the ability sorry to look through the different tuples and dictionaries we have that make matches but if our what we said is not a direct match then we have to keep the conversation going anyway so so we want to fix our sentence here in line in step 18 so that it reads different parts of our sentences and grep changes the pronouns so that it can respond back to us like for example in this situation I said I have only visited earth it should be able to respond back you have only visited earth swapping that key in that value the only way we can do this is to add to change up our converse function so that it reads things a little differently and uses our reflect function that's at the end of our program that reflects function is pretty much taking the words that we provide to the alien by splitting them up so it looks at each one as a different word instead of one whole sentence and it tries to match our words the words in the reflections dictionary so it should be taking the eye and putting it through reflect and giving back are you in order to do this we need to change line 100 it might be a different line for you but a mine is 100 where pi equals the input alien underscore answer dot lower method we want to get rid of that and what we want to do is use a formatted alien answer what we want to do is take a lien answer format it and we want to use that asterisk as four zero or more instances if there are zero or more instances of a reflection we want to make something happen we are cool so what we're gonna do is take zero or more occurrences to be added as a string from a list which is why we have our square brackets here inside of our square brackets we're going to say reflect because we want to use our reflect function at the bottom of our program and inside and reflect let's call the parameter matching group after that we're going to say for every function reflect matching group we want to take matching group in sound match dot cool so in this situation reflects which is the users words for the aliens response with the parameter a matching group or the users response and what we're doing is matching it against that that sound match which is when our regex library is matching the users response to the key inside of the alien Babel temple the dictionary in the alien Babel temple okay let's run that and let's try this again let's call Python 3 script py what do they call me Kyla hi Kyle I'm Marvin will you help me yes yes I will help you Marvin does earth have a leader yes well we have many leaders on ok so now we have a different problem this may be an issue my code because it should keep the conversation going so let's figure out what is going on here I believe that it's an issue in my converse function let me dive in to check that out because the conversation should keep going so I have just I'm defining my function converse with a parameter of reply for a pair inside of alien Babel we want to take the regex pattern or key and the alien answers or the values and the pair and use the item methods on that we want to have a found match variable which is the match between a regex pattern and the users reply and if found match is true you want to take the alien answer and have that equal a random choice from alien answers be the values in the dictionaries what's line one on one returning hmm it should be returning reply so this is where our issues thank you who's he Ziqi bluebirds it's really coming in so I think the issue here is that I had it it was an entry with my indenting I believe because what was happening is it was only returning the reply if it was in if it if it was a found match but if it's not a match we still want to return a reply so let's try this run this now that I've removed one indent from line 101 return reply let's see here they call me Kyla you have to help are there humans like me yes plenty up still not responding let me try this one more time to see if it's something I'm doing hmm that's not it yes Tom 203 I'm having the same problem but we're working through it right now to try to figure out what is up it should not be exiting after you type work yes so oh well it's exiting after you type yes well that issue must be inside of your exit so since you're not do you have returned true on the same indentation line as your if statements inside of greet and inside of make exit that's something you may want to check out okay this could be an issue too while like this converse reply that is passing which line is that you're referring to Benjamin Button I don't think we should be returning upon I believe it's in this situation we do the reply is the reply is the parameter yeah the argument but in this situation we do want to return a new let's just try it out why not no that's not the that is not saving it I think that in this situation we do want a return reply because our reply is what our function is like looking for reading yeah we're changing that definition in this situation one sec I'm gonna try and then this I'm gonna put this back where it was and start from where I was at and I'm just saying so the issue is here what I needed to do is take that reply and change it inside and what I was missing was sorry I'm reading what you guys are saying so what I was missing was that reply input formatted formatted alien answer so what we need to do is take that as a response so there's a new reply we need to give our alien things to respond with even if I've answered the last question if that makes sense let's run this and if that didn't make sense ask a question so we can clarify cool this should work now no that is strange I want to look through each one of my functions to make sure that I'm not missing any small parts and so inside of my my converse function I have four pair in alien battle for a regex pattern or key and an alien answers value and the pair with items method attached to it and I have found match equaling the right match method from the re library taking the arguments of regex pattern and reply or the key and the user's response after that I say if that found match is true alien answer should be a random choice from the alien answers couple then I say formatted alien answer equals the alien answered dot format taking matched groups as matching groups from the reflect function through the reflection function sorry for a matching group inside of found match groups after that I'm replying my reply is the input from a formatted alien answer in lowercase and I'm returning reply let us run this I have visited and it's closing again let me try my what would it say if I said are there humans like you what if I said I think now I'm taking something from our alien Babel temple one of the dictionary keys we had if the user says I think that starts at lying 51 so I wouldn't start off the sentencing I think I think sorry there are humans like me still not taking it this is strange yes oh my god yeah no girl this is half my day he's trying to figure out what's wrong with something this is honestly the programming life it's really about being really detailoriented and finding out what's up and I mean in most cases too we pair program all the time working with other people for those moments where you're staring at your code and it's gonna make you a crazy person so this is completely natural if you're doing this at home working on our platform like you are fine you're fine so let's figure this out together let's see Griet is working fine we know that we know make exit was working let's check that one more time just to just do just to see sorry I restarted there but everything's all done they call me Kyla if I say no I don't want to help you it says have a great birthday great run let's run this one more time with a exit command if I say my name is Kyla and if I say bye it keeps asking me questions so we do have an issue and make exit that issue is the lower once again I believe because it's inside capital goodbye or is that the issue if I tried if I tried lowercase exit hmm we do have an issue there now is that because of our make function or make exit function or is that because of our alien bot function well for every exit command inside of every command if I'd say command is in the reply which in this case there is an exit command in your pie and it's not lowercase so I probably need to add that lower let's test it out get a little crazy I'm not sure if I can't go this is my sorry I should be saying bye cool so it exits but now it's not printing that's strange okay we have a great have a great Earth Day return return true is there a way to make low apply across all of the code so it doesn't well someone did pull up earlier let me go back and it's my code someone did mentions to using will help hmmm let's look at that and then I'm gonna try something else it's not it's far up but someone did mention if you have the time to look through the comments that you can attach it to you can't attach it to function and you made his work oh my god Andrew tell us what did you do if actually well you guys decide if he should tell you what he did that's up to you guys I don't want to take away the challenge for me if you want to be challenged um now one thing I'm thinking about doing is printing reply just to see what reply is because it seems like let's print reply before we go to Congress actually so I can see that's applied before converse so if I run it my ninety two's not defined can't reply to so I should be inside of sorry reply inside of alien by I want it to be not inside of the wire loop not inside of the let me place it here we'll help you well let's say yes first just looking princess okay so it is taking it so my reply is the reply in this situation so that is working what if I want to know how to apply in Congress though so for alien babble today uh let's say let's say before if found match we're trying to apply this to fields going on in here they call me Kyle oh yes what technology we have we have instagrams pretty cool cool it's not into my reply it did not print my reply here so let's try it before we return it hmm it's not 20 instead of wile not and a lien by trying to see what are we saying you should try without violence I'd ever thought not let's take it out riding and for those of you who are following along I just took the not out of line number 90 this earth have a leader yes please come whoo okay um thank you who said that first I don't know who said that first closedloop uh I think she or he said it first and it worked nine ninety Andrew Wilson also mentioned it thank you to all of you guys who mentioned that it did work for me so please tell me more is working let's um this is the part that everyone fears it's like okay I got one thing working is something new broken if I say bye yeah it's not taking it but that's okay let's see let's before I like I did this I just want to see what is working so if I say I think I know a lot about Earth will it pick up on the fact that I'm saying I think yes so that is working if I say what is your planet like is it picking up on your planet it's beautiful so our issue here is that it's not taking our exit commands that is our only problem that's good let's figure that out and thank you guys so much for your help that's you guys are awesome let's see make exit apply for exit command and exit commands if exit man is a lower and reply print okay have a great Earth Day return return true so it is and exit command is lower and reply let's see what's up here let's see maybe it's because I added this know that look I do you feel like I added lower in a real weird place but I don't believe that's what's breaking it I'm gonna keep it for now I don't believe that's what's breaking it now I use a command if exit command is an exit reply makes sense cool but for exit command and exit commands is it looping properly I think this is what our issue is here so so I don't think we want a second return sure we just want to return true because I believe what's happening is because the return truth outside of the if condition it was continuing regardless where as it should be inside so it continues on with the code should return false in the if statement so let's try Shane let's try true because I believe that what we want to do what since what we want to do is keep the code going we should keep true there whereas if we return false that would mean that if will help is inside a negative negative response then it's I don't think I explained that well let's let's let's play around let's check faults and see what happens if we write as false let's try running this code again by what you can never exit but no in this situation what you want to do is hey say clear oh god no it's not or what you want to do is just refresh it because I'm copypasting just to make sure just in case something did not say properly but it should have yes it did cool after I refreshed it I'm gonna run it again um I'm going to say Python 3 script dot py cool what do they call me they call me Kyla okay will I help you yes I will hmm let's try this again they call me Kyla will I help you by new issues that I made for myself I think that that return false is not the way we want to go because I think that what's happening is since we're returning false it's just exiting regardless that's not what we want let's say true it's always good to try things out and just to see cuz you never know um well there's ways to find out but it's always good to find out from trying things and seeing playing around with your code seeing how it works so now that we're doing return true instead in line 75 let's try this out what do they call me Kyla will I help you yes hmm I run this properly clear that's when you want to use clear when you use clear it'll get rid of everything you had so we don't have anything confusing us later on down the line let's try this one more time and they call me Kyla will I help you yes it's exiting you know what I think we need to do is go back into that wild that we had and put that knock back so in line 89 we have while not make exit because what we're doing right now is before without the knot it was looping through that wild or some function and what was happening was regardless once again it was just kicking us out so let's say while it's not make exit let's keep the conversation going so if it's it is kyla and we are not exiting we're saying yes it should keep going one would think let's see yes I will interesting no doesn't like that else Falls hmm and greet turn if if statement is okay oh sorry that's fine return true online eightytwo delete line eightythree what's up there Oh tonight gosh yes okay so let's get rid of this just to see thank you Andrew Wilson Bruce Williams that's what mine is doing you're sucking I guess so we're gonna try this first I'm gonna try what Andrew suggested in line 82 if that's not it I'm going to check out this great situation that we're talking about here because that also seems plausible let's see kyla will you help me yes laughs I'm gonna keep this like this there's Dan there are definitely quite a few ways to do this so take a moment what is wrong so in greet its taking my name it's including my name and asking me a question for will help now if will help my response to will help which is my yes here if that is a negative responses it's a print okay have a great Earth Day and return true I think that part of the issue might be because we did not tell it hmm we did not tell it we told it to return true but we didn't tell it what to do if will help is not so let's just return that return okay have a good day print that return it if will help us in negative responses but if it's not we should return true to keep the function and keep the program growing this is my assumption let's try that my name is Kyla cool will I help you yes I will help you beautiful awesome all right Thank You G Wilson thank you think back victor dictator return poses let's let's um let's see if by works first of all okay have a great Earth Day cool it's clear this just so I can look at a blank slate so I don't go crazy Python three script dot py what do they call me they call me Kyla that part works will I help you yes why are you here I think I am here here because I have a purpose let's get roadies oh wow and that's a great question because my mom great why Wow eyes are really coming for my life um why because my mom loves me let's ask it a question since it's so nosy why are you here I come in peace that's good you know I think you're friendly why do you think I'm friendly well you haven't attacked me why do you say that I feel safe why interesting can you tell me more cool now let's say I have to go and I can't finish this conversation and I say bye okay have a great Earth Day our chat bot is working whoo mmhmm okay anybody have any questions we're at how about I just go through what we just did a lot just happen but we made it work and also if you're not you have something that's not working pay attention right now this will be a good time to figure out if there's a difference between our code so we started off we have our regex library we have a random library we have negative responses we have exit commands we have some random questions to start the conversation we have an empty string called name that's going to take our name obviously and we have our Babel temple with a bunch of dictionaries in it and we created those dictionaries I'm taking using regex say taking parts of our user responses and coming up with responsive alien responses to what the user could have possibly said let's move through that we have a bunch of them and the very end we have some other responses and that is a catchall for like if there's anything I said that is not in a key above then we can just give them something like this like interesting can you tell me more cool keep on going now we have our functions that we created let's go through them we have our greet function our greet function takes the name and changes it based off of what these are input is to what do they call you after that we have will help which is also an input it takes the hi I'm Marvin will you help me and adds our name into it with a format but we want it to be lower so that regardless of what the capitalization was on the users end it works it can read it properly after that we say if will help the answer to will help the input is a negative responses so it's something like no we will print okay have a great Earth Day and that will be the end of that but if not we have our return true here that keeps the conversation going if they say something that's not a negative command like yes after that we have our make exit function make f it takes a parameter of reply so that reply I think there was some confusion about reply that reply in the situation is the users response just so you know so this function is running on the users response if so now we're gonna loop through exit commands if exit command is in exit commands cool for exit command sorry for each exit command in egg the commands we want to say if that exit command fan lowercase is in reply the users response then print have a great day because they don't want to talk to us it's not I'm and then return true this one was a little funky I think there was a little bit of confusion in that return true section like that that if conditional so we have our exit command from exit commands like no no no whatever else we said in there so if there is a lowercase version of exit command in the users reply we wanna print okay have a great day after that we say return true and that return true that return true is in this situation that return true will happen okay it will allow us to exit if we want to exit that's what it's doing okay so because I if my exit command is inside a reply a prints have a great Earth Day but we don't want the function to keep going so return true sits inside of that of conditional cool after that we have alien bot a function alien body this is with moving through the conversation so if greet is the reply if greet is true sorry so if we have that return true because we've decided that because we decided that will help us not and negative response if greet is true we will the reply will equal an input of random choice from random questions lowercase so random questions is a couple we had earlier with questions like can you tell me more or why we want to randomly choose from that and whatever the users input is is our new reply or our new user response after that we have wild not make exit reply once again we're taking that user response and putting it inside an argument in the make exit function while it is not make route make reply exit is not true then we want the reply to go into the function argument to change the you the reply again I'm gonna break that down one thing that was clear so our make exit function as long as it's not true as long as the users response is not an exit command then our reply is going to go through the next function reply converse and it is going to change what the reply is by scrolling scrolling for every pair in alien Babel which is our temple of a bunch of keys and values possible things that the user could say and things that we could respond to you for the regex patterns the this is representing our keys comet alien answers which is representing our values in paired items that items method once again that items method is which is important to know because we never want to be using things you don't understand items method is returning a view object that displays a list of a given dictionaries key and value Temple pair so what it's pretty much doing is giving us the ability to look at the regex pattern as the keys and the alien answers as the values cool when we're making that we're leaping through that so we're trying to find matches we're trying to match using the regex library in the match method we're trying to match those regex patterns or keys to the users response we're looking for those parts of the sentence that we listed earlier and trying to see if it's inside of the response if the found match is true then we want to take alien answer and make it equal a random choice from alien answers for those values that are associated with the key after that which we needed to change up our alien answer so that eyes become use use become eyes we change up the pronouns of things and by doing it we did that by saying alien answers dot format with that the alien answers dot format with the format method to take the asterisks which says zero or more occurrences and running match groups as an argument through reflect or matching groups and found matched groups we're taking like the Matt we're taking the match from of the keys out and then we are also taking what is left over from that sentence and using it as its own group so that we have a formatted alien answer we're taking what was also said with any eyes and used and changing them using the reflect function we're pretty much just changing up the sentence and delivering it to them in a new way which is why we take the format and alien answer we take the input of that and to make that the new response the new user responds so whatever they reply to our formatted alien answer is the new user response then we return the reply cool and at the end of this code we have our reflections listed out turning I am you are and you're I'm and all of that and then after that we have that reflect function that we use earlier which is splitting the words apart and looking around for the AIIMS and czars they use to switch them around and then after that we call our alien bot function whoo and line 131 131 lines of Python code not bad for a JavaScript programmer not bad at all so we did it we did it guys hopefully your code is matching this if not we have the this link that you guys are using and messing around with it is available for you guys to play around with in your spare time try to get things right I believe that you guys can find the solution to this if you guys really wanted to on the platform but I always suggest like play around with it try not to use the solution unless you really really really are stuck and Google is your friend honestly Google is your friend what else so now that we've done that and you guys have played around with this this is kind of what like to go through natural language processing in a way this is a really introductory basic version of processing human language so that machines understand that and can even respond to it and I would suggest if this is stuff that's really interesting to you you should enroll in our data science path luckily for you I'm not writing that content but the people who are are brilliant and they are creating really cool things so join that path join that path if you're interested in data science machine learning natural language processing we are constantly putting out courses too so you'll learn something new like as you moves through the path and I mean like honestly it took us a while to do this but no one else has to know show your friends this cool pad Python chat bot that she just made and they're gonna think you're a genius because you are you did this so after that if there's anything else you want to do check out our blog we have some really really interesting articles one of them involves Taylor Swift and they are it's information about data science analyzing information sifting through social media sites we did a really cool live last week if you ever want to check that out all those things are available on our site on our blog news code Kadim ecomm yeah and if you thought this was cool look out first and natural language processing courses that are coming out soon there should be some really great stuff coming your way and look out for our next live we'll be doing these more often I believe so you can definitely check out different projects we're working on here and work alongside us or learn how to do something on different platforms so thank you for joining me once again I'm Kaila I am a curriculum developer here at code Cata me and you and I just made a Python chat bot it's pretty cool I am gonna go if you guys have any last questions feel free to go in the chat and if you guys have any suggestions go in the chat we have a survey let us know what you think if you let us know if there's any types of courses or things you'd like us to walk through that we haven't yet we'd love the suggestions and thank you for watching along yeah I'm going to end this now bye
