hello my name is Farish I'm not Micallef or Nia bass developer and over the last few years api s have become increasingly commonplace so in this video we're going to talk about what our api is and what are some of the reasons why API SAR being used to start things off let's go for what API stands for and it stands for application programming interface and you can think of this as a contract for software to communicate with each other well what do I mean by this statement like a real contract there's a set of rules that as a developer you have to follow as long as you follow the rules the API will talk to your software usually in the case of returning some data if you don't follow the rules the API won't send you back what you expected and in most cases will break your application now this allows your software components to communicate with the API components now you may be wondering where does this contract come from well the API developers created the contract when they made the API and these roles are the instructions given on how to use the API in the API documentation and the one thing that really isn't mention is that in most cases this is a onesided contract you have to follow the rules given you can't make your own so how does this API communication process work well out there there's a server and on the server is a database ain't connected to that database is an API and you can kind of think of the API like a gateway you as a developer and through your client communicate through the API the Gateway sentient requests to the server the server that connects to the database and returns to the data you request it back to your client you can also think of this like being at a restaurant the menu is your contract it gives you what you can order specifically from the API and then you see your requests through your API gateway which in this case you can think of as your waiter and the waiter goes to the chef which you can think of as the server and the database is the ingredients that he has access to and the chef will take out certain ingredients makes your meal which you can think of as your API requests and give it back to your waiter the waiter then heads to your table and delivers it to you and at that point you have to decide how to consume it and what I mean by how to consume it is you have to take this data and manipulate it and present it or do something with it now we're gonna go over a realworld example by looking at yelps API we're gonna go through the documentation and do a simple request but maybe that'll give you idea of what's going on here and how you would interact with a API in general now I'm over here at yelps documentation page and to get started I'm gonna click on get started and it's gonna bring you to the manage app page and what you see here is there's some Florida of items for security reasons so the main one that's poured out is my API key now if I didn't have a app here it would give you option to create an app and I just wanted to let you know that but you should always protect your API key and I want to emphasize that if you give out your API key and it's a paid service malicious actors might use it on their own behalf and rig up thousands of thousands of dollars in charges and I've heard of these stories before on the internet so it's pretty crucial to avoid giving out your API key now there's a lot of information here at the documentation and you can see that all on the Left menu plus different guides and a platform and everything but we're going to do a basic API request and all we need to do is go through the introduction page so I'm gonna click on that what you see here is a list of different end points so there's a business search a phone search a transaction search and others but what we're gonna start with this the basics so let's go with the first search item which is a business search and there's a lot of information here but let's start from the top what we want to focus on is the request and if you see it says get and it gives you this long URL that's your URL to make your API requests and right below that is your parameters and I want to focus on the first two so the first one is term and if you notice on the right side there's a description and it tells you that this is optional but it also gives you examples on how to use this which is pretty crucial here then the second one is location and it will emphasize that it's required but you could use longitude or latitude instead and that's not something most normal people do so we're gonna stick with location and we're just gonna use like a city named specifically Los Angeles believe her or not with the API key we have enough information to run our first API requests so I want to move into an interactive coding environment into that so you could see what the results look like so I'm over here in repple and what I've done is I've written a JavaScript fetch requests and what I want to emphasize here is that you could use any language you like this is what I'm comfortable with but because you may be programming into Python Ruby or other languages I'm not gonna go into the nittygritty of exactly how this works but I did want to point out that over here in this fetch request I do have the base URL that's listed I also included term and location as it was mentioned in the documentation I'm also passing over my API key and without these four items this wouldn't work so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead and he run and what I'm searching for here is Mexican and Los Angeles some looking for Mexican food in Los Angeles I'm gonna hit run and it's gonna take a second and also now I have this information over here and this is all the results given to me from Yelp for Mexican restaurants in Los Angeles and if you notice it's coming back as a JSON object and there's a lot of information here addresses names phone numbers whether they deliver but the most important thing here is something I mentioned earlier in the video that you need to take this data and consume it you have to manipulate it in any format you need to in order to have this be presented on your website and this is where API could be handy because it adds extra functionality to your website that you didn't have the program for outside of the API request I've talked a lot about what our API is and how do they work but I haven't brought up why companies like Yelp would offer one so let's take a few minutes to discuss that now many companies that you use behind the scenes have an API there runs their system some of them like Yelp offer their API so the public well why is that every company has different reasons but in yelps case it's to expand their reach they offer advertisements services to restaurants the more websites that use their data the higher advertisement rates take in charge now other companies offer api's as a software as a service you pay for the API because they believe what they offer will be cheaper than what you or your company will pay to develop it on their own Twilio is a great example of this scenario they offer voice over IP SMS and other communication services and unlike many other api providers that only charge a monthly Phee Twilio charges each time their API service issues every phone call every text every communication through to Leo's API results in a fee and you may be wondering how they can get away with this pricing structure and be successful well in this scenario the infrastructure costs of building a communication network is very high so instead of you or your company having to build this whole network and maintain it you're reducing your cost by using Julio's API and if you think about it with technology having so many startups costs is a major factor when you're looking for funds from investors the last reason why companies use API s is because it offers a easy path for expansion and what I mean by that is that api's are designed to deliver data regardless of the platform so if you're working for a company and they start off with a website as long as it was built with the API behind the scenes you can easily transfer that data to mobile simply by calling the API that code that I had showed earlier to make the API request will work on a webpage or on a react native app I don't have to reinvent the wheel just so I can have seamless data integration between my web platform and my mobile platform so these are just a few of the reasons why API sar use so let's do a quick recap and move on to the end of the video now first I went over what is API and I called it a contract for data second I talked about why companies use api's but the overall theme is that they reduce costs lastly I just like to remind you that learning about api's is a good thing to add to your developers toolbox thanks for watching now if you want to take your API skills to the next level head on over to code
