My name is Kate. I'm an artist, a mom to three boys, and a Software Developer. I was a stayathome mom for a long time. Sitting at home with this little baby and I couldn't really do a whole lot, and I thought, "I wonder how websites are made?" I went to the library and I got a kid's book on HTML. And I was just curious. What makes this image be in this part of the page? What makes this background color that way? I was totally hooked. I was like, "Woah! That's really cool!" I love marrying my hobbies together or building a program to support a different hobby. This right here, I actually wrote a program to help me put this together. I crocheted a whole bunch of squares and I didn't want the same color to touch on the side or the corner. And so I wrote a program in Ruby, and then I used that as a guide for putting my quilt together. I think I was on the edge of this cliff of possibilities. Like, "Wow, this is so cool! There's so many things I can still learn and keep doing here." I used Codecademy to make sure that I had a strong foundation moving forward. And then recently, I learned React. You know, that's a hot, new language, it's really marketable. I find it really, really rewarding to be employed as a Programmer — that is my income that's supporting my family, that's keeping a roof over our head. I learned this because I wanted to, not because that was my major. You don't need to be in college, you don't need a degree. You can just start — wherever you are, whatever you know, whatever you're doing — you can be whatever you want. Start programming.
