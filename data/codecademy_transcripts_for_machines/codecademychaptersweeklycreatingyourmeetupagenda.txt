everyone it's me again elisa uh i said last week that every week i'd like to hop in with a little bit of encouragement or like a tip for community building and this week i'd like to talk about agendas and creating your agendas and i didn't just pull that out of nowhere there was a few of you that actually were asking about like well what should we do and like how do we organize this and that's such a good question it's um it's not straightforward so i'm i'd like to say that for those of you who are just creating your first meetups let your first meet up be about getting to know your first people because they're going to be so important to your your chapter's health and growth um and just listen so if you if you must and i think it's a good idea to like for your for your creating your first meet up to have an agenda you can ha say 15 minutes for intros x amount like the bulk amount of your time for um an info gathering or for just making decisions about what it is you want to do as a chapter and then a wrapup time so that's a threepart pretty solid template for what you can imagine a first meetup to be and then as your second meetup gets underway you'll have a bit more of an idea of what your group of people actually want to do so you can be more descriptive in your on your page for your chapter and on your meetup page um a really good example he's not gonna love that i'm calling this out i don't care is to look at the denver meetup that michael bragg is hosting michael bragg is a master online community builder i've been working with him actually for two years in the codecademy community and he is the guy to look to for how to engage a group of people around code uh so for a good example of what a solid agenda and meetup page looks like just check out michael braggs for for the denver group and then once you've got a groove going for your meetup you should not should i like that word you will probably at that point know like what a solid agenda is and also don't be afraid to iterate um it won't always be the same the template probably will um striking the balance between rituals so that your members know what it is that they generally get when they show up and iterating so that we're not sticking to something that doesn't feel right for your chapters most of this is gonna sound like common sense because it is um i think sometimes it's also just nice to hear that you're on the right track and that you knew how to do this all along um the last thing about setting an agenda that i wish i would have known when i was starting to uh host meetups is as a leader bacon time for the after meetup chat so if yours is like 6 30 p.m to 8 30 p.m on a thursday just like set aside 8 30 to 8 45 or 8 30 to 9 there will inevitably be somebody who had an experience at your meet up and wants to talk to you about it or has an idea um or like wants to engage a little bit more it's fine if you can't talk to them with that at that time of course it's absolutely amazing if you're if you're already baked in that time and you're just relaxed and you're like yeah let's keep talking um everybody enjoys it so i hope this was helpful i'm gonna keep doing this um love talking about this stuff always at any time i can't wait to see more of your chapters and i hope you all have a great week thank you
