in this video I'd like to talk about CSS selectors now of course CSS is key to styling HTML pages and selectors are key to CSS CSS is what makes it possible to selectively style an individual element and completely ignore the other ones on the on that page and one of the mechanisms that support this architecture is of course the selector selectors are are actually patterns that developers can use to Target certain elements that they wish to style so in HTML whenever we code an element there are usually lots of other attributes and values and things like that we put alongside the name of the of the HTML tag itself so for example we we can attach a class to a particular element we can attach an ID and name these are all selectors but what I want to focus on in this video are those attribute equal values those attributes that we add to HTML elements those are not so common and but they provide excellent value when it comes to selecting things on a webpage so whenever we have an element and we have some kind of an attribute attached to that element we can or just simply looking or searching for that attribute it is already a selector in itself so for example we might be searching for all of the classes that that exist on the page and if there is a class then we can apply a particular style to it or we can search for IDs Etc there we can search specific value that that attribute has so for example the attribute is on the left the value is on the right and we can search for all of those elements that have that specific value we can even search with a wildcard value so for example if an attribute exists on the page and it contains a few letters let's say then we can search for anything with the value that has those letters in it now the wildcard value is very similar to searching for a specific value inside of a list so for example we may have a particular pattern of letters that we're looking for and we're simply searching to see if that exists so so value in the list and wildcard value are very similar we can also search for a particular pattern that starts the value part of the attribute so for example if it starts with the letter v a l then we know that we want to select those particular elements and there are a couple more like these but these are the more important ones there are some newer types of selectors so for example combinators combinators the designer to Target two or more elements that share a single parent it allows the designer or developer to Target specific columns for example that that are part of a table there are also pseudoclass selectors and these are really special in that they don't really Target the element itself but what they look for what they listen for is the state of a particular element for example if the element is being hovered over or maybe a link has already been visited so these are the kinds of states that these selectors will Target pseudo element type of selectors will Target items in a list allowing the designer to focus on a specific item in that list even if we have 100 of them we can focus on just one in the list and of course a typical example of this would be displaying data from a database we never know how many lines there are but with CSS we can Target for example the first item in that list the last item or somewhere in between so my purpose of showing you this particular slide is to show you and make you aware that there are new CSS selectors appearing all the time and that you should be aware of them
