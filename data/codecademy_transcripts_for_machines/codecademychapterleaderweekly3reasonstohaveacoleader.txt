community manager with codecademy and today's quick tip video for chapter leaders is three reasons why you might consider having a coleader a coleader for your chapter is totally optional and not necessary but i have seen some really cool stuff happening in the chapters that have coleaders so i thought that i would bring those observations out and share them with you so number one reason to have a coleader for your chapter is planning and promoting those are two separate jobs and two pretty big jobs planning your actual event is obviously something that you want to do every single time because you want to have that information listed on your agenda so that people can make decisions about coming to your meetup and then promoting it holy smokes that has to happen in partnership with hq but then also on your own social medias i'm seeing fantastic stuff happening with people who are creating instagram accounts and twitter accounts and um while one person can totally do this and have a lot of fun doing it i think it would be or i think it can be a really great thing um to split up between two people so that's number one planning and promoting number two moderating a meetup um i am sure you can imagine i've been a participant and a moderator for a number of virtual events and can't stress enough the sense of relief and having somebody to comoderate um usually or at least lately that's been either lil or mike whom you've met in the process of becoming a chapter leader and i'm so grateful for them so i just want to share that from my own personal experience having a comoderator for an event whether that person is on screen or not is a really nice feeling to have and then finally the third reason is around asynchronous communication so your meetups happen monthly um part of being a chapter leader means you'll also get a discord channel in our discord server but there's all kinds of asynchronous communication that you can also have with your chapter members be that through email or a whatsapp group or however you choose to organize yourselves for conversation in between your meetups that asynchronous communication once you get more members once you get your groove and more people showing up can become kind of a lot again a lot is good when it starts to happen this is not a problem this is a benefit um but i think that also it's a lot easier to welcome more when you have a coleader so how do you get a coleader that part's pretty straightforward uh if you need support adding somebody else as a coleader to your chapter always reach out to myself or mike or lil in our uh in our discord server we'll be happy to help add somebody if you're not able to do it yourself and we can also help you on board that person i hope that this is helpful and i hope that you have a fantastic start to your week talk to you soon
