leadership capacities at both Morgan Stanley and ey formerly earnst and young hi coma thanks for joining us great to be here thank you for having me yeah so I wanted to start by asking you what do you think the most important soft skills for Success are in the tech industry specifically that's a good question I I think that um a power skill that never goes out of style is communication that often times you'll be called into explain things to audiences of varying degrees of Technical acument and experience and the worst thing that can happen is that maybe you feel like you're explaining something in a way that makes sense to you but it's not Landing for the person that you're trying to explain to lots of times you might be called in to communicate what's happening with the particular project perhaps it's a crisis where you're trying to explain what happened with the remediate ation strategy is what's the path of getting people back up and running or explaining features of a particular project that you're working on so people can understand why it's important how it's important and how you might consume information and make sense of information may not be the way that everybody else does so being able to work intentionally on communication skills when you're thinking about a workplace that is remote and in person or hybrid intergenerational people with different abilities and different gifts that they bring to the table it really is critically important to continue to refine communication skills because how you show up to different audiences is often times maybe a little different and being able to navigate those Landscapes can pay dividends and your ability to add value and support growth and support other people on your team in their own professional Journeys in their own growing Journeys I especially think also empathy leading with empathy we we saw that the pandemic shifted a lot of norms in terms of how we work with each other what we're dealing with how we show up to work so I think that's also really making sure that you're showing up in a way that people find you to be authentic and invested in their Career Success um sometimes it's something as simple as just making sure you check in with folks on a regular basis making sure you're having oneon ones but those are places where it's Inc critically important to make sure that you're you're leading in a way where you're showing up for people they hopefully exper exp erience the real you and that they feel like you're invested in their success yeah yeah definitely and I think you brought up a great point which is just how much the pandemic has changed all of this um for people I wondered if we could talk about why there's a need for professional skills right now especially one of the peculiarities that came out of the pandemic although remote work is not something that is is relatively new the scale at which people were introduced to work remotely changed a lot of norms in terms of working with a team that may not be geographically close working with teams that are located in different countries with different cultures different time zones how do you how do you get to know a team that you've never met in person how do you work with a boss that you may never get to see um or you may see maybe twice a year so those are some things that that require sort of a reexamination of professional skills because a lot of those Norms that people with more experience in the workplace might have developed sort of fall apart uh something as simple as how do you do a job interview if you're used to showing up in person how do you do it remotely what are strategies to be able to put your best foot forward when you're not in the room with someone if you're used to working remotely how do you show up present in an environment where you're now interacting with people in person where you might be used to a different environment of re uh interacting with people remotely so it really is critical because what happens is when you have those gaps gaps sometimes create misunderstandings or the ability to not assume positive intent and those misunderstandings can fracture teams and personal relationships and professional relationships so now more than ever it really is critical to invest in those skills because those can be the make or break aspects of a team being able to deliver on time to be able to remediate things to be able to make sure everybody feels like they're included and that that became very difficult especially post pandemic in an environment where a lot of folks were not used to these Dynamics now being disrupted and how do you keep people together and motivated when the Norms that you might have been accustomed to are no longer the Norms of the professional environments that we're working in now right right um speaking of which I believe that we are having a bit of a technical difficulty connecting to the correct YouTube stream so we're going to pause our conversation I feel we were on such a great uh train of thought there but um just one second while we try and figure this out um Mariana perhaps is going to stop the YouTube live stream and get us to the correct one sorry everyone thanks for your patience we actually have a free course on giving virtual presentations and part of it includes what to do if the technology isn't working so maybe we should all take that after it includes oh all right if Mariana is here and could give some uh input that would be awesome
