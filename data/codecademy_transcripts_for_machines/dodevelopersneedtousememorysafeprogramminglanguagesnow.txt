so earlier this week the US White House released a report asking the technical community to use memory safe programming languages to help prevent cyber attacks but like what does that even mean so when they say memory safe they're talking about programming languages that have a memory safety feature that will prevent you from accidentally introducing bugs that mess with your computer's memory data shows that up to 70% of security vulnerabilities are caused by these memory safety issues which is why the White House is pushing for devel velers like us to use programming languages that are memory safe like python Java rust go and Swift and they're suggesting that we avoid C and C++ because they're not memory safe does that mean you shouldn't use them at all not necessarily you just have to be careful and consider the risks with the program that you're building we know this is a big topic so we just posted a full explainer on this on our blog Linked In Our bio for you so go give that a read and then let us know in the comments if you have any other questions on this
