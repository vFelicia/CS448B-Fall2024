um another question here is about getting discouraged by errors and I think that this is probably very common in data especially because you run into a lot of trial and errors it's so frustrating so first of all I just want to say like I'm going to give like a very nice answer and all this sort of stuff but also just know that I've sat there with my vs code or Jupiter notebook open trying to turn my hair out um so I understand the the cliche is it's always an opportunity to learn um but it's really true so if there's an error and you don't know why it's happening right what that means is there's something you don't understand maybe it's something you don't understand about the data set right so maybe it's not a syntax error maybe it's just something that's not coming out correctly that means that's that's a sign right you don't know something about the data set or you don't know something about one of the methods that you're using and as data scientists right it's our responsibility to make sure that we know what's going on it's super frustrating but the errors are there to help us understand like I need to like learn a little bit more about this or I need to look into it a little bit more deeply
