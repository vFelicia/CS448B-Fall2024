okay going live and i believe we are live now so how are you doing today julie i'm doing well thank you how are you i'm doing great uh thank you for coming thank you for stopping by you know uh all learners are always eager to learn a lot of information when it comes to job jobs careers you know learning to tech tech in general so i know that your journey it's one of those unique ones that a lot of people can learn from and take advice from and that's why i was so excited to get you to talk to to us today um let's just get started with some of the basics so can you tell me a little bit about you your background what you do sure and thank you again for having me i'm really excited to be able to share my story hopefully it will help some of the learners out there to also um shoot for their dreams so my background i am a pharmacist and i'm also a mom who decided to switch gears and go into tech i felt that tech would be kind of have more doors open for me so i wanted to explore that further the reason why i had stepped down from my pharmacy role was to be home with my children and during that time i wanted to add some ad programming to my skill set to differentiate myself and after learning programming i i knew i just wanted to keep going and here i am um before uh before i had stepped down i also had various roles within pharmacy i started as a pharmacy clerk then intern pharmacist and i even landed a corporate role in pharmacy where i helped with a really big project on changing the pharmacy label and the label now includes a little dosing chart to help patients kind of see what time of day they should take their medications in that way if they have multiple of these prescriptions then they can line them up and be able to see which ones they should take in the morning and which ones in the evening because of that role i wanted to go go into tech and do something like that again where i could have such a big impact um where i could i could do something where it had an impact on millions of users and i think we might have lost fit a um video are you there mmhmm looks like we might have lost fitty hello hey can you hear me i can hear you my laptop completely shut down i'm sorry uh so i let's go let's just uh yeah it just decides to quit on me you know live stuff it happens that's awesome so can you just uh start from the beginning again just tell me you were telling i was asking you i wanted to ask you a pharmacist is something that was related to code and programming and like that's why you thought that programming was kind of like the natural uh progression for you is that is that were you using programming before as a pharmacist i was not using programming before as a pharmacist however as on the business side i did speak to developers to help i'm sorry if you didn't hear my story about working on the prescription label but when i when when our team had changed the prescription label we had to work with developers to work on uh some changes in our software in order for pharmacists to verify this new dosing chart and i wanted to be in that same role again i knew that i couldn't maintain that role with children because i wanted to stay home with my kids during that time so i had to leave and figured if i got into programming maybe i can go back and do something similar where i could have an impact and i could have a say and i could build something for millions of people no i mean you know it's interesting that you mentioned that you wanted to build things and be impactful because i feel like that's something that a lot of people go into when they're trying to go into tech they realize that you build things other people use and that's like very exciting and you work on problems and challenges that are very handson and sometimes uh other kinds of careers don't really give you that chance to be so close to what you're building and that you know that kind of uh like you you almost feel it every day like oh yeah i did that i coded that i built that so um i think that probably is going to resonate with a lot of people are that are interested in getting into tech do you um did you have any process when it came to what part of tech to focus on like did you how did you decided i'm going to go this route and not that route because a lot of our learners that come to code academy have that question a lot of people are saying hey should i do data science should i do web development should i do something else uh how do you decide that yes to be honest with you i fell into that same learner where i didn't know what i wanted to do i just first started picking a language making sure that i learned that language really well you want to be able to learn something deeply versus learning multiple languages but not really diving deep into something so once i felt comfortable in a language then i thought well maybe i might go into web development because there's a lot of jobs out there for web development i did not want to do data science because to be honest data scares me a little bit and so i would have to kind of ease into that but if i really wanted to get into data science i'm sure that's um something that could that could happen uh so did you go to any communities online or do you read anything about it like did you do the classic go to google like what's the best programming field to get into or what's the most jobs in demand in the main jobs like did you do you do anything like that actually i went when i first got exposure to programming i started with code academy and there is like a code academy quiz to find out like what kind of programmer you are and uh web development was was on there um but some of the some of the things that i would just do is kind of google and search like what kind of jobs are available that people are looking for around me just to kind of get an idea but one of my good friends told me what what are you passionate about and i felt that i didn't think that i could think about what i was passionate about i felt like it was just so hard for some people to get jobs that people might feel like i should just try to get anything that i can but when i really thought about what i was passionate about which is education and gamification that really narrowed my search for jobs eventually and so i ultimately just really wanted to work on something involving education or working on an education platform okay yeah that's useful i mean so people right now around the world are taking courses with code academy or any other platform online being able to say okay let me take a step back what is it that i'm interested in am i interested in this field or that field am i interested in this work or that work and then kind of like work way work your way backwards and say well if i want to get there what are the technologies that they use what is more typically used here or there and those are the technologies i need to focus in learning uh would you say that since you went through the process i guess of just exploring programming in general you went from zero to you know starting from zero um is it do you find it true that any programming language that you start with it sort of like builds up into your repertoire or just being good at coding in general like problem solving and looking at how code works like you know some people might argue hey you should go c plus plus we used to go python you should go like do you feel that regardless of the language you start with once you figure out hey that's the direction i want to go in and maybe it's a different language but it wasn't a waste of time learning a different language in the beginning right that is so interesting that you bring that up uh because when i first started learning programming i learned in ruby and after about a year of learning ruby i switched over to javascript because i was thinking of doing web development and at the time i was like gosh did i just waste a whole year of learning ruby if i'm not going to be using ruby and it really turns out that it really wasn't a waste of time because that was when i learned the fundamentals and the basic concepts that really applies to more difficult things and i have mentioned that i thought i had wasted my year but i really didn't because it was so much easier for me to pick up a new language having already had ruby under my belt and when i switched to so when i switched i had also did python i also did javascript and i was just learning a couple of new languages i also learned c and c was actually to me really helpful to learn because it helped me understand more of the computer science concepts uh really how the data is working kind of underneath the hood so oh yeah even though i don't use c i it was really helpful for me to to kind of learn it a little bit more deeply and that helps me with understanding how data kind of works and so it sounds like you have a very it sounds like you have a very background i mean a very diverse sort of background you touch a few languages and they all sort of like brought something different to the table like they just kind of like shine a different light into what it is to its coding and programming and kind of like the techniques behind it yeah absolutely i would recommend starting with any language first as long as it's something not too low level but starting with any language i started with ruby but i hear a lot of people starting with python or even javascript and then once you are comfortable with that i suggest learning something a little bit lower level like c or something similar just to get that computer science um background and and then just just keep going forward starting to learn a little you know a framework here and there and if you want to get into web development i started with node but now i'm working back in ruby and rails so you really you're really full circle exactly you're really going full circle where you're gonna end up do you um okay so let's back up for a moment and talk about uh you just talked about how you ended up using ruby which is now at your current position so let's talk about that journey and how you got there so you start zero it's day one julie decided she wants to be a programmer so can you kind of like try to summarize what it's like that whole journey of like this is how it started this is like how how often did you code every week how often was it in days was it did you measure in hours when i want to know when did you feel that you were job ready did you go to communities online to find like portfolio ideas did you build some ideas on github or do you have friends help you do you do any pure coding like i just want to understand what was the journey that you took that got you to be successful and get land the job that you have today sure and actually i had my first exposure to programming i believe when i was 17 in high school i took an intro to computer science course and failed miserably and so i hadn't looked at programming all these years until until i had stepped down from my pharmacy job when i spoke with a friend who loves his job as a software engineer and said that he he loves logic puzzles and solving problems and i said i love doing those things so that's when i decided uh go go to google one day and say how do i learn programming and code codecademy actually was the first thing that popped up so i made an account that day and i started learning and i will say that for the first year i was learning by myself solo i didn't join any groups i i had a rough time just trying to stay motivated without some support or a friend to be accountable with and so i only started learning about one hour a day at the time i also wasn't sure if this is just a hobby or if this is going to be a career so i started about one hour a day and i might go for a couple of weeks at a time here and there where i didn't do any programming and when i came back i realized how much i had forgotten so a good tip would be just make sure at least get in something every day even if it's just five minutes if you can and what was the tipping point when did you decide okay i'm going all in now that would happen when covid had began in 2020 and there's something called code in place where stanford computer science instructors has led a huge effort about 10 000 students 900 section leaders for something called code in place where we were going to learn the first five weeks of their intro to computer science course and the section leaders are there to meet with you every week to work on a computer science or one of the coding problems every week and after the five weeks was over you make a final project and and then you can kind of choose where you want to go from there and i felt like learning in a community was just so different from learning on my own when i learned in the community i was putting a lot more hours i would say at least three hours a day going through that course with now friends and just having that community having people to talk to and answer questions and also anybody who has questions you can help answer and it really made me feel good that i was able to contribute back it totally makes sense yeah i mean it's it's like anything right it's like going to the gym or any other project that you take like when you are in it with other people just there's like a little bit of extra motivation a little bit of extra camaraderie and talking to other people just kind of like keeps you going right like it's just to me it makes total sense that that you were sort of like dabbing into coding a bit and then once you found a community and a group that were saying yeah we are all on this together that that's when it sort of like clicked in your mind that yes uh this is something that uh that i want to put more time into more effort into um so and ever since then like and then what i was gonna say ever since then uh i only learned in communities pretty much so after after the stanford course i went on to do a harvard cs50 course also in a community that we built to complete that course and then after that i did kind of go a little bit onto web development on my own but earlier this year i joined a boot camp but it wasn't a boot camp that people may have heard of before it was called all aboard boot camp uh led by john crapezy and he wanted to help underrepresented groups break into tech so he decided that he was going to make a boot camp and after the boot camp was over you just do a final project and it wasn't really until that boot camp and doing that capstone project for the boot camp where i felt that maybe i am ready to to find a job and okay i yeah what was the what was your capstone project about did you use like a framework how involved was this yeah so the bootcamp was four weeks long and in the four weeks you're learning ruby rails a little bit of html css and javascript so my final project was a full stack project that and because i was so passionate about education i wanted to build something that would help me while learning in communities to have all of my materials in one location so since i learned in communities during this time there's always multiple apps that you might use to talk to somebody like slack and then there might be no uh announcements that would go through email and there might be assignments that are through another portal and so i created an education platform where users can go to whichever class they were enrolled in and then access all of those things in one location and i created a little chat thing in there too so that users can talk to each other wow um and just for the learners that might not be familiar with what when you say a full stack project but some some might not be familiar with that can you explain the kind of technologies and programming languages that you used sure so ruby would be like the backend language and then rails would be the framework uh for the back end but the way rails works you can kind of incorporate front end into it as well so you add your html and your css and your javascript all in one and you would be able to have a full stack project where in my case the identification platform will have let's say user data which would be in the back end in a database and the front end would be what you see on the page so users can click and add themselves into whichever of course that they want to enroll in wow that's awesome so if i understand it has i heard it um you build this project after boot camp and you realize you look you look at your work and you say wow i built all this from the back end full stack like i i feel like i know enough that it would be worth starting a prime for jobs so once that happens in your mind you say this might be the next step do you how do you go about learning how to write a resume learning how to do a good cover letter uh you know where you should be applying like there's so many companies you could be applying for like all the application process did you do any interview prep so what were the next steps that you took that's a really great question and to be honest with you i don't know if i ever felt job ready i felt like i was comfortable enough to find a place that at least provided mentorship so i really wanted to look for something like an apprenticeship or an internship to start because i didn't feel like i was ready just to be put in and then automatically start working so i focused my efforts on looking for people that were really hiring definitely junior roles but mainly apprentices okay and my my story with looking for a job is probably not your typical story that here because i really when i felt that i was ready i immediately went on to codecademy to like to see if they were hiring because i i knew i wanted to be there and luckily at the same time they were also hiring for apprenticeship roles and so i was like oh my gosh is this a sign like i i'm on this and i i focused all of my time crafting my cover letter for it uh codecademy codecademy's interview or application process it's very transparent so they ask you for like three questions and make sure you answer it in your cover letter so i didn't have to have a lot of my own material that i needed to add into a cover letter but i answered the three questions and i probably spent several days just rereading it okay and rewriting it and making sure that just because i knew like i'm curious to know that you have to use any like uh externals do you have any resources like maybe from your bootcamp or from the other courses that you took in communities were there any resources that you looked up like okay this is this is a typical junior level resume or this typical like cover letter like do you do you use any resources or did you just kind of like trust that your gut and said well this looks good and this is what i'm going to submit i do you have anyone like who's read it for example do you have anyone read it i feel like i must have googled a template like for example in the first progress paragraph you might just introduce yourself for something like that and then because it asked for the three questions it was really easy for me to just answer those three questions and then have a closing statement so i did google some and i might have read like what verbiage how you might want to present yourself um yeah i can't remember yeah i can't remember where what i looked at but definitely have multiple people proofread it for you um i think i had like five people proofread it for me so in different stages and my cover letter originally was two pages but i got it down to one page make sure your make sure your verbiage is direct and clear into the point so you don't want to fluff it with too many words okay and do you do any interview prep like once you submitted that the resume and your cover like once you submitted the application you you realize okay if this goes through the next step is gonna be they contact me and we go through questions so were you already sort of like thinking ahead and saying okay i'm gonna start looking around typical interview questions typical coding questions making sure that my github repo is clean and all everything very tied it up did you do any any of these kind of interview prep yeah good point i did take a data structures and algorithms course just to understand some of the basic data structures and algorithms that will help you solve for example lead code problems and i did do a few leak code problems just to make sure that i could solve some of the easy ones and i i felt like that course that i took was kind of gave me the basics but it didn't i didn't really get deep into the more complicated data structures which is okay because i didn't end up having to use much of it maybe indirectly i had to but for example for my interview here it was a pair programming session and so it wasn't your typical whiteboard session where they give you a problem and you whiteboarded it out and then you code it so it was a little bit different than that um i also uh as a part of being in wnb.rb which is a group that i'm in for women and nonbinary folks i started creating a interview prep kind of group where i would just meet with a few folks and we would solve leap code problems together oh okay that's smart awesome yeah i like to like i said i like to learn in a community and i love to collaborate so i wanted to have something that i could work on with with other folks who are kind of going through the same thing and so i mean it sounds like a fair statement that collaboration and working with others is what got you like at least half the way there like it sounds like you got really serious about learning to code when you got in a community with all the people that we're learning too and it sounds like you lean on that community for code practice collaboration projects like you you just kept coming back to that so it sounds fair to say that that that aspect of collaborating with others and finding a niche community or some group that can help you that that's that was one of the key to your success yeah i think so and also make sure ensure you making sure you have a good support system just within maybe you're not working with them but some close friends that will help you stay accountable and you can help them stay accountable as well just just having that support the community yeah really really excelled my learning anyway nice so i'm curious okay so we talked about your journey from xero to the boot camp learning to code feeling job ready you prepared the cover letter you prepared the resume submit it you went through interview and prep a little bit of interviewing prep so you get the call you've been accepted into the role and now we have a lot of learners that they i mean they say it's nerveracking because there's this thing imposter syndrome right that creeps on you and you feel like oh no like i learned like i didn't really like i didn't go i didn't get like a college degree on this you know i'm like i'm not that smart i don't really know that much what's gonna happen my first day they're gonna ask me questions that i don't know about it's gonna be a mess did you could you speak a little bit of like what it's like to get into your first role in tech and like kind of like checking your expectations checking yourself and like kind of believing a little bit yourself say hey if they invited me it must be that i'm good enough and like i'm just gonna take it one day at a time and keep growing and learning yeah i all of those things that you said resonated with me because i was very worried before i started my first role what what if i'm gonna be so stressed out that i i don't know anything and i'm gonna spend all my time googling and looking things up and will i have time to to complete all the tasks that they're asking of me and uh well i think it's very fair that your first role is probably either an apprenticeship role or a junior role and they know that you're still learning and they shouldn't expect you to have that to know everything i mean even seniors admit that they don't know everything and they also look things up so my experience with starting was actually and i still wear my imposter hat syndrome my imposter syndrome hat and i i every day i have to think about well i they they chose me because they believed in something in me they believed that i can figure things out and that's what i'm here to do i'm i'm here to to learn and help solve problems and there's there's people here that can help me whenever i need the the community at codecademy is very very supportive uh very friendly and always willing to help if i need it because i know you know i'm asking this question because i know that uh kind of like in a side note a bit um there is a lot of emphasis from current professionals in the in developer roles where they will say that even though there is this sort of conflict in interest where you are eager to start a role whatever it is and at the same time they will say your first role matters because if you especially as a junior in an internship apprenticeship a junior role being in a place where they would allow you to kind of like feel comfortable and understand your limitations and help you grow and help you become the developer that you want to become and that professional going to the full role of a developer it seems like that conversation always happens kind of like back and forth but it's like it really matters that you find a place where like you mentioned people understand that you have you know their limits to what you know and they are they accommodate those limitations and at the same time you might be feeling like look whoever calls me first that's that's the job i'm upset so like did you feel a little bit of that tension like i know that you said that that was very aligned for you that when you felt job ready was at the same time code economy was looking for apprenticeships sort of like felt like a straight line but did you have that conversation that monologue internally saying you know how much does it matter where i get a job i just need a job a job whatever it is did you do you had that moment of just thinking you know whatever it is i'm fine with it i have had fears that i would have to select a job that i could take um whatever it is but i have also heard that you don't want to do that depending on okay so if you're going to interview and the interview is going okay and then you're finding out maybe things that you you don't feel that would be a good fit with that company not saying that the company is bad but maybe you don't fit very well with the company but you take it anyway because you feel like that's the only job that you can get you might you might kind of burn out depending on i guess i i'm just i'm just saying this hypothetically because i'm not in that situation but i feel like i might burn out if it wasn't a good culture fit um other things might be going on i don't know if i would feel like i belong and that could leave like a bad taste in my mouth if it was my first role and i just didn't feel like i fit in would that would that prevent me from wanting to further pursue engineering i i don't know um but i have i have multiple times thought about i'm gonna have to apply to multiple places i'm just gonna get the first one that accepts me um i do hear that a lot actually okay so so it sounds like yes so it sounds like you're leaning more towards the part of saying even if you're desperate for a job and you just want to accept any job it really does matter like uh like for example if you're like if you try to hypothetically hypothetically imagine yourself in a role in a different company that's not code academy and you think about how you're going through it here at code academy you you realize there is so much value in in finding out the right fit for for what you're for that so like if you have to go back and do it again you'll probably try to find a company like that that has those rather than not right right and i would like to think that there's a lot of jobs out there looking for software engineers that you should be able to kind of pick and choose what what your fit is um i i couldn't imagine a different place working to be honest with you i feel very welcomed here and i feel very supported here if i have a question i could ask anybody there's there's no one here that will kind of shoot you away that's great that's awesome to hear um well we've been talking for a while and we've walked through your entire process that your journey from beginning to code and learning what programming is all the way to getting into a role that you're currently holding uh do you have any sort of like general advice or tips that you want to share with everyone that i that might be going through the same things that you were going of learning online being insecure not knowing which programming language to focus on what career to go not knowing when you are job ready you know i've gone through six months of tutorials is that good enough how many portfolio projects do i need two three uh is this a good enough portfolio project to be more involved like do you have any like general thoughts on on advice like if you had to go to a group of people and say you can be developers too here's some of the things that i learned along the way that could help you i think some of the advice i would give is one make sure you're learning something deeply not superficially and jumping around and whatever language that you pick it's it's fine and to definitely work on projects i had this bad habit of going through tutorials but not building my own projects and when you're building your own projects that's when you're really learning you're really trying to figure out how things might work not handed to you and really don't compare yourself because i personally felt that it took me a much longer time to understand a concept versus somebody else and if i kept comparing myself to other people maybe i feel like i wouldn't be good enough but i mean my role now kind of proves that i i can do it um and then just make sure you have a good network um i i believe networking is is key here uh making sure that you put yourself out there you meet new people learn about them having a support group and and learning with people just the community i can't say enough about learning in a community and learning publicly nice i like it i mean i'm in community all the time so i like that you're praising community so much that's a bit of a bias there for me um let's look at the chat see if anybody had any questions um okay so one of the users was asking can someone with no coding experience enter a coding bootcamp and become a software engineer in six months so do you think that it's possible in a sixmonth time frame to to learn coding and getting a boot camp and i guess landing a job i suppose i hear that all the time honestly i it it took me two years but i also wasn't doing this full time and i couldn't have done a boot camp because of the hours that were expected i have two young kids and so most of my time is spent with the children but yeah i hear i hear a lot about people who get into coding boot camps get a job in six months i don't know how common that is but i have heard about it you know some people might post on youtube that they got a job within six months i also um think that it depends on the person so for me i don't think i would have been able to do that because i needed some time to have concepts sink in so i felt like six months might not be a good a long enough time for myself but it could be for someone else okay that's fair yeah and i mean boot camps themselves they have different timelines the typical bootcamp might be three months but i've heard of boot camps that are a year long they put less hours every week and they're more accommodating on like if you already have a job or you know whatever life situation you're in so i suppose the answer is yes depends the answer depends like people have done it in six months so it's not impossible but it depends on your situation and what you're trying to achieve i suppose and everybody learns differently like you said so some people uh are quicker in some concepts and then they get stuck on react or all the framework and like that's it you get hit or wrap another question uh did you construct a resume of projects that you created to get the internship and how do you create your resume so that companies can see your experience in engineering so two parts of the question what about can you speak a little bit about the projects that you build yes i think that's a really good point uh two of the projects that i ended up putting on there i i added i added a python tetris game that i created and i put a why behind why i'm adding it to my portfolio and why i created it in the first place and the why was i wanted to help my kids learn how to play tetris and if i code it myself i could have certain pieces dropped so i started with the o and the eye pieces so that they can understand how it works and then over time you increase it so my reasoning was to help my kids ease into learning how to play tetris the second one as i already mentioned my education platform i created it to solve a problem that i had which was having everything in one place if you add that into your resume i think it would stand out um just so that they can see why you're building something i forget what the second part of the question was um the second part of the question uh was just wondering if you created a resume so that companies can see your experience in engineering so i'm i'm i'm not sure that the person meant the resume has in the the piece of paper or resume in the sense of like the projects that you were building if uh did you build your projects like thinking these are showcase projects to land a job or were you building projects for fun i think that might be more of the question that's a good point my first one was for fun but ended up being on my resume because i thought it was a good story and the second one was definitely something that i knew i wanted to put on a resume um if that helps answer the question okay one of the things that yeah one of the things to to keep in mind when you build your resume is to make sure you're looking at the job description of where you're applying to and make sure that there's keywords that are in the job description inside of your resume so that it can kind of get filtered through there so tailored tailor it tailor it to your to where you're applying and make sure that the keywords are right makes sense makes sense someone is curious to know how long it took you to create your first website oh well this is a very interesting question because i am very much backend myself and so i would say my first website might be might actually be the the final project that i created uh for my for that bootcamp which really was like a little under two years after i started programming so it just it just kind of depends if you if you immediately start with front end which i did not do i didn't start with html css and javascript you you might create your first website in i don't know maybe a month i mean i'm not really sure i mean if you're talking about vanilla html you can create a website in five seconds just like the text document it's a website you can host that you can host an empty website in five seconds uh i'm going to answer this one are html and css necessary to learn when becoming a web dealer yes html css is everywhere on webs so you will need to know those how much use of them it depends on the frameworks and how they've written like ruby and rails or like react with node.js like uh how much html and css you touch personally depends on your role and what kind of developer you are but that's just the web the webs is built on those technologies so uh the answer is yes you you need to do html css um somebody was wondering about how you stay motivated when you were selfstudying and i think you touched on how the community helped you the network that you work with yeah and and i actually started something very very cool and i highly recommend others to do this as well is i made a twitter account and i started 100 days of code and every day i would tweet about what i learned or what i did that day my tweets ended up going a different route where i started sharing my knowledge too and i think that really helped motivate me because i i wanted to be able to help other people follow what i was learning and so i would tweet something about maybe a ruby syntax or something about ruby a ruby tidbit and then just kind of learn publicly in that way and i think that really helped me because when people started seeing that i was doing this i was on it every single day i i would do something i would learn something and then i would tweet about it yeah and uh you know touching on that uh for anyone watching code academy has these amazing forums at discuss.codacademy.com and there's so many people looking for help and some people sharing their code and sharing their projects so go there to that go there and try to help someone and like you were saying uh helping people and looking at their code that's like a skill on its own and it also motivates you and you get more used to seeing other people's work in code uh so it has a lot of positives and you start meeting people you start seeing people online and like they're going through your journey with you and it has a lot of positive so i would say go explore communities and try to find someone there like some support uh i'm looking at the time it seems like uh it's the time flown by uh but we've been here for about for a while now so uh i think i just want to give you one last chance as any parting thoughts and to thank you for being here online with us i'm pretty sure that you've helped a lot of people today a lot of people that had the same questions that you had when you were going through your journey so thank you so much for sharing and the floor is yours i really don't have anything else to add um thank you so much for having me be on here i am really excited to hear our learners kind of follow in the same path and and get to where they want to be and i'm i'm just so excited to one be a part of codecademy's community as well as be a part of codecademy now okay well i think with that we are finished for today like i said thank you so much julie for stopping by i think um like i said i think you've helped a lot of people and maybe we'll help you again in the future if you have more to share i mean i'm very curious to know three months down the road what it's uh what it looks like so thank you and i'm going to stop the stream now okay all right so the stream is over youtube killed it so
