hi my name is Stephanie I am a software developer based in Baltimore and today we're gonna go over a sprints simply put a sprint is a period of time that a team has to complete a set amount of work in the case here the development cycle is two weeks generally that amount of time can vary from team to team and it could be as long as a month or as short as a week you can think of development sprints like a running sprint they're both completed in a short amount of time and you have definitive end goals you're trying to achieve at the end for a running sprint your goal is to cover the distance you've committed to running in a set amount of time and for a development sprint your goal is to push out code you're committed to writing in a set amount of time now that we've defined what a sprint is these are some key takeaways that make Sprint's unique to other software development cycles and how Sprint's can accelerate the development process spurt planning happens at the beginning of the sprint in this meeting the team outlines the goals that will be completed by the end of the sprint the product owner who is responsible for the products growth will work with the developers to outline a list of goals to be completed the product owner determines the priority of the business needs and maintains his product backlog which contains all the requests that aim to deliver value to clients and so the practice from the product backlog into the sprint backlog which is a list of tasks that the team is committed to completing in the duration of the sprint meanwhile the developers will bring the technical perspective and make sure that the sprinkles can be completed sprints can last anywhere between a week to a month I've typically seen them occur within two weeks by limiting the timeframe it forces the planners to stick to small iterative changes so that you don't have a lot of massive features or too many changes going out at once plus this allows clients to get a more seamless experience as they're transitioning to newer versions of the product it also helps expedite releases on the right you can see that when you push out really large features in one go there's a lot of time being spent with little progress being made this is because you spend more time going through more code to debug and test than if you were to make smaller changes so when you limit the size and quantity of the features going out like in the graph on the left bugs are a lot easier to catch you can isolate the issue more easily when there's less code to go through it's like when you're playing Where's Waldo with Waldo being your bug and the rest of the picture being your code it's a lot easier to play when the picture is smaller isn't it there may also be times when your business needs change in the middle of your sprint and make your sprinkles obsolete it might throw off the time estimates for the rest of the sprint but that's okay Sprint's are just a way to shape and organize development work depending on how the new business needs change the goals of the sprint the product owner can meet with the developers to create new tasks to complete or developers can pull tasks from their own backlog and work on reducing technical debt but at the end of the day your products needs should drive development for example say you opened up a lemonade stand and your sprinkle is to make lemonade now you're in the middle of your sprint making the lemonade but because you live on the East Coast the weather forecast says that the weather is going to go from a heatwave to snow by the end of your sprint surely your clients are going to want lemonade anymore so you change your sprinkle to make hot chocolate and now when the Sprint is complete you made it you have a new and functional iteration of your lemonade stand all the features that you've worked on are completely functional and fully tested and you're ready for the whole cycle to start over again so remember a sprint is a development cycle where your team will be completing a list of goals during that time frame it may be useful to organize your team in a particular way but at the end of the day you're trying to deliver value to your clients and so your business needs will always be driving your development goals thanks so much for watching I hope you enjoyed this video please join the conversation by dropping a comment below and subscribing to this channel and if you're ready to take your skills to the next level you can start learning on coke atom II today
