hi my name is Stephanie I am a software developer and I'm here with coke atom II today bringing to you all the reasons why coding is useful for everyone as we become more reliant on technology code plays a much bigger role in our lives so even just some basic knowledge of how to code can help improve our interactions with technology and the ability to write code extends way beyond learning a language it helps you build on other skills that are applicable in any field today all the technology that we interact with from our cell phones to messages they're all powered by code when we send a message it may seem like there's a ferry running around in the background to pass the messages back and forth but concreted appropriate belief it's all powered by a piece of code then there's more code that will alert their recipient hey you've got a new message there's even code powering the videos we watch and the websites we browse through speaking of websites have you ever felt helpless when you're trying to load a page and then you get this wheel that never stops spinning well fun fact a lot of these spinny wheels are designed to make you think that progress is being made and the weight isn't that bad but then you realize that it's been spinning for ever and then you have no idea what to do so you figure it's broken and you just give up no matter what you do how old you are where you are unless you're in an area with bad internet connection just knowing a little bit about coding particularly web development in this case can help you figure out what's wrong all the people I've met that I've picked up coding abilities come from vastly different backgrounds some work truckers who needed a career change others are sales representatives whose coding backgrounds help them fully understand their company software and communicate the benefits of the product more effectively to their clients I friends Financial Analysts that want to learn how to use Python and sequel to build scripts that will run different analyses on their data this allows them to draw conclusions from financial trends more accurately and efficiently just yesterday I spoke with a guy who owns a small homeimprovement business and is looking to expand his customer base he plans on using his coding skills to create an app where he can interact with his clients and roll out a loyalty and referral program for my marketers and designers having CSS skills allows them to design websites more effectively and communicate better with the developers that are building the website actually regardless of your current or future occupation anyone can use it to be better and more creative at their job it can seem a little intimidating but code Academy is a great resource to get your feet wet and help you lay down some fundamentals that can translate into any kind of problem solving when you write code you're also forming a new perspective and learning how to think creatively through it this is because when you write code for your computer to run it can only execute one small task at a time so you have to break down a problem into bitesize instructions to guide the computer to do what you want kind of like if your friend was blindfolded and trying to make you a PB&J since you have all the information of where everything is you have to break the process down for them from how to get the bread out of the bag all the way down to how to slice a sandwich and on top of that you'll have to be creative like what if you only have one spoon to make the sandwich your instructions would definitely be more different than if you rate just using a knife code is very much a team effort a large part of it is also working effectively in a team especially for larger projects like building out an application or finding a solution to a really difficult problem a lot of times you need to be able to clearly communicate with your team members to make sure the code flows cohesively these kinds of communication skills are transferable to any environment and are especially critical in a work environment one of the most valuable skills I've gained from working on teams is recognizing what I've taken on too much and knowing when to reach out to my team members for help technology is for making our lives easier and there is code powering technology so this should mean that code is for making our lives easier right right using code to automate any tasks is kind of like waving your magic wand and kicking back while the dishes wash themselves if you're shopping online and you want to know when an item is back in stock you can write some code to alert you when it's ready you could also use some code to build out a website that will advertise the company you're running I mean during college class registration began at 7 a.m. before the end of the previous semester and thankfully it was online but it wasn't enough I'm the kind of person that likes to see as little of the morning as possible so I wrote a script that would load up my classes for the semester and then enroll me at 7 a.m. so I could sleep or if you use Excel to manage data you may have noticed that you're a lot more prone to errors when you're manipulating the data and that you see a huge lag when you have really really large data sets well I've got a fix for you just automate that so you have a list of transactions that your grocery store made in a year and you're trying to get all the transactions where an Apple was bought if you're trying to do this in the Excel there are a lot of steps and buttons you would have to click to make this happen and if you're a popular grocery store you're gonna have thousands and thousands of rows to go through and you'll be waiting around forever but if you wrote some code to do all that for you you'll be less prone to errors and your code can go through those thousands of rows more quickly than Excel plus you can run the script on next use data set without any additional effort on your part there's a lot of manual work out there that can just be pushed on to some code instead so why not let your code do the heavy lifting while you get a sit back and relax and Sapir bubble tea and in the process you can improve your team skills and form a new perspective that enables you to think differently and more creatively and if you ever get stuck well the coding community is always here to help because at the end of the day we're all just trying to make people's lives easier well thanks for watching this was stephanie with code
