think we should be live in just about a second i am going to oh i see someone in the chat let us know in the chat on youtube if you can see us um for anyone who's following along we are going to be streaming on a few different services but we'll be keeping an eye on the youtube chat so if you'd like to chat with us you can find us there um hopefully we are all set but cool okay i see looking good thank you um we're so jamie and i are flying without alex today and he's the uh the resident expert in live stream so we're just making sure we know what we're doing but i think we got it so um cool so today we're going to be talking about multiple linear regression and we're going to um we're going to use some kind of small examples to get ourselves started but it's going to be a pretty packed day so i'm going to go ahead and get started right away um actually really quickly as i'm sharing my screen do you want to introduce yourself jamie for those who met you hi everyone i'm jamie um i'm just tagging along and helping out sophie with this live stream i'll also be helping to answer any questions in the chat and be monitoring it so if you have any questions or talking about multiple linear regression um please serve in the chat yeah awesome yeah so um jamie can also stop me at any time uh since he could like get my attention more easily so i will keep an eye on the chat but if i miss something um or you need me to go over something again just let let us all know um in the chat awesome so we'll jump right in um today we're going to be using another dummy data set to start and then we'll use um we'll also use a real data set for the second example um so this is actually part of a project on codecademy so if you're following along in the um the linear regression with python course on codecademy this is the linear regression at codecademy um project and this is a madeup data set but it's actually something that we could do at codecademy that we thought about um and so i'm gonna like paint the picture for everyone so the idea is that we're imagining we're some curriculum developers we're trying to develop a new lesson and we we actually have two versions of a lesson teaching the same thing this is actually true of our linear regression uh courses we have an old lesson that um i think alex or maybe sunny wrote and then we have uh this newer lesson that i wrote um so you could imagine right that we've got two different lessons but teach the same topic but we have one quiz at the end and we're trying to see uh whether one lesson is better than the other lesson in terms of teaching students that topic but we also have some other information about each student and that is the number of other content items they have completed on our website and so you'll see in this data set that i've printed out for everyone for each student they're going to get a score on the on the final quiz and then they're going to get a number here in this completed column that tells us how many other content items they've completed and then here we've got an indicator that tells us which lesson they took on codecademy's website and we want to use all this information to predict score and in the process we want to understand what's the relationship between all three of these things at once like what's the relationship between how many um how many content items someone completed on their score and what's the relationship between which lesson they took and their score and we're going to build a model to do that so up to this point we've only done simple linear regression which is to say that we've only used one predictor in our linear regression models so we have the skills so far to create a model where we predict score using the completed variable so i'm just going to demonstrate i'll quickly plot these things so that you can all see so we do a scatter plot of um completed against score show that right we get this relationship between these points and we can see that it looks like people who have just completed more content items regardless of what those patent items are people that have completed more content items are doing better on the quiz right people who are who have done less content items are doing the first on the quiz we can also make a box plot right we can do this um of the same thing uh but now looking at the lesson variable and we see it looks like on average people are doing a little bit better if they took lesson a compared to if they took less than b so we've now looked at two bivariate relationships we looked at the relationship between these two variables and these two variables but we haven't looked at all three together and remember before when we were when we used simple linear regression when we fit a linear model here we're trying to find the line that minimize the the vertical distance between the line and all these points when we did a linear regression with these two variables we were doing the exact same thing it's just that we were here it's just that our points were sorry sometimes coding and talking is tough right but we did we had something like this right where we have a set of points here a set of points here we basically are finding the mean of each set of points and drawing the line that goes through those two points now we're going to try to fit a model that predicts score using both completed and lessen as predictors so in order to do that i think actually the first thing i'm going to do is i'm just going to fit the model and then we're going to go back we're going to try to understand what the output looks like so um let us go ahead and i'm going to grab this from my final code to be honest i don't see any question about a candle bar in in trading stocks crafts um i don't know what a candle bar plot is to be honest but a box plot really quickly is just so this just shows this line in the middle shows the median and then these are the 25th and 75th percentiles and these i believe are like the 90 50 or 97.5 percentile and 2.5 percentile so like 95 of the data is in between these two lines and then these are outliers so it just gives you a sense of where this data lies um similar to this picture i will look up what a candle bar graph looks like um okay so here's our model we're again gonna use oh i gotta probably grab oh no sorry guys so here's our model um we're using this ols from formula function again we've been using up to this point we're fitting this model where we say let's predict score using lesson and completed as predictors and we're going to use the codecademy data so that's this data set that i printed up here and then we're going to fit the model and then we're going to print out the parameters of the model so here i'll do this so everyone can see all of my code in one place so i run this i get an intercept a slope on lesson t dot lesson b which looks a lot like what we saw last week when we talked about categorical predictors already and then i also am getting a slope on completed so we're going to try to understand what these three pieces of information give us the other thing i want to do before we jump into this a little further is i'm going to just add a little bit to this graph right here so in this graph remember we're just looking at the relationship between completed and score so just two of our variables in this equation down here but i can visualize the third variable which was less than by using a little bit of color um i also think actually a nicer way to write this is you can do this and then tell python where the data is coming from so now python knows all of this is coming from this codecademy data set and so i don't have to append the name of the data set on each of these things um and when i do that oh is it i think i have to put it and um okay so now we can visualize these three variables at once and we see right that we can still see that relation that positive relationship between completed and score and then we can also see that the blue points for lesson a are a little bit higher than the orange points for lesson b so we can also we can see now those two relationships that we graphed separately here and here or here these two are telling us the same thing cool okay now that we have these two pieces of information i'm gonna switch things up and we're gonna grab the ipad which is very exciting and we're going to kind of walk through some of the math behind this and if anybody has questions please ask them because i know i'm moving a little bit quick so i don't want to miss anyone in the process sorry a little bit offcenter okay so i've now written everything out here that we just looked at we've got this graph right that shows lesson a and lesson b color and then we've seen we see score against completed right and then we've also got a we've got our output from that model and we've got the model written out here so remember we did score as a function of lesson and completed so let's write out now what these two things tell us about our model so when we fit this score as a function of lesson and completed model what we're actually saying is we want to fit the following equation so we are saying we want score to be equal to some number i'm going to call it b0 this is a notation thing so before we were using mx plus y equals mx plus b is our equation for a line we're going to write that equation slightly differently now and we'll talk about why we can do that so we're going to write our equation as b 0 plus b1 times less than plus b2 times completed okay now let's take a step back for a second and think through why this is the same as our original equation of a line y equals mx plus b so remember right we started with this equation y equals mx plus b where y was the outcome variable so that's something like score right this is our outcome variable x is our predictor so that's something like completed or a lesson and then this b was our yintercept and this m was our slope right and these were just numbers so we notationally chose to put the mx term first and the b second but you can add numbers in any order so right like 2 plus 5 is the same as 5 plus 2. so we could really rewrite this equation as y equals b plus mx and then we've just chosen to use the letters b and m but we could replace those with anything else so in our new equations we're replacing them with b0 and b1 so y equals b zero plus b oops plus b one x is really the same equation as the one above we've just decided to call the slope and the intercept slightly different things so the reason why we use this equation the b0 and the b1 is that as we add more predictors like in this case we have less than and completed as predictors we want to be able to expand our equation and use more letters and so if we just use b and m like what's the next letter we're going to use we don't know instead it's a little easier to just say like i'm going to call all of these things b0 b1 b2 b3 and then i can add as many of them as i want so that's why we're using the slightly different equation but the key thing to know is that it's really no different from the y equals mx plus the equation that we started with okay so here's our equation and here is our output right so now let's plug in this output into the equation so we actually have everything written now so really this equation is score equals b zero is our intercept right still the yintercept is the one that's not multiplying any of the predictors so b zero is 18.3 about b1 is our coefficient or slope on lesson now you'll notice that in the output sorry there's some sirens in the background here um you'll notice that in the output lesson got printed out as lesson t dot lesson b what that means is this is actually a indicator for when the lesson is equal to lesson b so remember from last time in order to fit the model with a categorical predictor we have to code the categorical variable as zeros and ones in this case we're saying one for the purpose of this equation 1 is equal to less than b and 0 is equal to less than a so i'm going to go ahead and just write this out exactly like it is in the output and then we'll talk about it after so um plus but then it's a negative 13.2 about so plus a negative is really just a negative but we'll write it all out for now so we've got plus minus 13 13.2 times and then i'm going to write this whole thing out lesson t dot um so if you have a question in the chat um yeah so uh someone's saying i'm new to python would linear aggression be used for a ride share price predictor it certainly could yes um yeah i'm super excited that people are using this as a way to get more familiar with python they do think it's a lot easier to do to work on a project if you have a specific goal and so these types of these types of problems are super interesting um and it's i think a good way to get started with programming um okay so and then we've got another slope b1 or sorry b2 on completed and that's equal to 1.35 i'm going to round to 1.4 but 1.4 times completed so here's our equation score equals 18.3 plus minus remember plus minus just means minus so i'm actually gonna erase this for a second and just replace it with a minus sign adding a negative is the same as subtracting score equals 18.3 minus 3.2 times lesson this whole thing here this lesson t lesson b is just an indicator it's equal to equals one if less than b equals zero if less than a and then plus 1.4 times completed where completed is the number of prior exercises completed so now what i'm going to do is i'm going to break this up into two equations so we're going to get an equation for lesson a and we're going to get an equation for lesson b let's start with lesson a so if a person took lesson a jamie what would the value of this lesson t dot lesson b variable v i think um so since lesson uh t s and v is an indicator variable um and we're looking for the equation with less than a we want to plug in zero for that indicator variable um so then we just get the value um zero for that exactly so if someone took lesson a then the value of this lesson t lesson b thing is zero in that case when we write out this equation we've got score equals 18.3 plus 13.2 times 0 plus 1.4 times completed right and like jamie said anything times zero is zero so 13.2 times zero is just zero so if we simplify this we get score equals 18.3 plus zero plus 1.4 times completed and we don't even have to write out plus zero it doesn't mean anything so we get score equals 18.3 plus 1.4 times completion now this looks a lot more like our y equals mx plus b equation that we have before we have another uh question in chats someone's asking what if there's an intrinsic correlation between lesson and completion um that's would that have any effect on the uh um aggression so okay so that is a complicated question it seems simple but it's a complicated question um so we have to think about how we designed this experiment so if we if we just randomly assigned people to lesson a or lesson b then we won't be worried about that right we won't we won't worry about the relationship between lesson and completion because lesson was randomly assigned but if not if that's not how we went about this if there's some relationship between lesson and completion then we're gonna need to take it into account somehow um we're gonna come back to that in a couple weeks um so that's like the topic of a future a future discussion um but yeah it's a tough it's a tough question it also it also depends on what your goal of this analysis is like if your goal is to determine whether the lesson that someone took caused them to do better on the on the quiz so you're trying to determine a causal relationship because you want to say like in the future if we show more people lesson uh was it lesson a yeah lesson a where they did better show more people less than a will they continue to do better on this quiz because this is causing them to do better it's a better lesson or something if that's your goal then you then you're gonna need some other strategies to figure out how to and you can't do like a randomized trials you can't randomize people then you're gonna need what's like this field called causal inference to try to balance the groups as best as possible um but yeah there's there is a lot to be said about that but with this method we can't take it into account um okay so this is lesson a our equation for lesson a and now we also are going to have an equation for lesson b let's see where can i do this oops sorry guys i thought i would be able to move this thing okay maybe not all right we'll try to fit this bottom um so for lesson b so for lesson b the value of this lesson t lesson b is equal to one so now when we plug in we're going to plug in a one for that variable so we've got score here four equals starts out the same 18.3 then we've got 13.2 so minus oops i also realized i just messed this up right so that's a minus we got 18.3 minus then we've got 13.2 sorry again times 1 because now this whole thing is equal to one if it's less than b and then we've got plus 1.4 times completed okay now anything times one is equal to itself so we can say four equals eighteen point three minus 13.2 because 13.2 times 1 is just 13.2 and then we've got plus 1.4 times completed and then finally we can simplify this a little bit so we've got 18.3 minus 13.2 that's equal to 5.1 so we've got score equals 5.1 plus 1.4 times and that's our equation for a lesson um okay i see a question oh yeah we might need to calculate variance inflation factor prior to doing the regression um yes i i am a little bit rusty on um on this to be honest but you there's definitely ways that you can weight the regression um based off of the like differences between the groups for lesson a and less than b um but yeah again like if if your goal is to prove that lesson a causes an improved score then you're gonna need causal inference methods um yeah okay uh so we've got our two equations for lesson a and lesson b let's try to draw them on this picture so for lesson a our equation was score equals 18.3 plus 1.4 times completed so that means that the yintercept is 18.3 and then the slope is 1.4 so i'm gonna like imagine right the intercept is back here somewhere in this picture or the yaxis is back here somewhere because this is 10 so back here is zero if we were to extend this out a little bit so if we're crossing 18 at the yaxis it's gonna start that line is going to start around here and we've got a slope of 1.4 it's gonna look it's going to be like over 1.4 or sorry over 1 up 1.4 over 1 up 1.4 i'm not going to really try to grab try to graph this but we've got some sort of line like this for the other group the slope is exactly the same right the slope is 1.4 because the number multiplying completed in both of these equations is 1.4 so it's going to be exactly the same steepness but now the intercept instead of being 18.3 it's 5.1 it's exactly 13.2 units below this intercept so for this line the yintercept is going to start a bit lower but then it's going to oop it's going to have the same slope we're going to try to draw that so same steepness but start slower and that kind of looks like it fits what these points are looking like cool okay are there any questions about this i know we just went over quite a lot um so i actually have a question so will this kind of be like the so for like any kind of multiple linear regression model that's like similar to this where there's an indicator variable and then a like quantitative variable will always be the case that they like basically have like the two different lines um for the indicator variable will have the same slope but different intercept or they ever have the case where they like might intersect um that's a really good question also something that we're going to cover in a future session um but yes there's a way that you can create a set of models where the you're not constrained that the two groups have the same intercept and the same oh sorry have the same slope but have different intercepts you can allow the intercepts and the slopes to vary for the two lines um but the way that you do that is actually by adding another predictor to the model um and so you you end up adding what's called an interaction term um between the two variables so in this case between completed and lesson and we'll we'll talk about that in the future in a future lesson but if as long as you don't have that extra term you don't have an interaction term you just have a binary variable or any categorical variable really and a quantitative variable and you're just adding them as predictors you're always going to end up with a like a set of lines where the slope is the same because all you're ever doing is for different values of your categorical variable or even if this was a quantitative variable and that's what we'll go over in a second but for any values of this variable you're really just multiplying by some number and then that gets added into the intercept and you can never by changing the value of or like by changing the value of this you can never change this 1.4 right like this 1.4 is multiplying completed and that's the slope on completed which is what we're looking at in this graph and this piece of the equation can never change that 1.4 and uh i guess my other curiosity is um so our what is the slope um for completed like the multiple linear regression model here versus um what you calculated in the last live stream where you're just like looking at completed as its own like as the one predictor term and then um as like the different lessons as the one particular term that's a really good question so the slope is not necessarily the same as what you would fit so i think what you're asking you can tell me i'm wrong but i think what you're asking is if i fit the original model where i just didn't i didn't color these points off at all i just drew the regression line for this entire set of points so i fit like score as a function of completed and then i just fit that line that slope is not necessarily the same is not necessarily going to be the same as the slope for these two ones yeah that's exactly what i was asking um and then we have a another question in the chat um are the coefficients based on correlation value of less than and complete uh with score yeah so actually um from the regression you can basically recover the correlation between um between like any set of two variables so if we just looked at this score as a function of completed like if we just looked at that model we could recover the correlation between score and completed from the model output um the higher the correlation like the better the the model will appear to be and we'll talk about that in the last session or second to last session a little bit more um so yes it's essentially we're essentially calculating we're not calculating the correlation directly but we're saying the model is going to be a better fit to the data if these things are highly correlated with each other so if score and completed are highly correlated and score and lesson are highly correlated then we can fit a better model that explains more of the variation and the data that we have good questions cool so i'm gonna stop this share now and reshare my notebook cool so i'm just gonna demonstrate really fast how we can um we can add this to add those lines to our graph so remember i i wrote this down um but already down here for everyone so for lesson a we calculated that the equation is or we wrote out the equation as score equals then we said 18.3 plus 1.4 times theta and that was our equation for a lesson so let's add that to the model or let's let's add that to our picture first so here we're going to do i'm going to add klt.plot i'm going to go from let's see actually what i'm what i'm going to do is i'm going to replot codecademy i'll write these out sorry write it out down here so i'm going to write out some x values so my x values are going to be completed so this is the original data academy.completed i can print it right out so that everyone can see actually right these are just my original completed values and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to apply this formula i'll call it completed actually right so i'll apply this formula so then my predicted based on this model my predicted scores based on these values are going to be 18.3 or i'll actually grab this whole thing so it's 18.3 plus this number 1.35 whatever times these completed values and then i'll print those out predicted of course great so to get this number 65.75 what i did was i took 18.34 plus 1.35 times 35 and that gave me my predicted score for someone who oops actually yeah so that gave me my predicted score for someone who completed lesson a so i should say predicted scores a yeah okay so let's add that line to our graph now so we can add plt.plot we're going to plot completed versus predicted scores okay and and there's our line for the blue points now to jamie's point if i was just if i was like isolating the blue points and just trying to draw a line through those blue points i probably would draw a slightly steeper line but we're restricted that the the lines have to have the same slope so it's not it's not the perfect line that we would draw through those blue points but it does reflect that the blue points are a little bit higher now let's do the same thing for lesson b so for lesson b my equation was score equals five point one plus one 1.4 times completed remember that that 5.1 is really coming from 18.34 whatever minus 13.816 so i'm actually gonna write that all out here and then this is yeah so there's my equation for predicted scores b and now i'm gonna add this to my model all right this is my plot so you can all see it and now we've got right the blue line is the predicted or the line for lesson a the orange line is the point is the line for lesson b and like we said before they have the same slope they're exactly parallel they will never intersect but they do represent two relationships they represent the relationship between score and completed but also the relationship between score and which lesson someone took really quickly because i know we're going to run short on time and i want to get to the next example the other thing to notice about this is that so as we're interpreting this if we just interpreted within lesson a so like let's forget about lesson b for a second this is our our line for lesson a the way we would interpret the slope and the intercept and this kind of comes back i think we skipped over it a little bit in the first week and i kind of regret that because i wish we'd spent more time on it but if you've taken the the lesson onto academy thought about it a little bit maybe you got there yourself right the interpretation of the intercept for this line is it's the expected score on the quiz for someone who completed zero assignments right because the intercept is where this line intersects the y axis and the yaxis happens when completed equals zero so when we have this this yintercept of 18.3 that means that for someone who took lesson a were expecting them to score an 18.3 on the quiz if they completed zero prior assignments based on this model and the slope is the expected difference in score for a one unit increase in completed so right because remember the slope is rise over run so it's the expected vertical increase here which is this difference in score because that's on the yaxis for a one unit run a one unit increase and completed so for groups of people for a student who who completed one more assignment than someone else we expect their score based on this model to be 1.4 points higher on the quiz and what we're saying here is if this is our model we're not expecting someone's like the potential impact and that word kind of is not the right word um because we're not saying we're not proving any causal inference here but it's the we're not saying that there's any difference in the relationship between completed and score for these two lessons but we are saying that someone is expected to score higher if they took lesson a than lesson b if they completed zero uh lessons prior but also if they completed any number of lessons right because we because the distance between these two lines is stays the same the whole time and it's always going to be whatever this number was like the distance between those two lines is 13.18 points and so the way we would interpret this is we would say controlling for how many lessons someone completed so if we if we freeze this at one particular number of lessons say 30 so controlling for how many lessons someone completed we expect the score to be 13.2 points higher among lesson people who completed lesson a compared to people who completed lesson b um i saw a question is there any difference between features and parameters um i think so i would say this is all like semantics of what you refer to things as and people refer to different things with the same thing with different words and different things with the same word sometimes so it's like these the word feature and the word parameter while they have definitions they often get used in different contexts and so i think so i should probably be caught referring to these predictors or these like columns of my data set as features um or predictors if they are predictors on a target variable or outcome variable if they're the outcome variable um but you might see people referring them to referring to them as parameters um okay let me i'm gonna grab the like solution code for the next 10 minutes so that we can get through a little bit more so for the last 10 minutes i'm going to talk about a slightly different example and this example is actually it's from a data set that i grabbed from the uci machine learning repository you can see the citation at the bottom um so this is a study of a group of students so similar topic um and we're just going to focus on some score some test scores for those students so the scores are for a math test and then a portuguese test and there are numbers after them so there's a math one math two math three port one port two part three in this data set and these are like semesters of the school year i think so it's like their math ones their math one value is their score on the math test after their first semester then sec after their second semester and then this is like at the end of the year i believe so we've got this picture here and i'm actually gonna switch switch back to my picture for a second my ipad one second um but what i what we're looking at here is we're saying okay what if we try to predict someone's final portuguese score based off of their initial math score and we see there's a relationship like maybe this is just students who are better at studying they can do better on both math and portuguese and so um it looks like people who have higher math scores are tending to do better on their portuguese tests and people with lower mass scores are tending to a little worse on the portuguese test there does appear to be some relationship here um and then we're coloring this by portuguese score in the first semester so that's this port one right and so we see darker colors are higher portuguese scores in the first semester and lighter colors are lower portuguese scores in the first semester and this is almost the same thing as what we were looking at before but now this portuguese or this port one score is no longer a categorical variable it's a continuous or in this case it's like a um discrete quantitative variable but we can think of it as a continuous variable um but basically it's a number it's not a category so we can do the exact same thing but it's gonna look a little bit different so i'm gonna show you guys um i'm gonna show you guys on my ipod again what that looks like okay okay can everyone see this yes hopefully okay um okay so here is another model where we have port three as a function of predictors math1 and port one right and then we can fit a model just as we did before with two predictors by putting this model formula into our sm sm.ols dot from formula function i'll demo that in a second when we come back and in this but in this picture right we've got two quantitative variables instead of having like just ones and zeros for math one we can have any number of values and same thing for port one so i'm gonna do is i'm gonna write this out the same way we did before using my output i'm gonna write the equation of the line so the equation is port 3 equals the intercept which is 0.44 plus the slope on math 1 is about 0.11 so we've got 0.11 times math1 and then we've got the slope on port one is point eight six we've got point eight six times port one okay now we can think about this for a few different values of port one let's write out what the equation would look like so to start let's try when port one equals zero so when four one equals zero we've got port three equals point four four plus 0.11 times math 1 plus 0.86 times 0. and anything times 0 is 0. so this is really just port three port three equals point four four plus point one one times math one when port one equals one we can do something similar but now we've got port three equals point four four plus point one one times math one plus one times point eight side plus point eight six times one and algebraically right it doesn't matter what order we add things in so we've got a point eight six times one and then we've got this 0.44 we can add those together and so we end up with port 3 equals 0.44 plus 0.86 this whole thing is now our intercept plus 0.11 times math one and you can kind of see how this would continue for port one equals two we have the same thing but now this is going to be a 2 this nut 1 here is going to become a 2 and so we'll be adding 0.86 times 2 to the intercept so we'll end up with something like port 3 equals 0.44 plus point eight six times two that's now the intercept plus point one one times math one um when you're saying like port one equals one and port one equals two like what is the scale for like what two corresponds to like for like the first exam so port one equals one just means that they scored a one on their first portuguese okay those would go all the way up to like a hundred um i think actually they're like goes up to zero just based off of the graph it looks like the scores are roughly between 0 and 10. um but yeah so it's whatever whatever the um the scale is in the original data and what's happening here is the intercept is just increasing every time so as port 1 increases we get a higher intercept and what that means for our picture is as port 1 increases we would draw a slightly higher line and there's infinitely many lines that could be in here because port one could be infinitely many values i mean in reality it's really probably just 0.51 1.5 to 2.5 etc but like theoretically with another quantitative predictor it could be any value right and it makes sense right we see that like these darker points are higher up so like at the top where port 1 equals 12 we've got like these darker blue points and so we would draw the line up here and for the lighter points we would draw a line down here they should all have the same slope but we're just thinking like as port one increases the intercept of our line is going to increase the line is going to move up um but the slope will stay the same okay we are just about at time so i'm gonna stop it there um but i hope that today's lesson was helpful in terms of getting a first look at what we're what we're thinking about when we run a regression with multiple predictors um and if you want to learn more and think a little bit more deeply about this i highly recommend that you take the linear regression uh in python course on codecademy we've linked out to it in a bunch of places on youtube and on the event pages um and on github i believe as well and there is a whole lesson on multiple linear regression and you can learn even more about it and how to interpret all the coefficients um so that if you're if you're interested in learning more that's a good place and then next week we're going to come back and we're going to investigate some of the math behind how these models are actually fit and it's a little bit it's a little bit technical but it's really important for being able to debug a model in python or even just figure out how to fit the model using some new software or a different package in python understanding a little bit of that matrix math is super super helpful um so hopefully everyone can join us for that uh thank you for all of the questions in the chat today i would love to see even more questions in future sessions the questions are really helpful for helping me figure out like what i need to go over to clarify things but it's awesome to see more people back every week and yeah i really appreciate everyone stopping by i just want a second also to take sophie's like linear regression lessons they're very awesome um and they're like very helpful if you want to learn more about this stuff um so yes definitely like look at those um and thanks for joining us today and thanks for letting me join you today sorry office hours on thursday at the same time 11 a.m eastern time um in the us and we will also uh after this week because not too many people have been showing up so please show up if you'd like to there's if you go to academy.com events you can check out or you can get the link to that um but after this week we'll be on we will be trying out office hours on get on sorry on discord um so if you're interested that could be really cool um there's i've just joined our discord and have discovered there's lots of really good conversation going on on discord so if you'd like to join for that highly recommend okay all right have a good rest
