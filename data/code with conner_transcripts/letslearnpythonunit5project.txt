00:01 - hello humans welcome back to code with
00:03 - connor this
00:04 - is the unified project this is the last
00:07 - unit project that we're gonna do
00:09 - and this is a text based choose your own
00:12 - adventure game
00:13 - so now that we've done all that we've
00:15 - done to create program structure it's
00:17 - time for you to plan
00:18 - and actually do something so what are
00:21 - you going to do you're going to make a
00:22 - game well kind of like zork
00:23 - back in the day i've ever played that
00:24 - europe maybe you read ready player one
00:26 - i don't think they put in the movie but
00:28 - it was in the book for sure
00:30 - and they talked a lot about zork and the
00:31 - white house but it was a text based
00:33 - choose your own adventure game and they
00:35 - can be wicked fun
00:37 - if you build it if you're into dnd this
00:38 - is a really cool experience because you
00:40 - can kind of take a d d
00:41 - campaign which is already very
00:42 - storytelling heavy very written heavy
00:45 - and turn it into something like this
00:47 - either way it's fun project i'm going to
00:49 - show you a couple of student examples
00:51 - of this we'll talk a bit about things
00:53 - that you should do or shouldn't do
00:54 - and then i'm going to set you loose i'd
00:56 - love it if you put it in a platform or
00:57 - you could share it with me
00:58 - if you do it on a code hs sandbox for
01:00 - example you can share the link to your
01:02 - game
01:02 - i can put it on my website if you want
01:04 - me to and people can check it out
01:06 - i want to check it out i think it'll be
01:08 - awesome i always enjoy looking at these
01:10 - every year when my students make them
01:11 - all right let's jump right in and have a
01:13 - look
01:15 - are you ready okay
01:18 - so right off the bat we've got some assy
01:21 - art
01:22 - ascii right using something online to
01:25 - create
01:26 - this string that actually prints out
01:28 - kind of like a fancy font you can google
01:30 - that stuff if you want to
01:32 - and then we immediately get right into
01:34 - the story mode right the text the story
01:36 - is what's going to sell it at the end of
01:37 - the day
01:38 - but mere moments ago you entered into
01:40 - what is commonly known as a dungeon
01:42 - the force field separating you from the
01:43 - grassy field above closing
01:45 - you have nothing on you except the
01:47 - clothes on your back and a strange sense
01:48 - of determination
01:50 - you see legend has told the legendary
01:52 - artifact lies in the depths of this
01:54 - dungeon
01:55 - one that will provide you with an
01:56 - embodiment of whatever you most desire
01:58 - that is if you can make it through
02:02 - to view the commands type help at any
02:04 - time not all of them can be used
02:06 - everywhere however have fun
02:08 - and then we enter the starting room
02:09 - starting room you find yourself in a
02:11 - rather spacious cavern
02:12 - there is a force field blocking the exit
02:14 - to the world above the sound of the
02:16 - nearby ocean can be heard and a small
02:17 - amount of light from outside illuminates
02:19 - your path
02:20 - it appears the caverns lead southward
02:22 - and blue crystals can be seen dotting
02:24 - the path
02:25 - so like just pause love it the world
02:28 - building the story this is awesome
02:31 - when i do this assignment with my
02:32 - students i always focus on that creative
02:34 - writing piece it's so key
02:36 - uh so what's happening from a code
02:39 - perspective so
02:40 - we've got some kind of function that's
02:42 - starting the game and kind of printing
02:43 - that intro
02:45 - and it's just a bunch of strings and
02:46 - print statements nothing there
02:48 - we've got another one for the first room
02:51 - probably a function
02:52 - for the starting room and it clearly is
02:54 - waiting for user input
02:56 - and if i enter help i'm going to guess
02:58 - this if statement is going to be in
02:59 - every function
03:01 - it prints a whole bunch of commands that
03:03 - i can use use help i can use attack
03:05 - and then a target kill and then a target
03:09 - n for north or i can use north
03:13 - so the or statements they must have in
03:14 - their if e
03:16 - s w i can do take if there's an object
03:18 - to take
03:19 - i can talk to if there's a person to
03:21 - talk to up
03:22 - down open an object i can quit i can
03:25 - read
03:26 - if i'm in a battle so they went a whole
03:28 - extra step here
03:30 - then i can attack i can use a shield or
03:32 - i can heal
03:33 - so what do i want to do i'm going to go
03:36 - south because the caverns lead southward
03:40 - all right castle gate the crystals all
03:43 - appear to congregate here forming a
03:45 - large castle
03:46 - a gate stands here currently closed
03:49 - there also appears to be a small window
03:50 - beside it
03:51 - to the south of you the window is closed
03:54 - a person is also leaning against the
03:55 - wall beside the gate
03:57 - aside from the castle a path leads to
04:00 - the west where there appears to be a
04:01 - forest
04:03 - before you can make a decision you hear
04:05 - a voice call from the castle gate
04:06 - yo you there i don't think i've seen you
04:10 - here before
04:10 - i'm charlotte she pauses for a moment
04:14 - well then again nobody comes down here
04:16 - anymore
04:17 - sighs but then again i think i know why
04:21 - you're here for the artifact aren't you
04:23 - yes
04:24 - or no let's go with the
04:28 - s i thought so
04:31 - whatever though anyhow i want to ask
04:34 - what do you plan on doing with the
04:35 - artifact anyway like dude
04:36 - it creates your wishes essentially what
04:38 - do you even wish for
04:39 - like if you're given the choice love
04:42 - power wealth or something else
04:43 - because i know those are your human
04:45 - typical desires
04:47 - i mean i don't know i'm gonna go love
04:51 - i'm a romantic figures nothing i would
04:54 - have picked
04:55 - i'll let you get back on your way though
04:56 - i want to keep playing games
04:58 - with that she pulls a game boy out of
04:59 - her pocket and you hear the sounds of
05:00 - what seems to be the game harvest moon
05:02 - you are now being heavily ignored what
05:04 - do you want to do
05:05 - so again here we go make the next move
05:08 - and you start to see the pattern i'm not
05:10 - going to play through this whole game
05:11 - this is a student game and it's
05:12 - phenomenal
05:13 - and it was based off a dnd campaign that
05:15 - they that they played and it goes
05:17 - really deep i could play this game for
05:19 - probably two hours
05:20 - and i don't think i would make it to the
05:23 - end i think i would screw up or die many
05:25 - times and end up back at the beginning
05:27 - so really cool experience playing
05:29 - something like this i got one more i'll
05:30 - load up real quick
05:32 - so hopefully you get a little bit of the
05:33 - idea now what code structure for a
05:34 - second here is not that crazy
05:37 - it's basically just you're in a function
05:39 - so if you're in room one
05:41 - okay and they make one choice maybe you
05:43 - call
05:45 - ballroom or you call study or you call
05:48 - hallway one and it's just inside your if
05:51 - statements you're going to call the next
05:53 - function
05:53 - so if they made a specific choice you're
05:55 - going to call the function that takes
05:57 - them to the next room
05:58 - i would suggest a flowchart or a map of
06:00 - some kind where each location has a
06:03 - function
06:03 - so that as they make their choices and
06:05 - they move to these new locations
06:07 - there's a function for each location and
06:10 - then within that function there might be
06:11 - if statements based on global variables
06:14 - so if you have a key then what you see
06:17 - in that function might be different than
06:18 - if you don't have a key
06:20 - okay so that room for example might look
06:22 - differently if you have something versus
06:24 - if you don't
06:25 - so things like that are important to put
06:27 - together i have a little sample
06:29 - file it's kind of like a sample game
06:33 - that's not really much to it other than
06:35 - code structure that i'm going to link in
06:36 - the description
06:38 - and you can steal some of that code just
06:39 - to help you get started but really the
06:41 - creativity piece is what's going to make
06:43 - your game
06:44 - work so give it a shot share with me
06:47 - what you make i think it could be
06:48 - awesome
06:49 - when i do this with my students in class
06:50 - i usually say you need at least
06:53 - 20 locations at least 20 functions with
06:55 - decision making
06:56 - you need at least three global variables
06:59 - that are going to be manipulated
07:00 - throughout the game
07:01 - you need many ways to lose and one clear
07:04 - way to win
07:06 - that's kind of the guidelines that i put
07:07 - forward when i do this with my class
07:09 - i think those would be great for you as
07:10 - well get out there try it
07:12 - and hit me up in the comments and let me
07:14 - know how it goes thanks for sticking it
07:15 - out
07:16 - we'll see you back with the final course
07:18 - project in the next video
07:20 - good luck and i look forward to seeing
07:21 - what you guys make and don't forget
07:23 - like share subscribe do all that fun
07:25 - stuff keeps me going see you soon
07:28 - bye
