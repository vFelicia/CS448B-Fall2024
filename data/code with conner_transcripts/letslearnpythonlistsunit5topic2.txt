00:03 - hello humans
00:04 - welcome back to code with connor and
00:05 - this is the let's learn python tutorial
00:07 - series we are here in unit number five
00:09 - topic number two and we are getting so
00:11 - close to the end of the course
00:12 - and i hope you're doing well and i'm
00:14 - impressed that you're still here
00:16 - good on you all right going back to the
00:18 - challenge first
00:19 - and then we'll jump into today's stuff
00:20 - which is lists this is a big topic here
00:22 - we go
00:23 - code for the challenge take the x1 and
00:25 - the y1 take the x2 and the y2
00:27 - turn them into two bulls and then
00:28 - calculate the slope of the line here we
00:30 - go
00:31 - all the inputs don't need to go over
00:33 - that at this point your pros
00:34 - awesome point one i store is a tubal x1
00:37 - y1
00:37 - 0.2 i swore is a tubal x2 y2 slope
00:41 - y2 minus y1 so point two box one minus
00:44 - point one box one over x two minus x one
00:48 - point two box zero and point one box
00:52 - zero x two x one to the division and
00:54 - then print the slope
00:56 - now 23 shouldn't be there it's gone now
00:58 - it's fine
00:59 - it's like it was never there at all okay
01:02 - so that was just to test this kind of
01:03 - basic understanding of data structures
01:05 - tubals and and all that fun stuff i
01:07 - don't think you'll use tuples a ton in
01:08 - your life
01:09 - you might who knows they're there lots
01:11 - of people love them depending on what
01:12 - kind of project you're working on
01:14 - i usually use lists my go-to but that's
01:16 - okay you do you
01:18 - all right jump it over we're gonna talk
01:19 - about lists okay here we are
01:21 - we're gonna talk about lists what they
01:22 - are how to set them up how to use them
01:24 - index mutability methods all that fun
01:26 - stuff
01:27 - let's get right into it i made a list
01:29 - it's empty you'll notice the notation
01:31 - it's not round brackets it's square
01:34 - brackets
01:34 - ooh all right now you can make an empty
01:37 - list
01:38 - or you can make a list that has stuff in
01:39 - it one two three
01:41 - four five right oh i put
01:45 - two different types of variables in that
01:46 - list is that
01:48 - can i do that i mean i don't know how
01:50 - would i ever find out the answer to the
01:52 - can i do that question
01:53 - oh i know i do it and i see what happens
01:57 - because i'm not going to break anything
01:59 - hey look at that it worked
02:01 - square brackets comma separated values
02:02 - one two three four and the string
02:04 - five it's all there okay now you can
02:07 - also
02:08 - set up an empty list and add stuff to it
02:10 - or you can just add stuff to a list that
02:12 - already has stuff in it
02:13 - you can also override stuff so for
02:15 - example we try to do this in tuples
02:17 - let's do it now
02:19 - my list box zero i want it to now equal
02:22 - the string one
02:26 - and then i'm going to print my list save
02:28 - that and run
02:30 - hey look at that it works it allows unit
02:33 - reassignment
02:34 - so it allows us to reassign a value
02:36 - inside of the data structure or the list
02:39 - all right so now i can do this kind of
02:41 - however i want i've got so much
02:43 - flexibility what if i want to add
02:44 - something to my list
02:45 - well i'm going to let you on your own go
02:47 - check out the w3schools link
02:49 - to list methods because there's a bunch
02:51 - of them and you should kind of look at
02:52 - them
02:52 - but i'll show you a few kind of nice
02:54 - ones append
02:55 - it's one of my favorites it adds
02:57 - something to the end
02:59 - of a list so if i did append six and
03:03 - my list dot append
03:06 - seven and then i print it
03:10 - you can see that it has added those on
03:12 - they weren't there when i originally
03:14 - started but they're there now that's
03:15 - great so we can use pop
03:19 - and this will let us put an index in and
03:21 - it'll remove that one from the list
03:22 - so let's say i want that 2 out of there
03:24 - so i'm going to pop index
03:25 - 1 right and then we run that
03:29 - okay you can see the 2 is gone because i
03:31 - popped it out now there's
03:33 - a little more to the pop method as well
03:35 - and again you'll learn this stuff as you
03:36 - get further on but
03:37 - this actually lets you steal it while
03:40 - it's being pulled
03:42 - so if you want to pull it but then grab
03:43 - that to store somewhere or to print out
03:45 - to the user
03:46 - or whatever it's actually going to
03:48 - return that value so if i print that
03:51 - for example it's still going to remove
03:53 - it from my list
03:54 - but it's going to allow me to use it one
03:56 - last time or store it in a separate
03:58 - variable one last time
04:00 - see so it actually printed it and then
04:03 - removed it so you can actually pop it
04:06 - from a list
04:07 - have it use it for other stuff in your
04:09 - code but then it's no longer in the list
04:11 - anymore which is great
04:12 - okay and there's lots of other ones here
04:14 - and i'll let you go look up some of them
04:16 - but i just wanted to talk core structure
04:18 - so you set up a list with the square
04:19 - brackets now look at the size here what
04:21 - about the size
04:22 - so we can do a len as well and we've
04:24 - done that before with strings
04:30 - and it'll print out how many things are
04:31 - in it so right now there's seven things
04:33 - in my list i got rid of that pop
04:34 - so it's showing me that there's seven so
04:36 - that's really helpful when we're looping
04:38 - right because we're gonna wanna know
04:40 - that so this is just a small snippet of
04:43 - what you can do now you can do multiple
04:44 - variable types
04:45 - we're going to get later you can do two
04:46 - dimensional lists
04:48 - it's kind of crazy and you're going to
04:49 - use lists a lot in your code because
04:51 - you're going to want to store
04:52 - stuff and another thing that's really
04:54 - common is this combination
04:56 - of files and lists where you'll read
04:58 - data in from a file
04:59 - store it in a list use the list variable
05:02 - to access all the stuff inside of your
05:04 - code
05:05 - and then maybe write it or save it back
05:07 - into a file kind of like a database
05:08 - that becomes really common as well now
05:10 - we don't usually write the background
05:11 - database code
05:12 - we use something like mongodb or
05:14 - whatever to handle that
05:16 - and we just pull from the database but
05:18 - that's what's happening in the
05:19 - background this stuff is stored in files
05:21 - it's being read into these data
05:23 - structures then we're accessing it
05:24 - through the data structures modifying it
05:26 - and it's getting written back to these
05:28 - files that's how your profile exists on
05:30 - social media and all that
05:31 - it's stored in files on servers it's
05:33 - pulled from those files into data
05:34 - structures
05:35 - those data structures allow us to
05:36 - reference modify
05:38 - and then store it back so we don't
05:40 - typically write it all from scratch we
05:42 - use
05:42 - you know existing code structures but
05:45 - it's important to kind of have that base
05:46 - understanding because
05:47 - sometimes we do need to write stuff from
05:48 - scratch and we want to have that kind of
05:50 - mindset of how it all connects together
05:53 - all right so i want you to play with
05:54 - lists i want you to look up some of the
05:55 - list functions see what you can do
05:57 - there's all kinds of cool stuff you do
05:58 - like counting things you know can i
06:00 - count
06:00 - how many of this occur in this list and
06:02 - all that kind of stuff
06:03 - play with it see what you can do and
06:05 - then we'll look at the challenge here
06:06 - and
06:07 - see what you can do for me okay for the
06:09 - challenge we're gonna go
06:10 - back in time to our mad lib game
06:13 - remember this thing enter an adjective
06:16 - harry
06:17 - enter a noun computer
06:20 - enter a verb run i'm just going to
06:23 - finish filling it in
06:29 - so i enter them all in and it prints my
06:31 - same outlet from earlier but you guessed
06:34 - it i'm using lists so i have a single
06:37 - list variable
06:38 - where i'm storing all of the user
06:40 - responses
06:41 - and then inside of my print statement
06:43 - i'm pulling
06:44 - from that list in order to fill in my
06:47 - mad lib
06:48 - so use a list and then store all the
06:51 - user responses into the list in order
06:54 - and then pull from that list to make
06:56 - your mad lib now you can go a step
06:58 - further with this if you want to where
06:59 - you actually have a list
07:00 - of mad libs and then those lists kind of
07:03 - get randomized and then from those
07:05 - we pick the right things so this is the
07:08 - challenge
07:09 - for unit five topic number two hopefully
07:12 - this goes well for you
07:14 - go there try it see what you can do
07:15 - lists are awesome you're going to love
07:17 - them once you get used to them
07:18 - like share subscribe do all that fun
07:20 - stuff and we'll see you back here for
07:21 - topic number three
07:22 - we're going to look at 2d lists see ya
