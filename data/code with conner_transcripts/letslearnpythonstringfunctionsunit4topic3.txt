00:03 - hello humans
00:04 - welcome back to code with connor this is
00:06 - the let's learn python course
00:08 - we are on unit four topic number three
00:12 - we're going to keep going with string
00:13 - functions but before we do that
00:15 - let's go back and look at the challenge
00:16 - from the last lesson so here we are in
00:18 - the challenge from the last lesson
00:20 - in this one we were printing a word
00:21 - vertically so you see i printed
00:24 - i have a word printed vertically i had
00:25 - to queue to quit took an input
00:27 - and i just did if the lowercase version
00:29 - of the word was q
00:31 - then break out and then my for each loop
00:33 - so my four
00:34 - character in the word print the
00:36 - character remember
00:37 - this type of print statement right here
00:39 - this automatically jumps to a new line
00:41 - after it prints the character
00:42 - so because it's printing one character
00:44 - at a time in the loop it's going to end
00:46 - up printing the word vertically
00:47 - so that was a challenge in the last
00:49 - lesson now let's jump in and talk a
00:50 - little bit more about string functions
00:53 - we're going to talk about string
00:53 - functions now we're already using one
00:55 - string function which we just used a
00:56 - second ago which is the dot lower
00:58 - function
00:58 - where we take a string variable and we
01:01 - do a dot notation dot notation says call
01:04 - a function on this
01:05 - data type so this is a string data type
01:08 - so
01:09 - it's going to call one of the string
01:10 - functions and we'll look at a list in a
01:12 - second
01:13 - so the one we want to call is the lower
01:14 - function which is going to make it lower
01:16 - case
01:17 - and i'm just then taking the result of
01:18 - that and passing it to my print
01:21 - so let's run that real quick so we can
01:23 - see what happens
01:25 - just enter a word and it turns it into
01:28 - lowercase if i run it again and i enter
01:30 - something
01:31 - caps you'll see that it returns it in
01:33 - lowercase
01:35 - so coming back this is not the only
01:37 - option that we have
01:38 - in fact there's a whole list of string
01:40 - functions or string methods
01:41 - that we can use let's have a quick look
01:43 - at the list and then go from there so
01:44 - here i am on w3schools and this is just
01:46 - a list of python methods
01:48 - that are related to strings so there's
01:50 - capitalize which
01:52 - makes the first character uppercase so
01:54 - you'll see a method and then you'll see
01:55 - a description
01:57 - and then you'll see the ability to click
01:58 - on it and get more details so
02:00 - let's take something like find for
02:02 - example searches the string for a
02:04 - specified value and returns the position
02:06 - of where it was found so we click on it
02:08 - we get an example
02:10 - so txt is hello welcome to my world and
02:13 - then x is txt
02:15 - dot there's my string dot font
02:18 - defined what am i looking for i'm
02:20 - looking for welcome so it's going to try
02:22 - to find welcome
02:23 - in this and then it's going to print out
02:25 - that variable so
02:26 - something like this welcome is here so
02:29 - it's going to find the starting index
02:31 - of that work it's going to starting
02:33 - index w
02:34 - and then it's going to return that to
02:35 - you if the word appeared more than once
02:37 - it would be the first instance
02:39 - so you can see first occurrence it
02:41 - returns negative 1 if it can't find it
02:43 - so we can handle that in an if statement
02:45 - so it's almost the same as the index
02:46 - method except the index method gives an
02:49 - exception
02:49 - and the fine method returns negative one
02:51 - so you could see how to use a method by
02:54 - clicking on it i'll put a link to w3
02:55 - schools in the description
02:56 - so you've got it to go off of so there's
02:58 - lots in here that are useful
03:00 - there's all the is is digit is
03:02 - alphanumeric is decimal
03:04 - and those are helpful if you're trying
03:05 - to check that somebody entered something
03:06 - the way that you wanted them to
03:08 - there's things like replace which
03:09 - returns a string where specified values
03:11 - are placed with another one
03:13 - so we're placing part of a string with
03:14 - another thing you have an upper which
03:16 - will convert it to uppercase
03:18 - we have things like center which is kind
03:20 - of neat where we can pass it a parameter
03:23 - so it'll center my word inside of a
03:25 - string that big
03:26 - there's also a two parameter version of
03:28 - this and there's also a two parameter
03:30 - version of this
03:32 - and there's also a two parameter version
03:33 - of this let's play with it a little bit
03:35 - so let's do
03:36 - dot center 20 and
03:39 - dash so this will center it
03:43 - in a string of dashes so this will
03:45 - center it in a string of dashes that's
03:47 - 20 dashes long so we save it
03:49 - come over here and run it
03:53 - you'll see it centers my string in the
03:56 - middle
03:57 - awesome so you can go through and play
03:59 - with a bunch of these string methods on
04:00 - your own
04:01 - obviously the more you know the more
04:03 - flexible you can be with strings which
04:04 - is
04:05 - great i want to look briefly at the
04:06 - challenge for today so let's run it and
04:08 - show you how it works
04:09 - so enter a word or queue to quit
04:11 - superman
04:13 - your word is not a palindrome so it's
04:14 - checking for a palindrome
04:16 - okay so mom your word is a palindrome
04:19 - okay race car your word is a palindrome
04:24 - okay mom with a capital m
04:28 - still counts out so it must be lowering
04:30 - the case on the word
04:32 - okay race car
04:36 - yep definitely lowering the case and
04:37 - working mother
04:39 - not a palindrome cue and we quit
04:42 - and we're out so for the challenge we're
04:44 - going to be building this simple
04:45 - palindrome
04:46 - checker and you're allowed to use things
04:48 - like reversing
04:50 - have a look at reversing a string do a
04:51 - little google on it it's not on w3
04:53 - schools because it's not actually a
04:54 - string function
04:55 - there's a neat notation that you can use
04:57 - in the index in the box notation
04:59 - for reversing a string so give that a
05:01 - shot and see how it goes
05:02 - and we'll see you back here for topic
05:04 - number four
05:07 - thanks for sticking with me this fair
05:08 - hopefully it's going well we'll see you
05:10 - back here real soon
05:11 - don't forget to like share subscribe bye
05:13 - humans
05:14 - have a good one
