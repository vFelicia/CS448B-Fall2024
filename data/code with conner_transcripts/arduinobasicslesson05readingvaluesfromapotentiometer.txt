00:11 - hello potential coder welcome back to
00:14 - the Arduino basics tutorial series today
00:16 - we're doing lesson number five we're
00:18 - gonna be learning how to take input from
00:19 - a potentiometer really quickly what is a
00:22 - potentiometer Sanchi ometer which often
00:24 - looks like this but can I come in other
00:28 - forms as well essentially consists of a
00:29 - knob one pin for voltage one pin for
00:32 - ground and one pin often referred to as
00:34 - the wiper which is the pin that connects
00:36 - to the potentiometer inside is
00:38 - essentially a variable resistor we've
00:40 - already talked briefly about resistors
00:42 - and how we can use them to resist
00:43 - voltage coming through a circuit this
00:45 - the same thing the only difference is we
00:47 - can adjust it on the fly by turning the
00:49 - knob think about a dimmer switch that
00:51 - you might have in a house by turning it
00:53 - we adjust the voltage in the circuit
00:54 - which allows us to control various
00:56 - things such as the brightness of an LED
00:58 - or to actually read a numerical value as
01:01 - to how much is flowing through in this
01:04 - lesson what we're gonna do is first
01:06 - learn how to wire the potentiometer and
01:07 - then learn how to use a serial monitor
01:09 - just to read the input that we get from
01:11 - it we're gonna start with a blank wiring
01:13 - diagram with our Arduino wired up to the
01:16 - breadboard ground and voltage Channel
01:18 - first thing we're gonna do is bring in
01:19 - our three pin potentiometer we're gonna
01:21 - wire it up to our breadboard the middle
01:23 - pin is the pin that's going to connect
01:24 - to our Arduino for that pin we're gonna
01:27 - connect it to a zero on our Arduino
01:29 - board this is one of the special analog
01:31 - inputs that our Arduino board already
01:34 - has preset up so there we have our
01:36 - middle pin wired into a 0 on our Arduino
01:39 - board next we're gonna take the
01:40 - left-hand terminal of the potentiometer
01:42 - and we're gonna wire to the ground row
01:44 - on our breadboard and the right-hand
01:46 - terminal and wire it to the voltage now
01:48 - you could reverse the polarity of these
01:50 - by putting the ground on the right and
01:51 - the voltage on the left all that would
01:52 - mean is it would reverse the way in
01:54 - which you turn the potentiometer in
01:56 - order to increase or decrease the
01:57 - voltage so that's it for a wiring
01:59 - diagram pretty simple this time around
02:01 - let's hop over to the code and have a
02:03 - look at what we need to do there so here
02:05 - we are in our code interface all I've
02:07 - done is create a new sketch so we're
02:08 - going to start by renaming it for lesson
02:11 - number 5 we're going to be reading in
02:12 - the value of a potential
02:13 - let's go ahead and look at what we're
02:15 - gonna need in our coat there's actually
02:17 - not that much that we need let's declare
02:18 - a couple of variables to start things
02:20 - off so you'll see that I created an
02:24 - integer called peepin so I'm gonna use
02:26 - from a potentiometer pin of a zero with
02:28 - a capital A then I have another int for
02:30 - p value which gave me the potentiometer
02:32 - value and I have a bother to initialize
02:33 - that to a number yet in our set up
02:35 - function we're gonna have just a couple
02:36 - of things to set things up so in our
02:42 - setup function we're gonna set the pin
02:44 - mode for our potentiometer pin and set
02:46 - it as an input pin so this points to a
02:48 - zero which sets that as an input pin
02:50 - here we're gonna begin our serial
02:51 - monitor as we do in most times because
02:53 - we use it for debugging purposes and I
02:55 - put a print line statement in where I
02:56 - just say the below are the input of
02:57 - potentiometer value it's really not
02:58 - needed as our serial one is in a scroll
03:00 - so fast but really just get you in good
03:02 - habit inside of our loop function we're
03:03 - gonna start by reading in the value from
03:05 - the potentiometer we're gonna do this
03:08 - using a new function called analog read
03:11 - analog read is something we can use on
03:13 - an input pin to read in a signal that's
03:16 - coming in as an analog wave from not pin
03:18 - so a digital is just a 0 or a 1 and off
03:21 - or an on an analog allows a whole
03:24 - spectrum of values in between you'll
03:25 - notice that when we take the analog read
03:27 - we're actually storing it using our p
03:29 - value variable which we had declared at
03:31 - the beginning of the file as an integer
03:32 - next we need to print this out to the
03:34 - screen so we're gonna put a couple of
03:35 - serial print statements to accomplish
03:37 - that task what I've done is to serial
03:41 - print statements the first one is just a
03:42 - print which means it's not going to jump
03:44 - to a new line after it prints p value
03:46 - colon space then I'm going to do a
03:48 - serial print line with the actual p
03:50 - value this will fill in with the actual
03:52 - value of the potentiometer and print it
03:55 - after this and then it'll jump to the
03:58 - new lot so each line should have p value
04:00 - colon space the actual value and then it
04:02 - should jump to the next line after that
04:04 - and that's actually all the code that
04:05 - we're gonna need in here I'm gonna add
04:07 - in a few comments just for clarity and
04:08 - then we'll try running the code
04:12 - so there we have it let's push this code
04:14 - out to our Arduino and see what happens
04:16 - it's open of our serial monitor so we
04:18 - can see you'll notice mine is giving a
04:20 - reading of 0 as I turn my potentiometer
04:23 - we're gonna see that value start to
04:25 - increase
04:25 - I'm turning mine clockwise the way that
04:27 - I have it wired and you'll see that I
04:29 - can go all the way up to a value of 1023
04:32 - so there are 1,024 possible values
04:34 - coming in from the potentiometer 0 all
04:37 - the way up to 1023
04:39 - great job with lesson number 5 for the
04:42 - extension we're just going to learn how
04:43 - to do a little bit of math inside of
04:45 - arduino so you'll see that I have my
04:46 - potentiometer on and my output is a
04:48 - little different it's printing the p
04:50 - value but it's also printing this
04:51 - converted value and what i want you to
04:53 - do is using math i want you to allow the
04:54 - potentiometer to also print the serial a
04:57 - range from zero for where it splits up
04:58 - those 1,024 values into only 5 0 1 2 3 &
05:03 - 4 and this gives us a little bit more
05:04 - control over this dimmer ending on we
05:06 - want it to control good luck great job
05:09 - with the extension and now we're gonna
05:10 - have a look at the channel this we're
05:11 - gonna bring back some skills used in
05:13 - previous lessons like wiring up an LED
05:14 - what I want you to do is use this
05:16 - potentiometer as a way of controlling
05:18 - the brightness of your LED you can see
05:20 - at a full brightness and you can dim the
05:22 - LED as you go down good luck on the
05:25 - challenge and thanks for watching lesson
05:27 - number 5 of the Arduino basics tutorial
05:28 - series I look forward to seeing you back
05:30 - in lesson number 6 and don't forget to
05:32 - like this video and subscribe to the
05:33 - channel to stay up to date as we
05:34 - continue the Arduino basics tutorials
