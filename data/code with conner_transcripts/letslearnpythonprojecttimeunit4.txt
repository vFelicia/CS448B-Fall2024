00:03 - hello humans
00:04 - welcome back this is code with connor
00:06 - and we are doing the let's learn python
00:08 - tutorial series
00:10 - we are all the way in topic four in fact
00:12 - we are at the
00:13 - end of topic four which is exciting
00:16 - we're gonna go back and look at the
00:17 - challenge from the last video which was
00:18 - the palindrome checker using word
00:20 - reversal
00:21 - and then we're gonna talk about uniform
00:22 - project let's go so i told you last time
00:25 - you were gonna have to do a bit of
00:26 - googling around reversing a word in
00:28 - python
00:28 - i warned you i attached it to the lesson
00:30 - on string functions but it wasn't
00:32 - actually a string function
00:34 - it has to do with box notation and here
00:35 - it is right here when you take a string
00:37 - in box notation and you do colon colon
00:39 - negative one
00:40 - it's going to read that string in
00:42 - reverse okay
00:44 - so you'll notice i have word.lower that
00:46 - just returns a string with all lowercase
00:48 - and then i do it in reverse and what am
00:50 - i doing i'm comparing
00:52 - the word not reversed to the word
00:55 - in reversed and i'm checking to see if
00:57 - they're equal because if the word is the
00:59 - same when you reverse it
01:01 - then you have a palindrome okay so
01:03 - that's what they did here while true
01:05 - they enter a word or q to quit if their
01:07 - word is q
01:08 - then we print thanks for playing and we
01:10 - break out of the loop
01:12 - else if their word is the same forwards
01:14 - in reverse
01:15 - then we print it as a palindrome and we
01:17 - continue back to the loop
01:18 - else which means it was not so they
01:21 - didn't enter q but the word they entered
01:22 - was not a palindrome
01:23 - then we print not a palindrome and we
01:26 - continue the loop
01:27 - they enter another word and off they go
01:29 - from there so
01:30 - this is kind of that word reversal
01:33 - palindrome and this is
01:34 - you know the easy palindrome checker
01:36 - that doesn't really require any
01:38 - knowledge of strings or indexing
01:40 - just that one little trick about
01:41 - reversing a word it's a great example of
01:43 - looping
01:44 - in conditional statements stuff like
01:45 - that but for the challenge today i
01:47 - wanted to talk about
01:48 - a palindrome checker that does not use
01:51 - word reversal
01:52 - so i want you to think about the same
01:54 - program
01:55 - but you're not allowed to just check if
01:56 - the word is equal to itself in reverse
01:58 - in fact you need to somehow iterate
02:01 - through the indices
02:02 - of the string and compare characters
02:05 - this is going to test your knowledge of
02:07 - string indexing and looping a lot better
02:09 - than using word reversal so the
02:11 - functionality of this is going to be
02:13 - pretty straightforward
02:13 - let's run it and before you say anything
02:15 - yes i switched computers i'm on a mac my
02:17 - laptop was struggling a little bit
02:19 - with some of my videos you'll see the
02:20 - lag in there and so i was like i'm just
02:22 - gonna do this on the mac and see if it
02:23 - works better so when i run this i get a
02:25 - nice message it's a palindrome checker
02:27 - enter a word or enter
02:28 - q superman not a palindrome
02:32 - like share subscribe
02:36 - no you can still do it though let's try
02:38 - mom
02:39 - yes it is a palindrome race car yes it
02:42 - is what if one of them is capital
02:44 - race car with a capital r at the front a
02:46 - still works so it must be dropping it
02:48 - down to lower case which is great
02:50 - and then q a and it quits but this is
02:53 - done using
02:54 - character indexing in the string not
02:57 - using word reversal
02:58 - and that's what makes this an end to
03:00 - unit project that's what makes this a
03:01 - little bit more
03:02 - challenging give it a try see if you can
03:04 - do it you're really going to need to
03:05 - understand
03:06 - loops and indexing and all that stuff
03:08 - and just
03:09 - small teacher moment real quick if you
03:11 - made it this far
03:12 - you know you're clearly taking it
03:14 - somewhat seriously which is awesome
03:16 - anyone can google you know palindrome
03:18 - checker python
03:19 - or palindrome checkered loops python
03:22 - that's great
03:23 - but it's actually writing the code where
03:25 - you're gonna have your learning it's
03:26 - it's having the struggle
03:28 - where you're gonna learn you know if you
03:30 - just watch me and you google stuff
03:31 - you're going to
03:32 - retain 10 maybe 20 of any of this
03:35 - if you want to actually use this and
03:37 - your plan is to build off of this
03:39 - foundational skill
03:40 - you got to do that piece you got to
03:42 - actually struggle a little bit so
03:44 - go try it on your own see if you can get
03:45 - there hit me up in the comments with
03:47 - your success or failure or frustration
03:49 - or whatever
03:50 - and we'll see you back in unit number
03:51 - five
03:54 - and don't forget if you like what i'm
03:55 - doing like share subscribe and we'll see
03:57 - you back here
03:58 - real soon see ya
