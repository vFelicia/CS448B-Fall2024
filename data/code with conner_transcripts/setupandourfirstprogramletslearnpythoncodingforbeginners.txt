00:02 - hello humans
00:04 - welcome to code with connor this is your
00:06 - first time here
00:08 - thanks for coming in we're going to
00:09 - learn some python in this video series
00:12 - so if this is video 1a so we're going to
00:14 - start unit one by just introducing what
00:16 - python is
00:16 - uh talk a little bit what you need to do
00:18 - to get set up and get coding we'll give
00:20 - you a few options so that you can code
00:22 - along
00:22 - uh with these videos uh and then we'll
00:25 - kind of get rolling from there if you
00:26 - wanna learn more about me
00:28 - uh let me know in the comments and i'll
00:29 - post a video about it but for right now
00:31 - we'll just stick to the code so if
00:33 - you're here you're probably interested
00:34 - in learning something about python maybe
00:36 - somebody told you can make a lot of
00:37 - money
00:37 - uh as a programmer uh maybe you just
00:40 - want to know it because you think it's
00:41 - cool and it's got a cool sound a name
00:42 - either way
00:43 - i'm glad you're here first thing you're
00:45 - going to need is you're going to need
00:46 - the ability to
00:47 - run python scripts now i'm going to go
00:49 - through a series of instructions over
00:50 - the next few minutes
00:51 - about installing this stuff on a windows
00:53 - computer it'll be a very similar process
00:55 - on a mac os or a linux machine
00:57 - if you're going to be running this on a
00:58 - chromebook or a tablet or a phone
01:01 - you can just check in the call in the
01:02 - description of the video and i'll i'll
01:04 - chapter this thing up you can skip ahead
01:06 - to the section where i'll talk about
01:08 - some options you can use if you're doing
01:09 - it mobile let's get into it i'm just on
01:11 - chrome here
01:12 - and i've just gone to the python website
01:13 - it's python.org
01:15 - and i clicked on downloads okay so
01:17 - you're gonna need to download python to
01:19 - your computer
01:19 - so i'm gonna download python 3.91 this
01:22 - is the latest version of when i'm
01:23 - recording this video
01:24 - if python 4 is out when you're watching
01:26 - it you should probably download python 3
01:29 - just because i imagine there'll be some
01:30 - major changes as they move from 3 to 4.
01:33 - so make sure you note where you download
01:35 - it
01:36 - download chrome's going to download the
01:39 - file and i'm going to open it up
01:41 - so it's going to ask me if there's one
01:43 - important piece here when you install
01:44 - this on a windows machine
01:46 - because of how we're going to use python
01:48 - it's really helpful for us
01:50 - if we add python as a path okay and this
01:52 - is going to allow us in powershell to
01:53 - use the python command
01:55 - which is just fantastic and it makes
01:56 - running our simple programs
01:58 - while we're learning really easy so
02:00 - we're going to do that cool install now
02:06 - awesome
02:11 - there we go python's installed close
02:15 - awesome now writing your actual python
02:17 - code
02:18 - you can use an ide an integrated
02:20 - development environment there's large
02:21 - scale ones there's tiny ones
02:23 - when i'm writing python i'm writing
02:24 - small scripts i'm teaching people
02:26 - i don't need the big convoluted
02:28 - debugging tools and all of that
02:30 - so i'm going to go to my go my go-to
02:31 - favorite and this is what i'm going to
02:32 - use in the videos
02:33 - notepad plus plus i love notepad plus
02:37 - plus
02:38 - if we hop over here to download you can
02:40 - go in here and you can download the
02:42 - latest version so here's the 7.88
02:44 - release
02:46 - click on that and then you can download
02:48 - it to your windows machine
02:49 - again take note of where you download it
02:51 - and then we're going to run the
02:52 - installer
02:54 - so i'm going to download the 64-bit
02:56 - installer here
02:59 - and we'll save it
03:03 - and we'll launch it
03:06 - choose a language
03:10 - we go next accept
03:14 - next next
03:19 - and just like that we are up and running
03:23 - pam there we go so notepad plus plus
03:26 - is installed so these two things
03:28 - together are going to be our environment
03:30 - we're going to write our code in notepad
03:32 - plus plus then we're going to use python
03:34 - which is installed on the computer
03:35 - to actually run it now that we have nova
03:37 - plus plus installed and we have python
03:39 - installed
03:40 - we're ready to start kind of writing
03:41 - code we're going to write our code in
03:43 - notepad plus plus
03:44 - we're going to use windows powershell to
03:46 - actually run our code so
03:48 - first time we pull up windows powershell
03:50 - all we're going to do
03:52 - is we're going to start menu and we're
03:54 - going to type power
03:56 - this is one of many ways to do it and
03:58 - then once we launch powershell it's
03:59 - going to look something like this
04:01 - it's called windows powershell now it
04:02 - might bring you to a different drive
04:03 - obviously
04:04 - than the one i'm in so the one thing
04:06 - we're going to need to do from an
04:07 - organization standpoint is you're going
04:08 - to want a folder on your pc
04:10 - where you're going to save all your
04:11 - python scripts so you can make it
04:12 - something simple like you can navigate
04:14 - to this pc
04:16 - to your c drive whatever and then you
04:18 - can do it that way so
04:19 - so on your computer if you are on your
04:22 - pc
04:23 - and you go to your c drive this is one
04:25 - of the easiest things
04:26 - if you just right click and make a new
04:28 - folder
04:30 - call it like share subscribe
04:35 - right and then that folder can be where
04:37 - we save all of our python scripts
04:39 - so this way it's going to make it easy
04:41 - for us to access it so if we hop over
04:43 - here
04:44 - to our powershell we can see that if i
04:47 - go to c
04:48 - colon and i hit enter and then
04:52 - i'm going to use a couple of commands so
04:54 - i can do cd dot dot it takes me back one
04:56 - directory so you'll see
04:58 - i go from my folder back to users i can
05:01 - do it again
05:02 - now i'm back in c drive there's another
05:04 - command called cd space and you can put
05:05 - the name of a directory
05:07 - so like and i can hit tab at any point
05:10 - it'll try to autofill it
05:11 - like share subscribe i hit enter and now
05:14 - i'm inside of that folder
05:15 - so i'm in c colon like share subscribe
05:18 - and so this is where i'll be when i run
05:20 - commands
05:21 - if you ever want to clear your
05:22 - powershell you can do cls
05:25 - and it's gone okay you know pretty
05:27 - simple set of commands that we're going
05:28 - to use you
05:29 - you'll sometimes use cd dot dot or
05:31 - you'll use cd space and then start
05:33 - typing in a folder name
05:35 - and the last command we'll use will be
05:36 - python and we'll use that in just a
05:38 - minute
05:39 - so let's hop over here to our notepad
05:41 - plus plus
05:42 - and our powershell environments in
05:44 - notepad plus plus we'll go over just a
05:46 - very quick program
05:47 - and then we're going to end this video
05:49 - and then we'll get ready for moving on
05:50 - to the next one we're actually diving
05:52 - into stuff a little bit more so the very
05:53 - first program that we write in the world
05:55 - of programming and software development
05:56 - is always the hello world program and
05:58 - it seems to be going on for a long time
06:00 - it was the first program i wrote in java
06:01 - back
06:02 - i don't know 20 years ago and it's still
06:04 - the first program i teach my students so
06:06 - it looks something like this in python
06:07 - we're going to type print
06:09 - and we're going to open a set of
06:11 - parentheses parentheses are our curved
06:13 - brackets
06:14 - and then in quotation marks so quotation
06:16 - marks are just left to the enter key on
06:17 - your keyboard
06:18 - we're going to write hello world
06:22 - exclamation point then we're going to
06:24 - close our quotation marks
06:25 - and we're going to close our parentheses
06:27 - it's important in coding and you'll see
06:29 - this if you've learned any html or
06:30 - anything before
06:31 - that what we open we have to close all
06:33 - right so we open the brackets we open
06:35 - the quotes
06:36 - we type it we close we close and then
06:38 - we're going to go through the process
06:39 - how we run it so we're going to save
06:41 - this
06:41 - so i'm going to go to file and this one
06:43 - time i'm going to do save as
06:45 - but from now on i'm just going to do
06:47 - file save
06:48 - and i'm going to find my folder c drive
06:51 - like share subscribe and we're going to
06:54 - call this
06:55 - hello world dot p y and the dot p y is
06:58 - important
06:59 - because the dot p y is a file extension
07:01 - that tells windows this is a python
07:03 - script
07:03 - it also will tell python to read it as
07:05 - such and i hit save
07:07 - you'll notice my notepad plus plus is
07:09 - color coded once you save it as a dot py
07:12 - nobel plus plus will recognize python
07:14 - code and help color code
07:16 - elements for you until you've saved it
07:18 - it's not going to do that it's just
07:19 - going to see raw text
07:21 - so it's helpful to save your files at
07:22 - the beginning so you get those nice
07:24 - colors
07:25 - to help you kind of organize your code
07:27 - so now when it's time to run it we
07:29 - actually
07:30 - will leave nova plus plus and go to
07:32 - powershell
07:33 - and in here we're going to type python
07:35 - space
07:36 - and then we're going to type the name of
07:37 - the file and again we don't take the
07:39 - whole name
07:40 - we can hit tab at any point that we
07:42 - think we have enough characters to make
07:43 - it unique
07:44 - and there it is pythonhelloworld.py and
07:46 - when i hit enter
07:49 - it prints to the console hello world
07:51 - exclamation point
07:52 - so it printed the literal string that
07:55 - was inside of these quotation marks it
07:57 - didn't print the quotes it didn't print
07:59 - the brackets
08:00 - it just printed the characters that were
08:02 - inside of that
08:03 - so you could change that you know we
08:05 - could make that say something else
08:06 - like share subscribe
08:10 - right and we save our file hop over to
08:14 - powershell
08:16 - and there it is it's changed what's
08:18 - being printed remember
08:20 - at any point cls will clear our
08:22 - powershell window away
08:24 - so one other thing that is sometimes
08:26 - useful when we're writing our programs
08:28 - is
08:28 - sometimes we want to put notes in our
08:30 - code that don't actually get executed or
08:32 - run
08:33 - so we can do a single line comment using
08:34 - a hashtag so hashtag
08:36 - single line comment and this
08:40 - will not execute it won't affect how our
08:42 - code runs so if i save it
08:43 - now i'm using control s to save you can
08:46 - click file save
08:47 - it's all the same and then i run it
08:50 - oops you'll notice i'm not retyping oh
08:53 - what am i doing
08:54 - ah it's a crazy shortcut if i press the
08:57 - up
08:57 - arrow in powershell and i can press it
08:59 - more than once it'll bring up previously
09:01 - entered commands
09:02 - so it's a nice way to save some time hit
09:04 - enter
09:06 - you'll see it didn't affect how the
09:07 - program ran at all
09:09 - and i can do the same with multi-line
09:11 - comments so instead
09:12 - you can use triple single quotes so
09:15 - these are next to the enter key without
09:16 - holding down shift
09:19 - three of them to open three of them to
09:21 - close this
09:22 - is a multi-line comment
09:27 - and you can go as much as you want in
09:29 - between those triple quotes
09:31 - again save and
09:34 - run up enter and you'll see it did not
09:37 - affect the execution of the code
09:39 - at all okay so as far as your layout
09:42 - goes you're probably going to have a
09:43 - powershell window and a nobel plus plus
09:45 - window
09:45 - you'll probably be switching between
09:47 - them a lot i like to use alt
09:49 - tab on a windows machine to cycle
09:51 - between them but again you can click
09:52 - your way through it
09:53 - so this is the setup that i use when i'm
09:55 - on a windows computer or mac computer
09:58 - to do my coding and this is what i'll be
09:59 - doing in all of my videos
10:01 - let's just say that you don't have
10:02 - access to that type of system you still
10:04 - want to code along i'm going to show you
10:05 - my favorite
10:06 - recommended online ide that you can use
10:09 - to do this
10:10 - so let's check it out so my favorite is
10:12 - a website called codehscodehs.org and
10:16 - i'll throw a link in the description
10:18 - on cody jess you can go you can create a
10:20 - free account with google and they have a
10:22 - sandbox on code hs
10:23 - and what i love about the codehs sandbox
10:25 - so i can do my hello world
10:28 - uh cwc just so it distinguishes it for
10:31 - the
10:31 - code with connor create program now you
10:34 - can code in a lot of languages on here
10:35 - so the two that we'll use in this video
10:37 - series would be
10:38 - python3 and we might look at a couple
10:41 - that involve turtle graphics which would
10:42 - be the python turtle
10:43 - so if i just go to python 3 create my
10:46 - program
10:47 - it's going to give me an online coding
10:49 - interface you'll notice it defaulted to
10:51 - the hello world
10:52 - program and i can click run code and it
10:55 - gives me a little
10:56 - display right over here this is great
10:58 - it's all self-contained you can do it in
11:00 - a browser you can do it on a chromebook
11:02 - whatever and you'll be able to follow
11:03 - along with pretty much everything we do
11:04 - here you can even have multiple files in
11:06 - a single project
11:07 - if that's your thing you can even change
11:10 - your editor settings
11:11 - right you can throw down like an old
11:13 - school terminal vibe
11:15 - you can maximize your editor so another
11:17 - great resource now i use this with my
11:19 - students as well because there's some
11:20 - learning tools
11:21 - amazing learning content built in again
11:24 - not a sponsor
11:25 - just love the site so this would be my
11:28 - preferred online ide if you're going to
11:29 - follow the course
11:30 - i'll make sure things work with this
11:33 - obviously there's a there's a ton of
11:34 - other options out there there's replica
11:35 - and there's others
11:37 - and you're going to kind of find the one
11:38 - that you're interested in but that's how
11:39 - i'm going to do it so
11:40 - in the event that you want to do this
11:42 - without using the windows setup
11:45 - this would be my option that i would
11:46 - recommend for you so that's the end of
11:48 - the first video
11:49 - hopefully that makes sense for you and
11:52 - hopefully that gives you kind of just
11:53 - that initial setup
11:55 - i didn't really talk much about the
11:56 - language and about programming kind of
11:58 - in a theoretical sense
11:59 - we'll hit on that a bit more in the next
12:00 - video when we actually start coding
12:02 - talking about variables and and really
12:04 - execution
12:05 - and what coding is thanks for watching
12:08 - don't forget to like subscribe
12:09 - share the videos and i hope you enjoy
12:11 - comment and i'll hit you back
12:13 - have a great day
