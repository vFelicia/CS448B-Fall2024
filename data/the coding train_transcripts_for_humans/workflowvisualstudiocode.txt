With timestamps:

00:00 - - Okay, so now I'm going to look at
00:02 - Microsoft Visual Studio Code.
00:05 - I mostly just refer to
it as Visual Studio Code
00:07 - but it's important to like understand
00:08 - the mechanics and interests
of where these tools come from
00:11 - and how they're being made.
00:13 - So this is put out by Microsoft,
00:14 - I've already downloaded here,
00:16 - this is a fresh user
account on this machine
00:19 - so there's nothing
installed or configured.
00:21 - So I'm doing all this from scratch.
00:23 - But I did already download it.
00:24 - All you need to do,
00:25 - if you want to use, try
using Visual Studio Code,
00:28 - is to go to the visual
Studio Code website.
00:30 - Once you've downloaded it,
00:32 - then you can go ahead and run it.
00:34 - And here it is.
00:37 - When you first run it,
oh it's going to send me
00:40 - through a different browser
to some getting started page
00:43 - which you could look at and by the way
00:45 - ah!
00:46 - In the last video I called them plugins.
00:48 - They're called extensions.
00:49 - So these you can see are
the various extensions
00:51 - you can
00:53 - you can install.
00:55 - I'm going to quit out of here.
00:56 - And it's giving us a
little welcome message
01:00 - I can,
01:00 - uncheck this
01:01 - 'cause maybe I don't want to
see the welcome message anymore
01:04 - and so now that I have
Visual Studio Code open,
01:06 - the first thing I want to show you
01:07 - is just I can make a new file,
01:10 - and I'm going to hit command S for save,
01:12 - and I'm just going to
put this on the desktop.
01:15 - And I'm going to say, like as if
I'm going to write a p5 sketch.
01:18 - I'm going to say sketch.js.
01:20 - And then I'm going to say
like, function, setup,
01:24 - ah!
01:25 - It's so tiny!
01:26 - I can't see it, can you see it?
01:28 - It's so tiny!
01:30 - Function, draw.
01:32 - So here's the thing,
01:33 - immediately you might see,
01:35 - okay my eyesight is not this good,
01:37 - I want to make the font size bigger,
01:39 - I don't like this color scheme,
01:41 - I want to change the color scheme.
01:42 - Most of these things can be
done through the preferences.
01:46 - So if I go up to code
01:49 - preferences and then settings.
01:51 - Now there's extensions again,
which I'm going to talk about.
01:54 - And oh this looks actually
different than the last time
01:56 - I used it.
01:57 - (laughs)
01:58 - but you can see here, editor font size.
01:59 - So one thing I want to do
02:01 - is I'm just going to change this to 36.
02:05 - And hit enter.
02:07 - And I'm going to hit close.
02:09 - And we can see now I have
a much bigger font size.
02:11 - Now you can also actually
change all of the settings
02:15 - in a secret json file.
02:16 - It's not so secret.
02:18 - I have to figure out how to find that.
02:19 - (chuckles)
02:21 - Because that's how I used to do it,
02:22 - but this is a new feature.
02:24 - So where do I find that?
02:25 - Oops.
02:26 - So let's look for it.
02:27 - Preferences, settings,
let's go back to settings.
02:32 - Let's see if
02:34 - I can change that.
02:35 - Show, oh!
02:36 - There we go, open settings.json
02:39 - (chuckles)
02:40 - And you can see this is actually
where all the settings are.
02:44 - They're actually all just
here in this big json file
02:47 - and then I need more room to
be able to see all this stuff.
02:50 - You can see here, now
I have user settings,
02:53 - I can just put extra things
that are overwritten there.
02:56 - So maybe I just want to use the Gooey.
02:59 - So I'm going to close this,
03:00 - I encourage you to look through this.
03:02 - Oh, oh, here we go.
03:03 - Tab size, the number of spaces a tab,
03:06 - no no no no no.
03:07 - Two spaces.
03:09 - (chuckles)
03:10 - And I don't want them to be tabs,
03:11 - I want them to be spaces.
03:12 - I'm not going to worry about that.
03:13 - You should use four, you should use three.
03:15 - Blow, blow peoples minds,
use three space tabs, whoa!
03:19 - Don't worry about this
sort of stuff too much.
03:21 - So that's really important.
03:24 - I could probably, this
video could be 10 hours long
03:27 - showing all the customization stuff.
03:29 - I don't use too much of that frankly.
03:32 - Okay, the other thing that's really useful
03:34 - which was, if I close this
out, which is right here is,
03:38 - show all commands.
03:39 - So I'm going to show you a command
03:41 - that you can run that I love.
03:42 - So one thing that I
often really like to do,
03:44 - like here I am, I'm going to
be showing you more about iTerm
03:48 - in a bit,
03:49 - but one thing that I like to do,
03:51 - I'm going to go cd which
is change directory,
03:54 - go to the desktop, and
then I'm going to type ls
03:56 - for list,
03:57 - look!
03:58 - There's this sketch.js file.
03:59 - I'm working in terminal
and what I want to do,
04:01 - is I want to open that
file and I want to edit it,
04:04 - in Visual Studio Code.
04:06 - Well I could go to Visual Studio Code
04:07 - and I could do command
o and I could find it,
04:10 - but something that I like to do very often
04:11 - is actually type a command in like this,
04:14 - code sketch.js and ah!
04:16 - Command not found.
04:17 - So,
04:19 - this is something that Visual
Studio Code has available
04:21 - for you, and the easiest
way to find it is by saying
04:24 - shift command P,
04:26 - shift command P
04:28 - then I'm going to, it's right
there 'cause I looked for it
04:30 - earlier, recently used,
04:32 - but what you're going to
want to do is type s-h-e-l-l.
04:37 - I'm going to zoom in here and
you're going to see shell command
04:39 - install code.
04:41 - You don't want to uninstall,
you want to install.
04:42 - So this installs the code command in PATH.
04:45 - PATH!
04:48 - Just going to write down the word PATH.
04:51 - More important than what you're
using for any of this stuff
04:55 - is how you're computer
finds what you're using.
04:59 - And your computer finds what you're using
05:01 - through this like,
05:02 - variable that's just sitting
in your computer's guts
05:05 - called PATH where it's,
05:06 - keeping track of all these directories
05:09 - where it needs to find stuff.
05:10 - So this is actually a
really important concept
05:12 - and we'll come up again and
again throughout these tools.
05:17 - Alright, so now let's do
install code command in PATH.
05:21 - It's going to need admin privileges,
05:23 - this is a temporary
account with no password.
05:25 - It did it.
05:26 - now interestingly enough, in
theory it shouldn't work now.
05:30 - I hope it doesn't work.
05:31 - Oh it did work!
05:32 - SO you know what,
05:34 - sometimes when you install
something new to the PATH,
05:38 - you're terminal, your console,
05:40 - your shell hasn't reloaded the new PATH
05:44 - so you have to quit and restart it again.
05:46 - But it did happen to work.
05:47 - So now anywhere I am on this computer,
05:49 - I can just type code,
05:50 - I could do like, cd, documents,
05:56 - and I can say, code,
and I can say code dot.
05:58 - And now it's actually opening
up my documents folder
06:02 - in Visual Studio Code.
06:03 - Now there's nothing in
the documents folder,
06:06 - it would be nice if I put
some stuff on this machine.
06:08 - But if you're in a directory,
06:09 - you can open up the whole thing.
06:10 - So the other thing that I like to do,
06:12 - is use extensions.
06:14 - So let's find those.
06:15 - Again, I barely use this program.
06:17 - So this is extensions here.
06:20 - So, there's so many different
kinds of extensions for git,
06:24 - and languages and syntax and
everybody has their favorites.
06:27 - But ha, here's one that I love.
06:29 - Beautify.
06:30 - Beautify code in place for VS code.
06:33 - So let's try to install that.
06:36 - Js beautiful for VS code, did it install?
06:39 - I think so, sometimes
you have to hit reload
06:42 - to like, make sure it
like, actually loads.
06:45 - So then, I should be able to go back here
06:48 - and I should be able to do things like,
06:51 - oops, whoa,
06:52 - oh there's a lot, a lot
of auto complete stuff.
06:54 - Which I haven't necessarily
gotten a handle on.
06:57 - And I'm going to do things
with weird, weird indentation,
07:04 - making me crazy,
07:06 - I can barely look at it.
07:15 - So what if what I want to
do is beautify this code,
07:18 - I have the package installed,
07:21 - is it maybe,
07:23 - is there a built in keyboard
shortcut with this package?
07:26 - I actually think there is.
07:26 - Command B.
07:27 - No.
07:28 - Command B does something else.
07:30 - So I think I need to find the
key mappings or the settings,
07:33 - so let's go back to
preferences, extensions,
07:38 - beautify, and then here,
07:40 - let's look through the documentation.
07:44 - There are some settings
07:46 - that you can change.
07:51 - And I think keyboard shortcut,
that's what I'm looking for.
07:52 - Ah!
07:53 - Use the following
07:54 - to embed a beautify shortcut
in keybindings.json.
07:59 - So I can actually take this here,
08:03 - copy it.
08:04 - Now I want to go into go, view,
somewhere is the keybindings.
08:08 - File,
08:10 - preferences,
08:11 - keyboard shortcuts, maybe that's it?
08:14 - Oh yes,
08:15 - here we go, I found it already.
08:16 - Okay look, so you can see
these are all the keybindings
08:19 - and you can actually edit
them and change them,
08:22 - but you can also go to this,
08:24 - edit keybindings.json file.
08:26 - I'm going to do that.
08:28 - And then I could put new keybindings,
08:29 - you can see that's where they all,
08:30 - all of these keys are here
08:32 - and I guess I can put my new one here.
08:35 - And command b will use this beautify
08:38 - and by the way, I think Visual
Studio comes with it's own
08:41 - beautification,
08:42 - this is an extra plugin
that does more stuff.
08:44 - So hopefully now if I close this,
08:46 - and close this. and close
this, and close this,
08:49 - and now,
08:51 - I'm going to hit command b.
08:53 - (drum roll)
08:54 - No!
08:56 - Command HookyQR beautify not found.
08:58 - What did I do wrong?
09:01 - Reload.
09:02 - Let's try reload.
09:04 - Okay now it's enabled.
09:05 - Some reason this reload thing
09:07 - I never figured that out,
09:08 - but let's try hitting command b again.
09:10 - (drum roll)
09:13 - Yay!
09:14 - Oooh, what?
09:15 - No, no, no.
09:16 - That can't possibly be it!
09:18 - What's going on, oh!
09:19 - There's errors in the code!
09:21 - Well see this is why you want to,
09:23 - I need another buzzer sound.
09:25 - This why
09:26 - (buzzing)
you want to
09:27 - use beautify.
09:28 - Because it didn't do it correctly,
09:29 - oh I made all sorts of weird things,
09:30 - first of all, there needs to
be an open curly bracket here.
09:33 - (drum roll)
09:33 - And by the way, in p5 the
function name is createCanvas.
09:37 - Now if I hit command b
09:38 - I'm going to stop with
the silly drum thing,
09:40 - there we go.
09:41 - So there we go, now
09:43 - (claps twice)
09:44 - beautify works.
09:45 - Now there is a way to
get it to work on save.
09:50 - 'cause I really like to do that.
09:53 - So in other words, just
every time I hit save,
09:56 - it beautifies the code.
09:59 - Let's go back to the
beautify and let's see,
10:04 - let's see,
10:05 - on save.
10:06 - (laughs)
10:07 - Actually don't know,
like, beautify will say,
10:09 - ah!
10:10 - Beautify on save will be enabled
10:12 - when editor format on save is true.
10:16 - Okay, so I have to go back
to the extension settings.
10:20 - (laughs)
10:21 - This is a tutorial
about Visual Studio Code
10:23 - for somebody who doesn't
really know how to use this.
10:25 - But this is good that I'm learning this.
10:28 - And then I want to go to extensions
10:31 - beautify config
10:33 - edit and settings.json,
10:35 - here we go.
10:38 - Which is, this is actually
the right place to put it.
10:40 - True.
10:41 - So this should do that.
10:44 - So now, save, there we go.
10:46 - Now the truth of the matter is,
10:47 - it didn't actually do everything
maybe I wanted it to do,
10:49 - like maybe I would have preferred it
10:51 - got rid of a lot of white space,
10:52 - but this is all configurable, I'm sure.
10:55 - Okay, so what, have I,
10:57 - yeah I've barely scratched
the surface here,
10:59 - but I'm using
11:00 - Visual Studio Code to edit text,
11:03 - I'm sure there's a p5 extension,
11:05 - that you can use to know
about the p5 functions.
11:07 - I'm using the beautify
plugin, extension, sorry,
11:11 - to beautify,
11:12 - but I'm really just trying
to show you about extensions.
11:14 - And I'm also able to
launch it from terminal.
11:16 - So, the next thing that I need to do
11:20 - is look at, we've kind of covered this.
11:24 - How I want to have console access
11:28 - how I want to access the shell
11:30 - to be able to run node commands
11:32 - to start up servers
11:34 - to set up a virtual
environment for Python,
11:37 - for anything that I want
to do via shell access.
11:40 - So that's what I'm going to do next.
11:41 - (upbeat music)

Cleaned transcript:

Okay, so now I'm going to look at Microsoft Visual Studio Code. I mostly just refer to it as Visual Studio Code but it's important to like understand the mechanics and interests of where these tools come from and how they're being made. So this is put out by Microsoft, I've already downloaded here, this is a fresh user account on this machine so there's nothing installed or configured. So I'm doing all this from scratch. But I did already download it. All you need to do, if you want to use, try using Visual Studio Code, is to go to the visual Studio Code website.

They're called extensions. So these you can see are the various extensions you can you can install. I'm going to quit out of here. And it's giving us a little welcome message I can, uncheck this 'cause maybe I don't want to see the welcome message anymore and so now that I have Visual Studio Code open, the first thing I want to show you is just I can make a new file, and I'm going to hit command S for save, and I'm just going to put this on the desktop.

Most of these things can be done through the preferences. So if I go up to code preferences and then settings. Now there's extensions again, which I'm going to talk about.

So I'm going to close this, I encourage you to look through this. Oh, oh, here we go. Tab size, the number of spaces a tab, no no no no no. Two spaces. (chuckles) And I don't want them to be tabs, I want them to be spaces. I'm not going to worry about that. You should use four, you should use three. Blow, blow peoples minds, use three space tabs, whoa! Don't worry about this sort of stuff too much. So that's really important. I could probably, this video could be 10 hours long showing all the customization stuff. I don't use too much of that frankly. Okay, the other thing that's really useful which was, if I close this out, which is right here is, show all commands. So I'm going to show you a command that you can run that I love. So one thing that I often really like to do, like here I am, I'm going to be showing you more about iTerm in a bit, but one thing that I like to do, I'm going to go cd which is change directory, go to the desktop, and then I'm going to type ls for list, look!

Let's go back to the beautify and let's see, let's see, on save. (laughs) Actually don't know, like, beautify will say, ah! Beautify on save will be enabled when editor format on save is true. Okay, so I have to go back to the extension settings. (laughs) This is a tutorial about Visual Studio Code for somebody who doesn't really know how to use this. But this is good that I'm learning this. And then I want to go to extensions beautify config edit and settings.json, here we go. Which is, this is actually the right place to put it. True. So this should do that. So now, save, there we go. Now the truth of the matter is, it didn't actually do everything maybe I wanted it to do, like maybe I would have preferred it got rid of a lot of white space, but this is all configurable, I'm sure. Okay, so what, have I, yeah I've barely scratched the surface here, but I'm using Visual Studio Code to edit text, I'm sure there's a p5 extension, that you can use to know about the p5 functions. I'm using the beautify plugin, extension, sorry, to beautify, but I'm really just trying to show you about extensions. And I'm also able to launch it from terminal. So, the next thing that I need to do is look at, we've kind of covered this. How I want to have console access how I want to access the shell to be able to run node commands to start up servers to set up a virtual environment for Python, for anything that I want to do via shell access. So that's what I'm going to do next. (upbeat music)
