00:00 - okay we're still working with our data
00:02 - at some point we're gonna start training
00:05 - a model what have I done so far okay so
00:07 - just to recap for a second I've got this
00:11 - whole database of crowd-sourced colors
00:14 - with a label and now I've converted all
00:17 - that stuff to tensors so and I'm just
00:19 - looking at the inputs now the inputs
00:21 - that I want to use for my machine
00:22 - learning model so I 5643 RGB values so
00:27 - the shape of the tensor is 5060 or 43
00:30 - comma 3 and I can look at it here I have
00:32 - all the RGB values normalized to 0
00:34 - between 0 and 1 now I need to do the
00:38 - wise I need to figure out what are the
00:40 - target outputs associated with each RGB
00:43 - value and this is exciting because we
00:46 - are going to cover we being me and you
00:48 - being the person watching I am going to
00:50 - cover a concept known as one hot
00:52 - encoding so we have to understand why
00:56 - we're going to do one hot encoding I
00:58 - need to jump all the way to what would
01:01 - essentially be like the very end of this
01:03 - video series what am I asking the neural
01:06 - network that I'm gonna build right the
01:07 - neural network that I've been in build
01:08 - is gonna have three inputs are GB it's
01:12 - gonna have some architecture some
01:13 - configuration of all the stuff in the
01:15 - middle the inputs being RGB what do I
01:20 - want the outputs to be the output should
01:22 - be a label right I want to say is it
01:26 - reddish is it blue ish but this is just
01:30 - the label that we I've used as a human
01:32 - being to say what I think it is like if
01:35 - I was doing image classification the
01:36 - label would be cat or dog or rainbow or
01:38 - unicorn but those strings are not going
01:42 - to be meaningful in the sort of numbers
01:44 - based neural network system that I'm
01:46 - building
01:47 - I need this to return a number so we
01:50 - could think if there are nine possible
01:52 - labels I could return the number zero
01:54 - one two three four five six seven or
01:57 - eight now while I could try to do
02:01 - something where I just have one output
02:02 - and that's a floating-point number that
02:04 - kind of around till the nearest integer
02:07 - that indicates the label that's not
02:08 - going to work so well what I actually
02:10 - really want is I want a prop
02:12 - value I want a probability value for
02:15 - each one of these labels so we could
02:17 - imagine if there are nine labels
02:20 - why don't nine is such I should've made
02:21 - a ten if I could go back double back in
02:24 - time start this whole series over I
02:26 - would have made Ted labels because all
02:28 - this would be so much easier to work out
02:29 - but imagine there are nine labels I
02:31 - don't know why I'm drawing it like this
02:32 - but one two three four five six seven
02:35 - eight nine and what if I had a
02:36 - probability like oh there's a 10% chance
02:39 - it's the first label and there's a 20%
02:42 - chance it's the second label in the zero
02:45 - zero zero zero and then a 70 percent
02:47 - chance
02:47 - zero zero right all of these values
02:50 - might add up to 100% and we could say ah
02:54 - it's most likely this one which is index
02:59 - zero one two three four five six which
03:02 - maps to you know purplish so I'm trying
03:07 - to create the target outputs if I know
03:09 - that this particular color should be
03:12 - purplish the target output that I want
03:16 - is actually zero zero zero zero zero
03:19 - zero one zero zero zero one two three
03:24 - four five six seven eight nine labels
03:26 - zero through eight indices this is one
03:29 - hot encoding I am taking the idea of
03:32 - index six and making a vector a 1
03:36 - dimensional vector full of zeros with a
03:39 - 1 in the spot that matches the label a
03:43 - 100% chance because if the neural
03:46 - network was working perfectly this is
03:48 - the output that I would get so one hot
03:51 - encoding is the idea of creating your
03:54 - vector having all zeros and sort of
03:57 - flipping a bit on in a way and just one
03:59 - of them a switch goes on and that's
04:00 - assigned one now I could come up with an
04:03 - algorithm pretty easily
04:05 - probably not easily but I could work
04:07 - hard on it and try it would be hard and
04:08 - I could say take all of my labels and I
04:12 - could convert every single label into an
04:14 - array with a 1 in the right spot luckily
04:16 - for us we're using tension flow j s and
04:18 - it has a function called TF 1 hot so I'm
04:23 - going to create the Y's for this
04:25 - system using the TF dot one-hot function
04:28 - and that's what I'm gonna go do next all
04:32 - right so let's go look at the code and
04:34 - now what I need to do I made this colors
04:37 - array now let me make this labels array
04:40 - and if I say labels dot push now here's
04:45 - the thing what I want is for this I mean
04:48 - I could just push the label in it so
04:49 - let's just do that a record label let's
04:53 - just look at this real quick and I'm
04:56 - going to comment out the console logging
04:59 - and I'm gonna say console dot log labels
05:03 - so let's just see this should be right
05:05 - this is all the labels the strings of
05:07 - the labels so the first thing I need to
05:09 - do is convert each one of these into an
05:11 - index value so I need a mapping for that
05:14 - all right so I need to find my list of
05:17 - labels I could just type them out labels
05:20 - oh no but uh all labels equals I could
05:27 - say I could say label list let me call
05:29 - it like the list and a grayish blueish
05:32 - but I have that right here right in
05:33 - crowdsource color when I made those
05:35 - buttons these are all the labels 1 2 3 4
05:38 - 5 6 7 8 9 so if I come back to what I'm
05:41 - doing here and just put this here and
05:42 - then let me just do a find replace
05:46 - whoops let me do a find replace for just
05:54 - this I just need to get rid of this yes
05:58 - you're watching me like failing at doing
06:02 - fine replace and then let me look for
06:06 - ish and replace that with ish comma
06:13 - there we go now I have my array my label
06:17 - list array so now what I want to put in
06:20 - in the labels array is not the actual
06:23 - string of the label but label list index
06:27 - of that label so the index of function I
06:31 - need another parenthesis there the index
06:33 - of function will say look for this
06:35 - particular element in the array
06:36 - and giving back its index so let's look
06:39 - at that now let me run this again
06:42 - and we can see there we go now I have
06:44 - five thousand six hundred and forty
06:46 - three index values and guess what this
06:51 - is when I now want to go and I apologize
06:53 - and I wrote TF dot one hot up there you
06:56 - can't see it so let me just write that
06:58 - again TF one hot is the name of the
07:01 - function let's go to the tensorflow
07:03 - j s documentation page right over here
07:07 - and look i already have it open to one
07:09 - hot how convenient
07:10 - and basically this documentation let's
07:13 - see if we can understand this i need to
07:15 - give it all the indices that's what I
07:17 - already have I mean oh but you know what
07:19 - these have to be a tensor already so
07:22 - first I need to make a tensor of all
07:24 - those indices let's do that so I want to
07:28 - say let label tensor tensor tensor
07:34 - labels tensor let's call it equal TF
07:37 - tensor 1d labels and let's say let's
07:42 - just look at that label tensor labels
07:45 - tensor dot print let's just make sure
07:49 - that's kind of right we can see that's a
07:51 - big long tensor of all of the labels and
07:55 - then now the wise is TF dot one hot so
08:00 - if I go back and look at this one hot
08:04 - needs the list of all of those index
08:07 - values which are zero through eight and
08:09 - the depth the depth means how many
08:11 - possibilities are there and there are
08:13 - nine possibilities a non value will
08:16 - default to 1 and the off value defaults
08:18 - to zero but if I presume reason I wanted
08:19 - to one Haughton code with three the
08:22 - number three for every spot in the
08:23 - number point one for every non spot I
08:26 - could change those values but all I need
08:28 - to do then is say one hot labels tensor
08:33 - and um nine and then I could say wise
08:39 - dot print so X's dot print and wise
08:44 - doctrine so now I have my X's and Y's
08:46 - I remember the previous video I did this
08:49 - I looked at all the RGB
08:51 - i / 255 and then i sorry i lost my train
08:58 - of thought here and then I made those
09:02 - into a 2d tensor and now I've made the
09:05 - Y's and I what I do want to see is
09:07 - console.log let's look at X's dot shape
09:10 - and console.log wise dot shape also okay
09:16 - right let's look and see if everything
09:17 - seems right ah indices must be of data
09:22 - type int 32 Oh interesting so when I
09:26 - made this tensor my labels if we look at
09:30 - them are actually like if I go back and
09:34 - console.log the labels those are
09:37 - floating-point numbers because I wasn't
09:39 - really worrying about it when I was just
09:40 - working with regular JavaScript arrays
09:42 - but I need to very specifically make
09:45 - sure that I set the data type index
09:47 - values for a1 hot vector cannot be
09:49 - floating point values so I think if I do
09:51 - this we can see that fixed it right so
09:56 - now I have the shape right this makes
09:58 - sense there's five thousand six hundred
10:00 - forty three data points this each data
10:03 - point for the inputs for the X's has an
10:05 - RGB that's three and there are nine
10:07 - possible labels so I have the shape as
10:10 - 5643 nine possibilities and each one of
10:13 - those just is one hot encoded so this
10:17 - means blueish and this means purplish or
10:19 - whatever the mapping is I don't remember
10:20 - the second one is greenish and zero one
10:26 - two three four five the six one is 0 1 2
10:30 - 3 4 5 is pinkish that's the sixth one
10:33 - yes whatever so I this is gonna be
10:35 - really important which labels actually
10:37 - go with with index values is something
10:39 - that I'm going to have to save for the
10:41 - duration of this project because when I
10:43 - show the results to the user I want to
10:45 - actually show the strings not the number
10:47 - value okay so I am now ready to try to
10:49 - fit four sides up so what's next I need
10:51 - to architect the model right I got all
10:54 - the input data and I got all the output
10:57 - data I need to divide into training and
10:59 - testing architect the model fit the
11:02 - model and
11:03 - then I'm sort of done maybe so that's
11:05 - gonna be like many more videos into the
11:07 - future so I got at least three or four
11:08 - little more steps to build here until I
11:10 - have this like final version of this
11:13 - color classifier built with tension flow
11:14 - jazz wait wait don't leave just wait
11:18 - don't leave just yet I do want to think
11:22 - about memory management and I'm maybe
11:24 - I'm gonna think about memory management
11:25 - later but and the X's and Y's I'm going
11:28 - to want to use in the next video but I
11:30 - probably should after I make the one hot
11:32 - vector
11:33 - I don't need when I'm working with
11:36 - lower-level tend to float yes I've got
11:38 - to clean up stuff I'm not gonna use
11:39 - anymore and I don't need these labels
11:41 - anymore so I can dispose that one so
11:44 - that was just the last little tidbit
11:45 - here and then I'll move on in the next
11:47 - video I'm going to start creating the
11:48 - architecture of the neural network model
11:50 - itself and OH I'm gonna introduce some
11:52 - new concepts soft backs and
11:54 - cross-entropy isn't that exciting
11:57 - [Music]
12:06 - you

Cleaned transcript:

okay we're still working with our data at some point we're gonna start training a model what have I done so far okay so just to recap for a second I've got this whole database of crowdsourced colors with a label and now I've converted all that stuff to tensors so and I'm just looking at the inputs now the inputs that I want to use for my machine learning model so I 5643 RGB values so the shape of the tensor is 5060 or 43 comma 3 and I can look at it here I have all the RGB values normalized to 0 between 0 and 1 now I need to do the wise I need to figure out what are the target outputs associated with each RGB value and this is exciting because we are going to cover we being me and you being the person watching I am going to cover a concept known as one hot encoding so we have to

zero and then a 70 percent chance zero zero right all of these values might add up to 100% and we could say ah it's most likely this one which is index zero one two three four five six which maps to
