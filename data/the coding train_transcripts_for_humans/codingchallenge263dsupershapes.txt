00:00 - hello and welcome to the super shape
00:02 - coding challenge grand finale in the
00:05 - previous video if you watch it you don't
00:07 - have to have watched it to follow this
00:08 - one but if you watched it I figured out
00:11 - how to make a sphere by iterating over
00:15 - latitude and longitudes and calculating
00:17 - spherical coordinates and creating a lot
00:19 - of Tyler triangle strips and coloring
00:21 - them like so and you see that on your
00:22 - right
00:23 - that pure nice sphere with little with
00:27 - horizontal bands and what I want to do
00:29 - in this video is show you how to take
00:31 - that sphere and turn it into this
00:33 - crazy-looking super shape now this is
00:35 - just one example of a super shape we're
00:38 - just what our super shapes and where do
00:39 - they come from so first of all I want a
00:40 - reference to you reference you the work
00:42 - of Risa Ally a link to his work will be
00:45 - in the description of this video he has
00:46 - a wonderful art project all about super
00:48 - shapes that you can look at and enjoy
00:50 - and some videos you can watch a
00:52 - beautiful ways of coloring and messing
00:53 - with them this is really where I took my
00:55 - visual inspiration from this particular
00:57 - work where I have where I've got the
01:00 - math formula from is from Paul Bork's
01:02 - website so what's going to happen what
01:06 - we're going to do is instead of simply
01:08 - saying something like right in this
01:10 - sphere that I've calculated the point
01:13 - for every the sort of XYZ points for
01:16 - every single latitude and longitude
01:18 - there is a radius a sort of fixed radius
01:21 - of 200 so what if we had a kind of crazy
01:25 - way to calculate the radii so for
01:27 - example if we just use Perlin noise or a
01:29 - sine wave we might see some rippling
01:31 - like looking sphere well it turns out
01:33 - this strange formula for whatever reason
01:36 - when you take either the latitude or
01:39 - longitude angle and calculate a radius
01:41 - based on the this crazy formula you get
01:44 - all sorts of values and you get these
01:46 - super shapes and if I scroll down we can
01:48 - see there's a whole bunch of kind of
01:50 - constants here there's n two there's
01:52 - actually and there's a constant M
01:54 - there's actually four there's N and 1
01:56 - and 2 and n 3 and if we scroll down here
01:59 - you can see based on how you might set
02:02 - those values you values those constants
02:05 - you'll get different shapes and this is
02:06 - actually the one that you're seeing in
02:08 - the particular
02:09 - example that I showed you and you can
02:11 - see all sorts of various possibilities
02:13 - here so the goal here is I'm going to
02:15 - make you I don't know I don't make ngey
02:18 - I don't know what that means I am going
02:19 - to write now code take that sphere and
02:22 - add those math formulas so we can see
02:24 - these super shapes on the screen I'm
02:26 - just going to scratch the surface on
02:27 - this and it's my hope and my goal that
02:30 - you take this and do something creative
02:32 - and interesting with it and I'll talk
02:33 - about what the possibilities might be at
02:34 - the end of this video okay so let's just
02:37 - get started and think about some things
02:40 - we need to add and change to this there
02:42 - so I'm going to close let me sorry move
02:45 - around here for a second I'm going to
02:47 - close this and so this is the code that
02:49 - I right now have to work with it uses
02:51 - just plain old spherical coordinates so
02:56 - R is a fixed value of 200 and I get the
02:59 - XYZ value and then I draw and set the
03:02 - sphere now what I'm going to do just
03:03 - briefly is kind of take color out of
03:05 - this for a second because I think
03:07 - that'll help us kind of debug this a
03:08 - little bit and I'm going to say a stroke
03:11 - 255 no fill and so there we can see
03:15 - again this is actually what's being
03:18 - drawn this is just the kind of wire mesh
03:20 - of that sphere and I'm also going to
03:21 - change this variable total up here to a
03:26 - 25 just to make it a little less
03:29 - detailed so we can kind of might help us
03:31 - sort of see what's going on so okay so
03:34 - now that we're there what do I need to
03:36 - change and let me just give myself more
03:39 - space here move them things around what
03:42 - I need to do is simply change the math
03:45 - that's going on here instead of the pure
03:49 - spherical coordinates where I just go
03:53 - from the latitude and longitude to a sit
03:55 - and a single radius I want to have
03:57 - different radii values based on the
04:00 - latitude and longitude so let's look at
04:02 - how that works
04:03 - once again here is this formula now I
04:06 - think what would be really useful would
04:08 - for me to have a kind of like visual
04:10 - reference of this formula always on the
04:12 - page while we're programming this and I
04:15 - also I'm going to need this so I'm
04:17 - taking some screenshots here I should
04:20 - have done this in advance but I'm just
04:21 - doing this in my
04:22 - you know and open these up with Mac
04:24 - preview and get put these up here in the
04:26 - corner
04:27 - so as I'm writing the processing code I
04:30 - can kind of have a reference to this
04:34 - okay so and actually you know what might
04:37 - be useful let's make a function let's
04:40 - just say there's a function called super
04:43 - shape and that function returns a radius
04:48 - value and it returns a radius value I'm
04:51 - gonna say based on what the based on
04:57 - some amount of constants so I need a I
05:02 - need em I need n1 I need n2 and I need
05:07 - n3 so the idea here is that what I could
05:12 - do here is say R 1 equals super shape
05:19 - based on some constants like oh did I
05:22 - call it super that would be a tear of
05:24 - super shape super shape based on some
05:27 - constants like the one that I'm going to
05:29 - do I have to have some constants
05:30 - memorized I don't have them memorized
05:31 - I'm going to go back to Paul Bork and I
05:34 - want to look at the let's start with
05:36 - this one so I want these particular
05:39 - constants point to one point seven seven
05:44 - point to one point seven and one point
05:47 - seven so I'm going to do a point two oh
05:52 - sorry
05:53 - seven point two one point seven one
05:56 - point seven and then actually what I
05:59 - need to do one thing you'll notice about
06:01 - this super shape is that the spherical
06:03 - coordinates have been adjusted slightly
06:05 - the way that this math works so I'm
06:08 - going to make those changes as well so
06:10 - I'm going to change this to I'm going to
06:13 - change this to cosine cosine I'm going
06:16 - to change this to sine cosine and I'm
06:21 - going to change this to sign and then I
06:24 - also need to have these new values R 1
06:28 - and R 2 so I'm going to say times R 1
06:36 - times are 2 times r1 times r2 and I'll
06:43 - talk about what these are in a second
06:44 - I'm just adding them into my code and
06:46 - then also taught r2 times r2 so why are
06:53 - there two values well pause back after
07:01 - an audio glitch so what I was talking
07:03 - about was why are there is why is there
07:05 - r1 and r2 well what this 3d super shape
07:08 - actually is is you can think about if
07:10 - you remember there is actually a
07:11 - previous video where I look at just a 2d
07:13 - super shape and what the 3d super super
07:16 - shape is it's kind of like having a 2d
07:19 - super shape flat like this and 2d super
07:21 - shape flat like this and then rotate it
07:23 - around each other so in that sense
07:25 - there's a radius that's determining
07:27 - there's kind of a radius calculation for
07:28 - the one of those super shapes and a
07:30 - radius calculation for the other super
07:32 - shape and one of those and those super
07:34 - shapes are calculated based on latitude
07:36 - and longitude so what I need to do is
07:38 - calculate both and r1 that's based on
07:43 - right now they're going to be the same
07:44 - so I don't know if it actually matters I
07:46 - need a r1 and I need an r2 so this is
07:51 - the idea that I want an r1 which is
07:53 - super cheap and by the way I forgot the
07:55 - most important parameter to this
07:56 - function which is that I need to pass in
07:58 - that angle latitude and I need to pass
08:00 - in that angle longitude so I'm going to
08:03 - go back here and I'm going to add the
08:05 - first argument as theta so first thing
08:08 - I'm going to do is just let's just see
08:10 - whoops
08:11 - and I lost my latitude longitude oh it's
08:15 - here this has to go above so there's a
08:19 - lot going on here on this screen here
08:21 - but let me just take them over to take a
08:22 - deep breath and look at it so what I'm
08:24 - doing is I'm looking the same thing I
08:26 - did with the sphere I'm saying for every
08:29 - latitude and for every longitude let's
08:31 - calculate a super shape radius value
08:34 - based on the latitude a super shape
08:36 - radius value based on the longitude and
08:38 - then apply those formulas I actually
08:39 - have a mistake in those formulas that I
08:41 - can see now which is that cosine
08:43 - longitude longitude and
08:47 - this is latitude latitude and then
08:51 - there's something else here which is
08:52 - that for the calculations to work
08:54 - correctly I want to have my latitude
08:56 - range instead of going from 0 to PI to
08:59 - go from negative PI over 2 to PI over 2
09:01 - and longitude range as well so I'm going
09:03 - to change those ranges to go from
09:06 - negative 1/2 PI to 1/2 PI and then
09:14 - negative PI to PI now one thing you'll
09:18 - notice is that this this value R is not
09:22 - present here in this particular formula
09:25 - what I'm going to do is calculate kind
09:28 - of a unit super shape that's based on
09:30 - the value of a range between 0 and 1 and
09:32 - I'm going to use that value R to expand
09:34 - its size so I'm going to keep that as
09:36 - 200 and so let's just see if I run this
09:38 - right now the super shape function is
09:40 - just returning 1 no matter what so I'm
09:43 - not actually doing the calculation and
09:44 - if I run it you should see I've
09:47 - basically still got that sphere so I'm
09:49 - still getting the sphere if the super
09:52 - shape calculation just returns 1 for R 1
09:55 - and R 2 for every single value I'm still
09:57 - going to have that sphere so now it's up
09:59 - to us to put the math here correctly and
10:03 - not have things go too terribly awry so
10:06 - let's give that a try I've got R 1 and R
10:10 - 2 the wrong way around so so let me
10:14 - correct that
10:15 - meaning that R 1 should be based on a
10:23 - longitude like this and our 2 should be
10:28 - based on latitude like that let's see so
10:33 - maybe that's the way I guess I could
10:34 - look at the formula edit this out and
10:38 - see that right R 1 oh yeah RR 1 of theta
10:45 - so R 1 of longitude so R 1 is based on
10:50 - longitude yet so I should just looked at
10:51 - this by the way you can see that this
10:53 - formula is saying calculate R 1 value
10:57 - based on the launch to
10:58 - our vote to value based on the the sorry
11:03 - our one value yes based on the longitude
11:06 - our to value based on the latitude okay
11:08 - so that should work okay got it I fixed
11:12 - it hopefully that's right let's still
11:14 - look at the result and we should still
11:16 - have that sphere I just had them
11:18 - backwards now okay let's come back here
11:20 - and now we're going to start to put in
11:21 - that math oh boy oh dear so I'm going to
11:24 - give myself some nice room on the screen
11:26 - I'm going to move this down and then
11:29 - move this over here so we can see that
11:31 - formula so what are some things I need
11:33 - to calculate oh I forgot there's a and B
11:36 - are constants - I'm just going to fur
11:38 - now you know a and B are going to change
11:40 - sort of the quality of the shape in the
11:43 - sense that it's going to like stretch it
11:45 - or or smush it on a horizontal or
11:47 - vertical axis I'm going to leave those
11:49 - as one right now just for simplicity and
11:51 - let's first calculate this particular
11:54 - value so I'm going to say t1 equals one
11:59 - divided by a times cosine of n times
12:06 - theta divided by four and what do I want
12:11 - I want the absolute value of that and
12:14 - then I want to take t1 and set it equal
12:18 - to itself to the N twos power so that's
12:24 - giving me just this component right here
12:27 - I'm doing this particular math and
12:29 - setting that to the n to power then
12:33 - let's do t2 which is the absolute value
12:36 - of 1 divided by B times sine times n
12:40 - times theta divided by four and I'm
12:45 - going to say t2 is itself to the n3
12:50 - power then what I want to do is say t3
12:55 - and I'm just using T as some arbitrary
12:56 - like variable naming structure I want to
12:58 - just calculate the parts of these I need
13:00 - to add t1 and t2 together
13:02 - t1 plus t2 and then I need to take that
13:06 - and say t3 take to the power of negative
13:11 - 1
13:12 - / n 1 so then that's really what R is so
13:18 - that's the end right oh no no no yes the
13:20 - whole thing should be then float R
13:23 - equals the result of that and I should
13:26 - be able to return R so let's now I don't
13:31 - know if I I'm sure I made a mistake
13:32 - Oh somebody in the chat a divided by B
13:34 - should be 1 divided by B oh yes this
13:37 - should be 1 divided by B thank you I
13:39 - don't know if I have any other mistakes
13:40 - here in the math but let's run this Oh
13:43 - given getting an air I have some
13:44 - parentheses out of place so absolute
13:47 - value of uh there should be another
13:49 - parenthesis here and let's see what I
13:52 - get here miracle of miracles that looks
13:56 - like that particular supervisor I can
14:09 - you know give myself a little bit of a
14:10 - higher resolution by having 75 points
14:13 - for every latitude and longitude I can
14:17 - also what I can do is I can put the
14:20 - let's run this again now you can see
14:24 - that resolution is finer this looks
14:26 - pretty good I am going to now give it
14:30 - just like a fill of white oh and it says
14:34 - no fill right after that so we can sort
14:37 - of see what that looks like okay that
14:40 - looks still pretty good I think we've
14:42 - got it okay missing a bracket I don't
14:45 - know somewhere I'm missing a bracket but
14:47 - I looks right I may be that maybe that
14:49 - comet is in the past okay so let's see
14:51 - if we can get a cup one of the other
14:53 - super shapes to look right and then
14:55 - we'll start messing with the color and
14:56 - maybe do some animation okay so what I'm
14:59 - going to do now so let's go back to Paul
15:01 - Bork and let's pick another one I don't
15:04 - know what looks like a nice-looking one
15:05 - let's try this one and so what you're
15:09 - going to notice is that there are now
15:12 - different values for super shape 1 & 2
15:15 - that means different values for R 1 and
15:17 - R 2 right this soup two-dimensional
15:19 - super shape that's kind of all along the
15:21 - longitude the two-dimensional super
15:23 - shape that's along the latitude and the
15:24 - they're rotated against each other so
15:26 - what I'm going to do now is say can we
15:28 - remember this 860 138 6130 so I'm going
15:33 - to go here and say 8 well that's our - I
15:37 - don't know if that I don't know that it
15:38 - really matter so let's do 860 130 now
15:46 - we're gonna go back and say - 10 10 10 -
15:50 - 10 10 10 super shapes on - 10 10 10 - 10
15:54 - 10 10 so now I'm gonna go up here and
15:56 - say - 10 10 10 okay
16:06 - does this look that looks kind of like
16:09 - what was in there right I can zoom out a
16:10 - little bit to see I think that looks
16:12 - like that shape so let's go back and see
16:14 - yeah that looks right so I think all of
16:16 - our formulas are looking correct we can
16:18 - see I can put this at this angle you can
16:19 - see those match up pretty well we can
16:21 - actually go back and add that color
16:23 - stuff that I had before from the sphere
16:25 - right I can get rid of the stroke and I
16:31 - can add hue and then I can have the hue
16:34 - kind of cycle and we can see now I've
16:36 - made this rainbow super shape and I can
16:39 - zoom out so we're really moving along
16:41 - here so you now can take this code and
16:44 - you can plug in the different values see
16:46 - what shapes you can get you can try
16:47 - different colors you can try to make
16:49 - vertical stripes or horizontal stripes
16:50 - or have it animate this would be nice to
16:53 - do actually really really quickly I
16:54 - could just add a variable like offset
16:57 - equals zero and I'm going to in the hue
17:00 - I'm going to like I'm going to say hue
17:03 - plus offset mod 255 and I'll just say
17:06 - offset plus equals five I don't know
17:09 - what this is going to do but you can see
17:11 - now I have my like cycling colors and I
17:14 - would have like zoom in here and then we
17:16 - can have this beautiful why is it so it
17:19 - doesn't looks kind of dark all of a
17:20 - sudden but I have to stand in the middle
17:24 - of this oh wait I've actually recorded a
17:29 - tutorial video I forgot not just like
17:31 - messing around okay so you can see
17:33 - there's like lots of kind of crazy so
17:35 - cuz the lights are over here there we go
17:36 - this is brighter now
17:38 - well okay I'm gonna make myself seasick
17:40 - okay
17:41 - so on you can see that there's all sorts
17:43 - of possibilities things you could do I
17:44 - want to do one last thing in this video
17:46 - before I stop and give you some thoughts
17:48 - about other things you can do let's at
17:50 - least make it animate a little bit so I
17:53 - want to go back I'm going to comment and
17:57 - I think first of all I think it could be
17:59 - a lot more thoughtful in terms of how
18:01 - you store these things as variables I'm
18:03 - just kind of doing it haphazardly right
18:05 - now but I'm going to go back to that the
18:09 - first super shape which has sort of
18:11 - equal values here and it was seven point
18:15 - two one point seven one point seven did
18:20 - I get that right is that what it was
18:25 - let's see yeah so you can see now here's
18:28 - this particular super shape that I
18:29 - started with so what I want to do with
18:32 - this is now just show you how to animate
18:34 - it a little bit so one thing I could
18:36 - actually do is just say let me make this
18:38 - M a global variable so I'm going to call
18:42 - this M m and I'm going to have a global
18:47 - variable called M and have that equal to
18:50 - zero now let me just run this right now
18:54 - and see what we get with an M of zero
18:57 - you can see this is actually just back
18:59 - to that sphere again interestingly
19:01 - enough because it kind of like cancels
19:03 - out multiplying by zero cancels out
19:05 - everything so what I can now do is I can
19:08 - say I could say something like n equals
19:12 - map mouse X which goes from zero to with
19:16 - between zero and seven so now as I start
19:20 - the sketch you know I you can sort of
19:23 - see as I move the mouse around it kind
19:25 - of morphs from that sphere all the way
19:28 - to that particular shape and I could say
19:32 - well let me have some kind of global
19:34 - variable like angle I already have an
19:37 - angle variable like let's just call this
19:39 - like a M change I don't know I
19:44 - could probably think of something better
19:45 - but I'm going to have a variable called
19:48 - M change and have that equal to zero
19:51 - and what I'm going to do is I'm going to
19:53 - actually map sine of M change which is
19:56 - like a nice smooth oscillation which
19:58 - goes between negative and 1/2 between 0
20:00 - and 7 and I'll have M change you know
20:02 - change over time by some by some value
20:05 - and then what I've got is this thing
20:08 - kind of like oscillating back and forth
20:11 - almost like this weird super shape
20:12 - breathing thing I know it's brighter on
20:14 - one side the way that I have the light
20:15 - set up so it's you know breathe the
20:23 - camera's going to go off cuz I've hit 30
20:24 - minutes so um so you can see kind of
20:27 - what's going on here there are a lot of
20:31 - possibilities now the other thing that I
20:33 - would say is sort of interesting to
20:34 - think about is not just morphing from
20:37 - kind of zero but what if you took two
20:40 - different super shapes and had those
20:42 - values interpolate between one to the
20:44 - other so you're actually morph one super
20:46 - shape into the other that would be a
20:47 - great exercise for you to try I think
20:49 - I've pretty much reached the end the
20:52 - stream went offline okay I'm sorry
20:54 - hopefully this is recording anyway so I
20:56 - think I've reached the end of this
20:58 - particular tutorial I hope that you try
21:01 - making some of the other super shapes
21:03 - try playing with the variables and
21:04 - colors see what kind of interface you
21:06 - could build for this I am going to try
21:08 - to make a JavaScript WebGL version of
21:10 - this in which case it might be easier to
21:12 - have a interface that controls these
21:13 - shapes and so stay tuned Oliver just
21:16 - post that code in the description of
21:17 - this video hall you'll see another video
21:19 - kind of converting this code to
21:20 - JavaScript thanks for watching the super
21:22 - shape tutorial and I'm sure you're gonna
21:24 - have questions and comments and thoughts
21:25 - so please let me know in the variety of
21:27 - channels that exist to you to
21:29 - communicate with me perhaps okay you for
21:32 - real I mean not perhaps whatever okay no
21:33 - five

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome to the super shape coding challenge grand finale in the previous video if you watch it you don't have to have watched it to follow this one but if you watched it I figured out how to make a sphere by iterating over latitude and longitudes and calculating spherical coordinates and creating a lot of Tyler triangle strips and coloring them like so and you see that on your right that pure nice sphere with little with horizontal bands and what I want to do in this video is show you how to take that sphere and turn it into this crazylooking super shape now this is just one example of a super shape we're just what our super shapes and where do they come from so first of all I want a reference to you reference you the work of Risa Ally a link to his work will be in the description of this video he has a wonderful art project all about super shapes that you can look at and enjoy and some videos you can watch a beautiful ways of coloring and messing with them this is really where I took my visual inspiration from this particular work where I have where I've got the math formula from is from Paul Bork's website so what's going to happen what we're going to do is instead of simply saying something like right in this sphere that I've calculated the point for every the sort of XYZ points for every single latitude and longitude there is a radius a sort of fixed radius of 200 so what if we had a kind of crazy way to calculate the radii so for example if we just use Perlin noise or a sine wave we might see some rippling like looking sphere well it turns out this strange formula for whatever reason when you take either the latitude or longitude angle and calculate a radius based on the this crazy formula you get all sorts of values and you get these super shapes and if I scroll down we can see there's a whole bunch of kind of constants here there's n two there's actually and there's a constant M there's actually four there's N and 1 and 2 and n 3 and if we scroll down here you can see based on how you might set those values you values those constants you'll get different shapes and this is actually the one that you're seeing in the particular example that I showed you and you can see all sorts of various possibilities here so the goal here is I'm going to make you I don't know I don't make ngey I don't know what that means I am going to write now code take that sphere and add those math formulas so we can see these super shapes on the screen I'm just going to scratch the surface on this and it's my hope and my goal that you take this and do something creative and interesting with it and I'll talk about what the possibilities might be at the end of this video okay so let's just get started and think about some things we need to add and change to this there so I'm going to close let me sorry move around here for a second I'm going to close this and so this is the code that I right now have to work with it uses just plain old spherical coordinates so R is a fixed value of 200 and I get the XYZ value and then I draw and set the sphere now what I'm going to do just briefly is kind of take color out of this for a second because I think that'll help us kind of debug this a little bit and I'm going to say a stroke 255 no fill and so there we can see again this is actually what's being drawn this is just the kind of wire mesh of that sphere and I'm also going to change this variable total up here to a 25 just to make it a little less detailed so we can kind of might help us sort of see what's going on so okay so now that we're there what do I need to change and let me just give myself more space here move them things around what I need to do is simply change the math that's going on here instead of the pure spherical coordinates where I just go from the latitude and longitude to a sit and a single radius I want to have different radii values based on the latitude and longitude so let's look at how that works once again here is this formula now I think what would be really useful would for me to have a kind of like visual reference of this formula always on the page while we're programming this and I also I'm going to need this so I'm taking some screenshots here I should have done this in advance but I'm just doing this in my you know and open these up with Mac preview and get put these up here in the corner so as I'm writing the processing code I can kind of have a reference to this okay so and actually you know what might be useful let's make a function let's just say there's a function called super shape and that function returns a radius value and it returns a radius value I'm gonna say based on what the based on some amount of constants so I need a I need em I need n1 I need n2 and I need n3 so the idea here is that what I could do here is say R 1 equals super shape based on some constants like oh did I call it super that would be a tear of super shape super shape based on some constants like the one that I'm going to do I have to have some constants memorized I don't have them memorized I'm going to go back to Paul Bork and I want to look at the let's start with this one so I want these particular constants point to one point seven seven point to one point seven and one point seven so I'm going to do a point two oh sorry seven point two one point seven one point seven and then actually what I need to do one thing you'll notice about this super shape is that the spherical coordinates have been adjusted slightly the way that this math works so I'm going to make those changes as well so I'm going to change this to I'm going to change this to cosine cosine I'm going to change this to sine cosine and I'm going to change this to sign and then I also need to have these new values R 1 and R 2 so I'm going to say times R 1 times are 2 times r1 times r2 and I'll talk about what these are in a second I'm just adding them into my code and then also taught r2 times r2 so why are there two values well pause back after an audio glitch so what I was talking about was why are there is why is there r1 and r2 well what this 3d super shape actually is is you can think about if you remember there is actually a previous video where I look at just a 2d super shape and what the 3d super super shape is it's kind of like having a 2d super shape flat like this and 2d super shape flat like this and then rotate it around each other so in that sense there's a radius that's determining there's kind of a radius calculation for the one of those super shapes and a radius calculation for the other super shape and one of those and those super shapes are calculated based on latitude and longitude so what I need to do is calculate both and r1 that's based on right now they're going to be the same so I don't know if it actually matters I need a r1 and I need an r2 so this is the idea that I want an r1 which is super cheap and by the way I forgot the most important parameter to this function which is that I need to pass in that angle latitude and I need to pass in that angle longitude so I'm going to go back here and I'm going to add the first argument as theta so first thing I'm going to do is just let's just see whoops and I lost my latitude longitude oh it's here this has to go above so there's a lot going on here on this screen here but let me just take them over to take a deep breath and look at it so what I'm doing is I'm looking the same thing I did with the sphere I'm saying for every latitude and for every longitude let's calculate a super shape radius value based on the latitude a super shape radius value based on the longitude and then apply those formulas I actually have a mistake in those formulas that I can see now which is that cosine longitude longitude and this is latitude latitude and then there's something else here which is that for the calculations to work correctly I want to have my latitude range instead of going from 0 to PI to go from negative PI over 2 to PI over 2 and longitude range as well so I'm going to change those ranges to go from negative 1/2 PI to 1/2 PI and then negative PI to PI now one thing you'll notice is that this this value R is not present here in this particular formula what I'm going to do is calculate kind of a unit super shape that's based on the value of a range between 0 and 1 and I'm going to use that value R to expand its size so I'm going to keep that as 200 and so let's just see if I run this right now the super shape function is just returning 1 no matter what so I'm not actually doing the calculation and if I run it you should see I've basically still got that sphere so I'm still getting the sphere if the super shape calculation just returns 1 for R 1 and R 2 for every single value I'm still going to have that sphere so now it's up to us to put the math here correctly and not have things go too terribly awry so let's give that a try I've got R 1 and R 2 the wrong way around so so let me correct that meaning that R 1 should be based on a longitude like this and our 2 should be based on latitude like that let's see so maybe that's the way I guess I could look at the formula edit this out and see that right R 1 oh yeah RR 1 of theta so R 1 of longitude so R 1 is based on longitude yet so I should just looked at this by the way you can see that this formula is saying calculate R 1 value based on the launch to our vote to value based on the the sorry our one value yes based on the longitude our to value based on the latitude okay so that should work okay got it I fixed it hopefully that's right let's still look at the result and we should still have that sphere I just had them backwards now okay let's come back here and now we're going to start to put in that math oh boy oh dear so I'm going to give myself some nice room on the screen I'm going to move this down and then move this over here so we can see that formula so what are some things I need to calculate oh I forgot there's a and B are constants I'm just going to fur now you know a and B are going to change sort of the quality of the shape in the sense that it's going to like stretch it or or smush it on a horizontal or vertical axis I'm going to leave those as one right now just for simplicity and let's first calculate this particular value so I'm going to say t1 equals one divided by a times cosine of n times theta divided by four and what do I want I want the absolute value of that and then I want to take t1 and set it equal to itself to the N twos power so that's giving me just this component right here I'm doing this particular math and setting that to the n to power then let's do t2 which is the absolute value of 1 divided by B times sine times n times theta divided by four and I'm going to say t2 is itself to the n3 power then what I want to do is say t3 and I'm just using T as some arbitrary like variable naming structure I want to just calculate the parts of these I need to add t1 and t2 together t1 plus t2 and then I need to take that and say t3 take to the power of negative 1 / n 1 so then that's really what R is so that's the end right oh no no no yes the whole thing should be then float R equals the result of that and I should be able to return R so let's now I don't know if I I'm sure I made a mistake Oh somebody in the chat a divided by B should be 1 divided by B oh yes this should be 1 divided by B thank you I don't know if I have any other mistakes here in the math but let's run this Oh given getting an air I have some parentheses out of place so absolute value of uh there should be another parenthesis here and let's see what I get here miracle of miracles that looks like that particular supervisor I can you know give myself a little bit of a higher resolution by having 75 points for every latitude and longitude I can also what I can do is I can put the let's run this again now you can see that resolution is finer this looks pretty good I am going to now give it just like a fill of white oh and it says no fill right after that so we can sort of see what that looks like okay that looks still pretty good I think we've got it okay missing a bracket I don't know somewhere I'm missing a bracket but I looks right I may be that maybe that comet is in the past okay so let's see if we can get a cup one of the other super shapes to look right and then we'll start messing with the color and maybe do some animation okay so what I'm going to do now so let's go back to Paul Bork and let's pick another one I don't know what looks like a nicelooking one let's try this one and so what you're going to notice is that there are now different values for super shape 1 & 2 that means different values for R 1 and R 2 right this soup twodimensional super shape that's kind of all along the longitude the twodimensional super shape that's along the latitude and the they're rotated against each other so what I'm going to do now is say can we remember this 860 138 6130 so I'm going to go here and say 8 well that's our I don't know if that I don't know that it really matter so let's do 860 130 now we're gonna go back and say 10 10 10 10 10 10 super shapes on 10 10 10 10 10 10 so now I'm gonna go up here and say 10 10 10 okay does this look that looks kind of like what was in there right I can zoom out a little bit to see I think that looks like that shape so let's go back and see yeah that looks right so I think all of our formulas are looking correct we can see I can put this at this angle you can see those match up pretty well we can actually go back and add that color stuff that I had before from the sphere right I can get rid of the stroke and I can add hue and then I can have the hue kind of cycle and we can see now I've made this rainbow super shape and I can zoom out so we're really moving along here so you now can take this code and you can plug in the different values see what shapes you can get you can try different colors you can try to make vertical stripes or horizontal stripes or have it animate this would be nice to do actually really really quickly I could just add a variable like offset equals zero and I'm going to in the hue I'm going to like I'm going to say hue plus offset mod 255 and I'll just say offset plus equals five I don't know what this is going to do but you can see now I have my like cycling colors and I would have like zoom in here and then we can have this beautiful why is it so it doesn't looks kind of dark all of a sudden but I have to stand in the middle of this oh wait I've actually recorded a tutorial video I forgot not just like messing around okay so you can see there's like lots of kind of crazy so cuz the lights are over here there we go this is brighter now well okay I'm gonna make myself seasick okay so on you can see that there's all sorts of possibilities things you could do I want to do one last thing in this video before I stop and give you some thoughts about other things you can do let's at least make it animate a little bit so I want to go back I'm going to comment and I think first of all I think it could be a lot more thoughtful in terms of how you store these things as variables I'm just kind of doing it haphazardly right now but I'm going to go back to that the first super shape which has sort of equal values here and it was seven point two one point seven one point seven did I get that right is that what it was let's see yeah so you can see now here's this particular super shape that I started with so what I want to do with this is now just show you how to animate it a little bit so one thing I could actually do is just say let me make this M a global variable so I'm going to call this M m and I'm going to have a global variable called M and have that equal to zero now let me just run this right now and see what we get with an M of zero you can see this is actually just back to that sphere again interestingly enough because it kind of like cancels out multiplying by zero cancels out everything so what I can now do is I can say I could say something like n equals map mouse X which goes from zero to with between zero and seven so now as I start the sketch you know I you can sort of see as I move the mouse around it kind of morphs from that sphere all the way to that particular shape and I could say well let me have some kind of global variable like angle I already have an angle variable like let's just call this like a M change I don't know I could probably think of something better but I'm going to have a variable called M change and have that equal to zero and what I'm going to do is I'm going to actually map sine of M change which is like a nice smooth oscillation which goes between negative and 1/2 between 0 and 7 and I'll have M change you know change over time by some by some value and then what I've got is this thing kind of like oscillating back and forth almost like this weird super shape breathing thing I know it's brighter on one side the way that I have the light set up so it's you know breathe the camera's going to go off cuz I've hit 30 minutes so um so you can see kind of what's going on here there are a lot of possibilities now the other thing that I would say is sort of interesting to think about is not just morphing from kind of zero but what if you took two different super shapes and had those values interpolate between one to the other so you're actually morph one super shape into the other that would be a great exercise for you to try I think I've pretty much reached the end the stream went offline okay I'm sorry hopefully this is recording anyway so I think I've reached the end of this particular tutorial I hope that you try making some of the other super shapes try playing with the variables and colors see what kind of interface you could build for this I am going to try to make a JavaScript WebGL version of this in which case it might be easier to have a interface that controls these shapes and so stay tuned Oliver just post that code in the description of this video hall you'll see another video kind of converting this code to JavaScript thanks for watching the super shape tutorial and I'm sure you're gonna have questions and comments and thoughts so please let me know in the variety of channels that exist to you to communicate with me perhaps okay you for real I mean not perhaps whatever okay no five
