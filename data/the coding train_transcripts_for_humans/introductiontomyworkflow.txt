00:00 - - Hello, welcome to a
video on the Coding Train
00:03 - where I am going to show
you all of the things
00:06 - that I use in various videos, all of them.
00:10 - This might end actually
end up being kind of long.
00:12 - At the end, I'm going to
be getting into the weeds
00:14 - of some of the nitty gritty details.
00:17 - But first let me make a list.
00:19 - So first of all let me
be clear about something.
00:21 - Number one, nobody has,
00:23 - there's no paid endorsements here
00:25 - of certain things that I'm using.
00:26 - And I'm picking things,
in many ways, arbitrarily.
00:29 - And I am not,
00:30 - in any way
00:32 - whatsoever
00:33 - telling you to use the
things that I'm using.
00:36 - I'm just showing you the
things that I'm using
00:38 - and actually learning to use one thing
00:41 - is not as valuable as trying
out a lot of different things.
00:44 - And by things I mean text editors,
00:45 - and console applications,
00:48 - and you know, different node packages,
00:50 - and different programming languages.
00:52 - But, this would hopefully
be helpful to you
00:54 - if you're going along and
following various videos.
00:57 - This is going to have all the pieces
00:58 - of how things are set up and configure.
01:00 - So, a couple things,
01:01 - I often use a kind of all-in-one package.
01:04 - So what I that I mean is
like it's a thing that I can,
01:06 - it's either a URL that I can
go to, that I can run code in
01:09 - or it's an application that
I can download and run.
01:11 - So two things that I use are Processing.
01:16 - This is a Java based
platform for creative coding,
01:20 - it's been around since 2001.
01:22 - I talk about the history
and various aspects
01:24 - of it in quite a few videos.
01:26 - And currently, as of the
time of this recording,
01:29 - it is on version 3.4, which
is the version I'm using.
01:32 - There are a bunch of libraries
and things that I'll,
01:33 - actually would really like to make a video
01:35 - that just does a sort
of Processing overview,
01:36 - which I'm thinking about.
01:37 - Okay, the other thing that
I'm using, most recently
01:41 - is the p5.js web editor.
01:45 - What this is,
01:46 - and there are many wonderful
online web editors,
01:48 - let me name a few.
01:49 - OpenProcessing, Glitch,
CodePen, and many more.
01:54 - This is one that I'm using
01:56 - because it is designed for beginners.
01:59 - It's a project that I have
tried to help with (laughs).
02:02 - By no means am I the creator of this,
02:04 - this was created by Cassie Tarakajian.
02:07 - And, you can, I'll link to the videos
02:09 - about the p5.js web editor that she made
02:12 - and the processing foundation.
02:13 - So this is a place where you
can write code in JavaScript.
02:19 - And if you look behind the scenes,
02:21 - you can also edit the HTML
and the CSS of a webpage,
02:25 - upload files, media files, etc.
02:28 - So these are my all-in-one packages.
02:31 - So if I want to just
quickly sketch out an idea
02:33 - and I want to use a downloadable
editor like Processing,
02:36 - I do that.
02:36 - If I want to sketch an
idea and do it the browser
02:38 - and share a link with
it and teach with it,
02:41 - I'm using this.
02:43 - Okay, so I'm not really
going to show you these.
02:45 - I'll just link to where you
can download and use them
02:48 - and separate videos cover
how to program in Processing,
02:51 - how to program in p5 with the web editor.
02:53 - What I'm going to cover more
specifically in this video
02:55 - is my local development environment
02:58 - for doing JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
03:01 - So that really, by the
way, includes a few things.
03:03 - So what do I need?
03:04 - I need a text editor,
03:07 - so some sort of text editor.
03:09 - And, again, there are all
sorts of text editors.
03:13 - Try them, use your favorite,
use what makes you happy.
03:16 - I am, this year, learning
to use Visual Studio Code
03:21 - which is, I think it's open source,
03:23 - but it's a code editor
created by Microsoft.
03:27 - Most of my previous videos
have used Sublime or Atom.
03:32 - I need some sort of console application
03:36 - or terminal application.
03:37 - I'm going to call that
like console access.
03:41 - On a Mac, Macs come with
the terminal application.
03:45 - On a PC, you might be
using command or get Bash
03:50 - or something or some other ones
03:51 - that people have told me about.
03:52 - I unfortunately or
fortunately I'm using a Mac
03:55 - and I'm starting to use an
application called iTerm
04:00 - which has a few extra features.
04:02 - So, here I'm really talking
about an application
04:05 - that gives you console access
04:07 - but also what you need
is you need a shell.
04:09 - And this is not something
that might be obvious to you
04:12 - 'cause mostly you're
going to just be using
04:13 - whatever default shell is part
04:16 - of your computer's installation.
04:18 - And that's what I have always been using
04:20 - in all of my previous
videos up until this year.
04:22 - And the default shell on a Mac
04:24 - is usually something called Bash.
04:27 - And I'm going to try
using something called Zsh
04:31 - which I'm going to, I
have to install separately
04:33 - but there's a wonderful tool
04:34 - that I discovered called Oh
My Zsh that I will show you.
04:39 - So this is a way that
I can run Get-Commands,
04:43 - I can start up local servers,
04:48 - I can manipulate files,
04:50 - do all the kinds of things I might want
04:51 - to do through shell access.
04:54 - I could otherwise do with
a gooier other application
04:56 - but it helps my workflow,
it makes me more efficient
04:59 - and I actually enjoy
working in that environment.
05:02 - It's the kind of thing
05:03 - that might look a little intimidating
05:04 - but once you get used to it,
05:05 - it can be useful for your workflow.
05:08 - Okay, so text editor, console access,
05:10 - (laughs)
05:11 - I hadn't had made this list in advance
05:13 - so I'm trying to think of
what am I missing here.
05:15 - I'll probably discover it as I go.
05:17 - Well, let's talk about this,
05:18 - I need, so two other things.
05:19 - I need a, you know, node.
05:22 - So I need to install node.
05:25 - Node I use for different examples
05:27 - that use server side programming.
05:29 - If I need to start up a server
05:30 - that saves data to a JSON file
05:33 - or communicates with an API
05:34 - that I need to authenticate with.
05:35 - But mostly I'm saying this
05:37 - because also node I can install
what are known as global,
05:42 - well I can install packages globally
05:45 - that are utilities that
I can run via the shell.
05:49 - And so two that I tend
to use are p5-manager
05:54 - which is one that will
sort of generate a template
05:58 - of index in a HTML and files
for creating a p5 sketch.
06:01 - Like, all the files that
web editor kind of uses,
06:03 - you can generate those
locally with p5-manager.
06:06 - You can just download them,
06:07 - you can just make them by saying new file
06:08 - but this is useful.
06:10 - And then, another one is http-server.
06:15 - Another one is live-server.
06:19 - And once again, the point
of me showing this to you
06:22 - is not to say use these three.
06:26 - Find your own.
06:28 - See what your friends are using.
06:30 - You just need to know how,
06:33 - you need to have a sense of
what all these pieces are
06:35 - and how to play around with them.
06:36 - You might not like Zsh,
use a different one.
06:39 - I don't have any agenda, I'm
not telling you to use these.
06:42 - Have I said that enough times?
06:44 - Alright, what else?
06:45 - I also, to be honest with you,
06:46 - I have been doing some more thing,
06:48 - I haven't really been writing Python code
06:50 - but recently and in some
upcoming video tutorials,
06:53 - I've been running Python scripts
06:55 - to do something like train
a machine learning model
06:58 - that I'm going to use elsewhere
in my JavaScript code.
07:00 - So the thing that I have
recently learned, which I love,
07:03 - is something called Virtualenv
07:07 - for setting up a Python environment.
07:08 - Maybe this needs to go
in a separate video.
07:11 - I don't know if I really,
07:12 - this might actually turn into multi,
07:13 - I think this should probably
turn into multi-parts
07:16 - so we'll sort of figure that out as I go.
07:18 - But these are all the pieces.
07:20 - Let me pause for a
second and see if anyone
07:22 - who's watching this live in the chat
07:24 - has anything that I missed
07:26 - or any questions so far
about this map of stuff.
07:29 - I think I've got everything,
07:30 - though there were a few good comments
07:31 - that I think are useful to mention.
07:32 - Number one is,
07:35 - by text editor I also kind of mean IDE
07:39 - which stands for integrated
development environment,
07:42 - meaning it's a whole piece of software
07:44 - that has all these
features for running code
07:46 - and doing stuff with code
for developing things.
07:49 - I like to think of it as a text editor
07:50 - 'cause it's kind of what I use it for.
07:52 - I just edit text and save.
07:54 - But it has so many features.
07:55 - There's actually console access
07:57 - within Visual Studio Code itself,
which maybe I'll show you.
08:01 - And there are so many plugins,
08:03 - so I should make a note
of what plugins do I use.
08:07 - One that I use is called Beautify,
08:09 - so that it makes
everything nicely indented.
08:11 - So I'll try to show you
how to install that.
08:13 - I don't know if they're called plugins
08:14 - in Visual Studio Code,
08:15 - we'll look at that.
08:17 - And then also with something like
08:19 - iTerm has a lot of features
08:21 - and then Zsh has a lot of features.
08:23 - You can configure them and template them.
08:25 - I'm not going to get too far down that
08:28 - but I just use this
sort of default settings
08:31 - of Oh My Zsh 'cause it has
some nice colors that I like
08:34 - and it shows things that are useful to me.
08:36 - But I look forward to
hearing from your suggestions
08:38 - about how to configure
that stuff even more.
08:40 - Alright, so I'm going to
go through all of this.
08:43 - Let's start in this video with,
08:45 - actually, you know what?
08:46 - This was my introduction to my workflow.
08:49 - Multi-part series.
08:52 - In the next video,
08:53 - I'm going to go through
Visual Studio Code.
08:56 - Is that the right order to do this in?
08:58 - Why not, yes.
08:59 - Okay.
09:00 - (fun techno music)
