00:01 - hello in this video I'm going to see if
00:02 - I can come up with a new name for this
00:04 - YouTube channel because I need a new
00:05 - name and what I'm going to do is I'm
00:07 - going to generate one using an algorithm
00:09 - called a marov chain now if you watch
00:11 - the previous video then I spent a lot of
00:13 - time talking about what a marov chain is
00:15 - and building the code for a marov chain
00:17 - from scratch one thing I didn't do do
00:19 - however which this video will focus on
00:21 - is how to use a marov chain to generate
00:23 - a short phrase so in this sense what I'm
00:26 - going to feed into the marov chain is
00:28 - many many examples of that short phrase
00:30 - so you could use city names or character
00:33 - names or thesis title ideas or course
00:36 - title ideas I think of that like school
00:38 - stuff because that's what where my brain
00:39 - is at but you know YouTube channel names
00:42 - so um here are a bunch of uh YouTube
00:44 - channel names that came in suggested
00:46 - from the viewers through a Google form
00:48 - now I could actually connect to the
00:49 - Google form directly and I have a
00:51 - example that shows you how to do that
00:53 - but I think for right now for Simplicity
00:55 - sake this is just in a text file called
00:56 - names.txt so I'm going to go to the
00:59 - marov chain code no longer do I want to
01:02 - have the hardcoded text about the
01:04 - Unicorn or the theramin instead what I
01:07 - want to do is I'm going to make a
01:09 - variable called names I'm going to add
01:13 - the preload function so in P5 the
01:16 - preload function is a function where I
01:17 - can preload data files like images
01:20 - sounds and other kinds of data files and
01:23 - I'm going to say names equals load
01:25 - strings names.txt so if I do this and
01:29 - I'm just going to say console log names
01:31 - I'm going to get lots of weird errors CU
01:33 - I took out a bunch of other things um I
01:36 - should see o I don't see any oh yeah
01:38 - that's what I do I'm going to see this
01:40 - array of all the I have an array of all
01:42 - the names that people suggested and
01:44 - there's some other errors so now what I
01:46 - need to do is I need to do this so This
01:50 - engrams remember this engrams variable
01:52 - stores the table of everything so what I
01:56 - need to do is instead of having
01:58 - one piece of text that I feed into the
02:03 - model the engram table um the barov
02:06 - model table thing I to call it um I need
02:09 - to do that through a loop so what I need
02:11 - to do is I need to put an outer loop so
02:12 - I'm going to say uh for VAR J equals z J
02:16 - is less than names. length
02:19 - j++ and I'm going to put a loop around
02:22 - all of
02:23 - this and then what I'm going to do is
02:26 - this inner loop is the thing that adds
02:28 - stuff to the NRS model what I'm going to
02:30 - do is say VAR text equals names index I
02:34 - so I'm going to add each line from that
02:36 - text file one at a time to the model the
02:39 - reason why I want to do this is I want
02:41 - all of that to be part of the Poss
02:43 - possibilities however one thing that's
02:46 - not built into my code is well how does
02:49 - a name begin a name could begin with C
02:53 - Cod Jo y c o d t h e o d e w n so I want
03:00 - to keep a separate list of actual
03:02 - possible Beginnings for the generation
03:04 - process so on the one hand I'm kind of
03:06 - done here like it um the thing that
03:09 - won't work let me run this uh cannot Le
03:11 - read property length of undefined
03:13 - sketch. JS line7 let's see what the
03:16 - error is uh ah H oh names index J boy
03:20 - that's bad and j++ so remember the outer
03:23 - loop is J so I'm looking at each there
03:25 - is no
03:26 - I so that worked and you can see I'm
03:28 - getting a nice big list uh with all the
03:31 - sort of possibilities that table is
03:33 - working if I hit generate though I'm
03:35 - going to have an error and that error is
03:37 - txt is not defined because how I was
03:40 - able to how I started the generator was
03:43 - with just the first three letters or
03:46 - whatever the order is of that seed
03:48 - phrase now what I think that would make
03:50 - sense to
03:51 - do is I need to I want to create I'm
03:54 - going to call it
03:55 - Beginnings I don't know if I've
03:57 - mentioned this by the way that this most
03:58 - of the all the code that I'm writing is
04:00 - based on python code written by Allison
04:03 - parish and I'll make sure to credit her
04:05 - in both the previous video and this one
04:07 - I guess I'm mentioning it now I should
04:08 - have mentioned it in the first one um so
04:11 - thank you Allison for that code that at
04:13 - some point I looked at a couple years
04:15 - ago when I first started doing this
04:16 - stuff
04:18 - um okay um so that was implanted in my
04:21 - head two years ago and it's coming out
04:23 - right now I guess there might be some
04:24 - differences never mind okay so I what I
04:27 - want to do is have an array uh a called
04:29 - Beginnings which are what are the
04:31 - possible Beginnings so each time I look
04:33 - at a name the first gram is a possible
04:37 - beginning so
04:42 - if if I equals z beginnings. push gram
04:48 - so I want to keep track of an extra list
04:50 - of all the possible Beginnings meaning
04:53 - here is the table of all of the NRS and
04:57 - possible outcomes and if I look at
04:59 - beginning
05:00 - here is an array of all of the possible
05:02 - ways that a name could begin and again
05:05 - there's redundancy here and why are they
05:07 - all two characters instead of
05:10 - three oh my n must be two the N is two
05:14 - okay that's right um I was going to
05:16 - start with
05:17 - three so if I do this again and hit
05:20 - Beginnings we can see yeah so these are
05:21 - all the possible ways that a name could
05:23 - begin and there's redundancy in there
05:25 - but I like that because I want my names
05:27 - to begin with the same probability as my
05:30 - input data so now what I'm going to do
05:33 - is down here the current gram just needs
05:36 - I just need to pick a random beginning
05:39 - So Random Beginnings so I just pick a
05:41 - random beginning and that's where I
05:43 - start and then I let the algorithm just
05:45 - go so let's run it and see what I get
05:48 - coding codes and unicolors coding time
05:50 - rainbows shiftman's rainbow coding heres
05:53 - and dis spectrum of colored orange
05:55 - yellow code Kiton that in that code so
05:59 - you can see have we found something yet
06:01 - I think first of all a couple things one
06:02 - is I should probably limit the name to
06:04 - about maybe 15 characters I don't know
06:06 - maybe let's limit it to
06:08 - 20 and uh maybe let's make the order two
06:11 - because it's making too much sense
06:14 - coding blander cande unic coding happy
06:17 - Rodi coding pitchy code Cod the K
06:21 - Dro coding in
06:23 - happen OD thatan rating C so you can see
06:27 - here that this is working but what the
06:29 - order is is really going to affect um
06:33 - affect the sort of the this. show coding
06:36 - balloon coding meteor meteorological P
06:39 - Happy Jumpy Dancy codes and so uh that
06:42 - order might be too high I might only be
06:44 - getting literal the sort of literal
06:46 - names and another thing here to point
06:48 - out is this would be much more probably
06:50 - interesting if I had a data set of a
06:52 - 100,000 names that I could use um you
06:55 - know something you might try is to you
06:57 - know what's your input data come up with
07:00 - what the thing you're trying to name see
07:01 - if you can find a really big data set
07:03 - maybe have a slider where you can adjust
07:05 - the order so the the user can actually
07:08 - pick what that order is as as the user
07:11 - is generating text from it so I don't
07:13 - know if we've come I really thought that
07:16 - at the end of this video I'd be able to
07:18 - do this and now the new name of this
07:20 - channel is you know let's just say it's
07:23 - okay hold on let's make the order three
07:25 - is that's kind of in between let's just
07:27 - say it's for the rest of today the name
07:29 - of this channel
07:31 - is drum
07:36 - roll Joy of light appearing D # jooy of
07:41 - light appearing D see you all in another
07:44 - video I there some more stuff that I
07:45 - need to talk about which is looking at
07:48 - uh generating Markov chains for longer
07:50 - pieces of text perhaps as well as uh on
07:53 - the word level I think would be worth
07:54 - taking a look at as well
07:58 - okay
08:01 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hello in this video I'm going to see if I can come up with a new name for this YouTube channel because I need a new name and what I'm going to do is I'm going to generate one using an algorithm called a marov chain now if you watch the previous video then I spent a lot of time talking about what a marov chain is and building the code for a marov chain from scratch one thing I didn't do do however which this video will focus on is how to use a marov chain to generate a short phrase so in this sense what I'm going to feed into the marov chain is many many examples of that short phrase so you could use city names or character names or thesis title ideas or course title ideas I think of that like school stuff because that's what where my brain is at but you know YouTube channel names so um here are a bunch of uh YouTube channel names that came in suggested from the viewers through a Google form now I could actually connect to the Google form directly and I have a example that shows you how to do that but I think for right now for Simplicity sake this is just in a text file called names.txt so I'm going to go to the marov chain code no longer do I want to have the hardcoded text about the Unicorn or the theramin instead what I want to do is I'm going to make a variable called names I'm going to add the preload function so in P5 the preload function is a function where I can preload data files like images sounds and other kinds of data files and I'm going to say names equals load strings names.txt so if I do this and I'm just going to say console log names I'm going to get lots of weird errors CU I took out a bunch of other things um I should see o I don't see any oh yeah that's what I do I'm going to see this array of all the I have an array of all the names that people suggested and there's some other errors so now what I need to do is I need to do this so This engrams remember this engrams variable stores the table of everything so what I need to do is instead of having one piece of text that I feed into the model the engram table um the barov model table thing I to call it um I need to do that through a loop so what I need to do is I need to put an outer loop so I'm going to say uh for VAR J equals z J is less than names. length j++ and I'm going to put a loop around all of this and then what I'm going to do is this inner loop is the thing that adds stuff to the NRS model what I'm going to do is say VAR text equals names index I so I'm going to add each line from that text file one at a time to the model the reason why I want to do this is I want all of that to be part of the Poss possibilities however one thing that's not built into my code is well how does a name begin a name could begin with C Cod Jo y c o d t h e o d e w n so I want to keep a separate list of actual possible Beginnings for the generation process so on the one hand I'm kind of done here like it um the thing that won't work let me run this uh cannot Le read property length of undefined sketch. JS line7 let's see what the error is uh ah H oh names index J boy that's bad and j++ so remember the outer loop is J so I'm looking at each there is no I so that worked and you can see I'm getting a nice big list uh with all the sort of possibilities that table is working if I hit generate though I'm going to have an error and that error is txt is not defined because how I was able to how I started the generator was with just the first three letters or whatever the order is of that seed phrase now what I think that would make sense to do is I need to I want to create I'm going to call it Beginnings I don't know if I've mentioned this by the way that this most of the all the code that I'm writing is based on python code written by Allison parish and I'll make sure to credit her in both the previous video and this one I guess I'm mentioning it now I should have mentioned it in the first one um so thank you Allison for that code that at some point I looked at a couple years ago when I first started doing this stuff um okay um so that was implanted in my head two years ago and it's coming out right now I guess there might be some differences never mind okay so I what I want to do is have an array uh a called Beginnings which are what are the possible Beginnings so each time I look at a name the first gram is a possible beginning so if if I equals z beginnings. push gram so I want to keep track of an extra list of all the possible Beginnings meaning here is the table of all of the NRS and possible outcomes and if I look at beginning here is an array of all of the possible ways that a name could begin and again there's redundancy here and why are they all two characters instead of three oh my n must be two the N is two okay that's right um I was going to start with three so if I do this again and hit Beginnings we can see yeah so these are all the possible ways that a name could begin and there's redundancy in there but I like that because I want my names to begin with the same probability as my input data so now what I'm going to do is down here the current gram just needs I just need to pick a random beginning So Random Beginnings so I just pick a random beginning and that's where I start and then I let the algorithm just go so let's run it and see what I get coding codes and unicolors coding time rainbows shiftman's rainbow coding heres and dis spectrum of colored orange yellow code Kiton that in that code so you can see have we found something yet I think first of all a couple things one is I should probably limit the name to about maybe 15 characters I don't know maybe let's limit it to 20 and uh maybe let's make the order two because it's making too much sense coding blander cande unic coding happy Rodi coding pitchy code Cod the K Dro coding in happen OD thatan rating C so you can see here that this is working but what the order is is really going to affect um affect the sort of the this. show coding balloon coding meteor meteorological P Happy Jumpy Dancy codes and so uh that order might be too high I might only be getting literal the sort of literal names and another thing here to point out is this would be much more probably interesting if I had a data set of a 100,000 names that I could use um you know something you might try is to you know what's your input data come up with what the thing you're trying to name see if you can find a really big data set maybe have a slider where you can adjust the order so the the user can actually pick what that order is as as the user is generating text from it so I don't know if we've come I really thought that at the end of this video I'd be able to do this and now the new name of this channel is you know let's just say it's okay hold on let's make the order three is that's kind of in between let's just say it's for the rest of today the name of this channel is drum roll Joy of light appearing D # jooy of light appearing D see you all in another video I there some more stuff that I need to talk about which is looking at uh generating Markov chains for longer pieces of text perhaps as well as uh on the word level I think would be worth taking a look at as well okay
