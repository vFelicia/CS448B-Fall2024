00:00 - (tooting train whistle)
00:01 - Hello, welcome to another
holiday coding challenge!
00:04 - Again with the snowflakes!
00:05 - This is my second snowflake challenge,
00:07 - but in this time instead
of creating an algorithm
00:10 - to draw a snowflake, I'm
going to ask a neural network
00:13 - to draw a snowflake for me.
00:15 - Now, there's a lot of
pieces to all of the work
00:18 - that's gone in to making the fact
00:20 - that I'm going to be able to do this
00:21 - in well what probably will be
about four and a half hours,
00:23 - but really could take just
about 15 minutes possible.
00:27 - The first thing I want to
reference is the Magenta Project.
00:30 - So the Magenta Project
is a make music and art
00:32 - using machine learning research project,
00:34 - it's an open source research
project from Google,
00:37 - and it has a ton of examples,
00:41 - projects with TensorFlow in
both Python and JavaScript,
00:45 - and you can look through at
all these featured projects.
00:47 - The project I want to mention
is, I'll just click over here,
00:51 - is this project called SketchRNN,
00:54 - or draw together with a neural network.
00:56 - Now, if you've watched
any of my previous videos
00:58 - about the Quick, Draw dataset,
01:00 - the Quick, Draw dataset
is this huge collection
01:02 - of millions upon millions of doodles
01:04 - that users from around the world made,
01:06 - playing the Google Quick, Draw game.
01:09 - So what the researchers
from Google Brain did,
01:13 - you can see them credited here David Ha,
01:14 - Jonas Jongejan, and Ian Johnson
01:17 - wrote this paper about
how a neural network
01:21 - could be trained on all of those drawings,
01:24 - so it could learn okay when
somebody's drawing a cat
01:26 - they kind of go like this,
and then they go like this,
01:30 - and it could start to
imagine new drawings of cats.
01:32 - And it's called SketchRNN because
the kind of neural network
01:37 - that it's using is something called
01:38 - a Recurrent Neural Network.
01:39 - And you might have also seen this,
01:42 - Nabil Hassein was here
and did a guest video
01:44 - about generating texting with
a Recurrent Neural Network.
01:46 - A Recurrent Neural Network is good
01:48 - at learning about sequential information,
01:51 - like hello world is
sequential information.
01:54 - H-E-L-L-O space W-O-R-L-D.
01:58 - Music is sequential
information (singing a scale)
02:02 - that's a sequence of notes and rhythms.
02:04 - A drawing is a sequence of vectors.
02:07 - So you can read this paper
all about how they used
02:10 - the Google Quick, Draw dataset
02:12 - to train a model to create new drawings.
02:15 - You could also look at their demo,
02:17 - and this is the code by
the way for their demo.
02:19 - There's a lot involved here
in all of these pieces,
02:21 - and here's the demo right here.
02:23 - So, I'm going to pick cat,
02:25 - and what I can do is I can start drawing,
02:28 - oops, I can start drawing a cat,
02:30 - I'm just going to draw a circle,
02:32 - and then it will pick up for me
02:33 - and finish the rest of the cat.
02:35 - So at some point I will do
a part two of this video
02:39 - where I actually create an
interactive version like that,
02:41 - but one of the things that
is in now the ml5 project,
02:45 - ml5 is a friendly machine
learning for the web library
02:49 - that's built on top of TensorFlow.js.
02:52 - It works with p5 which is the
open source JavaScript library
02:56 - that I use in a lot of my video tutorials,
02:58 - is it has a SketchRNN module for you.
03:01 - So on the one hand you might want to go
03:04 - and look all the way through all this code
03:06 - and read the research paper
to learn how it works,
03:08 - but if you want to
quickly get up and running
03:10 - with playing with a SketchRNN model,
03:12 - what we've tried to put
in ml5 will help you.
03:16 - Now, (laughs) you might
notice that if I go
03:18 - click on reference, at
the time of this recording
03:20 - it doesn't say SketchRNN here.
03:23 - So this is actually a new feature.
03:25 - There's a couple issues
in the GitHub repository
03:29 - for ml5 about things that
don't work perfectly,
03:31 - or need to be added, or fixed,
we welcome contributions.
03:34 - I will come back and maybe
do some more videos with it
03:37 - once it's gotten further along
and there is documentation
03:39 - but for the holiday season let's see
03:42 - if we can get it to
draw a snowflake for us.
03:44 - So, I'm not going to be
able to use the website
03:47 - because the documentation isn't there,
03:49 - but I've got some documentation
03:52 - over here on my invisible
computer (laughs)
03:54 - that I can look at if I need to.
03:57 - So what do I have?
03:58 - I have a blank p5 sketch
with just setup and draw,
04:01 - and also at index.html I should call this
04:04 - Snowflake SketchRNN.
04:07 - I have also in addition to the
p5 libraries being imported,
04:12 - I have the ml5 library and again
04:14 - at the time of this
recording it's version 0.1.3.
04:17 - Hopefully there'll be future
updates to improve SketchRNN
04:20 - and there'll be a higher numbered version.
04:22 - So the first thing that I want to do
04:24 - is I want to make a variable
and I'm going to call it model.
04:28 - So model, I could call it SketchRNN,
04:30 - maybe I should call it SketchRNN,
04:31 - I'll just call it model,
model is the thing
04:33 - that's going to hold the SketchRNN model.
04:36 - It is all of the information,
04:38 - the brain of that neural network
04:40 - that we can ask to generate new stuff.
04:43 - So we can say, hey give me a new point
04:45 - along the path that
you're imagining to draw.
04:47 - So I'm going to say model equals ml5
04:53 - SketchRNN,
04:56 - and then I'm going to just put
a callback in here, model ready,
05:00 - and this is the important
thing, what goes here.
05:02 - So there are a bunch of
available models with SketchRNN
05:07 - and we can see that
list here, whoops, here.
05:09 - For example there is cat,
let's start with cat maybe
05:13 - but we can see all the other ones like
05:14 - the Mona Lisa apparently
is in there, bird.
05:18 - So let's, whatever is available
we can put cat in here.
05:22 - I'm asking ml5 to load the cat model.
05:26 - It's actually doing this from the cloud,
05:28 - the model, all of the data
for this machinery model
05:31 - is stored on a server somewhere,
05:33 - and ml5 knows how to load that for you.
05:35 - So, then what I'm going
to do is add a callback,
05:38 - I'm going to say model ready.
05:40 - I'm going to write a
function called model ready
05:42 - and I'm just going to say
console.log model ready.
05:46 - So let's just run this code
and see if it even just works
05:50 - loading the model without an error.
05:52 - So I'm going to close this demo down,
05:54 - we have my own here.
05:56 - Okay, great the model is loaded,
05:58 - and just to be sure,
05:59 - oh yeah initialized SketchRNN model ready,
06:01 - just to be sure if I
put in here like tiger,
06:04 - which I don't think is something in there.
06:07 - Oh, maybe it is (laughs)
06:10 - guacamole, that must not
be something in there.
06:12 - I spelled guacamole wrong even.
06:14 - Okay, right it couldn't
even find guacamole
06:15 - and I know that's spelled wrong,
06:17 - apologies to guacamole
lovers all over the world.
06:20 - Okay, so we've got the cat
now what do I need to do?
06:23 - The first thing I need to do
as soon as the model is ready
06:27 - is ask for something.
06:29 - So what SketchRNN will give you
06:31 - every time you ask for
it to generate something
06:34 - is what is referred to as a stroke.
06:38 - Now, I'm not going to use
the variable name stroke
06:40 - in my code because stroke
is a global function in p5
06:43 - that sets the outline color of a shape,
06:46 - and I don't want to
get confused with that,
06:49 - but the stroke is a JavaScript
object with a few properties.
06:54 - It has dx, dy, and I think
it's just called pen.
07:01 - And dx is a floating point
number, some number like 1.3,
07:06 - dy is some number like negative four,
07:08 - and pen is a string.
07:10 - It can either be up, down,
07:14 - or end.
07:15 - And what this refers to is a particular
07:19 - stroke of a pen basically.
07:20 - So if you could imagine dx
for the change in x, delta x,
07:24 - dy for the change in y, delta y.
07:27 - If I were to go over 1.3 units
and up negative four units,
07:33 - basically the stroke is this.
07:35 - This is the path of the pen,
07:37 - that's what SketchRNN
should draw right now,
07:41 - and it should either draw it
as a line if the pen is down.
07:45 - If the pen is up it should just move
07:47 - from here to there, right.
07:48 - Because if I'm drawing a
cat, I'm going to draw this,
07:50 - then I'm going to pick my
pen up, move over here,
07:53 - so that action is also a stroke
07:56 - but it's a stroke with the pen up.
07:57 - And then pen end is when
the drawing is finished.
08:01 - So this is what ml5 does, the
actual native SketchRNN model,
08:06 - just gives you all these
things as array of numbers,
08:09 - and so we've kind of made
it as a JavaScript object
08:11 - that makes it a little bit
easier to read hopefully.
08:14 - Okay, so now coming back over here
08:16 - I think I just say model.generate
08:21 - got sketch (laughs).
08:24 - Oh, oh, oh, yes!
08:25 - Now actually, an important
thing that I should probably do,
08:27 - I don't necessarily need
to do this the first time,
08:30 - but because this is a kind
of machine learning model
08:33 - that is giving us sequential information
08:36 - the next stroke, like the
one that comes after this one
08:41 - is quite important, it's
related to this one.
08:44 - But if I want to start
over and draw a new cat
08:47 - I need to kind of go back to the beginning
08:48 - and say start a new cat over.
08:50 - And so a model.reset function
is the thing that does that.
08:53 - So model.reset I'm going to call that,
08:57 - It should be reset the
first time you load it,
08:59 - but I'm going to call that anyway.
09:00 - Then I can say model.generate got sketch
09:03 - and then I'm going to write a function.
09:04 - I'm going to call it got sketch.
09:06 - It should get that stroke path.
09:08 - Let's just call that S
and let's have a variable.
09:12 - I'm going to have a global
variable called stroke path.
09:17 - And I'm going to set that I just going to
09:18 - set it to null when the program starts,
09:20 - and then when I get a new
sketch I'm going to say
09:22 - stroke path equals S,
and then I'm going to say
09:25 - console.log stroke path.
09:28 - So let's see if we get this first thing.
09:33 - Model loaded!
09:34 - Undefined oh.
09:36 - (laughs)
09:37 - That was close!
09:38 - (sad trumpet sound)
09:40 - I forgot, this is
actually very hard for me,
09:42 - I always make this mistake,
ml5 is written in such a way
09:47 - that uses something called
error first callbacks,
09:49 - this is different than how p5 is written.
09:51 - So this got sketch function is receiving,
09:54 - what was actually undefined
there was the error,
09:56 - there was no error.
09:57 - All the callbacks need to
have an error argument first.
10:02 - So, if I wanted to be really
thorough about error handling
10:07 - I might do something like this.
10:12 - So I could console out the error,
10:15 - and then if there is no error
10:18 - now just console log out the stroke path.
10:20 - So this should work now.
10:25 - Load that model!
10:26 - Ah there it goes!
10:27 - So look at this, I need to move
10:30 - this many pixels in the x direction,
10:32 - this many pixels in the y
direction, and the pen is down.
10:35 - So this should be easy
enough for a sample then.
10:39 - If I have an x and a y global variable,
10:44 - I'm going to start them in the middle.
10:51 - Then I am going to, in the
draw loop I'm going to say
10:55 - if stroke path is not
equal to null, right.
11:01 - I got to check do I have
a new stroke path, right.
11:04 - The new stroke path will
come in the callback here.
11:07 - And draw is always
looping, so draw's looping
11:09 - to wait to see that there's a stroke path.
11:11 - And again I could control
how the draw loop works
11:13 - with the query to the
model in a different way,
11:17 - but this is like an easy
way for me to do it.
11:19 - Draw's just going to loop,
then I'm going to say
11:23 - draw a line from x, y, to
x + dx, y plus dy, right.
11:28 - Just draw that line and then what?
11:30 - Let's set stroke path to null again.
11:32 - So once I'm done set
that stroke path to null.
11:35 - Okay, so we should just
see that one first line.
11:42 - Oh dx is not defined.
11:46 - Strokepath.dx, right
it's part of stroke path.
11:49 - I don't know why, the dx
and dy is in the object.
11:56 - Here it goes.
11:59 - Do you see it?
12:00 - Is there a line?
12:02 - How come I didn't see that line?
12:03 - Oh, hmm.
12:05 - Stroke zero?
12:09 - Stroke weight,
12:12 - stroke weight four?
12:14 - What did I miss?
12:15 - Line...
12:16 - Oh you know what!
12:18 - (laughs) I'm sort of forgetting.
12:21 - I just don't want to, I just
want to draw the background.
12:23 - I'm redrawing the background,
so as soon as I draw the line
12:26 - (bell ringing)
12:28 - that's such a mistake that I always make.
12:30 - I drew that line but
then draw looped again
12:32 - and drew the background over it.
12:34 - So this is a thing where
I just want to draw
12:35 - the background once and I'll
draw it in setup in this case.
12:41 - So let's draw it at setup.
12:42 - Here we go, we're getting there.
12:44 - Let's see that line.
12:46 - There it is!
12:47 - That's the first stroke of our cat.
12:49 - So we got the first path
that the neural network
12:53 - the SketchRNN model imagined for the cat.
12:55 - So now what we're going to do is...
13:02 - Ah wait what do we need to do?
13:04 - Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
13:05 - Let's just ask for the next one.
13:07 - So how did I ask for the first one?
13:09 - Model.generate, I can
just say okay I got one,
13:12 - set it to null, generate
and wait for the next one.
13:15 - Also though I need to move
x and y to that new point.
13:19 - So it actually might
make sense for me to say
13:21 - like new x equals, and
this will clean up the code
13:24 - a little bit in a way that
makes it more readable,
13:26 - this is the new x value,
this is the new y value,
13:33 - draw the line from old x to new x,
13:38 - set the stroke path to
null, ask for a new one,
13:41 - and also move x and y to the new position.
13:45 - So now when there's a new one
we should get the new one in.
13:48 - Guess what?
13:48 - Here we go.
13:52 - Let's see our cat.
13:53 - There's our cat!
13:55 - Whoa woo-hoo!
13:56 - And it's console logging its drawing,
13:57 - now, that looks crazy, right?
13:58 - Because I completely ignored the whole
14:01 - pen up versus down thing.
14:03 - So that's something really important.
14:04 - And there's something that
actually I didn't bother
14:06 - to tell you that's kind of important
14:08 - and makes it a little bit more confusing.
14:09 - Let's take out this
console.log by the way.
14:12 - So, the thing that's extra
confusing about the pen up
14:15 - and pen down is when
you get this information
14:18 - it's actually telling you the
pen state for the next stroke.
14:22 - This is not the pen's state
for this particular path,
14:26 - it's the pen state for the next one.
14:28 - Why is that?
14:28 - Well, it's a little bit weird
but if you think about it
14:31 - when you first start
drawing the pen is down,
14:34 - it has to be down, that's the definition
14:36 - of the beginning of the drawing.
14:37 - And then when you're done you're saying
14:40 - finish that last one then end.
14:42 - So, what it really is it's the pen state
14:45 - that you get in the previous
stroke sets the next one,
14:47 - and when it's end we're done.
14:49 - So let's try implementing
that, and a way we can do that
14:52 - I think is just by having a variable
14:54 - that's called like previous
pen, and previous pen,
14:58 - or I can just call it pen
actually, let's just call it pen.
15:01 - Because by definition pen is down.
15:04 - So pen is going to be down to start with.
15:06 - Pen is down.
15:08 - And here I'm only going to
actually draw it if pen,
15:13 - whoops sorry,
15:14 - if pen equals down then I should
actually draw the drawing,
15:20 - draw the line sorry,
15:22 - I should always, oh I
should always move X, right.
15:28 - So I always want to move X, but
I only want to draw the line
15:33 - if pen is down, and then what I need to do
15:37 - is here I need to say pen equals,
15:40 - oh I am going to need like a previous pen.
15:43 - Or can I do this like right before
15:45 - I get the new stroke path?
15:47 - I'm confused.
15:49 - Oh I can just say, I can say
pen equals strokepath.pen.
15:54 - So basically the pen starts as down,
15:57 - then I'm going to draw
and then pick up that
16:00 - for when the next time comes around.
16:02 - So don't pick up the actual
pen value from the object,
16:06 - you might need to think
about this for a little bit.
16:08 - This is really like previous pen,
16:10 - maybe I should call it previous.
16:12 - Because really what I'm checking here
16:14 - is the pen from the last time
16:15 - 'cause I'm picking it up after.
16:17 - Let's see if this works.
16:18 - (snare drumrolling)
16:22 - Look at that cat! (laughs)
16:25 - I was waiting for like, here's the thing,
16:27 - we don't know what we're going to get.
16:28 - This has just been trained on what
16:30 - users all over the world drew cats.
16:32 - And sometimes we're going
to get a nose and whiskers
16:34 - and sometimes we're not.
16:35 - We're going to see a
variety of different cats.
16:37 - Okay, but now we also need
to figure out what to do,
16:39 - we need to check for pen ending.
16:42 - So, if I here were to say
16:46 - if pen, let's set the stroke path to null,
16:49 - we can do all this but as long
as pen is not equal to end
17:00 - then I am going to say generate the new.
17:03 - So if pen is equal to N
don't bother to generate
17:06 - another stroke, and then I'm
going to just put in here
17:08 - else console.log
17:13 - drawing complete, okay.
17:16 - Let's give this a try.
17:17 - We're going to see the cat.
17:22 - There's out cat, there's our cat.
17:25 - Drawing complete!
17:27 - So maybe we should have
it restart a new one?
17:29 - And this is going to be
good for our snowflakes,
17:30 - you'll see in a second.
17:32 - So actually instead of drawing complete
17:33 - what I could actually do now
is I could say model.reset
17:40 - and model.generate again.
17:45 - So this is going to
instantaneously do another one.
17:51 - Let's see if this works. (laughing)
17:52 - Here's a cat, oh you know what,
17:54 - it's going to do it
from wherever it ended.
17:57 - So the other thing I need to
do is reset where x and y go,
18:00 - so let's say x goes back to
the middle of the screen,
18:04 - y goes back to the middle
of the screen also.
18:07 - It takes a while to load
the model, so each time
18:09 - I'm refreshing I have to
wait a little bit. (laughing)
18:13 - So let's see our cat, I
also need to give myself--
18:14 - oh look at that it's a
very different kind of cat.
18:16 - Drawing complete now
it's doing another one.
18:18 - So this is perfect because this is exactly
18:19 - what I want to do with snowflakes,
18:21 - this is exactly what I
want to do with snowflakes,
18:23 - so first let's change this to snowflake.
18:26 - Let's make this x a random place.
18:30 - Let's make this y a random place,
18:33 - and actually let's also
translate to the center.
18:40 - I want to translate to the center,
18:42 - and I'll explain why in a second.
18:44 - So actually this is going to be at random,
18:50 - anywhere randomly in the canvas,
18:53 - so x is going to be
between negative half width
18:56 - and positive half width.
19:02 - Y is negative half height,
positive half height.
19:06 - And then I want to do
exactly the same thing
19:09 - whenever I finish the snowflake.
19:13 - Okay, here we go.
19:15 - And let's see what happens.
19:18 - I don't know how big these
snowflakes are going to be.
19:21 - There's a nice snowflake.
19:24 - There we go, look it's
drawing snowflakes. (laughing)
19:26 - So I wanted to create a
big scene of snowflakes,
19:29 - so I think in order to do that
19:30 - I need to scale everything down.
19:33 - And so I could do this in so many--
19:36 - what if I just...
19:39 - What if I just did this.
19:44 - What if I just scaled
all the dx's and dy's
19:48 - by like one percent, by ten percent.
19:50 - I was actually going to do
it a totally different way,
19:53 - but would this actually work this might be
19:55 - an easier way to do it.
19:58 - Yeah, there we go.
20:00 - All right, here is our
festive world of snowflakes,
20:05 - and I am going to make this larger,
20:13 - I'm going to get rid of
the console, do this.
20:17 - Whoops.
20:20 - Whoops.
20:21 - (laughs)
20:25 - Nice big canvas.
20:26 - Oh, there we go that's good enough.
20:29 - Okay, go!
20:31 - Draw snowflakes!
20:32 - So (laughs) there we are everybody.
20:36 - So you could imagine you
could probably create
20:37 - a whole scene with a
bunch of different things,
20:39 - and do much more.
20:40 - I'm going to let this
run for a little bit,
20:42 - we'll speed this up so we can see what
20:44 - this scene of snowflakes looks
like in a couple minutes.
20:47 - (light cheerful music)
20:57 - All right, so as you can see--
20:58 - by the way during all that time (laughs)
21:00 - I changed the background
to black, made it sort of
21:02 - full screen and drawing
the snowflakes white.
21:04 - But you can see this is
what after it's drawn
21:06 - a whole bunch of them this is what we get.
21:09 - So I would encourage you,
this is what's going to be
21:10 - interesting about this is oh
could you save those in objects
21:13 - and then combine this with my last year's
21:16 - snowflake snowfall coding challenge?
21:18 - Could you think about color,
could you animate them
21:21 - in some way, what other
types of things might you do
21:24 - with SketchRNN into a scene,
so many possibilities.
21:27 - I'm sure you will create something.
21:30 - Take a look in this video subscription
21:32 - for the link to the codingtrain.com page
21:35 - where you can submit
your versions of this,
21:37 - and hopefully when you're watching this
21:40 - there'll be more information also
21:42 - about SketchRNN on the ml5 website itself.
21:44 - Okay, thanks for watching!
21:46 - (tooting train whistle)
21:47 - (light cheerful music)

Cleaned transcript:

(tooting train whistle) Hello, welcome to another holiday coding challenge! Again with the snowflakes! This is my second snowflake challenge, but in this time instead of creating an algorithm to draw a snowflake, I'm going to ask a neural network to draw a snowflake for me. Now, there's a lot of pieces to all of the work that's gone in to making the fact that I'm going to be able to do this in well what probably will be about four and a half hours, but really could take just about 15 minutes possible. The first thing I want to reference is the Magenta Project. So the Magenta Project is a make music and art using machine learning research project, it's an open source research project from Google, and it has a ton of examples, projects with TensorFlow in both Python and JavaScript, and you can look through at all these featured projects. The project I want to mention is, I'll just click over here, is this project called SketchRNN, or draw together with a neural network. Now, if you've watched any of my previous videos about the Quick, Draw dataset, the Quick, Draw dataset is this huge collection of millions upon millions of doodles that users from around the world made, playing the Google Quick, Draw game. So what the researchers from Google Brain did, you can see them credited here David Ha, Jonas Jongejan, and Ian Johnson wrote this paper about how a neural network could be trained on all of those drawings, so it could learn okay when somebody's drawing a cat they kind of go like this, and then they go like this, and it could start to imagine new drawings of cats. And it's called SketchRNN because the kind of neural network that it's using is something called a Recurrent Neural Network. And you might have also seen this, Nabil Hassein was here and did a guest video about generating texting with a Recurrent Neural Network. A Recurrent Neural Network is good at learning about sequential information, like hello world is sequential information. HELLO space WORLD. Music is sequential information (singing a scale) that's a sequence of notes and rhythms. A drawing is a sequence of vectors. So you can read this paper all about how they used the Google Quick, Draw dataset to train a model to create new drawings. You could also look at their demo, and this is the code by the way for their demo. There's a lot involved here in all of these pieces, and here's the demo right here. So, I'm going to pick cat, and what I can do is I can start drawing, oops, I can start drawing a cat, I'm just going to draw a circle, and then it will pick up for me and finish the rest of the cat. So at some point I will do a part two of this video where I actually create an interactive version like that, but one of the things that is in now the ml5 project, ml5 is a friendly machine learning for the web library that's built on top of TensorFlow.js. It works with p5 which is the open source JavaScript library that I use in a lot of my video tutorials, is it has a SketchRNN module for you. So on the one hand you might want to go and look all the way through all this code and read the research paper to learn how it works, but if you want to quickly get up and running with playing with a SketchRNN model, what we've tried to put in ml5 will help you. Now, (laughs) you might notice that if I go click on reference, at the time of this recording it doesn't say SketchRNN here. So this is actually a new feature. There's a couple issues in the GitHub repository for ml5 about things that don't work perfectly, or need to be added, or fixed, we welcome contributions. I will come back and maybe do some more videos with it once it's gotten further along and there is documentation but for the holiday season let's see if we can get it to draw a snowflake for us. So, I'm not going to be able to use the website because the documentation isn't there, but I've got some documentation over here on my invisible computer (laughs) that I can look at if I need to. So what do I have? I have a blank p5 sketch with just setup and draw, and also at index.html I should call this Snowflake SketchRNN. I have also in addition to the p5 libraries being imported, I have the ml5 library and again at the time of this recording it's version 0.1.3. Hopefully there'll be future updates to improve SketchRNN and there'll be a higher numbered version. So the first thing that I want to do is I want to make a variable and I'm going to call it model. So model, I could call it SketchRNN, maybe I should call it SketchRNN, I'll just call it model, model is the thing that's going to hold the SketchRNN model. It is all of the information, the brain of that neural network that we can ask to generate new stuff. So we can say, hey give me a new point along the path that you're imagining to draw. So I'm going to say model equals ml5 SketchRNN, and then I'm going to just put a callback in here, model ready, and this is the important thing, what goes here. So there are a bunch of available models with SketchRNN and we can see that list here, whoops, here. For example there is cat, let's start with cat maybe but we can see all the other ones like the Mona Lisa apparently is in there, bird. So let's, whatever is available we can put cat in here. I'm asking ml5 to load the cat model. It's actually doing this from the cloud, the model, all of the data for this machinery model is stored on a server somewhere, and ml5 knows how to load that for you. So, then what I'm going to do is add a callback, I'm going to say model ready. I'm going to write a function called model ready and I'm just going to say console.log model ready. So let's just run this code and see if it even just works loading the model without an error. So I'm going to close this demo down, we have my own here. Okay, great the model is loaded, and just to be sure, oh yeah initialized SketchRNN model ready, just to be sure if I put in here like tiger, which I don't think is something in there. Oh, maybe it is (laughs) guacamole, that must not be something in there. I spelled guacamole wrong even. Okay, right it couldn't even find guacamole and I know that's spelled wrong, apologies to guacamole lovers all over the world. Okay, so we've got the cat now what do I need to do? The first thing I need to do as soon as the model is ready is ask for something. So what SketchRNN will give you every time you ask for it to generate something is what is referred to as a stroke. Now, I'm not going to use the variable name stroke in my code because stroke is a global function in p5 that sets the outline color of a shape, and I don't want to get confused with that, but the stroke is a JavaScript object with a few properties. It has dx, dy, and I think it's just called pen. And dx is a floating point number, some number like 1.3, dy is some number like negative four, and pen is a string. It can either be up, down, or end. And what this refers to is a particular stroke of a pen basically. So if you could imagine dx for the change in x, delta x, dy for the change in y, delta y. If I were to go over 1.3 units and up negative four units, basically the stroke is this. This is the path of the pen, that's what SketchRNN should draw right now, and it should either draw it as a line if the pen is down. If the pen is up it should just move from here to there, right. Because if I'm drawing a cat, I'm going to draw this, then I'm going to pick my pen up, move over here, so that action is also a stroke but it's a stroke with the pen up. And then pen end is when the drawing is finished. So this is what ml5 does, the actual native SketchRNN model, just gives you all these things as array of numbers, and so we've kind of made it as a JavaScript object that makes it a little bit easier to read hopefully. Okay, so now coming back over here I think I just say model.generate got sketch (laughs). Oh, oh, oh, yes! Now actually, an important thing that I should probably do, I don't necessarily need to do this the first time, but because this is a kind of machine learning model that is giving us sequential information the next stroke, like the one that comes after this one is quite important, it's related to this one. But if I want to start over and draw a new cat I need to kind of go back to the beginning and say start a new cat over. And so a model.reset function is the thing that does that. So model.reset I'm going to call that, It should be reset the first time you load it, but I'm going to call that anyway. Then I can say model.generate got sketch and then I'm going to write a function. I'm going to call it got sketch. It should get that stroke path. Let's just call that S and let's have a variable. I'm going to have a global variable called stroke path. And I'm going to set that I just going to set it to null when the program starts, and then when I get a new sketch I'm going to say stroke path equals S, and then I'm going to say console.log stroke path. So let's see if we get this first thing. Model loaded! Undefined oh. (laughs) That was close! (sad trumpet sound) I forgot, this is actually very hard for me, I always make this mistake, ml5 is written in such a way that uses something called error first callbacks, this is different than how p5 is written. So this got sketch function is receiving, what was actually undefined there was the error, there was no error. All the callbacks need to have an error argument first. So, if I wanted to be really thorough about error handling I might do something like this. So I could console out the error, and then if there is no error now just console log out the stroke path. So this should work now. Load that model! Ah there it goes! So look at this, I need to move this many pixels in the x direction, this many pixels in the y direction, and the pen is down. So this should be easy enough for a sample then. If I have an x and a y global variable, I'm going to start them in the middle. Then I am going to, in the draw loop I'm going to say if stroke path is not equal to null, right. I got to check do I have a new stroke path, right. The new stroke path will come in the callback here. And draw is always looping, so draw's looping to wait to see that there's a stroke path. And again I could control how the draw loop works with the query to the model in a different way, but this is like an easy way for me to do it. Draw's just going to loop, then I'm going to say draw a line from x, y, to x + dx, y plus dy, right. Just draw that line and then what? Let's set stroke path to null again. So once I'm done set that stroke path to null. Okay, so we should just see that one first line. Oh dx is not defined. Strokepath.dx, right it's part of stroke path. I don't know why, the dx and dy is in the object. Here it goes. Do you see it? Is there a line? How come I didn't see that line? Oh, hmm. Stroke zero? Stroke weight, stroke weight four? What did I miss? Line... Oh you know what! (laughs) I'm sort of forgetting. I just don't want to, I just want to draw the background. I'm redrawing the background, so as soon as I draw the line (bell ringing) that's such a mistake that I always make. I drew that line but then draw looped again and drew the background over it. So this is a thing where I just want to draw the background once and I'll draw it in setup in this case. So let's draw it at setup. Here we go, we're getting there. Let's see that line. There it is! That's the first stroke of our cat. So we got the first path that the neural network the SketchRNN model imagined for the cat. So now what we're going to do is... Ah wait what do we need to do? Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Let's just ask for the next one. So how did I ask for the first one? Model.generate, I can just say okay I got one, set it to null, generate and wait for the next one. Also though I need to move x and y to that new point. So it actually might make sense for me to say like new x equals, and this will clean up the code a little bit in a way that makes it more readable, this is the new x value, this is the new y value, draw the line from old x to new x, set the stroke path to null, ask for a new one, and also move x and y to the new position. So now when there's a new one we should get the new one in. Guess what? Here we go. Let's see our cat. There's our cat! Whoa woohoo! And it's console logging its drawing, now, that looks crazy, right? Because I completely ignored the whole pen up versus down thing. So that's something really important. And there's something that actually I didn't bother to tell you that's kind of important and makes it a little bit more confusing. Let's take out this console.log by the way. So, the thing that's extra confusing about the pen up and pen down is when you get this information it's actually telling you the pen state for the next stroke. This is not the pen's state for this particular path, it's the pen state for the next one. Why is that? Well, it's a little bit weird but if you think about it when you first start drawing the pen is down, it has to be down, that's the definition of the beginning of the drawing. And then when you're done you're saying finish that last one then end. So, what it really is it's the pen state that you get in the previous stroke sets the next one, and when it's end we're done. So let's try implementing that, and a way we can do that I think is just by having a variable that's called like previous pen, and previous pen, or I can just call it pen actually, let's just call it pen. Because by definition pen is down. So pen is going to be down to start with. Pen is down. And here I'm only going to actually draw it if pen, whoops sorry, if pen equals down then I should actually draw the drawing, draw the line sorry, I should always, oh I should always move X, right. So I always want to move X, but I only want to draw the line if pen is down, and then what I need to do is here I need to say pen equals, oh I am going to need like a previous pen. Or can I do this like right before I get the new stroke path? I'm confused. Oh I can just say, I can say pen equals strokepath.pen. So basically the pen starts as down, then I'm going to draw and then pick up that for when the next time comes around. So don't pick up the actual pen value from the object, you might need to think about this for a little bit. This is really like previous pen, maybe I should call it previous. Because really what I'm checking here is the pen from the last time 'cause I'm picking it up after. Let's see if this works. (snare drumrolling) Look at that cat! (laughs) I was waiting for like, here's the thing, we don't know what we're going to get. This has just been trained on what users all over the world drew cats. And sometimes we're going to get a nose and whiskers and sometimes we're not. We're going to see a variety of different cats. Okay, but now we also need to figure out what to do, we need to check for pen ending. So, if I here were to say if pen, let's set the stroke path to null, we can do all this but as long as pen is not equal to end then I am going to say generate the new. So if pen is equal to N don't bother to generate another stroke, and then I'm going to just put in here else console.log drawing complete, okay. Let's give this a try. We're going to see the cat. There's out cat, there's our cat. Drawing complete! So maybe we should have it restart a new one? And this is going to be good for our snowflakes, you'll see in a second. So actually instead of drawing complete what I could actually do now is I could say model.reset and model.generate again. So this is going to instantaneously do another one. Let's see if this works. (laughing) Here's a cat, oh you know what, it's going to do it from wherever it ended. So the other thing I need to do is reset where x and y go, so let's say x goes back to the middle of the screen, y goes back to the middle of the screen also. It takes a while to load the model, so each time I'm refreshing I have to wait a little bit. (laughing) So let's see our cat, I also need to give myself oh look at that it's a very different kind of cat. Drawing complete now it's doing another one. So this is perfect because this is exactly what I want to do with snowflakes, this is exactly what I want to do with snowflakes, so first let's change this to snowflake. Let's make this x a random place. Let's make this y a random place, and actually let's also translate to the center. I want to translate to the center, and I'll explain why in a second. So actually this is going to be at random, anywhere randomly in the canvas, so x is going to be between negative half width and positive half width. Y is negative half height, positive half height. And then I want to do exactly the same thing whenever I finish the snowflake. Okay, here we go. And let's see what happens. I don't know how big these snowflakes are going to be. There's a nice snowflake. There we go, look it's drawing snowflakes. (laughing) So I wanted to create a big scene of snowflakes, so I think in order to do that I need to scale everything down. And so I could do this in so many what if I just... What if I just did this. What if I just scaled all the dx's and dy's by like one percent, by ten percent. I was actually going to do it a totally different way, but would this actually work this might be an easier way to do it. Yeah, there we go. All right, here is our festive world of snowflakes, and I am going to make this larger, I'm going to get rid of the console, do this. Whoops. Whoops. (laughs) Nice big canvas. Oh, there we go that's good enough. Okay, go! Draw snowflakes! So (laughs) there we are everybody. So you could imagine you could probably create a whole scene with a bunch of different things, and do much more. I'm going to let this run for a little bit, we'll speed this up so we can see what this scene of snowflakes looks like in a couple minutes. (light cheerful music) All right, so as you can see by the way during all that time (laughs) I changed the background to black, made it sort of full screen and drawing the snowflakes white. But you can see this is what after it's drawn a whole bunch of them this is what we get. So I would encourage you, this is what's going to be interesting about this is oh could you save those in objects and then combine this with my last year's snowflake snowfall coding challenge? Could you think about color, could you animate them in some way, what other types of things might you do with SketchRNN into a scene, so many possibilities. I'm sure you will create something. Take a look in this video subscription for the link to the codingtrain.com page where you can submit your versions of this, and hopefully when you're watching this there'll be more information also about SketchRNN on the ml5 website itself. Okay, thanks for watching! (tooting train whistle) (light cheerful music)
