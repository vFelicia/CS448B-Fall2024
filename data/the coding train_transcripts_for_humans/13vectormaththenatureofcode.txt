00:02 - okay I will not bump into a lamp at the
00:05 - beginning of this video hello um maybe
00:08 - you just watched the last video maybe
00:09 - you had a chance to look at the P vector
00:11 - class a little bit tried in your code
00:13 - hopefully you don't have too many
00:14 - problems if you did hopefully somebody
00:17 - helped you I hope I helped you in some
00:18 - way in this video we now are going to
00:21 - take a break in subtle actually we're
00:24 - not really we're still going to look at
00:25 - the P vector class but we're going to
00:26 - take a break from this we've got this
00:28 - like laser focus where we're going to
00:31 - build our first simple simple physics
00:33 - engine but we're going to take a break
00:35 - from that just to kind of walk through a
00:37 - few key concepts in I feel the need to
00:40 - write this and it has a vector P no just
00:42 - vector where should I write this over
00:44 - here vector math breathe breathe we're
00:52 - using the word math but it's okay it's
00:54 - comforting soothing relaxing mat joyful
00:58 - math it's gonna be fine
01:00 - I I feel a little bit of anxiety in
01:02 - myself because I don't want to screw
01:03 - this up but we're gonna get through it
01:05 - together okay vector math now here's the
01:07 - thing let's go over here for a second ah
01:12 - come on camera did you really go off my
01:19 - back did this go off oh here we are I
01:22 - don't know what went off something went
01:24 - off I'm sorry okay we're back hi
01:27 - maybe I'll edit that out and yeah that's
01:30 - probably so look over here this is the
01:34 - processing P vector documentation page
01:36 - now this isn't comprehensive lesson on
01:40 - everything you could possibly ever do
01:41 - with vectors in your entire life but one
01:44 - thing we want to look at just to get
01:46 - started here is if we scroll down a
01:47 - little bit we can see here are a list of
01:51 - functions available in the P vector
01:53 - class random set mag mag squared I don't
01:57 - know maybe I want to make this bigger so
01:59 - we can really see it add subtract
02:00 - multiply divide distance dot cross
02:02 - normalize Limited send mag heading
02:04 - rotate lerp there's lots of functions I
02:05 - actually want to just look through four
02:08 - simple ones in this video we're at you
02:11 - know if you are big
02:13 - some strange commitment to kind of go
02:14 - through all this stuff with me we will
02:16 - get to other things we will get to the
02:18 - dot product we will get to other
02:19 - mathematical pieces about vectors but my
02:22 - feeling here is that it's more important
02:23 - to look at them when they're necessary
02:25 - when we're using them in an actual
02:26 - application an actual example rather
02:28 - than just kind of look math functions
02:30 - juggling but I do want to take the time
02:33 - before we get back into the physics
02:35 - stuff to looking at four basic things
02:37 - and let's make a list of those things so
02:39 - those things I don't know I'm going to
02:40 - do that over here we're going to look at
02:42 - ad which kind of comes with the idea of
02:45 - subtraction we're going to look at
02:47 - multiply which kind of comes with it the
02:50 - idea of division and I should also just
02:53 - kind of say but think of this with the
02:55 - word scale multiplying what I really
02:59 - mean there is scaling a vector growing
03:01 - it shrinking it but we'll get to that I
03:03 - want to look at magnitude how do we
03:06 - actually and I guess I'm going to use
03:08 - I'm just going to write that whole word
03:10 - out and I want to look at normalize the
03:15 - magnitude function processing by the way
03:16 - is just Mac okay so I want to look at
03:19 - these four math functions with vectors I
03:22 - want to make a little simple processing
03:24 - sketch that kind of dabbles in them that
03:25 - demonstrates how the syntax works and
03:27 - what they're doing and once we have
03:30 - these tools here we're going to be able
03:32 - to go on the next video and make another
03:36 - thing move around the screen by the way
03:38 - okay I had a couple mishaps but we're
03:43 - back in the same video okay the board
03:46 - looks a little different but you know
03:47 - everything's okay nothing bad happened
03:49 - here okay um we had a little time left I
03:53 - want you know I want what I want to do
03:55 - in this time that we have left because
03:56 - we have an infinite amount of time as
03:57 - long as I can stand here and keep
03:58 - talking but I don't want this to go on
04:00 - for too long I want to walk through
04:01 - these four mathematical operations that
04:04 - are available in the P vector class and
04:07 - we're going to start with ad now ad is
04:09 - actually something we're quite familiar
04:10 - with already because we said location
04:13 - dot add velocity that's something we did
04:15 - in the previous video what did it mean
04:17 - to add the location vector and the
04:18 - velocity vector
04:19 - it means add the velocities x component
04:23 - two locations X component add velocities
04:25 - Y
04:26 - component two locations y-component
04:28 - we're comfortable that and that's
04:29 - actually all we need to know but I think
04:31 - it's worth examining visually for a
04:33 - moment what it means to add vectors now
04:36 - let's say we have two vectors V and u
04:41 - here's the vector V here is a the vector
04:46 - I'm going to you know draw sort of two
04:48 - strange-looking vectors now one thing I
04:50 - should point out is this notation V with
04:52 - an arrow on top that is vector notation
04:54 - that's what you would find in a
04:56 - mathematics or physics textbook we're
04:59 - going to use that from time to time just
05:00 - when we're talking about diagrams and
05:02 - notation but for the most part we're not
05:03 - going to see vector notation because
05:05 - we're working in source code so there's
05:07 - nothing but just sort of raw text there
05:09 - no arrows on top or weird squiggly lines
05:10 - or strange spirally Greek letters or
05:14 - whatever but we're going to use that
05:16 - from time to time so what does it mean
05:17 - to add two vectors what it means is so
05:20 - let's say W W equals V Plus u what it
05:28 - means to add two vectors is to put them
05:30 - end to end so we can draw a V like this
05:33 - we can draw u like this and then here
05:37 - this is W which equals V Plus u v Plus u
05:44 - so if we put vectors end to end we're
05:47 - adding and that makes sense if W is
05:49 - instructions for how to get from here to
05:51 - there then we follow the instructions
05:52 - from u how to get from here to there and
05:54 - our new vector from the where we started
05:56 - to where we ended up is adding those two
05:58 - vectors together this actually Maps
06:00 - exactly to what we're doing with
06:01 - location and velocity right let's make a
06:03 - little processing window right here here
06:06 - is our location right that is where our
06:08 - we're drawing our little bouncing ball
06:10 - it's at that location what is the
06:12 - location vector it is a vector
06:15 - that tells us how to get from the origin
06:16 - to that location so it points from zero
06:19 - zero to that location now if we want to
06:21 - add velocity to that location and let's
06:24 - say this is our current velocity then we
06:27 - put those vectors end to end like this
06:29 - and this vector right here is location
06:34 - plus velocity so this is what we're
06:38 - doing and now the ball
06:40 - at this new location so that's exactly
06:42 - what we're doing when we're using
06:43 - vectors in our code to move something
06:45 - around the screen velocity changes
06:47 - location over time it maps to exactly
06:50 - what the sort of the underlying
06:52 - mathematics of adding vectors is and we
06:54 - know from doing this that to add V Plus
06:56 - u means add the components together what
06:58 - I mean by that is W sub X equals V sub X
07:01 - plus u sub X W sub y equals V sub y plus
07:05 - use of Y look at that we just made this
07:08 - all a little bit a little bit of math
07:09 - sub this that and it feels kind of
07:11 - relaxed again fine right this is okay
07:14 - you guys are okay with this deep breath
07:18 - okay now let's move on a little bit if
07:21 - we know add then we kind of instantly
07:24 - know subtract and normally I might stop
07:27 - and not go over anything about subtract
07:29 - however subtracting vectors is so common
07:34 - in all the examples that we're going to
07:35 - do it there's something more to it than
07:37 - just the just saying I'm putting a minus
07:39 - where a plus is now in truth or isn't
07:42 - anymore to it it just is if we want to
07:44 - say W equals V minus u all we need to do
07:48 - is put a minus there and put a minus
07:50 - there but let's look at what that means
07:52 - in terms of a diagram so this is V this
08:01 - is you right but if we want to say V
08:05 - minus U this vector is minus u so and if
08:11 - I just move this little thing here this
08:14 - here is V minus U so we put vectors end
08:20 - to end but instead of the plus you use
08:23 - Direction is inverted negative of a
08:25 - vector is the same vector with the same
08:27 - magnitude but in the opposite direction
08:29 - now we get V minus u now why is that
08:32 - useful let's just say for a moment that
08:37 - we have something here and we have
08:40 - something here let's say this is the
08:43 - center of the screen that's a vector
08:45 - called center and this is a vector
08:48 - called Mouse
08:51 - it's where the mouse is I'm going to
08:54 - draw a little mouse pointer so I got
08:57 - lost to drive a little mouse pointer for
08:59 - a moment okay here we are now what does
09:02 - it mean to say mouse - Center let's look
09:08 - at that mouse - Center Mouse now this is
09:15 - Center let's put Center like in this is
09:18 - the vet vector over here in the reverse
09:20 - direction
09:20 - look this vector over here is Mouse -
09:24 - Center in other words it's this vector I
09:28 - didn't draw it for her well it's kind of
09:30 - a little bit of a disaster I think this
09:32 - is something that I'm going to have to
09:33 - work on how to describe this and explain
09:35 - this but hopefully you're following it
09:36 - somewhat right the reason why I subtract
09:39 - is so useful is if we want to make a
09:41 - vector that points from one location to
09:42 - another location we use subtract right
09:45 - what makes sense like if location plus
09:47 - velocity is the new location the new
09:49 - location minus the previous location
09:51 - would be that velocity and we can use
09:53 - this we're going to use this a lot for
09:55 - example when we want to do gravitational
09:56 - attraction between two bodies we need to
09:58 - know we need to have a vector that
10:00 - points from one body to the other one so
10:01 - we can subtract their locations
10:03 - subtracting two locations gives us a
10:05 - vector that points from one to the other
10:07 - one thing that's misleading about these
10:08 - diagrams which I should point out is
10:10 - that I kind of drew the vector over here
10:12 - so it seems like it's in the wrong place
10:14 - vectors don't have a place vectors just
10:17 - describe a magnitude in the direction we
10:20 - position them around some sort of
10:22 - diagram to try to explain something but
10:24 - there is no like actual location for
10:27 - that vector so what I mean by a vector
10:30 - that describes the difference between
10:32 - these two points we use subtract for
10:34 - that and let's let's move and let's
10:35 - actually make our processing example do
10:37 - this wow this is getting long
10:38 - I guess you're watching long videos
10:41 - today what can I do I don't know what
10:43 - else to do am i over here I'm over here
10:45 - okay so I have a little processing
10:46 - sketch which shows a dot in the center
10:49 - and you can see where the mouse is what
10:51 - I want to make is a vector that points
10:52 - from that dot to the mouse and we can do
10:55 - that rather easily I can say P vector
11:00 - mouse is a new vector where the mouse is
11:05 - mouse X Mouse Y and then I want to say P
11:10 - vector Center is a new vector in the
11:14 - center of the window and now I want to
11:18 - subtract Center from Mouse so this is
11:23 - that operation mouse equals mouse -
11:26 - Center what do I get there I get the
11:29 - difference between the mouse location
11:30 - and the center location and if I were to
11:33 - draw a line now a line that starts at
11:35 - zero zero to Mouse X Mouse dot Y let's
11:41 - run this we can see I now have a line
11:43 - that's always pointing out why is that
11:45 - line starting in the center of the
11:47 - window I drew it at zero zero if you
11:49 - notice translate I had this extra a
11:51 - little bit of code earlier if you're not
11:52 - familiar with 2d transformations you
11:54 - should go stop right now go to the
11:56 - Prostate website processing org slash
11:58 - learning slash transform two days you go
12:01 - look through how translate rotate push
12:03 - matrix pop matrix all that stuff works
12:05 - we're going to use that in these
12:06 - examples right this is not like some of
12:08 - this stuff is kind of basic some this
12:09 - stuff requires some previous knowledge
12:11 - but you can see here that now we now
12:13 - have a line that points from the mouse
12:15 - to the center great so that is
12:17 - subtraction and addition we're going to
12:22 - keep going eight minutes plus five
12:25 - minutes thirty now this can be some
12:26 - twenty minute video I got to keep going
12:28 - okay because the other stuff I'm gonna
12:32 - press this button I know this is not I'm
12:34 - kind of I'm a little tired I need to go
12:37 - eat lunch below like Lu Zhi but I don't
12:41 - worry I'm gonna be fine I mean I don't
12:44 - not that you're actually worried anyway
12:47 - um okay let's move on to multiply I
12:54 - think maybe we're going to do magnitude
12:56 - and normalize in a separate video
12:58 - because I feel like we but I want to get
13:00 - to multiply for a second because I think
13:02 - it's going to show something pretty
13:03 - useful on that we could maybe use so
13:07 - let's just get to multiply we're going
13:09 - to take a short break
13:10 - I think it's no break for you just keep
13:12 - watching but I'm going to take a short
13:14 - break okay multiply now what do I mean
13:17 - by multiply
13:18 - we had you and me right our friends you
13:21 - we said you plus V I mean we could say
13:23 - you multiplied V there really isn't a
13:26 - multiplication operation in the way that
13:29 - we might initially think for multiplying
13:31 - two vectors there are some
13:34 - multiplication like activities
13:35 - activities
13:36 - fun activities for you doing a Saturday
13:39 - afternoon the dot product in the cross
13:40 - product so that's cut off but that says
13:42 - dot and that says cross right but what
13:44 - we want to actually look at is this
13:47 - scenario you times n so when we use the
13:51 - mult or multiply which stands for
13:53 - multiply function in processing what we
13:55 - really mean is scale what we're looking
13:59 - to do is scale the vector grow it or
14:02 - shrink it and what we do that is we
14:05 - scale it by a scalar value so when we
14:08 - say a vector we mean a collection of
14:11 - values a two-dimensional vector is x and
14:14 - a y three dimensional vectors in XY and
14:16 - z when we say a scalar we mean a
14:18 - singular quantity so if we have this
14:20 - vector V what if we were to say V times
14:25 - two what do you think we do we keep the
14:28 - vectors same exact direction but we grow
14:33 - its length by a factor of two
14:35 - so this is the new vector x two if I
14:38 - were to say V times 0.1 0.1 now my
14:42 - vector V is 10% of its length so this is
14:45 - actually a really simple thing to do and
14:47 - it's really useful what if we calculate
14:50 - a full force later we can calculate a
14:52 - gravitational force but we only want it
14:54 - to be half as strong we multiply it by
14:57 - 0.5 we could even have a slider that
14:59 - maps to a value between 0 and 2 and we
15:01 - can the user can make a force stronger
15:04 - or weaker by using this multiplication
15:07 - function we're scaling it growing and
15:10 - shrinking it so let's take a look at
15:12 - what that means over here we can see
15:16 - once we've once we have got this vector
15:20 - called Mouse we can now say something
15:22 - like Mouse multiply I'm going to
15:24 - multiply it by 5 which is kind of going
15:25 - to be insane because I got to really get
15:27 - the mouse back back back back back and
15:30 - you can see no matter where the mouse is
15:31 - that
15:32 - vectors length is now five times that on
15:34 - that line that's between the center and
15:36 - the mouse eye whether been to have a
15:40 - really hard time like how do they do
15:42 - that like know where they're looking
15:43 - okay so we can also say I can say point
15:47 - one zero point once and now it's going
15:49 - to be ten percent and you can see that
15:51 - as I move the mouse here it's growing
15:53 - we're only at ten percent of the length
15:55 - so scaling a vector using the
15:58 - multifunction is a pretty good thing so
16:00 - I think I want this to be a video it
16:02 - really proud should be in three parts
16:03 - maybe I will actually make it in three
16:04 - parts it's at least in two parts right
16:07 - now in the next video we're going to go
16:09 - over magnitude and normalize which are
16:11 - also two important operations in frost
16:13 - sake with vectors okay I'm gonna um get
16:18 - some like orange juice or something I
16:20 - don't have any more interviews whatever
16:22 - okay goodbye
16:23 - carry on the rest stop it

Cleaned transcript:

okay I will not bump into a lamp at the beginning of this video hello um maybe you just watched the last video maybe you had a chance to look at the P vector class a little bit tried in your code hopefully you don't have too many problems if you did hopefully somebody helped you I hope I helped you in some way in this video we now are going to take a break in subtle actually we're not really we're still going to look at the P vector class but we're going to take a break from this we've got this like laser focus where we're going to build our first simple simple physics engine but we're going to take a break from that just to kind of walk through a few key concepts in I feel the need to write this and it has a vector P no just vector where should I write this over here vector math breathe breathe we're using the word math but it's okay it's comforting soothing relaxing mat joyful math it's gonna be fine I I feel a little bit of anxiety in myself because I don't want to screw this up but we're gonna get through it together okay vector math now here's the thing let's go over here for a second ah come on camera did you really go off my back did this go off oh here we are I don't know what went off something went off I'm sorry okay we're back hi maybe I'll edit that out and yeah that's probably so look over here this is the processing P vector documentation page now this isn't comprehensive lesson on everything you could possibly ever do with vectors in your entire life but one thing we want to look at just to get started here is if we scroll down a little bit we can see here are a list of functions available in the P vector class random set mag mag squared I don't know maybe I want to make this bigger so we can really see it add subtract multiply divide distance dot cross normalize Limited send mag heading rotate lerp there's lots of functions I actually want to just look through four simple ones in this video we're at you know if you are big some strange commitment to kind of go through all this stuff with me we will get to other things we will get to the dot product we will get to other mathematical pieces about vectors but my feeling here is that it's more important to look at them when they're necessary when we're using them in an actual application an actual example rather than just kind of look math functions juggling but I do want to take the time before we get back into the physics stuff to looking at four basic things and let's make a list of those things so those things I don't know I'm going to do that over here we're going to look at ad which kind of comes with the idea of subtraction we're going to look at multiply which kind of comes with it the idea of division and I should also just kind of say but think of this with the word scale multiplying what I really mean there is scaling a vector growing it shrinking it but we'll get to that I want to look at magnitude how do we actually and I guess I'm going to use I'm just going to write that whole word out and I want to look at normalize the magnitude function processing by the way is just Mac okay so I want to look at these four math functions with vectors I want to make a little simple processing sketch that kind of dabbles in them that demonstrates how the syntax works and what they're doing and once we have these tools here we're going to be able to go on the next video and make another thing move around the screen by the way okay I had a couple mishaps but we're back in the same video okay the board looks a little different but you know everything's okay nothing bad happened here okay um we had a little time left I want you know I want what I want to do in this time that we have left because we have an infinite amount of time as long as I can stand here and keep talking but I don't want this to go on for too long I want to walk through these four mathematical operations that are available in the P vector class and we're going to start with ad now ad is actually something we're quite familiar with already because we said location dot add velocity that's something we did in the previous video what did it mean to add the location vector and the velocity vector it means add the velocities x component two locations X component add velocities Y component two locations ycomponent we're comfortable that and that's actually all we need to know but I think it's worth examining visually for a moment what it means to add vectors now let's say we have two vectors V and u here's the vector V here is a the vector I'm going to you know draw sort of two strangelooking vectors now one thing I should point out is this notation V with an arrow on top that is vector notation that's what you would find in a mathematics or physics textbook we're going to use that from time to time just when we're talking about diagrams and notation but for the most part we're not going to see vector notation because we're working in source code so there's nothing but just sort of raw text there no arrows on top or weird squiggly lines or strange spirally Greek letters or whatever but we're going to use that from time to time so what does it mean to add two vectors what it means is so let's say W W equals V Plus u what it means to add two vectors is to put them end to end so we can draw a V like this we can draw u like this and then here this is W which equals V Plus u v Plus u so if we put vectors end to end we're adding and that makes sense if W is instructions for how to get from here to there then we follow the instructions from u how to get from here to there and our new vector from the where we started to where we ended up is adding those two vectors together this actually Maps exactly to what we're doing with location and velocity right let's make a little processing window right here here is our location right that is where our we're drawing our little bouncing ball it's at that location what is the location vector it is a vector that tells us how to get from the origin to that location so it points from zero zero to that location now if we want to add velocity to that location and let's say this is our current velocity then we put those vectors end to end like this and this vector right here is location plus velocity so this is what we're doing and now the ball at this new location so that's exactly what we're doing when we're using vectors in our code to move something around the screen velocity changes location over time it maps to exactly what the sort of the underlying mathematics of adding vectors is and we know from doing this that to add V Plus u means add the components together what I mean by that is W sub X equals V sub X plus u sub X W sub y equals V sub y plus use of Y look at that we just made this all a little bit a little bit of math sub this that and it feels kind of relaxed again fine right this is okay you guys are okay with this deep breath okay now let's move on a little bit if we know add then we kind of instantly know subtract and normally I might stop and not go over anything about subtract however subtracting vectors is so common in all the examples that we're going to do it there's something more to it than just the just saying I'm putting a minus where a plus is now in truth or isn't anymore to it it just is if we want to say W equals V minus u all we need to do is put a minus there and put a minus there but let's look at what that means in terms of a diagram so this is V this is you right but if we want to say V minus U this vector is minus u so and if I just move this little thing here this here is V minus U so we put vectors end to end but instead of the plus you use Direction is inverted negative of a vector is the same vector with the same magnitude but in the opposite direction now we get V minus u now why is that useful let's just say for a moment that we have something here and we have something here let's say this is the center of the screen that's a vector called center and this is a vector called Mouse it's where the mouse is I'm going to draw a little mouse pointer so I got lost to drive a little mouse pointer for a moment okay here we are now what does it mean to say mouse Center let's look at that mouse Center Mouse now this is Center let's put Center like in this is the vet vector over here in the reverse direction look this vector over here is Mouse Center in other words it's this vector I didn't draw it for her well it's kind of a little bit of a disaster I think this is something that I'm going to have to work on how to describe this and explain this but hopefully you're following it somewhat right the reason why I subtract is so useful is if we want to make a vector that points from one location to another location we use subtract right what makes sense like if location plus velocity is the new location the new location minus the previous location would be that velocity and we can use this we're going to use this a lot for example when we want to do gravitational attraction between two bodies we need to know we need to have a vector that points from one body to the other one so we can subtract their locations subtracting two locations gives us a vector that points from one to the other one thing that's misleading about these diagrams which I should point out is that I kind of drew the vector over here so it seems like it's in the wrong place vectors don't have a place vectors just describe a magnitude in the direction we position them around some sort of diagram to try to explain something but there is no like actual location for that vector so what I mean by a vector that describes the difference between these two points we use subtract for that and let's let's move and let's actually make our processing example do this wow this is getting long I guess you're watching long videos today what can I do I don't know what else to do am i over here I'm over here okay so I have a little processing sketch which shows a dot in the center and you can see where the mouse is what I want to make is a vector that points from that dot to the mouse and we can do that rather easily I can say P vector mouse is a new vector where the mouse is mouse X Mouse Y and then I want to say P vector Center is a new vector in the center of the window and now I want to subtract Center from Mouse so this is that operation mouse equals mouse Center what do I get there I get the difference between the mouse location and the center location and if I were to draw a line now a line that starts at zero zero to Mouse X Mouse dot Y let's run this we can see I now have a line that's always pointing out why is that line starting in the center of the window I drew it at zero zero if you notice translate I had this extra a little bit of code earlier if you're not familiar with 2d transformations you should go stop right now go to the Prostate website processing org slash learning slash transform two days you go look through how translate rotate push matrix pop matrix all that stuff works we're going to use that in these examples right this is not like some of this stuff is kind of basic some this stuff requires some previous knowledge but you can see here that now we now have a line that points from the mouse to the center great so that is subtraction and addition we're going to keep going eight minutes plus five minutes thirty now this can be some twenty minute video I got to keep going okay because the other stuff I'm gonna press this button I know this is not I'm kind of I'm a little tired I need to go eat lunch below like Lu Zhi but I don't worry I'm gonna be fine I mean I don't not that you're actually worried anyway um okay let's move on to multiply I think maybe we're going to do magnitude and normalize in a separate video because I feel like we but I want to get to multiply for a second because I think it's going to show something pretty useful on that we could maybe use so let's just get to multiply we're going to take a short break I think it's no break for you just keep watching but I'm going to take a short break okay multiply now what do I mean by multiply we had you and me right our friends you we said you plus V I mean we could say you multiplied V there really isn't a multiplication operation in the way that we might initially think for multiplying two vectors there are some multiplication like activities activities fun activities for you doing a Saturday afternoon the dot product in the cross product so that's cut off but that says dot and that says cross right but what we want to actually look at is this scenario you times n so when we use the mult or multiply which stands for multiply function in processing what we really mean is scale what we're looking to do is scale the vector grow it or shrink it and what we do that is we scale it by a scalar value so when we say a vector we mean a collection of values a twodimensional vector is x and a y three dimensional vectors in XY and z when we say a scalar we mean a singular quantity so if we have this vector V what if we were to say V times two what do you think we do we keep the vectors same exact direction but we grow its length by a factor of two so this is the new vector x two if I were to say V times 0.1 0.1 now my vector V is 10% of its length so this is actually a really simple thing to do and it's really useful what if we calculate a full force later we can calculate a gravitational force but we only want it to be half as strong we multiply it by 0.5 we could even have a slider that maps to a value between 0 and 2 and we can the user can make a force stronger or weaker by using this multiplication function we're scaling it growing and shrinking it so let's take a look at what that means over here we can see once we've once we have got this vector called Mouse we can now say something like Mouse multiply I'm going to multiply it by 5 which is kind of going to be insane because I got to really get the mouse back back back back back and you can see no matter where the mouse is that vectors length is now five times that on that line that's between the center and the mouse eye whether been to have a really hard time like how do they do that like know where they're looking okay so we can also say I can say point one zero point once and now it's going to be ten percent and you can see that as I move the mouse here it's growing we're only at ten percent of the length so scaling a vector using the multifunction is a pretty good thing so I think I want this to be a video it really proud should be in three parts maybe I will actually make it in three parts it's at least in two parts right now in the next video we're going to go over magnitude and normalize which are also two important operations in frost sake with vectors okay I'm gonna um get some like orange juice or something I don't have any more interviews whatever okay goodbye carry on the rest stop it
