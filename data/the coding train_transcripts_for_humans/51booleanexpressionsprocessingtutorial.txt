With timestamps:

00:02 - hi, so it is time for another super, big moment
00:08 - in our life of learning to program the computer
00:11 - and in fact this may very well be
00:14 - the biggest moment of all the moments
00:15 - and i'm sure I'll just say in the next video
00:18 - it's the biggest moment
00:19 - but right now it really is
00:20 - because we're going to start talking
00:22 - about conditional statements
00:23 - and it might not sound like it's the
00:25 - most super, biggest moment ever
00:26 - but it really is!
00:27 - let's understand why this is gonna be
00:30 - such a huge leap forward that we're gonna take
00:32 - maybe, perhaps you don't remember where
00:35 - we last left off. where we last left off
00:37 - we had this nice Processing sketch,
00:38 - we were learning about variables,
00:40 - we declared a variable at the top,
00:41 - we initialized its value to zero,
00:44 - and then we manipulated the value of that variable
00:47 - by incrementing it every time through draw()
00:49 - which looped over and over again
00:51 - and when we run the sketch
00:52 - we have our circle, and it's going ...
00:54 - there it is ...
00:56 - it's going, going, going, it's very, very slowly
00:59 - so this is like awkward now
01:01 - but eventually it's gonna get to the end
01:03 - and it's gonna leave,
01:04 - and it's not gonna come back.
01:05 - and that's sad. that's a sad moment
01:07 - for the circle, for us, the program, 
Processing, everything.
01:10 - but we will now get over this sad moment
01:14 - and we're going to add something new to our
01:16 - bag of tricks, or bag of tools, we're going
01:19 - to be able to say:
01:20 - if the ball, if the circle reaches the end
of that window
01:25 - do something else, change colour,
01:27 - turn around, reset your position back to
01:30 - somewhere else.
01:30 - this is what we're going to do in this video take
01:35 - so we're just gonna get started with this
01:37 - so let's move over here
01:40 - and let's think about what are the nuts and bolts
01:41 - of what we're doing
01:42 - we are writing a new kind of block of code
01:45 - it is called a 'conditional statement'
01:48 - I'll write this down: conditional statement
01:54 - and it is going to look like this
01:56 - IF ( ... this is the squeaky pen ...
02:02 - I don't know where the other one is,
02:04 - can I pause for a second? pause
02:05 - ok, got a new pen
02:08 - IF, open parentheses, close parentheses,
02:13 - open curly bracket, close curly bracket,
02:17 - some code ... I guess all of these pens squeak 
to some extent
02:20 - but ... hopefully it's not bothering you like
it's bothering me
02:24 - ok, enough about the pen!
02:26 - what do we have here?
02:28 - IF parentheses, parentheses, something that's
02:30 - going in the middle here
02:32 - open curly bracket, close curly bracket
02:34 - right, this looks familiar in some ways
02:36 - this is a block of code. just like we had
02:39 - setup() and draw() , setup() has a
02:42 - beginning and an end with the curly brackets
02:44 - draw() has a beginning and an end 
with curly brackets
02:46 - but we are now having a block of code
02:48 - what this block of code means is
02:52 - IF whatever is in here is TRUE
02:57 - THEN execute this code
02:59 - IF NOT then don't execute this code.
03:01 - so this is the moment where we now
03:03 - have the ability to add some logic
03:06 - to our program that let's the program take
03:08 - a path. it could chose to execute some code
03:11 - it could draw some stuff on the screen
03:13 - or it could not draw some stuff on the screen
03:14 - it could change the values of some variables
03:16 - or it could not change the values of some variables
03:18 - so if it is always doing this through draw()
03:21 - every time through draw()
03:22 - sometimes it will execute things one way,
03:23 - sometimes it will execute thing a different way.
03:26 - this allows our program to path different behaviors
03:28 - at different moments in time.
03:28 - so this simple, simple structure
03:31 - is incredibly powerful and important!
03:34 - so what I wanna do in this video is really just talk
03:37 - about, obviously there's gonna be a whole set
03:39 - of videos about conditional statements, we're
03:41 - gonna look at lots of scenarios,
03:42 - but what I wanna focus on in this particular video
03:46 - is really just this question mark.
03:48 - what goes in there?
03:50 - and what goes in there is known as
03:52 - a 'boolean expression'
03:59 - now a boolean expression is an expression
04:04 - that evaluates to only TRUE or FALSE.
04:06 - for example I could say 'my name is Francis' and 
that would be false,
04:11 - or I could say 'I am an extremely nervous person'
04:15 - and that would be true!
04:16 - but the thing about it is, thats a little bit ...
04:20 - I should point out that's 
a little bit subjective, you know.
04:22 - we could, in the english language, we might say
04:24 - things like 'I'm feeling a little melancholy today'
04:28 - and that could be sort of true, mostly true 
but not exactly true because I'm only a little bit
04:33 - I don't know what I'm saying but the point is
04:35 - the types of boolean expressions 
we're going to write
04:39 - for our computer program are going to be
04:41 - distinctly true or false. only one or the other.
04:45 - no gray area whatsoever.
04:48 - now there are many ways that we're going
04:50 - to see that we can create a boolean expression
04:52 - but the simplest way, what's going to be
04:54 - most useful for us right now to start with is
04:55 - using something called a 'relational operator'.
04:59 - so let's make a list
05:01 - of relational operators. 
what are relational operators?
05:07 - here's one: > (greater than)
05:10 - another one is: < (less than)
05:14 - >= (greater than or equal)
05:16 - <= (less than or equal)
05:17 - and I'm gonna list a couple here more
05:19 - at the bottom that are a little bit goofy
05:21 - == (two equal signs)
05:24 - or != (not equals) , exclamation, equal
05:27 - so one of the things about programming
05:29 - is sometimes syntax can be a little bit cryptic
05:32 - right, if I wanna ask if something is not,
05:34 - if I wanna test if a value is not equal 
to another value
05:38 - I need to know that these symbols for that are 
exclamation point, equals.
05:43 - so we'll see examples of this as we go
05:46 - I think for right now let's just focus on
05:49 - these two simple relational operators.
05:52 - this will get us going.
05:53 - so let's write some boolean expressions
05:55 - here is a boolean expression for you:
06:00 - 6 > 5 (six is greater than 5)
06:03 - this is an expression that evaluates to 
'true' or 'false'
06:07 - is this a true statement or 
is is a false statement?
06:10 - that is definitely, most definitively true
06:15 - here is another one:
06:17 - 717 < -10 , is that true or is that false?
06:23 - that's quite obviously false, right?
06:26 - there is no way for this expression to be
06:27 - something other than true or false,
06:31 - even if I say 7 is greater than 7
06:34 - is that true or false?
06:35 - that is false!
06:37 - so we can see: these are the types
06:39 - of boolean expressions that we can write
06:42 - with these relational operators.
06:45 - is one value greater than another value?
06:47 - is one value less than another value?
06:49 - etc
06:51 - so, these boolean expressions,
06:54 - these relational operators,
06:55 - that must mean they go in between
06:57 - the parentheses right here because this
06:58 - is where you put your boolean expressions.
07:00 - if 6 is greater than 5 then execute that code
07:05 - if this expression evaluates to 'true' 
then execute this code
07:09 - if this expression evaluates to 'false'
then skip and keep going,
07:13 - don't evaluate that code!
07:14 - so now let's look at this and think to ourselves:
07:17 - does it make any sense at all in any universe
07:21 - to write that code?
07:23 - think about that for a second.
07:25 - I argue, I'm gonna make the argument
07:28 - right now that this, while it's syntactically correct,
07:30 - it has no logical value, right? because 6 > 5 can
07:35 - never ever be anything but true, so there is no
07:38 - point in having this conditional statement
07:39 - cause we're always gonna execute that code
07:40 - so point of writing these boolean expressions
07:44 - is not to use hardcoded numbers but to use
07:46 - variables, variables which have variable values
07:50 - sometimes the value of that value might be
07:52 - greater than 5, sometimes it might not be
07:54 - greater than 5. for example, what if I were to say
07:57 - 'if mouseX < 5' ? so if the value of the mouseX,
08:04 - if the value of the mouse's x-position is greater
08:07 - than 5 then execute that code.
08:09 - so only when I have my mouse over here
08:10 - execute that code, if I don't have my mouse
08:12 - over there then execute some other code.
08:13 - think about it like if you need to program a rollover
08:16 - from scratch, right? you have this rectangle
08:19 - on the screen and whenever the mouse is over
08:21 - that rectangle you want it to light up and change
08:22 - color, that's how you're gonna do it.
08:24 - if the mouseX is greater than here,
08:26 - and if it's less than here
08:27 - and mouseY is greater than here,
08:28 - and if it's less than here,
08:29 - if it's within all these bounds
08:30 - then draw a different color
08:31 - this is where we're going with this type of stuff
08:34 - ok, so, I think this kinda gives us the pieces,
08:38 - the beginning pieces, of what the form of a
08:41 - conditional statement looks like,
08:42 - what a boolean expression is, what's a
08:44 - basic boolean expressions are using
relational operators
08:47 - let's just look at one, tiny little example
08:49 - in code and then we'll move onto the next video.
08:53 - so let's put aside our bouncing ball, the program
09:03 - we're hoping to eventually turn into a
09:04 - bouncing ball sketch, for a moment and
09:06 - let's do something quite simple:
09:08 - so here we have a Processing sketch that does nothing
09:10 - but draw a gray background.
09:11 - size(), and background() in draw()
09:13 - let's add some new code in here!
09:15 - let's add this conditional statement:
09:17 - if mouseX is greater than, pick a value, 200,
09:27 - then I'm gonna say: background, pick a color,
09:34 - any color, green, uh, red, a bit yellowish, whatever
09:39 - here's another color
09:41 - we're gonna run this sketch
09:42 - look, gray background, look there's a line of code
09:45 - in there background some other color,
09:47 - but we're not seeing that!
09:48 - it is not happening.
09:49 - why? because mouseX is currently not greater
09:51 - than 200. what is the value of mouseX?
09:53 - I don't know, maybe it's about 20, 30, ...
09:56 - it's an exciting moment, it's about to happen
09:58 - 50,100, 150, .. ah! there it is! it's orange.
10:01 - that's a nice color, I like orange.
10:02 - so you can see: wooh, it's not, wooh
10:04 - so we can see pixel 200 is right about there
10:07 - and we could be a little bit better about this
10:09 - we could do something like, say,
10:11 - stroke(255); draw a line at pixel 200, 0, ...
10:18 - so that I could at least see that hey, whenever
10:21 - the mouse is on this side it's grey, whenever
10:23 - the mouse is on this side it's orange.
10:24 - so, you know, this is like quite possibly
10:27 - the most simple, a very, very, very simple
10:30 - beginning of conditionals but I would venture to say
10:36 - for a moment that one of the amazing things 
about programming
10:39 - is all you really need is data, variables
10:43 - and conditionals to make different choices
10:45 - we're gonna look at lots of stuff
10:47 - loops, and functions, and objects and all
10:49 - sorts of other fundamentals of computation
10:51 - but I would suggest that even with just the ...
10:54 - I've just shown you so far, 
that you can have variables
10:58 - and you can have conditional statement,
10:59 - there's nothing you could not program right now.
11:01 - nothing! everything else is just gonna be
11:02 - about helping making your code shorter,
11:03 - more organized, more efficient, obviously you
11:04 - really wanna have a loop, otherwise you will have
11:07 - to have thousands of lines of code, but
11:09 - really this is sort of an important moment
11:11 - to realize that you now have all the tools
11:14 - to make anything you can imagine!
11:15 - so you should really start giving this a try!
11:17 - so if you're looking for a little exercise
11:19 - to try before you get to the next video,
11:22 - what I would suggest now is think about
11:24 - this program: could you write a conditional
11:27 - statement that executes this task:
11:30 - if the circle reaches the right-hand edge of the
11:34 - window, reset its location back to the left-hand edge.
11:38 - now I stated that in a very english language kind
11:42 - of way, I could state it more like code, more like
11:45 - pseudo-code, more like code, and eventually
11:46 - write the code for it. but think about that,
11:48 - where would you put that conditional statement?
11:51 - can you get that to work?
11:52 - a very simple exercise, and we'll move on
11:54 - in the next video and do more with this stuff.
11:56 - ok, ... I wanted to say something profound
12:00 - at the end but there is nothing profound other than
12:03 - I am staring into the abyss of an empty camera
12:06 - and I bid you adieu!

Cleaned transcript:

hi, so it is time for another super, big moment in our life of learning to program the computer and in fact this may very well be the biggest moment of all the moments and i'm sure I'll just say in the next video it's the biggest moment but right now it really is because we're going to start talking about conditional statements and it might not sound like it's the most super, biggest moment ever but it really is! let's understand why this is gonna be such a huge leap forward that we're gonna take maybe, perhaps you don't remember where we last left off. where we last left off we had this nice Processing sketch, we were learning about variables, we declared a variable at the top, we initialized its value to zero, and then we manipulated the value of that variable by incrementing it every time through draw() which looped over and over again and when we run the sketch we have our circle, and it's going ... there it is ... it's going, going, going, it's very, very slowly so this is like awkward now but eventually it's gonna get to the end and it's gonna leave, and it's not gonna come back. and that's sad. that's a sad moment for the circle, for us, the program, Processing, everything. but we will now get over this sad moment and we're going to add something new to our bag of tricks, or bag of tools, we're going to be able to say if the ball, if the circle reaches the end of that window do something else, change colour, turn around, reset your position back to somewhere else. this is what we're going to do in this video take so we're just gonna get started with this so let's move over here and let's think about what are the nuts and bolts of what we're doing we are writing a new kind of block of code it is called a 'conditional statement' I'll write this down conditional statement and it is going to look like this IF ( ... this is the squeaky pen ... I don't know where the other one is, can I pause for a second? pause ok, got a new pen IF, open parentheses, close parentheses, open curly bracket, close curly bracket, some code ... I guess all of these pens squeak to some extent but ... hopefully it's not bothering you like it's bothering me ok, enough about the pen! what do we have here? IF parentheses, parentheses, something that's going in the middle here open curly bracket, close curly bracket right, this looks familiar in some ways this is a block of code. just like we had setup() and draw() , setup() has a beginning and an end with the curly brackets draw() has a beginning and an end with curly brackets but we are now having a block of code what this block of code means is IF whatever is in here is TRUE THEN execute this code IF NOT then don't execute this code. so this is the moment where we now have the ability to add some logic to our program that let's the program take a path. it could chose to execute some code it could draw some stuff on the screen or it could not draw some stuff on the screen it could change the values of some variables or it could not change the values of some variables so if it is always doing this through draw() every time through draw() sometimes it will execute things one way, sometimes it will execute thing a different way. this allows our program to path different behaviors at different moments in time. so this simple, simple structure is incredibly powerful and important! so what I wanna do in this video is really just talk about, obviously there's gonna be a whole set of videos about conditional statements, we're gonna look at lots of scenarios, but what I wanna focus on in this particular video is really just this question mark. what goes in there? and what goes in there is known as a 'boolean expression' now a boolean expression is an expression that evaluates to only TRUE or FALSE. for example I could say 'my name is Francis' and that would be false, or I could say 'I am an extremely nervous person' and that would be true! but the thing about it is, thats a little bit ... I should point out that's a little bit subjective, you know. we could, in the english language, we might say things like 'I'm feeling a little melancholy today' and that could be sort of true, mostly true but not exactly true because I'm only a little bit I don't know what I'm saying but the point is the types of boolean expressions we're going to write for our computer program are going to be distinctly true or false. only one or the other. no gray area whatsoever. now there are many ways that we're going to see that we can create a boolean expression but the simplest way, what's going to be most useful for us right now to start with is using something called a 'relational operator'. so let's make a list of relational operators. what are relational operators? here's one > (greater than) another one is < (less than) >= (greater than or equal) <= (less than or equal) and I'm gonna list a couple here more at the bottom that are a little bit goofy == (two equal signs) or != (not equals) , exclamation, equal so one of the things about programming is sometimes syntax can be a little bit cryptic right, if I wanna ask if something is not, if I wanna test if a value is not equal to another value I need to know that these symbols for that are exclamation point, equals. so we'll see examples of this as we go I think for right now let's just focus on these two simple relational operators. this will get us going. so let's write some boolean expressions here is a boolean expression for you 6 > 5 (six is greater than 5) this is an expression that evaluates to 'true' or 'false' is this a true statement or is is a false statement? that is definitely, most definitively true here is another one 717 < 10 , is that true or is that false? that's quite obviously false, right? there is no way for this expression to be something other than true or false, even if I say 7 is greater than 7 is that true or false? that is false! so we can see these are the types of boolean expressions that we can write with these relational operators. is one value greater than another value? is one value less than another value? etc so, these boolean expressions, these relational operators, that must mean they go in between the parentheses right here because this is where you put your boolean expressions. if 6 is greater than 5 then execute that code if this expression evaluates to 'true' then execute this code if this expression evaluates to 'false' then skip and keep going, don't evaluate that code! so now let's look at this and think to ourselves does it make any sense at all in any universe to write that code? think about that for a second. I argue, I'm gonna make the argument right now that this, while it's syntactically correct, it has no logical value, right? because 6 > 5 can never ever be anything but true, so there is no point in having this conditional statement cause we're always gonna execute that code so point of writing these boolean expressions is not to use hardcoded numbers but to use variables, variables which have variable values sometimes the value of that value might be greater than 5, sometimes it might not be greater than 5. for example, what if I were to say 'if mouseX < 5' ? so if the value of the mouseX, if the value of the mouse's xposition is greater than 5 then execute that code. so only when I have my mouse over here execute that code, if I don't have my mouse over there then execute some other code. think about it like if you need to program a rollover from scratch, right? you have this rectangle on the screen and whenever the mouse is over that rectangle you want it to light up and change color, that's how you're gonna do it. if the mouseX is greater than here, and if it's less than here and mouseY is greater than here, and if it's less than here, if it's within all these bounds then draw a different color this is where we're going with this type of stuff ok, so, I think this kinda gives us the pieces, the beginning pieces, of what the form of a conditional statement looks like, what a boolean expression is, what's a basic boolean expressions are using relational operators let's just look at one, tiny little example in code and then we'll move onto the next video. so let's put aside our bouncing ball, the program we're hoping to eventually turn into a bouncing ball sketch, for a moment and let's do something quite simple so here we have a Processing sketch that does nothing but draw a gray background. size(), and background() in draw() let's add some new code in here! let's add this conditional statement if mouseX is greater than, pick a value, 200, then I'm gonna say background, pick a color, any color, green, uh, red, a bit yellowish, whatever here's another color we're gonna run this sketch look, gray background, look there's a line of code in there background some other color, but we're not seeing that! it is not happening. why? because mouseX is currently not greater than 200. what is the value of mouseX? I don't know, maybe it's about 20, 30, ... it's an exciting moment, it's about to happen 50,100, 150, .. ah! there it is! it's orange. that's a nice color, I like orange. so you can see wooh, it's not, wooh so we can see pixel 200 is right about there and we could be a little bit better about this we could do something like, say, stroke(255); draw a line at pixel 200, 0, ... so that I could at least see that hey, whenever the mouse is on this side it's grey, whenever the mouse is on this side it's orange. so, you know, this is like quite possibly the most simple, a very, very, very simple beginning of conditionals but I would venture to say for a moment that one of the amazing things about programming is all you really need is data, variables and conditionals to make different choices we're gonna look at lots of stuff loops, and functions, and objects and all sorts of other fundamentals of computation but I would suggest that even with just the ...
