00:00 - [BELL RINGING]
00:01 - Hello again.
00:02 - It's me from the
future inserting myself
00:04 - into your play list of videos.
00:06 - I am making a video to go right
here in between 7.7 and 7.8.
00:11 - I don't know how
you ended up here,
00:12 - but that's the intended point
of watching between these two
00:16 - in this tutorial series.
00:17 - So what I'm going to show
you-- but you could also just
00:20 - be here because you want to know
how to add images to the P5 Web
00:23 - Editor.
00:24 - So this is in a series about
object-oriented programming
00:27 - in 7.8.
00:29 - This next video, I look at how
to use an image and an object
00:33 - and then have multiple objects
each showing a different image.
00:35 - All sorts of fun.
00:37 - But in both of these videos,
I'm using the Atom text editor
00:40 - And just opening up my
JavaScript P5 sketch
00:44 - in the Chrome browser directly.
00:46 - And now, I want to show you
how to do this-- oh and here--
00:50 - in the P5 Web Editor.
00:51 - So I'm going to
create a new sketch.
00:53 - Well, let me just save this
and create a new sketch.
00:57 - I'm going to hit OK because
that's something else going on.
00:59 - And, OK, so what I want to
do is just look at let's say,
01:04 - I've made this beautiful sketch.
01:06 - It is this beautiful rectangle.
01:08 - It is this lovely shade of gray.
01:10 - But what I really want is
a kitten to appear there.
01:13 - Oh, I just so happen to
have this nice directory
01:16 - of little tiny kitten images.
01:18 - I like this one.
01:20 - And what I want to do
is load this kitten
01:23 - JPEG into my sketch.
01:24 - So code-wise, there
are two functions
01:27 - that I need to know about.
01:28 - One is a function
called load image,
01:29 - and another is a
function called image.
01:31 - So I might as well
talk about those two
01:33 - while I'm here, although I think
I probably talk about those
01:34 - in the next video as well.
01:36 - But more importantly,
the purpose of this video
01:38 - is how do I actually
get this image--
01:41 - this image-- into this sketch.
01:43 - So once again, this
is a time for me
01:45 - to go over here and reveal,
pull back the curtain
01:48 - of the P5 Web Editor.
01:50 - I've done this before when I
made a second JavaScript file.
01:53 - We can see that there's also an
html file and a style.css file.
01:57 - What goes on in these
files are things
01:58 - that I get into in a future
playlist about the P5 Dom
02:02 - library.
02:02 - So I want to look
for that little arrow
02:04 - again and click Add
File, just like what
02:06 - I did before when I
added a new JavaScript
02:08 - file, like bubble.js.
02:10 - but now instead of
typing in a new file,
02:13 - I actually am just going
to drag a file over here
02:15 - into this region.
02:16 - I could also click
here, and it's
02:17 - going to open up a kind
of like finder thing.
02:19 - But I'm just going
to come over here.
02:20 - I'm going to grab my kitten--
02:21 - this lovely little kitten.
02:22 - I'm going to drag it over here.
02:24 - And then it's going to upload.
02:26 - It is done, and we can
see kitten2.jpg is now
02:30 - part of this project.
02:31 - You should realize
though there is a limit.
02:32 - I can't remember if it's 5
megabytes or 10 megabytes.
02:35 - You can't upload really
big files to the Web Editor
02:38 - at present.
02:39 - Maybe in the future,
we'll figure out
02:40 - ways of managing the
data so that you can.
02:43 - So now, just to
finish this off, I
02:47 - said I want to have a
variable called image.
02:50 - And that's the
image where I want
02:51 - to-- that's the variable where
I want to load the file into.
02:55 - And then, once I
have that, I want
02:58 - to draw that image
to the canvas.
03:00 - Of course, it's giving
me an error now--
03:02 - cannot read property
width of undefined--
03:06 - cannot read property width of
undefined because the image is
03:10 - not there.
03:11 - So I need to actually
load the image.
03:13 - And you might think, OK, well,
there's a load image function.
03:17 - So why not just use load
image and in quotes reference
03:20 - the name of that JPEG?
03:21 - Well, this doesn't work because
I cannot call P5 functions
03:26 - outside of setup or draw.
03:28 - It doesn't actually know
what a P5 function is.
03:31 - So what I could do is
then say, all right,
03:33 - well, image needs to
be a global variable.
03:38 - I'm over explaining
this, but I think
03:39 - it's worth noting all this.
03:41 - So let me put load
image in setup.
03:44 - And ther, it worked.
03:45 - There's the image of the kitten.
03:47 - Why did this work though?
03:48 - Weird.
03:48 - Let me draw on this again.
03:50 - Did you see how the
kitten wasn't there at
03:52 - first for like a little bit?
03:55 - What if I say here no loop?
04:00 - The kitten doesn't appear.
04:02 - The kitten's being
loaded in setup
04:04 - and then being drawn in draw.
04:05 - So one of the things you
have to start getting used to
04:09 - is the asynchronous
nature of JavaScript.
04:11 - And this will come more and
more as you go into the videos
04:15 - about working with data
and the DOM library.
04:18 - But when we asked
to load an image,
04:20 - it's not going to be
immediately ready.
04:22 - It takes some time for it
to go and grab those pixels
04:24 - and load them into memory.
04:26 - And there's ways
of using something
04:27 - called a callback, which I
will get to in a future video.
04:30 - But the best way for
you to do this right now
04:33 - is to use a function
called preload.
04:36 - And preload is a
special function.
04:37 - It's kind of like
the prequel to setup.
04:40 - Setup is where
everything begins.
04:42 - But before setup,
we have preload.
04:44 - And what preload does
is it is a place where
04:47 - you can load any
media or data assets
04:49 - and make sure they are already
before setup and draw happen.
04:53 - So, in this case,
even with no loop,
04:55 - that kitten's always
going to be there.
04:57 - And just incidentally
while we're here,
04:59 - we should note that
the image function
05:02 - drawing this particular
image, which maybe I
05:03 - should be more clear
about my variable naming
05:06 - and name it kitten,
this is exactly
05:10 - like the rectangle function.
05:12 - I am drawing a
rectangle at 0, 0.
05:15 - The only difference is
I'm filling that rectangle
05:17 - with the pixels from that image.
05:18 - But I can do things like
give it a width and height.
05:21 - And you can see I have
stretched the kitten.
05:23 - These could be variables.
05:27 - And you can see now
it's going to resize.
05:29 - It's just a rectangle.
05:31 - I could do things like say x
and have a variable called x.
05:39 - And I could say x plus plus.
05:42 - And now the kitten
is slowly moving.
05:45 - I could change the y-value.
05:46 - So it's just another thing
to draw that you can rotate
05:49 - and twist and color
and turn and all that.
05:52 - And in the next video,
if you are here,
05:54 - if you happen to
be watching this
05:56 - as part of this playlist, what
I'm actually going to show you
05:58 - in the next video--
05:59 - you can sort of see
it in the thumbnail--
06:01 - is to make a whole bunch
of objects that are images
06:04 - and animate them
around the window.
06:06 - So I hope to help this
clarify a little bit
06:08 - about using the P5
Web Editor with all
06:10 - these other surrounding videos.
06:13 - And if I didn't get it right
here or you're confused,
06:15 - please let me know
in the comments.
06:17 - And I look forward to seeing
you in a future video.
