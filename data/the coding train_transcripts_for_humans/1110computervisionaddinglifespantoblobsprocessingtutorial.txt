00:00 - hello and welcome to another computer
00:05 - vision video this is a follow-up video
00:07 - on my previous one where I'm going to
00:09 - talk about something called I don't know
00:12 - it's called
00:12 - I'm gonna fix a problem with this
00:14 - particular video look what happens if I
00:15 - like shake this blob around a lot
00:17 - notice how the ID numbers going up and
00:19 - up and up and up and up because even
00:21 - though it's the same blob it's the
00:22 - computer vision algorithm and it doesn't
00:24 - detect it for a brief moment so it
00:26 - deletes it and then it comes back and it
00:27 - gives it a new ID but I want to build
00:29 - something into the algorithm so that
00:31 - even if the blob leaves for a very short
00:33 - period of time
00:34 - it doesn't actually get a new ID unless
00:36 - it's really gone for a significant
00:38 - period of time and that's the difficulty
00:39 - of time could just be like a few
00:41 - milliseconds but I'll getting used to us
00:43 - a minute I'm not a minute
00:44 - a second or five seconds or 10 seconds
00:46 - so the first thing that I need to do is
00:48 - I just need to add to the blob I'm gonna
00:51 - add this idea do you have an idea idea
00:53 - of a timer I'm gonna set the timer equal
00:56 - to 100 and then what I want to do is the
01:00 - other thing I want to do just for
01:01 - debugging purposes is I want to take a
01:04 - look I want to be able to see the timer
01:05 - and I'm gonna put it above the blob I
01:08 - mean why minus 10 and I'm gonna just
01:10 - make it half the size Oh what I'm going
01:13 - to do and let's just see if this works
01:15 - now we should see that every blob now
01:20 - has a timer associated with it
01:21 - now nothing's happening with that timer
01:23 - but maybe what I'll do is write a
01:26 - function in the blob I don't know what
01:29 - to call it uh fade-out huh I don't fade
01:33 - well I'll just call it update update
01:36 - sort of weird that's not the right
01:37 - whatever somebody somebody will come up
01:39 - with a good a good name for that
01:41 - function and suggest it I'll think of it
01:43 - later in the chat maybe somebody will
01:45 - notice and tell me okay so what I'm
01:46 - gonna do just for the sake of argument
01:47 - right now I'm gonna call update always
01:51 - and you'll see what's going on
01:54 - so now when a blob comes up you could
01:58 - see that the timer is going down and
02:01 - every time I get a new blob the timer
02:04 - starts back at 100 so here's the thing I
02:07 - don't want to actually delete the blob
02:10 - unless it's
02:11 - Oh 2-0 and I don't actually want its
02:13 - timer to always go down I only want its
02:15 - timer to go down if it can't find
02:17 - something to match to so this actually
02:21 - should just be here right in this last
02:24 - scenario right the last scenario is if
02:29 - option through yet I could delete this
02:31 - right if there are more blobs than the
02:34 - computer vision algorithm is currently
02:36 - detecting then whatever whatever blobs
02:39 - did not get matched get deleted in this
02:41 - case don't actually delete them just
02:44 - update the timer so I'm gonna call
02:50 - update and then I'm gonna say if I do
02:55 - you know I'm gonna do I'm just gonna
02:56 - write a function called check check
02:59 - timer that's what I'll call it and then
03:04 - because I'm also gonna have a return
03:06 - true or false and then only if it
03:08 - returns true then actually remove it so
03:14 - in this case and there's gonna be some
03:16 - issues with this so I'm gonna call this
03:19 - boolean check timer and then timer - -
03:24 - if timer is less than 0 then return true
03:29 - otherwise return false and I know I know
03:32 - I could just say return timers less than
03:35 - zero because it evaluates to true or
03:37 - false but I'd like to be just sort of
03:39 - long-winded about this just so people
03:40 - can really see what's going on yeah
03:44 - timer isn't really something that Chad
03:45 - is saying that timer isn't really
03:47 - related to time and that's actually true
03:49 - so actually why don't I call it like
03:50 - lifespan and that way
03:57 - check life that way I'm just sort of if
04:01 - I could have said counter but I don't
04:02 - know why I didn't so and I'm gonna just
04:04 - do this okay so so check life always up
04:07 - so no so let's take a look at this
04:09 - unless eoqs and now I just need to
04:11 - update this with lifespan as well so
04:14 - let's see now what happens here let's
04:18 - see what this gets us so look you can
04:20 - see that that blob exists and it's got a
04:22 - lifespan currently of
04:23 - now if I take it away it's timers going
04:26 - down hope it went to one but if I come
04:29 - back but look at that its lifespan is
04:31 - now at forty five so up up it's two so
04:35 - one of the thing is when it gets matched
04:37 - I need its lifespan needs to go back to
04:40 - one hundred so wait how do I know when
04:44 - it gets matched here is when it gets
04:47 - matched so if and this should really go
04:49 - into a function probably but I'm gonna
04:51 - just gonna be a little hacky about this
04:53 - right now I'm just gonna say lifespan
04:54 - equals 100 so that'll reset its lifespan
04:57 - back to 100 another thing I'm gonna do
04:58 - is I'm actually just gonna make the
05:00 - lifespan to 55 because I think what
05:03 - would be nice is to look at this to
05:06 - debug this actually when I'm drawing it
05:08 - where do I draw the blob I can't even
05:10 - find it anymore I'm gonna actually use
05:12 - its lifespan as its alpha actually going
05:15 - to leave it at 200 and then maybe I
05:17 - won't bother to draw the I won't bother
05:21 - to draw the lifespan right now so let's
05:23 - take a look at this and let's see how
05:26 - this works so I now have two blobs 0 & 1
05:31 - they're gonna leave the screen and I'm
05:34 - gonna come back and there's still 0 in
05:35 - one they're gonna leave and they're
05:37 - gonna come back and there's still 0 1 I
05:39 - could do this and it's probably not
05:42 - being detected but they're still there
05:44 - they're still 0 & 1 now what if I really
05:46 - what if they really leave I don't think
05:50 - the lifespan got reset properly right
05:53 - let's come back right it still looks
05:57 - like it's alpha II ah so there's a bug
05:59 - there the idea is right but I have a
06:01 - still have a bug in the code my lifespan
06:03 - didn't get set correctly what did I what
06:05 - what happened mmm matched lifespan hmm
06:13 - Oh 100 that's why because I'm starting
06:15 - to the 200 okay so that should be a
06:18 - variable and I should have that as a
06:19 - function so I don't make that mistake
06:24 - okay so so let me try this again
06:31 - 0 & 1 leave they're fading out whoops
06:35 - does they come back I love this
06:37 - so this is nice these are my blobs 0 & 1
06:39 - where's my other cup wait I had a third
06:41 - no it's on the floor let's see does it
06:43 - do 0 & 1 still exist I was fast enough
06:46 - so you can see how I've got 2 3 there we
06:50 - go
06:50 - 0 1 2 & 3 I don't know why that one
06:53 - disappeared for a while so you can see
06:55 - how the the IDs are actually
06:56 - interestingly enough they even they even
06:59 - keep themselves as they kind of overlap
07:01 - a little bit so I don't know you get the
07:02 - idea so this I think is a pretty robust
07:05 - solution for ID numbers here's the thing
07:07 - by the way all of this effort in will
07:09 - hurt guess what if I just had a red cup
07:12 - and a blue Cup I could use the color to
07:14 - keep track of which one is which but you
07:16 - know you might have the case where
07:17 - you're using like multi-touch with
07:19 - figures and you're using infrared light
07:20 - you're just seeing these bright white
07:22 - blobby things and you want to which
07:23 - finger it's which and again my system
07:26 - the other thing I should mention here is
07:27 - my system for determining which is which
07:29 - is just based on distance so in other
07:31 - words like this is 7 & 8 right now but
07:34 - let me cross them over that I don't
07:37 - think that worked right yeah oh no it
07:40 - kind of somehow did but you could see
07:42 - like I might a better you know I hit add
07:44 - more sophisticated things like I could
07:46 - use the blob size to kind of try to help
07:49 - match like oh well Bob should have a
07:50 - similar size to what it had previously
07:51 - or I could actually try to predict where
07:53 - it's going to be next because I could
07:54 - keep track of that blobs velocity over
07:56 - time so if anyone makes these
07:58 - improvements or adds to these examples
07:59 - of sort of refinements of this code
08:01 - please let me know and otherwise this is
08:04 - now lobbed I think this ends my blob
08:07 - detection with persistence video oh
08:09 - maybe we need a good thumbnail for this
08:11 - I don't need to be doing this during the
08:16 - video wait Bob 15 go away there we go I
08:21 - should mention by the way that a
08:23 - variable that really makes a big
08:25 - difference here and I'm gonna actually
08:28 - add this I'm gonna say max life I had it
08:32 - at 200 right so let me look for 200 I'm
08:36 - gonna say max life and then also here
08:40 - max life you know playing with this
08:45 - variable is going to make a really big
08:46 - difference because maybe you actually do
08:49 - want it to be a new blog
08:51 - if it leaves the screen like and comes
08:54 - back rather quickly but you don't want
08:56 - really really quick losses to result in
08:58 - a new blob so how you how long you let a
09:01 - blob survive is really kind of a crucial
09:04 - variable in this kind of system okay and
09:07 - so thanks for watching this computer
09:09 - vision tutorial and there will be more
09:10 - in the future there you might have been
09:12 - watching this like at some point where
09:13 - there already are a lot more goodbye

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome to another computer vision video this is a followup video on my previous one where I'm going to talk about something called I don't know it's called I'm gonna fix a problem with this particular video look what happens if I like shake this blob around a lot notice how the ID numbers going up and up and up and up and up because even though it's the same blob it's the computer vision algorithm and it doesn't detect it for a brief moment so it deletes it and then it comes back and it gives it a new ID but I want to build something into the algorithm so that even if the blob leaves for a very short period of time it doesn't actually get a new ID unless it's really gone for a significant period of time and that's the difficulty of time could just be like a few milliseconds but I'll getting used to us a minute I'm not a minute a second or five seconds or 10 seconds so the first thing that I need to do is I just need to add to the blob I'm gonna add this idea do you have an idea idea of a timer I'm gonna set the timer equal to 100 and then what I want to do is the other thing I want to do just for debugging purposes is I want to take a look I want to be able to see the timer and I'm gonna put it above the blob I mean why minus 10 and I'm gonna just make it half the size Oh what I'm going to do and let's just see if this works now we should see that every blob now has a timer associated with it now nothing's happening with that timer but maybe what I'll do is write a function in the blob I don't know what to call it uh fadeout huh I don't fade well I'll just call it update update sort of weird that's not the right whatever somebody somebody will come up with a good a good name for that function and suggest it I'll think of it later in the chat maybe somebody will notice and tell me okay so what I'm gonna do just for the sake of argument right now I'm gonna call update always and you'll see what's going on so now when a blob comes up you could see that the timer is going down and every time I get a new blob the timer starts back at 100 so here's the thing I don't want to actually delete the blob unless it's Oh 20 and I don't actually want its timer to always go down I only want its timer to go down if it can't find something to match to so this actually should just be here right in this last scenario right the last scenario is if option through yet I could delete this right if there are more blobs than the computer vision algorithm is currently detecting then whatever whatever blobs did not get matched get deleted in this case don't actually delete them just update the timer so I'm gonna call update and then I'm gonna say if I do you know I'm gonna do I'm just gonna write a function called check check timer that's what I'll call it and then because I'm also gonna have a return true or false and then only if it returns true then actually remove it so in this case and there's gonna be some issues with this so I'm gonna call this boolean check timer and then timer if timer is less than 0 then return true otherwise return false and I know I know I could just say return timers less than zero because it evaluates to true or false but I'd like to be just sort of longwinded about this just so people can really see what's going on yeah timer isn't really something that Chad is saying that timer isn't really related to time and that's actually true so actually why don't I call it like lifespan and that way check life that way I'm just sort of if I could have said counter but I don't know why I didn't so and I'm gonna just do this okay so so check life always up so no so let's take a look at this unless eoqs and now I just need to update this with lifespan as well so let's see now what happens here let's see what this gets us so look you can see that that blob exists and it's got a lifespan currently of now if I take it away it's timers going down hope it went to one but if I come back but look at that its

they're gonna leave and they're gonna come back and there's still 0 1 I could do this and it's probably not being detected but they're still there they're still 0 & 1 now what if I really what if they really leave I don't think the lifespan got reset properly right let's come back right it still looks like it's alpha II ah so there's a bug there the idea is right but I have a still have a bug in the code my lifespan didn't get set correctly what did I what what happened mmm matched lifespan hmm Oh 100 that's why because I'm starting to the 200 okay so that should be a variable and I should have that as a function so I don't make that mistake okay so so let me try this again 0 & 1 leave they're fading out whoops does they come back I love this so this is nice these are my blobs 0 & 1 where's my other cup wait I had a third no it's on the floor let's see does it do 0 & 1 still exist I was fast enough so you can see how I've got 2 3 there we go 0 1 2 & 3 I don't know why that one

lobbed I think this ends my blob detection with persistence video oh maybe we need a good thumbnail for this I don't need to be doing this during the video wait Bob 15 go away there we go I should mention by the way that a variable that really makes a big difference here and I'm gonna actually add this I'm gonna say max life I had it at 200 right so let me look for 200 I'm gonna say max life and then also here max life you know playing with this variable is going to make a really big difference because maybe you actually do want it to be a new blog if it leaves the screen like and comes back rather quickly but you don't want really really quick losses to result in a new blob so how you how long you let a blob survive is really kind of a crucial variable in this kind of system okay and so thanks for watching this computer vision tutorial and there will be more in the future there you might have been watching this like at some point where there already are a lot more goodbye
