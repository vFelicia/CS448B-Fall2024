00:00 - [BELL RINGS]
00:01 - Welcome to another,
now with haircut,
00:04 - video in Chapter
2, Nature of Code.
00:07 - What I have done so far, using
the classical laws of motion,
00:11 - classical mechanics, force
equals mass times acceleration,
00:14 - I have implemented a system
where mover objects can
00:17 - receive forces as vectors and
have those forces control how
00:22 - they move about a
canvas in p5.js.
00:24 - But the way that I have
created these force vectors
00:28 - is just by picking
numbers out of a hat,
00:30 - and I want to do something more.
00:33 - The formula that I
want to start with
00:35 - is the formula for friction.
00:37 - Now, there are many different
kinds of friction and examples
00:40 - of friction.
00:41 - And there's static
friction, which
00:43 - is friction that holds
something in place
00:45 - and not moving versus
kinetic friction, which
00:48 - is the friction that occurs
when two surfaces are in moving
00:52 - in contact with each other.
00:53 - Here's the diagram that I
have to describe the friction
00:57 - force in the Nature
of Code book itself.
00:59 - I'm going to take a minute to
rewrite that formula over here.
01:02 - [MUSIC PLAYING]
01:05 - The approach I like to take
when finding a formula like this
01:09 - and then trying to figure
out how to apply it in code
01:12 - is to unpack each of the
elements of the formula one
01:15 - at a time and figure out whether
it actually applies or is,
01:18 - in fact, something
that we can ignore
01:20 - to simplify in the case of
our sort of 2D p5 canvas.
01:24 - So one, let's-- I'm going to go
in sort of in arbitrary order
01:28 - here, but something really to
note here is, what is this?
01:31 - This is the velocity
unit vector.
01:34 - Why are we doing this?
01:37 - Let's consider I
have this circle
01:40 - at the bottom of the canvas.
01:41 - It's moving in this direction,
that's its current velocity,
01:45 - and I want to describe what
is the direction of friction.
01:50 - Well, the direction
of friction is--
01:52 - and this negative 1
is really important.
01:54 - These two go together.
01:56 - The direction of
friction is a vector
01:59 - in the opposite
direction of velocity.
02:01 - Circling back for a second,
what am I doing again?
02:04 - I'm calculating a
force, a vector,
02:06 - and I need to figure out
two things, direction
02:10 - and magnitude.
02:12 - The direction here is expressed
as the unit vector pointing
02:15 - in the velocity's
direction times negative 1.
02:17 - So I know that the friction
points in this direction.
02:21 - That's the friction force.
02:22 - What is the magnitude?
02:24 - Well, I have two other
variables in this formula.
02:28 - And all these, by the way,
are scalars, scalar, scalar,
02:31 - scalar, and this is the vector.
02:34 - This is known as mu or the
coefficient of friction.
02:40 - Let's play a little
knock-knock joke together.
02:42 - Knock, knock.
02:44 - Who's there?
02:45 - The interrupting
coefficient of friction.
02:48 - The interrupting--
02:49 - Mu!
02:50 - [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
02:51 - Thank you.
02:52 - Thank you.
02:52 - Thank you very much.
02:53 - Thank you very much.
02:54 - Coefficient of
friction is a value
02:56 - that describes the strength
of the friction force based
02:59 - on what material it is.
03:01 - You could imagine
if this is like ice
03:03 - and this is an
ice skate, there's
03:05 - going to be a lot less friction.
03:06 - That ice skate will
glide across the ice
03:08 - versus this is
sandpaper and this
03:10 - is some other kind
of rough material
03:12 - and there's a much greater
amount of friction.
03:14 - So the coefficient of
friction is tied specifically
03:17 - to the material itself and
what its behavior as it
03:20 - comes into contact.
03:22 - Then we have something
interesting here.
03:23 - This-- the normal force.
03:25 - To describe the
normal force, let
03:27 - me refer back to the diagram.
03:29 - This diagram has a sled
in contact with a hill,
03:33 - and there is also
the force of gravity.
03:35 - The force of gravity is a
force pointing directly down
03:38 - towards the center of the
Earth and causing the sled
03:40 - to kind of rub in with
the hill as it moves
03:43 - and as it comes down.
03:44 - The normal force is
the force perpendicular
03:47 - to the two surfaces in contact.
03:49 - And its magnitude
is tied to the--
03:52 - this component of
the gravity force,
03:56 - the component that is
perpendicular to the hill.
03:58 - But guess what?
03:59 - None of that really matters.
04:00 - [CHUCKLES] What I
want to say is--
04:03 - I mean, all this is like
super important in real world
04:06 - physics, but let me remind
you what we're doing here.
04:10 - I have a ellipse, a piece
of graphics drawn on a two
04:15 - dimensional canvas
coming into contact
04:17 - with the edge of the canvas.
04:19 - So there is a normal
force pointing
04:21 - straight down in my world that
is the sort of looking at the--
04:25 - I'm looking at a slice of
a three dimensional world
04:28 - in a way.
04:29 - There is a normal force,
but what its magnitude is
04:32 - is something that I
could just make up.
04:34 - It's some kind of
constant in this case.
04:37 - Quick clarification.
04:39 - N is not a constant
in the sense that it
04:42 - depends on the weight, which
depends on the object's mass.
04:46 - So for different objects, that
relative amount of friction
04:49 - would be different because their
weights would be different.
04:52 - But in the case of
one particular object,
04:54 - I can treat it as a constant
here and scale it according
04:57 - to that object's mass.
04:59 - I'm going to simplify this
again to just have one object
05:02 - so as I add the code
for friction into it,
05:04 - I'm not dealing with
multiple objects.
05:06 - [MUSIC PLAYING]
05:09 - OK.
05:10 - So I have my single object
bouncing up and down.
05:13 - I'm going to invent a kind
of artificial scenario
05:16 - where I want this mover to
only experience friction
05:20 - when it comes in contact
with the bottom surface
05:23 - of the canvas.
05:24 - So any time it is in contact
with the bottom surface.
05:27 - It will experience friction.
05:29 - To make this happen, I'm
going to write a new function
05:31 - in the mover called friction.
05:32 - [MUSIC PLAYING]
05:34 - I'll check to see how far
is it away from the bottom.
05:37 - [MUSIC PLAYING]
05:40 - I want to know how far
is it from the bottom.
05:42 - So I want to know the
difference between the height
05:44 - and its position
plus the radius,
05:46 - because remember, the position,
the y position is the center.
05:49 - So I want to look at the edge
in contact with the bottom.
05:52 - I will say it's in contact
if that difference is
05:55 - within one pixel.
05:56 - [MUSIC PLAYING]
05:58 - So let's just run
the sketch, what
06:00 - we call the function friction.
06:01 - [MUSIC PLAYING]
06:03 - And let's see if-- when it
comes in contact with the edge
06:06 - we get the word friction
here in the console.
06:11 - So we can see, every
time it bounces,
06:13 - we're seeing the word friction.
06:15 - [MUSIC PLAYING]
06:19 - And now we can see,
as it's rolling along
06:20 - the bottom, friction,
friction, friction, friction,
06:22 - friction, because it's
in constant contact
06:24 - with the surface.
06:26 - Maybe I would want to
treat the scenario of when
06:28 - it hits the surface
once versus just
06:30 - rolling on the
surface differently,
06:32 - but I'm not going to worry
about that right now.
06:34 - The live chat that's watching
me record this video right
06:36 - now is also pointing out that
things would be quite different
06:39 - if my surface were at an angle.
06:43 - So how the normal force
would be calculated relative
06:45 - to the force of gravity.
06:46 - That's why I'm happy
about this simple scenario
06:48 - of this sort of flat
surface along the bottom.
06:51 - Let me first get the direction
of the friction force.
06:54 - I need the velocity vector
normalized to length 1
06:57 - multiplied by negative 1.
06:59 - Let me copy the velocity vector.
07:02 - Let me normalize it and
reverse its direction.
07:06 - Now that I have the direction,
I need the magnitude.
07:09 - What is the magnitude?
07:10 - The coefficient of friction,
mu, times the strength
07:14 - of the normal force.
07:16 - The normal force is proportional
to the weight, which is scaled
07:20 - by the mass of the object.
07:22 - So I can use mass
in my calculation.
07:24 - And then mu can be a
value that I make up.
07:26 - Let's say 0.1.
07:28 - The normal force will
be equal to the mass
07:33 - and then I can say force set
magnitude mu times normal.
07:39 - Once again, anytime I'm
calculating the force,
07:42 - I need to both figure
out its direction,
07:44 - a normalized vector
here pointing
07:46 - in the opposite
direction of velocity,
07:48 - and its magnitude, the
coefficient of friction,
07:50 - a value I'm making
up, times the strength
07:52 - of the normal force, which is
some value scaled according
07:54 - to mass.
07:55 - What do I do next?
07:56 - Apply the force.
07:59 - And I'm realizing I want
to call this friction.
08:01 - [MUSIC PLAYING]
08:03 - Let's run this and
see what happens.
08:05 - [MUSIC PLAYING]
08:11 - [GASPS] It came to a stop!
08:13 - How delightful!
08:15 - Now that this is working,
this is a nice moment for me
08:17 - to take a minute and
just add an array
08:19 - so we can see a bunch of these
all with different masses
08:22 - and see how they behave
within the same environment.
08:25 - So let me quickly add that in.
08:26 - [MUSIC PLAYING]
08:32 - Here you can see I am
making 10 mover objects.
08:36 - Everyone will start with
a y position at 200,
08:39 - but each will start
at a random exposition
08:41 - and with a random mass
some value between 1 and 8.
08:44 - Also might make sense for
me to make this mu variable
08:46 - a global variable,
just so I can play
08:48 - with it outside of the
interior of the class itself.
08:53 - I'm going to leave it up there.
08:54 - And then inside Draw, this
is a nice opportunity for me
08:57 - to use a for of
loop, because I want
08:59 - to say for every mover of--
09:02 - I can't.
09:02 - It's hard to say the word of
with what you're describing.
09:05 - It's really for each or
for in really makes sense.
09:07 - But the loop that I want
in JavaScript is for of.
09:09 - I have a whole other
video about that.
09:11 - But I want to look
at every single mover
09:12 - inside of the mover's array.
09:14 - And one way of doing that is
for every mover of movers,
09:18 - run all of this code.
09:21 - And let's take a look
and see what happens.
09:26 - Now, they're all
bouncing together.
09:27 - They hit the bottom at a
slightly different time.
09:29 - They should all respond to wind
differently based on their size
09:34 - not their mass.
09:36 - And then they'll all also
have their own friction
09:38 - according-- that's
scaled according
09:40 - to their mass as well.
09:41 - [MUSIC PLAYING]
09:44 - And after a little while, all
of them will roll to a stop.
09:48 - Does this feel accurate?
09:51 - Does this-- what
does this feel like?
09:52 - Well, I suspect that
by playing around
09:56 - with the coefficient
of friction,
09:58 - the relative strength
of the weight,
10:00 - the gravitational force,
all of these things,
10:03 - all of these
variables you can tune
10:05 - to have the simulation
feel more or less
10:08 - like different kinds of
material in different kinds
10:10 - of environments.
10:11 - So while here I am
attempting to actually write
10:16 - a code that uses the formula
for friction in the real world,
10:20 - I could also do this with a
very quick and dirty algorithm
10:23 - that I think it's
worth showing you just
10:26 - at the sort of tail
end of this video.
10:28 - Ultimately, what
friction does is it
10:30 - takes a little bit off of the
velocity every single frame.
10:33 - We lose some speed as
this object is coasting
10:37 - along a particular surface.
10:39 - The friction slows it down.
10:41 - Another way to lose a
little bit of velocity
10:43 - with each and every
step in time would
10:46 - be to just take a
percentage of velocity off.
10:48 - I could comment all of
this out and just say,
10:52 - this dot velocity multiply 0.95.
10:55 - Meaning, shrink
the velocity vector
10:58 - every time step, if it's
in contact with the edge,
11:01 - with the bottom surface by 5%.
11:03 - And let's just see if
this has the same result.
11:06 - [MUSIC PLAYING]
11:12 - In the end, it's pretty similar.
11:13 - They all come rolling to a stop.
11:15 - Did you notice,
though, that they all
11:16 - seem to come rolling to a stop
at exactly the same moment?
11:19 - Well, that's because one flaw
with this particular method
11:24 - is that I'm not taking into
account the objects mass.
11:26 - So you know, for just
having things sort of slow
11:28 - down over time, this might be
a really easy way to do it.
11:31 - If you want to make
sure that that force,
11:33 - that friction force is scaled
to mass, then maybe doing it
11:36 - the vector way is.
11:37 - One is not inherently
better than the other,
11:39 - these are just different
ways to produce
11:41 - the same kind of effect.
11:42 - So this wraps up this
very basic demonstration
11:45 - of coding a friction force into
a simple 2D physics simulation.
11:49 - There's a lot that you could
try before you move-- we move on
11:52 - to the next video.
11:52 - So we'll try these
things as an exercise.
11:54 - I wrote them all down.
11:55 - One is it's pretty
arbitrary that I decided
11:57 - to have this sideways view of
the world, of taking a slice,
12:00 - a two dimensional slice, and
things are falling up and down
12:03 - and moving left and right.
12:04 - What if what I were
actually looking at
12:06 - was a top down
view of a 2D world?
12:08 - So I'm actually overhead
maybe a billiards table
12:10 - and lots of things are
rolling around this surface
12:13 - and experiencing friction.
12:14 - How might what you code change?
12:16 - But if I were to stay
in this world that's
12:19 - the vertical slice,
what if I wanted,
12:22 - instead of having a horizontal
surface at the bottom,
12:25 - to actually have a sloped
surface within the frame
12:30 - and my objects are falling
down and maybe rolling down
12:35 - this particular surface.
12:36 - How would I have the
force of gravity behave,
12:40 - and how would I have the
force of friction behave?
12:42 - Truthfully, the material
that you need to do this
12:44 - is coming in
Chapter 3, where I'm
12:47 - going to look at angles and
polar coordinates and things
12:50 - like a pendulum simulation.
12:51 - So some of the ways that
you would calculate a force
12:54 - perpendicular to a
non-horizontal-- perfectly
12:57 - horizontal surface
are coming soon.
12:59 - But if you maybe
want to look ahead
13:00 - or experiment with how to do
that, try that as an exercise.
13:04 - I am completely
ignoring the difference
13:06 - between static friction,
what's the friction that's
13:09 - holding something in place
when it's not moving,
13:11 - versus kinetic friction, that
friction when it's in motion.
13:14 - That might be something
you consider folding
13:16 - into this particular example.
13:17 - Can you demonstrate
those two differences.
13:19 - And then finally, I think
this visualization would
13:22 - be so much more sort of
compelling or illustrative if I
13:26 - were to actually draw
the various vectors.
13:28 - Could I draw the velocity
vector as well as
13:31 - draw visual representations
of all the forces.
13:34 - So could I see the
drawing of the friction
13:36 - force, the gravitational
force, the wind
13:38 - force, all those other forces
within the simulation itself.
13:41 - So if you try any
of those and you
13:42 - make your own version
of them, please
13:44 - go to the URL that's in this
video description, where
13:46 - you can share your variation.
13:48 - I would love to check them
out and maybe also show them
13:50 - in a future video or livestream,
where I sometimes them
13:53 - show community contributions
from the website.
13:55 - Now, I have two
more case studies
13:56 - to look at related to forces.
13:58 - One, in the next video, is
very similar to friction.
14:00 - Actually going to look at a
drag force, air resistance.
14:02 - So what happens when
something, a body
14:04 - is falling through the air?
14:06 - How does-- what sort
of force acts on it?
14:08 - Or a body is moving
through a liquid.
14:10 - So that's known as drag
or a fluid resistance.
14:12 - I'm going to look at that
force in the next video.
14:14 - And finally, I want to
circle all the way back
14:16 - and look at that first
example I made when I looked
14:18 - at acceleration of this object
being attracted to the mouse,
14:21 - and make a version
of that, but use
14:23 - the actual formula for
gravitational attraction
14:26 - itself.
14:27 - So just a couple more videos
left in this Chapter 2,
14:30 - and we'll be moving
on to Chapter 3.
14:32 - And I hope you're enjoying
it and all that stuff.
14:34 - See you soon!

Cleaned transcript:

[BELL RINGS] Welcome to another, now with haircut, video in Chapter 2, Nature of Code. What I have done so far, using the classical laws of motion, classical mechanics, force equals mass times acceleration, I have implemented a system where mover objects can receive forces as vectors and have those forces control how they move about a canvas in p5.js. But the way that I have created these force vectors is just by picking numbers out of a hat, and I want to do something more. The formula that I want to start with is the formula for friction. Now, there are many different kinds of friction and examples of friction. And there's static friction, which is friction that holds something in place and not moving versus kinetic friction, which is the friction that occurs when two surfaces are in moving in contact with each other. Here's the diagram that I have to describe the friction force in the Nature of Code book itself. I'm going to take a minute to rewrite that formula over here. [MUSIC PLAYING] The approach I like to take when finding a formula like this and then trying to figure out how to apply it in code is to unpack each of the elements of the formula one at a time and figure out whether it actually applies or is, in fact, something that we can ignore to simplify in the case of our sort of 2D p5 canvas. So one, let's I'm going to go in sort of in arbitrary order here, but something really to note here is, what is this? This is the velocity unit vector. Why are we doing this? Let's consider I have this circle at the bottom of the canvas. It's moving in this direction, that's its current velocity, and I want to describe what is the direction of friction. Well, the direction of friction is and this negative 1 is really important. These two go together. The direction of friction is a vector in the opposite direction of velocity. Circling back for a second, what am I doing again? I'm calculating a force, a vector, and I need to figure out two things, direction and magnitude. The direction here is expressed as the unit vector pointing in the velocity's direction times negative 1. So I know that the friction points in this direction. That's the friction force. What is the magnitude? Well, I have two other variables in this formula. And all these, by the way, are scalars, scalar, scalar, scalar, and this is the vector. This is known as mu or the coefficient of friction. Let's play a little knockknock joke together. Knock, knock. Who's there? The interrupting coefficient of friction. The interrupting Mu! [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Coefficient of friction is a value that describes the strength of the friction force based on what material it is. You could imagine if this is like ice and this is an ice skate, there's going to be a lot less friction. That ice skate will glide across the ice versus this is sandpaper and this is some other kind of rough material and there's a much greater amount of friction. So the coefficient of friction is tied specifically to the material itself and what its behavior as it comes into contact. Then we have something interesting here. This the normal force. To describe the normal force, let me refer back to the diagram. This diagram has a sled in contact with a hill, and there is also the force of gravity. The force of gravity is a force pointing directly down towards the center of the Earth and causing the sled to kind of rub in with the hill as it moves and as it comes down. The normal force is the force perpendicular to the two surfaces in contact. And its magnitude is tied to the this component of the gravity force, the component that is perpendicular to the hill. But guess what? None of that really matters. [CHUCKLES] What I want to say is I mean, all this is like super important in real world physics, but let me remind you what we're doing here. I have a ellipse, a piece of graphics drawn on a two dimensional canvas coming into contact with the edge of the canvas. So there is a normal force pointing straight down in my world that is the sort of looking at the I'm looking at a slice of a three dimensional world in a way. There is a normal force, but what its magnitude is is something that I could just make up. It's some kind of constant in this case. Quick clarification. N is not a constant in the sense that it depends on the weight, which depends on the object's mass. So for different objects, that relative amount of friction would be different because their weights would be different. But in the case of one particular object, I can treat it as a constant here and scale it according to that object's mass. I'm going to simplify this again to just have one object so as I add the code for friction into it, I'm not dealing with multiple objects. [MUSIC PLAYING] OK. So I have my single object bouncing up and down. I'm going to invent a kind of artificial scenario where I want this mover to only experience friction when it comes in contact with the bottom surface of the canvas. So any time it is in contact with the bottom surface. It will experience friction. To make this happen, I'm going to write a new function in the mover called friction. [MUSIC PLAYING] I'll check to see how far is it away from the bottom. [MUSIC PLAYING] I want to know how far is it from the bottom. So I want to know the difference between the height and its position plus the radius, because remember, the position, the y position is the center. So I want to look at the edge in contact with the bottom. I will say it's in contact if that difference is within one pixel. [MUSIC PLAYING] So let's just run the sketch, what we call the function friction. [MUSIC PLAYING] And let's see if when it comes in contact with the edge we get the word friction here in the console. So we can see, every time it bounces, we're seeing the word friction. [MUSIC PLAYING] And now we can see, as it's rolling along the bottom, friction, friction, friction, friction, friction, because it's in constant contact with the surface. Maybe I would want to treat the scenario of when it hits the surface once versus just rolling on the surface differently, but I'm not going to worry about that right now. The live chat that's watching me record this video right now is also pointing out that things would be quite different if my surface were at an angle. So how the normal force would be calculated relative to the force of gravity. That's why I'm happy about this simple scenario of this sort of flat surface along the bottom. Let me first get the direction of the friction force. I need the velocity vector normalized to length 1 multiplied by negative 1. Let me copy the velocity vector. Let me normalize it and reverse its direction. Now that I have the direction, I need the magnitude. What is the magnitude? The coefficient of friction, mu, times the strength of the normal force. The normal force is proportional to the weight, which is scaled by the mass of the object. So I can use mass in my calculation. And then mu can be a value that I make up. Let's say 0.1. The normal force will be equal to the mass and then I can say force set magnitude mu times normal. Once again, anytime I'm calculating the force, I need to both figure out its direction, a normalized vector here pointing in the opposite direction of velocity, and its magnitude, the coefficient of friction, a value I'm making up, times the strength of the normal force, which is some value scaled according to mass. What do I do next? Apply the force. And I'm realizing I want to call this friction. [MUSIC PLAYING] Let's run this and see what happens. [MUSIC PLAYING] [GASPS] It came to a stop! How delightful! Now that this is working, this is a nice moment for me to take a minute and just add an array so we can see a bunch of these all with different masses and see how they behave within the same environment. So let me quickly add that in. [MUSIC PLAYING] Here you can see I am making 10 mover objects. Everyone will start with a y position at 200, but each will start at a random exposition and with a random mass some value between 1 and 8. Also might make sense for me to make this mu variable a global variable, just so I can play with it outside of the interior of the class itself. I'm going to leave it up there. And then inside Draw, this is a nice opportunity for me to use a for of loop, because I want to say for every mover of I can't. It's hard to say the word of with what you're describing. It's really for each or for in really makes sense. But the loop that I want in JavaScript is for of. I have a whole other video about that. But I want to look at every single mover inside of the mover's array. And one way of doing that is for every mover of movers, run all of this code. And let's take a look and see what happens. Now, they're all bouncing together. They hit the bottom at a slightly different time. They should all respond to wind differently based on their size not their mass. And then they'll all also have their own friction according that's scaled according to their mass as well. [MUSIC PLAYING] And after a little while, all of them will roll to a stop. Does this feel accurate? Does this what does this feel like? Well, I suspect that by playing around with the coefficient of friction, the relative strength of the weight, the gravitational force, all of these things, all of these variables you can tune to have the simulation feel more or less like different kinds of material in different kinds of environments. So while here I am attempting to actually write a code that uses the formula for friction in the real world, I could also do this with a very quick and dirty algorithm that I think it's worth showing you just at the sort of tail end of this video. Ultimately, what friction does is it takes a little bit off of the velocity every single frame. We lose some speed as this object is coasting along a particular surface. The friction slows it down. Another way to lose a little bit of velocity with each and every step in time would be to just take a percentage of velocity off. I could comment all of this out and just say, this dot velocity multiply 0.95. Meaning, shrink the velocity vector every time step, if it's in contact with the edge, with the bottom surface by 5%. And let's just see if this has the same result. [MUSIC PLAYING] In the end, it's pretty similar. They all come rolling to a stop. Did you notice, though, that they all seem to come rolling to a stop at exactly the same moment? Well, that's because one flaw with this particular method is that I'm not taking into account the objects mass. So you know, for just having things sort of slow down over time, this might be a really easy way to do it. If you want to make sure that that force, that friction force is scaled to mass, then maybe doing it the vector way is. One is not inherently better than the other, these are just different ways to produce the same kind of effect. So this wraps up this very basic demonstration of coding a friction force into a simple 2D physics simulation. There's a lot that you could try before you move we move on to the next video. So we'll try these things as an exercise. I wrote them all down. One is it's pretty arbitrary that I decided to have this sideways view of the world, of taking a slice, a two dimensional slice, and things are falling up and down and moving left and right. What if what I were actually looking at was a top down view of a 2D world? So I'm actually overhead maybe a billiards table and lots of things are rolling around this surface and experiencing friction. How might what you code change? But if I were to stay in this world that's the vertical slice, what if I wanted, instead of having a horizontal surface at the bottom, to actually have a sloped surface within the frame and my objects are falling down and maybe rolling down this particular surface. How would I have the force of gravity behave, and how would I have the force of friction behave? Truthfully, the material that you need to do this is coming in Chapter 3, where I'm going to look at angles and polar coordinates and things like a pendulum simulation. So some of the ways that you would calculate a force perpendicular to a nonhorizontal perfectly horizontal surface are coming soon. But if you maybe want to look ahead or experiment with how to do that, try that as an exercise. I am completely ignoring the difference between static friction, what's the friction that's holding something in place when it's not moving, versus kinetic friction, that friction when it's in motion. That might be something you consider folding into this particular example. Can you demonstrate those two differences. And then finally, I think this visualization would be so much more sort of compelling or illustrative if I were to actually draw the various vectors. Could I draw the velocity vector as well as draw visual representations of all the forces. So could I see the drawing of the friction force, the gravitational force, the wind force, all those other forces within the simulation itself. So if you try any of those and you make your own version of them, please go to the URL that's in this video description, where you can share your variation. I would love to check them out and maybe also show them in a future video or livestream, where I sometimes them show community contributions from the website. Now, I have two more case studies to look at related to forces. One, in the next video, is very similar to friction. Actually going to look at a drag force, air resistance. So what happens when something, a body is falling through the air? How does what sort of force acts on it? Or a body is moving through a liquid. So that's known as drag or a fluid resistance. I'm going to look at that force in the next video. And finally, I want to circle all the way back and look at that first example I made when I looked at acceleration of this object being attracted to the mouse, and make a version of that, but use the actual formula for gravitational attraction itself. So just a couple more videos left in this Chapter 2, and we'll be moving on to Chapter 3. And I hope you're enjoying it and all that stuff. See you soon! [MUSIC PLAYING]
