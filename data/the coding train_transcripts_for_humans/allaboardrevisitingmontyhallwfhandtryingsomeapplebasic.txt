21:12 - other announcements one is a short one
21:14 - and one is kind of a long one both of
21:16 - these are repeating things that i talked
21:17 - about on tuesday's very brief stream
21:20 - that i did before the itp ima
21:23 - semester show
21:25 - so
21:26 - um
21:28 - now
21:29 - i am going to close oh no i have to have
21:31 - this open but i'll just have it in the
21:34 - background
21:35 - um let me come over here
21:38 - and let me
21:41 - [Laughter]
21:43 - uh simon is here you know it's hard
21:45 - simon you got to wake up early in the
21:46 - morning now that you're
21:48 - in the same time zone as me i believe
21:50 - uh everyone say hi to simon in the chat
21:52 - of course just joining us
21:54 - uh um simon we talked about p5 access
21:57 - day um which maybe i'll see you there
21:59 - tomorrow if you're free but no worries
22:01 - if you're not
22:02 - basically this is this live stream is
22:04 - just a one-on-one where i can like talk
22:06 - to simon briefly
22:08 - all right what was i what was that ah
22:10 - let me do my announcements so
22:13 - um
22:14 - i mentioned this
22:16 - uh
22:16 - speaking of simon this is very funny
22:18 - timing p c d
22:20 - c p h so and back to processing i just
22:24 - want to again mention that processing
22:26 - community day in copenhagen is happening
22:28 - on june 4th 2022. i mean there's lots of
22:32 - community days and there's the io
22:33 - festival there's all sorts of things i
22:35 - can tell you about but the reason why
22:36 - i'm telling you about this one is
22:37 - because i'm going to be there i'm going
22:39 - to copenhagen i have a plane ticket i
22:41 - have a picture of me on the website
22:42 - where i was had a little bit less gray
22:44 - hair even though that was only like two
22:46 - years ago so i don't know what's been
22:47 - going on
22:48 - it's very stressful this last couple
22:50 - have you noticed
22:52 - what the world is like
22:55 - i have it way easier than probably most
22:58 - so i really don't need to complain but i
23:00 - i know everybody's having a a range of
23:02 - emotions and challenges in their lives
23:04 - these days so hopefully the coding train
23:06 - can bring something positive to you
23:08 - that's um that's one of my goals here
23:10 - with this whether it's educational or
23:11 - entertainment or just pure
23:15 - vibes
23:16 - is coding train a vibes show or a plot
23:19 - show i don't even know if it's a show
23:21 - but is it more vibes or is it more plot
23:23 - i think it might be more vibes
23:25 - at least so far right now
23:27 - all right uh so yeah so please
23:29 - especially if you are in the denmark
23:31 - area is that a thing people say the
23:33 - denmark we say like the tri-state area
23:35 - for here if you're in that the
23:37 - the new york city kind of i mean there's
23:39 - other states that are not just new york
23:41 - but the the denmark area the northern
23:43 - europe area um i would love to see you
23:45 - there i've heard from people on the
23:47 - twitters and on the youtube chat and the
23:49 - comments and all of that that they're
23:50 - planning to come that's really great
23:53 - not sure yet what i'll be doing there
23:55 - but some kind of coding stuff
23:57 - um copenhagen area okay i'm also
24:00 - thinking of going to stockholm
24:03 - maybe i heard that you could take this
24:04 - overnight boat from stockholm to
24:06 - helsinki and then visit health thank you
24:08 - for the day and then take the boat back
24:10 - i'm thinking about that i don't know why
24:11 - i should be just like talking about all
24:12 - my travel plans here but i've never
24:14 - really been around sort of northern
24:15 - european area so i'm excited to to do
24:18 - some visiting there okay

24:39 - um let me switch back over here so
24:41 - youtube
24:42 - let's let's talk for a minute about
24:44 - coding train and live streaming because
24:47 - first of all i'm
24:48 - i'm probably i'm not going to have any
24:49 - live streams pro actually no i have one
24:51 - that i'm going to try i'm going to try
24:52 - to do one next friday if all goes well
24:56 - one of the reasons why i am working on
24:59 - learning relearning applesoft basic is
25:01 - because i am filming something for the
25:04 - streaming service nebula that i've
25:05 - talked about um a short a class if you
25:09 - go to nebula uh if you start if you go
25:10 - to nebula.app and look at nebula classes
25:12 - you'll see there's a whole bunch there
25:13 - already
25:14 - and i'm doing a quick set of programming
25:16 - tutorials in basic so lots more to say
25:19 - about that then but i'm doing that next
25:20 - week so today i wanted to get my feet
25:22 - wet a little bit and tinker around in
25:24 - basic again um so that'll help me
25:26 - mentally prepare for next week but
25:27 - that's been a big project it's kind of
25:29 - slowed me down on my
25:30 - youtube production of stuff
25:33 - i have been streaming quite a bit on
25:34 - twitch
25:35 - um which i really enjoy
25:37 - i like a lot of the features and you
25:39 - know i can imagine doing some
25:40 - interesting things with the twitch api
25:42 - in the chat so i'm kind of waffling back
25:44 - and forth between the two platforms
25:46 - but uh here i am today
25:48 - on youtube
25:49 - um and one of the things that's been
25:51 - interesting to follow is how various
25:54 - features
25:55 - that appear on twitch then make their
25:57 - way over to youtube and i'm very excited
26:00 - that youtube seems to have added
26:01 - something
26:02 - called gifting memberships so
26:05 - i'm going to try this now i'm going to
26:07 - gift 20 memberships to the chat
26:10 - and let's just see what happens
26:13 - uh so 20 of you watching right now i
26:15 - apparently i i thought you could assign
26:17 - them
26:18 - not that i want to be in charge of
26:19 - picking who gets them but uh let's see
26:22 - how that goes so i just gifted
26:24 - 20 memberships um i'm looking at the
26:27 - chat now uh pink chris manning pink
26:30 - lemonade raj fun planet muhammad
26:35 - muchitaba this is this is so fun
26:39 - unless you think i'm being super
26:40 - generous that money just goes right back
26:42 - to me i mean not really because uh
26:45 - youtube i don't know what youtube takes
26:47 - i think 30 actually so if it was like
26:50 - i guess i guess that was like for 20
26:51 - memberships it was like a dollar and
26:54 - change
26:55 - each
26:56 - um
26:57 - but this is fun to see uh how this works
27:00 - anyway um so it's very confusing how you
27:03 - support the coding train for those of
27:05 - you first of all i'm just happy you're
27:06 - here watching
27:08 - i'm happy if you decided i'm not going
27:10 - to watch anymore because i'm doing other
27:11 - stuff with my life or if you want to
27:13 - just send me a tweet that says hey i
27:15 - like your videos or hey you know you
27:17 - know i don't really like your videos
27:19 - because you wave your arms around too
27:20 - much i mean i i i love getting those
27:22 - messages but you say it in a nice
27:24 - constructive feedback way i totally
27:26 - accept it
27:27 - anyway i'm saying um uh but i do
27:29 - appreciate that there are people who
27:31 - have the capacity and desire to support
27:33 - the coding train financially um
27:35 - i'm kind of running this whole
27:38 - ship
27:39 - as a train it's not a ship as a
27:42 - kind of break even small business
27:44 - basically
27:45 - and i have folks who are helping me with
27:47 - maintaining the website and
27:49 - the
27:50 - open source repositories and doing video
27:51 - editing and illustration and helping me
27:53 - with other projects and research so i'm
27:55 - trying to grow that to some extent
27:57 - although i don't i would like to just
27:59 - still be just like
28:01 - a small easy to manage simple things so
28:03 - anyway for those of you who are
28:04 - supporting in that way that's great
28:07 - one of the things that is confusing
28:09 - is there are
28:11 - many different avenues
28:13 - on which to
28:15 - find coding train content as well as
28:17 - support the coding train so this is all
28:20 - a big segue to talk about the new
28:23 - codingtrain website
28:30 - are you ready
28:32 - we're at my live stream on tuesday you
28:34 - already saw it so it's not too exciting
28:36 - um
28:37 - but um let's have a looksie at it
28:40 - um and talk about it for a bit okay
28:45 - so first of all the new coding train
28:47 - website is not actually live at
28:49 - thecodingtrain.com
28:50 - the plan is for it to have its official
28:52 - launch
28:53 - um in
28:56 - pcd uh
28:57 - um copenhagen so um that's kind of like
28:59 - the deadline i'm i'm going to move it
29:01 - over to the propertycodingtrain.com
29:03 - domain before then but right now you can
29:06 - preview it at
29:08 - uh codingtrain
29:12 - preview.netifly.app one of the things
29:14 - i've been learning which has been super
29:15 - fun is how to deploy a web application
29:17 - to netlify i would love to do some
29:18 - videos on that
29:20 - this is what it looks like
29:22 - this is the home page i'm going to go
29:23 - through pieces of it in a bit and i'm
29:25 - also going to show you how to
29:26 - download the repository and run it
29:28 - download the website and run it locally
29:30 - build it locally
29:32 - so one of the things that i just wanted
29:34 - to show you
29:36 - is here in the footer i'm trying to be
29:37 - better organized so these are sort of
29:40 - the current avenues that come with
29:42 - various different benefits and rewards
29:44 - in terms of youtube membership patreon
29:47 - github sponsorship a twitch subscription
29:49 - and the nature of code book so um but
29:51 - this is not the primary thing i wanted
29:52 - to talk about about the website
29:54 - so um
29:57 - i one of the things i'm planning to do
29:59 - this will probably happen at the very
30:00 - beginning of june is i'm going to do
30:03 - some really lengthy i don't want to say
30:05 - all day but like
30:07 - several hour live streams on twitch
30:10 - probably um where i'll be working on
30:13 - updating the website and asking for
30:15 - people to help
30:17 - um so um this is just a little taste of
30:20 - that because i don't want to spend the
30:22 - whole stream like here i am i'm going to
30:24 - like build a page for the website that
30:26 - needs that's not there right now but i
30:28 - want to show you so that any of you who
30:30 - are interested could get started
30:31 - tinkering with it contributing to it and
30:35 - the main thing i want to show you is how
30:36 - you can add your own
30:38 - uh versions of the different coding
30:40 - examples that are in my videos to the
30:42 - website itself i'm trying to keep my eye
30:44 - on the chat um i don't know where to
30:47 - look at it here okay hydro pn thank you
30:50 - so much so all of you who are just like
30:52 - suddenly gifted this membership so i'm
30:54 - sorry for the random number generator
30:56 - i'll maybe i'll do another one a little
30:57 - bit
30:58 - um
30:59 - um but um you should the main thing for
31:02 - you to do is
31:04 - link your um
31:07 - link your
31:10 - oh yes link your youtube and discord
31:12 - accounts then go to the coding trained
31:15 - discord which you can get to at
31:17 - thecodingtrain.com discord and um
31:21 - there you will have access to some of
31:23 - the supporter member channels and yeah i
31:25 - can answer your questions there and i
31:27 - guess it'll go away i guess i just
31:28 - gifted you one month and then
31:31 - when that's over it'll go away unless
31:33 - you choose to continue it i don't know
31:34 - maybe that's uh i don't i actually don't
31:36 - know how this works i'm just
31:37 - experimenting with it twitch has had
31:38 - this kind of gift subscription thing
31:40 - forever so
31:42 - um
31:43 - okay
31:44 - uh
31:45 - let's see oh a dark mode feature for the
31:47 - website so feel free to file an issue
31:49 - for that um we can have that discussion
31:52 - um
31:53 - uh you know the the the vibe of the
31:55 - coding train is bright and cheery but oh
31:58 - one of the things actually that's one of
31:59 - the things we're talking about doing is
32:01 - having the scene change the time of day
32:04 - based on the time of day but um i see
32:06 - that it's already 11 30. i want to make
32:08 - sure that i'm
32:09 - moving into um
32:12 - moving into some of the other stuff i
32:14 - want to do today soon enough so let's
32:16 - take a look at just a quick
32:18 - lesson i know lessons probably the wrong
32:20 - word a quick demonstration of how you
32:23 - can get your hands into the website
32:25 - locally on your computer okay
32:28 - so this is the github repo it is at oh
32:31 - and unchained just joined
32:34 - that's like a genuine legitimate
32:37 - membership joining
32:40 - oh
32:42 - [Music]
32:53 - you have just won
32:54 - your very own membership to the coding
32:56 - range you didn't really win it because
32:57 - you you paid for it and then google took
33:01 - a large portion of that and then the
33:02 - rest at some point will
33:04 - anyway thank you so much i really
33:05 - appreciate your support
33:07 - um
33:08 - okay uh
33:10 - so no fave icon yet yeah file these as
33:13 - issues people we want to hear from you
33:16 - so okay so what i'm going to do here now
33:19 - first of all if you want if you want to
33:21 - just download everything that has to do
33:23 - with the website you can just go right
33:25 - here onto github and click download zip
33:29 - there are
33:30 - ways for you to contribute and edit the
33:33 - website by
33:34 - going through the github repository the
33:37 - git repository on github itself clicking
33:40 - edit creating a pull request these are
33:42 - things i would really love to remake my
33:44 - whole git and github tutorial series
33:46 - maybe it actually makes sense for me to
33:47 - do that using the coding train website
33:49 - if i'm
33:51 - thinking about this right now it's kind
33:52 - of an interesting idea but um
33:55 - i want to just look at what is a bit
33:57 - more of a higher degree of difficulty uh
33:59 - element which is to uh and especially if
34:02 - anybody is sort of has a lot of
34:03 - experience with web development out
34:04 - there who wants to sort of
34:06 - see how the website works and think
34:08 - about how they might want to contribute
34:09 - to it
34:10 - this is what you'll need to do so i'm
34:12 - going to go here under uh code and um i
34:16 - should probably start using this github
34:17 - command line
34:19 - and by the way i have a million people
34:21 - to thank about this website i'll have to
34:22 - come back and do that later
34:24 - because i'm not really prepared i don't
34:26 - want to forget anyone today but um
34:28 - uh so apologies for not giving like sort
34:31 - of full credit of course if you just go
34:32 - through the repo and look at the history
34:34 - you'll see all the wonderful people
34:35 - working on the website so it is there
34:37 - and findable um so i am going to click
34:41 - uh copied um
34:43 - and i am going to uh
34:47 - uh go over here and go to the desktop
34:50 - um so i'm in item any sort of terminal
34:53 - or console access will do here i am
34:56 - going to say
34:58 - git
34:58 - clone
35:00 - and then i'm going to paste the url for
35:01 - the repository
35:03 - which should bring the entire website uh
35:05 - down to my computer
35:07 - uh it looks like it's finished i'm going
35:09 - to go and just look in the finder now
35:12 - here
35:13 - and we can see so let's just look at
35:14 - what's here first of all for a second
35:17 - so there's a couple things that are
35:18 - interesting about this one is
35:21 - there is no website
35:23 - in the way that you're viewing it
35:26 - here
35:27 - what is in all these folders is the raw
35:30 - data and design materials for the
35:32 - website so i have to build the website
35:35 - but what is important for me to try to
35:38 - briefly explain and talk about and i
35:41 - think this is not my area of expertise
35:44 - or my forte here
35:45 - but this is what's known as a statically
35:49 - built
35:50 - website uh unchained thank you unchained
35:53 - that's that's i appreciate that uh
35:55 - clarification on the name pronunciation
35:58 - um
35:59 - so what i mean by that is when you're
36:02 - looking at the website you're looking at
36:04 - a flat
36:05 - rendered html page that's loading images
36:08 - and animations and embedding all sorts
36:10 - of other things there's no engine that
36:12 - is live rendering that is that is
36:15 - that is um
36:17 - i want to say like generating the page
36:19 - that's pulling from a database i wanted
36:22 - the website and this is something that
36:23 - we talked a lot about in the development
36:25 - design systems international is the
36:27 - creative
36:28 - firm that um has done
36:30 - designed this website and worked with me
36:32 - to build it um
36:35 - so i wanted the website to be something
36:37 - that you could just grab
36:40 - and run locally that you could edit
36:42 - directly on github you don't need to
36:44 - have some kind of
36:46 - secret keys environment variables and a
36:49 - dummy database and the website is just
36:52 - everything for the website is all here
36:54 - in all these folders and if i go under
36:57 - content you'll start to see there's
36:58 - pages there's templates there's tracks
37:01 - there's videos and if you go in there
37:02 - you can start to see like oh there's
37:04 - something for every there's a folder for
37:06 - every coding challenge if i go into this
37:08 - one but suddenly aha
37:10 - this doesn't look like
37:13 - a web page that's not an html file
37:16 - that's a json file if i were to now open
37:18 - this up
37:22 - in a code editor like visual studio code
37:26 - and i were to go to content pages
37:29 - uh challenges no no uh
37:32 - where videos
37:34 - challenges and go to this one i don't
37:36 - know which ones and go here we would see
37:38 - oh look object oriented fractal trees
37:42 - oh the description is blank let's we're
37:44 - going to do something about that right
37:45 - now there's a date there's a video id
37:47 - there's some languages there's some
37:49 - topics there's links to the code
37:51 - examples this is all json
37:54 - but when i go to the website if i were
37:56 - to go under
37:57 - videos tracks no
38:00 - videos challenges
38:02 - and i were to go to which one was i
38:04 - looking at
38:06 - object-oriented fractal trees
38:09 - here it is this looks like a webpage
38:11 - with you know a navigation bar the video
38:14 - links to the code examples
38:16 - the description is empty uh this other
38:19 - thing about a passenger showcase thing
38:21 - so where is all of that and how does
38:23 - that happen
38:26 - this website is built with a build
38:29 - system
38:30 - actually it's it's something called
38:32 - gatsby
38:33 - which i don't know
38:35 - uh gatsby let's let's look up what
38:36 - gatsby is build gatsby static sites with
38:40 - react and
38:41 - no no that's a udemy course
38:43 - that's an
38:44 - ad story blog this is an ad give me this
38:48 - thing yeah
38:49 - so this is what gatsby is
38:51 - it is essentially an engine that is able
38:54 - to take all of the raw materials and
38:57 - generate the website but rather than do
38:59 - that on the fly the moment when a page
39:02 - is requested it does that anytime the
39:05 - developers of the website make a change
39:07 - and rebuild it
39:09 - so i can
39:11 - i can now do that process so i have all
39:14 - of the data
39:15 - here
39:16 - on my computer in this folder all the
39:19 - data for the website and if i want to
39:22 - start to build the website look at it
39:25 - locally make changes to it and then send
39:27 - those changes back to the actual website
39:29 - i can do that by issuing some node
39:32 - commands
39:33 - to
39:34 - install whatever package dependencies i
39:36 - need to build the website to build to
39:40 - test to run tests on the website all
39:42 - those kinds of things so the first one
39:44 - i'm going to want to do is type npm
39:46 - install now if the word node is
39:48 - completely unfamiliar to you
39:50 - um you know i might have some tutorials
39:53 - that you could watch and i wish i could
39:54 - just sort of like bring them up right
39:55 - now oh if only i had a website that
39:57 - organized everything well i'd be able to
39:58 - go right to the page where my node
40:00 - tutorials are coming soon
40:02 - but node.js is a javascript framework
40:05 - for
40:06 - um
40:07 - you know i want to say server-side
40:09 - coding but it's so much more i guess
40:10 - it's a runtime it's a way of like
40:12 - executing javascript just on any
40:14 - computer without a browser context so
40:16 - javascript is most commonly found as
40:19 - code running inside a web browser but
40:20 - you can run it anywhere so i want to run
40:22 - some javascript code right here on my
40:25 - computer inside of this folder well i
40:27 - need to make sure if i'm going to run
40:29 - all the scripts that go with the website
40:31 - i need to install all the packages npm
40:34 - node package manager so i'm going to hit
40:36 - enter there
40:37 - and we're going to run all of this
40:41 - and i'll talk about people are asking
40:42 - about how maybe i'll talk about the
40:44 - deployment process i'll get to that
40:47 - how that gets deployed then so it's
40:49 - installing a bunch of things
40:54 - so by the way to contribute to the
40:55 - website you don't have to know any
40:57 - programming and you don't have to know
40:59 - anything
41:00 - about git i mean
41:02 - you have to be willing to try these
41:04 - things but i'm looking for though all of
41:06 - you who have never done any of this
41:08 - before to contribute to the website let
41:10 - it be a friendly welcoming place for you
41:13 - to
41:14 - do your first open source contribution
41:16 - um p5 and processing a lot of the other
41:18 - projects i'm involved with are those
41:19 - kind of places too but the website
41:20 - that's really an invitation i'm really
41:22 - inviting you like i want you to be in
41:25 - there like i've never tried this before
41:27 - can i figure it out if you can't we've
41:29 - done something wrong on our end right
41:30 - we've got to fix that
41:36 - wow that was a lot of node packages to
41:38 - install
41:40 - um all right and i realize you probably
41:41 - can't see the bottom here because my
41:43 - desk is so now that i've done npm
41:45 - install
41:46 - one thing i want to just look at briefly
41:48 - is
41:50 - an important file to look at is this
41:53 - package.json file so any node project
41:56 - the package.json file is like a
41:59 - configuration file it is a file that
42:01 - tells you all about the project
42:03 - and if i go here it'll say things like
42:05 - oh it's the coding train and it's
42:07 - version one
42:08 - it's not actually private anymore it was
42:10 - private there's a description oh roon
42:12 - matson
42:14 - is the author of the coding trade
42:15 - website he's the one who started this
42:16 - project uh a designer uh one of the
42:19 - founders of dsi but what i'm really
42:21 - looking for these are all the
42:22 - dependencies right all of these things
42:24 - that it's using you know we could get
42:26 - into any of these individually
42:28 - but what i wanted to show you are these
42:30 - scripts
42:32 - so this is important
42:35 - uh if i want to build the website serve
42:38 - the website clean the build which is
42:40 - something i'll get to test the website
42:43 - or work on
42:44 - developing the website i can run any of
42:47 - these commands
42:48 - update your packages you have three
42:50 - criticals
42:53 - all right
42:55 - what uh what do i do npm audit maybe
42:59 - or update or something
43:01 - audit fix
43:04 - um
43:08 - i don't know i don't know what i'm doing
43:09 - anymore let's write npm audit fix so one
43:12 - of the things about these node packages
43:14 - is they're constantly being updated and
43:16 - especially some of the older ones can
43:17 - have you know security vulnerabilities
43:19 - in them
43:20 - um
43:22 - so i think i'm gonna have to look at
43:23 - this later but there's also something
43:25 - that was telling me to like
43:27 - update my npm or something i'm just
43:28 - going to run npm install again
43:33 - wasn't it telling me
43:36 - uh
43:37 - oh npm fun
43:39 - i don't know i don't know i'm gonna deal
43:41 - with this later we're gonna live with
43:42 - the vulnerabilities
43:44 - hi kay
43:45 - um
43:47 - so
43:49 - what was i looking for
43:51 - i was on a on a path here i had done yes
43:55 - i got distracted by the chat though
43:56 - thank you for that important message
43:58 - um so the one that i want to look at
44:01 - right now is
44:04 - uh let's try npm so these are just
44:06 - aliases the actual command that we're
44:08 - running is like gatsby serve or gatsby
44:10 - build build but these are things like i
44:12 - can make this uh called unicorn and then
44:16 - i could say
44:17 - npm run unicorn
44:20 - and that's going to run the development
44:22 - command
44:24 - um but i i there's no reason for me to
44:26 - make that change so let me go back and
44:29 - call it dev and let me just say npm run
44:31 - dev so this is what i want to do first
44:33 - so what this is actually doing is it's
44:35 - building the website it's a little bit
44:37 - different than npm build because what
44:39 - it's doing is it's building the website
44:42 - and hosting the website and then
44:45 - keeping its eye on all of the files so
44:48 - if i were to change any file it's going
44:50 - to quickly rebuild that page and this is
44:52 - what you want to do while you're
44:53 - developing it right when you build the
44:55 - website it's a one-time operation
44:57 - i build the website there it is i change
44:59 - the json file it's not going to be a new
45:00 - it's not going to update until i rebuild
45:02 - npm run dev is like we're going to be
45:05 - building it continuously in the
45:06 - background while you're working on it
45:08 - it's inefficient you would never want
45:09 - that in production so to speak like oh
45:12 - it's just constantly rebuilding but
45:13 - while you're working on it makes sense
45:15 - so
45:16 - i got one problem zero errors one
45:18 - warning so
45:19 - um
45:20 - and now we see that the website is now
45:23 - running locally so i am able to go to
45:26 - um this particular url localhost at this
45:29 - port
45:30 - and i'm just to type it in manually
45:32 - although i could click on that localhost
45:34 - localhost
45:36 - 8000
45:38 - and we see there's the website looks
45:40 - just like the website that is currently
45:44 - did i lose it where is it oh yeah it's
45:46 - here the website that is currently um on
45:49 - deploy to netlify right now but we can
45:52 - do things like
45:54 - let's go back to that file
45:57 - uh videos
45:59 - challenges object-oriented
46:02 - so this has no description
46:05 - so what i would like to do here is let's
46:08 - find this video
46:10 - object-oriented
46:12 - [Music]
46:15 - tree
46:19 - so this is at the page for it on the old
46:20 - website which is fine so i'm actually
46:22 - going to take this description here from
46:24 - the old website
46:26 - i'm going to paste it into here well
46:28 - first let's
46:29 - quickly go and have this page open
46:31 - locally so we can see the magic of this
46:33 - this is the local version of the site
46:35 - videos challenges
46:38 - um
46:39 - which is the one i'm looking for maybe i
46:42 - go to the next page
46:44 - this one 15.
46:47 - so
46:48 - notice how this description here is
46:49 - blank
46:51 - let's try it i'm going to put this in
46:52 - here
46:54 - let me turn on word wrap
46:56 - uh put a period there
46:58 - and now there you go look at that it
47:00 - appeared
47:02 - boom because i'm running that and if we
47:04 - went to the terminal it's going to say
47:06 - you can see like
47:08 - it you can see all these information
47:10 - about how it's uh re it ah it found this
47:13 - changed file and it's rebuilding stuff
47:15 - and all that one thing that's
47:16 - interesting to look at by the way i
47:17 - don't understand what this is exactly
47:19 - but there's this
47:21 - view graphyql an in-browser ide to
47:24 - explore your site's data and schema
47:26 - let's take a look at that so this
47:28 - is like
47:29 - uh i know maybe somebody in the chat can
47:31 - explain what this is i'm gonna take a
47:32 - look um
47:37 - yeah so i i see there's some discussion
47:39 - in the chat i'm not sure what the
47:40 - question was but you do not need you
47:42 - could be on any
47:44 - this website should build
47:46 - on any platform that supports node so
47:49 - the server network i assume is where i
47:51 - have it deployed i assume is running
47:52 - some type of linux server unix-based
47:54 - server i'm running it on mac right now
47:56 - you can run node on windows on linux
47:58 - obviously so yeah um
48:01 - yes you can do what i'm doing so now let
48:04 - me read this over to see if i want to
48:05 - make any edits in this coding challenge
48:07 - i can so
48:09 - i don't think i think that's redundant
48:12 - uh can i continue the topic uh let's
48:15 - just change it to
48:17 - more algorithmic botany
48:21 - um
48:24 - uh
48:27 - another way to
48:29 - render
48:30 - i don't know this is hard to do in real
48:32 - time while i'm live streaming this is uh
48:34 - i'm kind of regretting this decision to
48:36 - try to edit this but i wanted to show
48:37 - you like i'm trying to freshen up all
48:40 - the content as i'm bringing it over
48:41 - another way to
48:43 - um
48:45 - generate a fractal
48:48 - tree is to consider
48:52 - every part of the tree an object
48:55 - so that we can apply forces and
48:56 - attributes to
48:59 - all the
49:00 - branches all the branches and leaves and
49:04 - more okay so i'm going to make that edit
49:07 - to the description
49:09 - let's go back and see if this is the old
49:11 - website where is it here
49:14 - localhost so we can see the description
49:17 - here um this might be um whoa what just
49:20 - happened oh it refreshed
49:22 - so
49:23 - i'm wondering just about this
49:25 - read more here with this particular
49:27 - length and then i say read more and it's
49:29 - like kind of a lot of extra space so
49:31 - this might be a bug
49:33 - to work on let's go to the code examples
49:35 - and make sure they work
49:37 - so this goes to
49:40 - p5 sketch
49:44 - uh great this is the code example so
49:45 - that's working what do these do
49:48 - um
49:49 - this takes me to ah the code on uh
49:52 - github and then this one let's see what
49:54 - this does
49:56 - uh downloads the code uh directly okay
49:59 - um and that's and i think these are
50:00 - supposed to have like the processing or
50:02 - p5 logo so that might at one point that
50:05 - was there
50:06 - but i'm not sure what happened to that
50:08 - um
50:09 - okay
50:10 - so there's lots more that could be done
50:12 - uh the time stamps are not here that's
50:15 - something that i would want to add so
50:16 - i'm looking for people to contribute all
50:18 - of these things like if you
50:20 - again i don't want to uh
50:22 - my goal for this is not to take
50:24 - advantage of people's generosity and get
50:26 - free labor
50:27 - like if you are really interested you
50:30 - know i um i have people who are paid to
50:33 - work on porting and but uh
50:36 - and and like building out the content to
50:38 - the website but if this would be a
50:41 - enjoyable learning experience for you to
50:43 - pick one coding challenge or one video
50:45 - page or one thing and try to add some
50:47 - material to it i welcome your
50:50 - contribution um
50:52 - so and and joseph in the chat is saying
50:54 - graphql is a query length so eric writes
50:56 - graph eql pronounced like graphical is a
50:59 - dev endpoint for working with testing
51:00 - the graph
51:02 - graphical api or graphql api which is a
51:05 - query language
51:06 - a way to query data then multiple rest
51:08 - endpoints so it's kind of like the
51:09 - beginnings of an api
51:11 - so i would think that um
51:14 - um
51:16 - i would think that
51:18 - um
51:19 - that's that's good news for like
51:21 - eventual development of being able to
51:22 - serve a lot of the content on the
51:23 - website as an api
51:25 - so
51:25 - let's think about fractals generative
51:27 - art let's add object oriented
51:31 - programming as another topic maybe
51:34 - um
51:36 - uh
51:37 - and i don't know if algorithmic botany
51:40 - really makes sense these are kind of
51:41 - like tags let's add that
51:43 - so the next thing i'm going to do is i'm
51:45 - going to
51:46 - here oops
51:50 - let's look at git status you can see
51:51 - that i've changed the
51:54 - object oriented fractal trees page
51:57 - i'm going to make a separate branch
51:58 - which is live stream demo
52:02 - i'm going to go to that branch
52:06 - um i'm going to hit add
52:09 - just
52:10 - to add those changes
52:13 - to the sort of get staging thingy my mom
52:17 - someday when i do a proper video about
52:18 - git i'll have the vocabulary at the
52:20 - ready um
52:22 - then i'm going to write a commit message
52:24 - now
52:25 - as uh i always have the voice of darius
52:28 - kazemi in the back of my mind that says
52:29 - don't do this don't just write a short
52:31 - message
52:32 - so i'm going to do git commit
52:35 - i'm going to follow the wise words
52:38 - and say like this is a demonstration
52:42 - that i am doing live
52:44 - on youtube
52:46 - to show how
52:48 - to
52:49 - contribute to the new
52:51 - coding
52:52 - train website
52:54 - so and then so the idea here is that i
52:56 - can see what's modified and i could
52:58 - write a longer more thoughtful message
53:00 - i think there's a way to have a title
53:01 - and uh but um i'm gonna then go ahead
53:04 - and
53:06 - quit out of here no
53:08 - how do i how do i get out of this i
53:09 - think i'm in like vi or vim or something
53:13 - no wait
53:14 - cole and q right or x
53:18 - uh there was an error
53:21 - i don't know what i did wrong all right
53:23 - i'm sorry i failed
53:25 - uh live demo
53:28 - live demo of website edit
53:31 - let's go back to this
53:33 - uh then i'm going to push it to
53:36 - uh
53:38 - get push origin
53:40 - uh that and uh apologies i realize some
53:42 - of you watching this like it is all
53:45 - completely unfamiliar to just soak it in
53:47 - um uh maybe check out my uh well there's
53:50 - plenty of wonderful materials online to
53:52 - learn about getting github my tutorial
53:54 - series is called github for poets which
53:56 - you would find on the website or youtube
53:58 - so i'm going to push this up
54:00 - oh interesting i'm not authenticated
54:04 - oh crud
54:06 - um i made a mistake here but let's let's
54:10 - see if i can do this real quickly
54:13 - um
54:15 - i usually have myself authenticated
54:19 - through um
54:21 - keys
54:23 - on my machine
54:24 - then i just have a passcode but i i'm in
54:27 - my coding train login which i guess i
54:29 - haven't done this
54:30 - um
54:31 - so let's see what happens here
54:34 - if
54:35 - um
54:40 - boy you can't see the password that's on
54:42 - this phone can you
54:44 - let me put it here i
54:45 - might have to redo that password
54:53 - yeah it failed why did it fail
54:56 - this is so sad
54:58 - uh isn't my username
55:00 - this
55:18 - all right well this is kind of a little
55:19 - bit of a little you can't use it i mean
55:22 - i have two factor in all of that so
55:24 - um i guess i probably want to use the
55:26 - cli or be authenticated through my keys
55:30 - i wonder if i had cloned it actually
55:32 - through i didn't think to do this but
55:35 - usually
55:36 - oh what oh because i'm not logged in i
55:39 - usually clone it through
55:42 - hold on
55:44 - how do i do that info thing
55:51 - i want to see a five if how
55:54 - if i have a key
55:56 - stored
55:57 - a global um
55:59 - look at the chat
56:04 - get me the pass go to github settings
56:05 - create a token okay but i'm not even
56:07 - logged in i don't know what happened to
56:09 - me
56:10 - um
56:12 - i want to make this happen let's let's
56:14 - let's go forth
56:15 - um all right
56:20 - i'm stubborn i'm going to make this
56:21 - happen
56:22 - um now i need to go to my event my two
56:25 - factor um
56:33 - um okay so what is what are people
56:35 - telling me i need to do
56:36 - um
56:40 - that i should not be doing while showing
56:44 - um
56:46 - but probably that should be should not
56:47 - be showing live
56:48 - uh use the cli it's easy to authenticate
56:54 - uh generally took on the website use
56:56 - that instead of a password all right
56:57 - where do i do that token
57:01 - token token token developer settings
57:04 - password and authentication
57:07 - um
57:09 - i really should probably not be having
57:11 - this open live
57:14 - um
57:21 - keys
57:25 - yeah that's why i cloned it this is
57:27 - still okay
57:28 - let's go back
57:30 - everybody stay calm
57:36 - i'm going to do this
57:38 - i cloned it with https which is what to
57:42 - do if you're not like logged in through
57:44 - your account but i can use ssh
57:53 - try
57:54 - to
57:57 - let's try this
58:00 - yes i this is me being authenticated now
58:03 - oh i'm sorry everybody
58:05 - uh we're just gonna just do this again
58:08 - i'm gonna run in
58:09 - pretend none of that happened
58:12 - developer settings generate tokens so i
58:14 - could have done that
58:15 - um
58:17 - where was that developer settings
58:20 - developer settings
58:22 - personal access token all right i'm
58:26 - i'm moving to this view just in case it
58:28 - shows it
58:29 - expiration
58:31 - custom
58:34 - i'm gonna have this expire tomorrow
58:42 - live
58:44 - and select scopes
58:48 - can i do everything
58:53 - oh boy this is bad i'm giving myself
58:55 - every every possible
59:00 - permission
59:02 - generate token
59:04 - copy it okay
59:06 - so i made a personal access token
59:14 - and now
59:18 - let's try it back in here
59:21 - just curious get put push origin
59:25 - live stream demo
59:27 - so shiffman
59:28 - password so put in my personal access
59:30 - token i just created
59:33 - ah there we go
59:34 - so that works so i can show you that
59:36 - page that doesn't have the access token
59:38 - on it anymore
59:39 - but um wherever that was i think i might
59:42 - have closed it actually
59:43 - um
59:44 - but now all right
59:46 - so sorry for that slight diversion there
59:49 - are this is why
59:51 - this stuff is hard and confusing to
59:53 - navigate because there's so many
59:55 - different ways to do it and so many ways
59:58 - that you could get stuck
59:59 - but the way that i usually work with
60:02 - github is by cloning repos through uh
60:06 - secure shell ssh and i've
60:09 - set up my all sorts of configuration
60:12 - settings on my computer to allow that
60:14 - what i happen to do here i hear this
60:16 - github cli is particularly useful so you
60:19 - can look into installing that but what
60:21 - happened is i used this
60:23 - particular
60:25 - url which is what you would use if
60:27 - you're not authenticated into the it's
60:29 - not like your repo you're not
60:30 - authenticated into it and then
60:33 - um
60:34 - you're able to uh you can generate a
60:36 - personal token and all that kind of
60:37 - stuff is what i showed you so but that's
60:40 - neither here or nor there the important
60:42 - thing is you'll see that all of a sudden
60:45 - i now have this new branch called live
60:47 - stream demo i'm going to do compare and
60:49 - pull request
60:51 - i'm going to say i'm adding description
60:54 - to coding challenge
60:56 - oop fractal tree
61:01 - and this is happening
61:02 - [Music]
61:03 - live right now
61:05 - i'm going to create this pull request
61:08 - oh and i forgot to show you how to run
61:10 - the tests so one thing i should have
61:12 - done by the way and you can see here
61:14 - this is what i changed right it's
61:15 - showing me the new description the new
61:17 - topics
61:19 - and what i uh one thing that i should
61:21 - have done first is do npm run test
61:25 - because this will check the changes to
61:27 - see if there is a typo or error in it
61:30 - but they all passed so for example if i
61:32 - were to go back to this and i if i were
61:34 - to forget this quote
61:36 - obviously like uh visual studio code is
61:38 - showing me through syntax highlighting
61:40 - that there's a mistake but if i were to
61:42 - do this and do npm run test
61:47 - it's going to tell me
61:49 - that the tests failed and if sometimes i
61:52 - can sort of figure out but like syntax
61:54 - error at this place and blah blah blah
61:56 - so i could go back to the file and try
61:58 - to figure out what i got wrong
62:01 - um the pull request itself is actually
62:04 - running these tests so it is running a
62:07 - test and it's even going to do a deploy
62:09 - preview i think so i'm going to wait for
62:11 - that to happen i'm going to take a look
62:12 - at the chat
62:14 - the cli is good um people are saying
62:17 - yeah it's using jest the i have not i
62:19 - did not write any of the tests again
62:21 - this website was designed and developed
62:23 - by uh design systems international
62:27 - let's see how their
62:29 - uh google uh
62:30 - this is their website um they did the
62:33 - website for uh processing and you can
62:35 - see other projects of theirs on um
62:39 - um on
62:40 - uh on their website and they are doing
62:42 - the coding train website which at some
62:44 - point will um
62:46 - i would expect will hopefully appear wow
62:47 - they they redid their website recently
62:50 - um um
62:52 - which i assume will at some point appear
62:54 - on their website as well so check out
62:56 - design systems international
62:58 - um let's see here
63:05 - joseph asks are you using eslint
63:09 - to share styles i don't know i would
63:12 - like to i wanted to one thing that's
63:15 - changing so the previous website in
63:18 - addition to host in addition to holding
63:22 - all of the metadata around all of the
63:24 - videos also held the actual source code
63:27 - for the videos and i'm now going to
63:29 - decouple that it was way too much to
63:32 - manage within one github repository so
63:35 - any page
63:38 - on the website like this being one of
63:39 - them
63:40 - the code examples are all links to urls
63:44 - outside
63:46 - of the website itself now one thing
63:49 - that's a little bit weird is that the
63:51 - url that's going to the source code for
63:54 - processing is currently
63:56 - pointing to the old websites
63:59 - repository because that's where the code
64:01 - is but it's my intention to move those
64:03 - so that's another project that i
64:04 - absolutely need help with i would like
64:06 - to make one repo for all the coding
64:08 - challenges sometimes like for the wave
64:10 - function collapse um project i just have
64:13 - a whole repo that's just wave function
64:14 - collapse romantic hall i have that so
64:16 - it's gonna the source code is going to
64:18 - be able to be flexibly in more than one
64:20 - place under any kind of organization on
64:22 - a case-by-case basis and then the web
64:24 - page just links to it
64:26 - um
64:29 - so uh chris i i talked a bit about how
64:32 - uh the website how it's um uh static
64:34 - build using gatsby and that kind of
64:36 - thing um we'll be revisiting this again
64:39 - more in future streams i guess these
64:41 - take quite a bit of time
64:43 - um i i don't know if um
64:47 - oh oh but look we have a no that's a
64:49 - deploy log
64:50 - um oh so can if i i think i probably
64:52 - have to log into netlify
64:54 - i am logged in so we can see um
64:57 - so i have a netlify account
65:00 - and what this is showing is that this is
65:03 - kind of like what happens is
65:06 - anytime github and netlify are linked to
65:08 - each other
65:09 - and so basically like when there are
65:12 - changes made to the
65:14 - source code repository on github
65:17 - communication happens that tells netlify
65:19 - hey you can rebuild run all the gatsby
65:22 - build commands to rebuild the website to
65:25 - host it um so it's not rehosting it the
65:29 - the the actual website like this is
65:31 - codingtame preview and if i go to
65:33 - challenges and that same page right this
65:37 - is the page on the live netlify preview
65:41 - uh the live website this is the local
65:43 - host page and you can see
65:45 - localhost page has these extra topics
65:48 - the live website does not
65:51 - but at some point
65:53 - it takes quite a while i guess
65:55 - i uh oh wait wait is it is it there
65:58 - is it getting there oh yeah deploy
66:00 - preview ready so i think i can go here
66:04 - ah yes look at this
66:06 - so this is what's so cool about using
66:08 - netlify it created a deploy preview so i
66:12 - could actually see what the website
66:14 - looks like with the new changes i've
66:16 - made before it goes to the live website
66:19 - and it would look this way
66:22 - even when it's at the codingtrain.com
66:24 - actually i don't know what it'll look
66:25 - like maybe it'll do some kind of
66:26 - subdomain thing
66:27 - so i should wait for all the tests to
66:30 - finish
66:33 - before i merge it
66:35 - i kind of know it's going to be fine
66:36 - maybe i'll wait let's see if there's
66:38 - other questions and then once i merge it
66:41 - it would then those changes would then
66:43 - appear live on the actual website so
66:45 - this is such a useful
66:47 - process because even if you don't want
66:50 - if you if you're not doing this locally
66:51 - like let me let me show you probably the
66:53 - way that you're more likely to engage
66:55 - with this it's like and somebody did
66:57 - this recently if i go
66:59 - here to
67:00 - um
67:03 - spelling fixes
67:05 - so for example um supercrafter
67:08 - went through the website and made just
67:10 - like small edits to a lot of different
67:11 - pages um and then i looked at them and
67:15 - merged them but i can actually just do
67:17 - that through the github interface itself
67:19 - like for example
67:21 - if i were to go to
67:23 - a different
67:24 - challenge like the barnsley fern
67:27 - and go here to index.json and if i
67:30 - wanted to edit the description i could
67:31 - just do it right here in the github
67:33 - interface and i could say
67:36 - [Music]
67:39 - visualizing
67:41 - the barnsley firm
67:43 - fractal with processing
67:45 - java and then i could this is a trivial
67:48 - change
67:49 - but do we have fractals generative art
67:54 - um what were some things that i said
67:56 - like algorithmic botany
67:59 - i don't know that we need that as a tag
68:00 - but um so if i wanted to add those um
68:04 - demonstrate uh updating
68:07 - barnsley i saw that wrong barnsley fern
68:12 - and then i could create a new branch
68:15 - and live demo two
68:17 - propose change
68:19 - um and then i could make this a pull
68:21 - request
68:30 - and
68:31 - um
68:34 - now i can look at this pull request
68:38 - i uh chris i appreciate i appreciate
68:40 - your comments about wanting to see a
68:42 - dynam uh a database layer and a dynamic
68:44 - setup but i made a very specific
68:46 - decision to go with a static website it
68:48 - was a long discussion that we ran around
68:50 - a lot of circles on and i i appreciate
68:52 - your feedback and i i you know we'll see
68:54 - what happens in the future but this is
68:56 - definitely the direction that um i've
68:58 - chosen to go in so ah now we can see
69:01 - that this one has completed running its
69:04 - tests
69:05 - and i can merge it in so i'm going to
69:07 - hit merge and then at some point it will
69:10 - take some time
69:11 - this being the actual
69:13 - preview of the website on netlify i can
69:17 - [Music]
69:19 - i can uh
69:21 - refresh here and at some point the new
69:23 - website will build and we'll see the new
69:24 - topics coming in
69:26 - um
69:27 - okay
69:28 - so
69:29 - i'm trying to think of what else i might
69:30 - want oh yes the most important part so
69:33 - what i didn't get to really show here
69:35 - now
69:37 - but i'm going to show you in a second
69:40 - is here under uh closed
69:43 - let's look at this one so um
69:48 - yesterday i believe
69:50 - i received this wonderful pull request
69:53 - um
69:54 - from rue dash a
69:56 - who contributed their particular um
70:00 - uh project so if you want to create your
70:04 - own so let's look at the website to see
70:07 - where this is so i'm going to go to
70:09 - challenges
70:10 - and which one was this that i'm looking
70:12 - at this one is
70:14 - l16l systems
70:17 - so
70:18 - um
70:20 - where was that i'm gonna go to
70:22 - why am i lost here
70:24 - um oh i'm on the website i'm going to
70:26 - 16.
70:30 - don't know what what order they're in
70:31 - i'm going to go here
70:32 - um and one of the things you'll see
70:37 - oh where is it
70:38 - is this the wrong one
70:42 - okay hold on
70:43 - let's figure out what's going on here
70:45 - so i am on
70:47 - challenges 16 l systems fractal tree
70:50 - showcase this was merged
70:52 - contribution 6.
70:54 - so why is it not showing up let's look
70:58 - at it locally here for a second
71:02 - so i'm going to look at the local
71:03 - version
71:04 - whoops
71:09 - challenges
71:11 - video i'm going to videos challenges
71:14 - oh my god it's afternoon already this is
71:16 - insane
71:17 - i guess i guess i should have allocated
71:19 - a lot more time for the website let's go
71:22 - to
71:23 - 16 fractal tree l system passenger
71:26 - showcase
71:27 - so let's now look at what's in there
71:33 - showcase
71:38 - so contribution one two three four five
71:41 - six
71:44 - uh
71:47 - one two three
71:49 - four five oh there it is did i just not
71:52 - scroll far enough to the right
71:55 - let's go back to here
71:58 - no
72:00 - oh maybe it hasn't redeployed do i have
72:02 - to do something to redeploy the website
72:06 - because it's actually showing here so
72:08 - this is what this is what i was trying
72:09 - to show you you can
72:11 - by creating your own json file and
72:13 - uploading a thumbna thumbnail image and
72:15 - the the plan is to both have a cli as
72:18 - well as a form that you can enter in to
72:20 - do this so you ultimately don't have to
72:22 - do it by like manually creating a json
72:24 - file you can see this is the
72:25 - contribution and it appears
72:28 - um
72:31 - so
72:32 - um
72:36 - okay so
72:38 - what i'm confused about is why it's not
72:42 - actually appearing on the main website
72:45 - do i need to do something
72:50 - to actually i'm not logged in
72:53 - all right i have to figure out i'll have
72:55 - to figure this out i i didn't realize
72:58 - that
72:59 - maybe there's an extra step that when
73:01 - something is merged to main for it to
73:03 - redeploy to the actual website itself
73:06 - because i'm not seeing it
73:09 - i'm still looking at the preview
73:13 - i know but the preview is sorry it's
73:15 - confusing the preview is the live
73:18 - website right now i just haven't i just
73:21 - haven't
73:22 - this is not a deploy preview i probably
73:24 - shouldn't have called it preview
73:26 - i should have called it coding train
73:28 - uh almost published to be moved to the
73:31 - actual domain this is the equivalent of
73:34 - the live website
73:36 - unless it's just cached
73:39 - because
73:40 - i looked at that page before let's just
73:42 - try this
73:43 - uh videos tracks no i always go videos
73:47 - challenges
73:50 - um
73:54 - uh what was i looking for
73:57 - um
73:58 - this one
74:01 - i'm gonna force refresh
74:05 - yeah i don't know why
74:07 - it's not building
74:09 - it's there
74:12 - how is it there
74:28 - thank you yes i see the discussion is
74:30 - continuing and i i totally get it i
74:33 - appreciate the feedback um i don't think
74:36 - it's a perfect solution by any means and
74:38 - i definitely would like to do i
74:41 - definitely i plan to do
74:42 - i mean this is i'm kind of realizing how
74:44 - long this takes but i plan to do a full
74:46 - live stream this is practically becoming
74:48 - that dedicated to the website and uh
74:50 - being more organized about how to walk
74:52 - people through working on it
74:54 - um
74:55 - you stayed on the page and refreshed
74:57 - just now
74:59 - so weird
75:02 - i'm not seeing it here
75:05 - but let's go just out of curiosity let's
75:07 - go to
75:11 - this one
75:13 - i i um which one the object this one
75:17 - oh yeah this appeared
75:20 - so this is strange so the changes i just
75:22 - made today appeared
75:25 - so there maybe there's like a caching
75:27 - thing going on
75:28 - let me just go to like a new incognito
75:30 - window
75:33 - and go to
75:35 - challenges
75:37 - and um
75:43 - which one this one is the one i'm
75:44 - looking for
75:46 - no so strange
75:50 - oh does it maybe only show
75:53 - a certain number not all of them no i
75:55 - think it whoops i think it shows it's
75:57 - very hard to scroll this that's one
75:59 - actually a little bit of feedback that
76:01 - might
76:01 - oh i have this here
76:03 - like does it only show a random number
76:05 - of them all right i i have to move on
76:09 - hold shift yes i've done that i've
76:11 - holden i've held shift press the refresh
76:13 - button many times uh i think it's time
76:16 - for me to move on
76:18 - um
76:20 - um to uh the next part of today's live
76:24 - stream so i wanted to come back to monty
76:28 - hall
76:29 - um
76:32 - let me come back
76:34 - to a monty hall
76:38 - sorry i i i got a little
76:41 - that drained me getting stuck with a few
76:43 - things and trying to like maneuver
76:45 - between all these different windows
76:46 - how's everybody doing i need a break for
76:49 - sure um there should be moderators on
76:52 - this stream
76:54 - yes
76:55 - um
76:56 - but you know sometimes
76:59 - that's not the case so if we need some
77:02 - moderation help um let's um
77:06 - let's uh let's let's get there okay
77:13 - interestingly enough just just one last
77:15 - you indulge me with one last check
77:18 - so where i should see it
77:20 - oh no wait that doesn't make any sense
77:22 - okay i'm lost never mind i'm gonna come
77:24 - back to this later uh
77:26 - um and yeah it should so i i i went
77:29 - through a sort of opening discussion
77:30 - about this but i encourage everybody to
77:33 - um to play around the website um to to
77:36 - add your versions of things you've made
77:38 - from the videos to it and stay tuned in
77:40 - early june i will be returning to do a
77:43 - much longer session probably on twitch
77:45 - where we just spend all day kind of
77:46 - helping people
77:48 - and through adding stuff to the website
77:50 - okay
77:51 - well in theory i was going to be done in
77:53 - about 40 minutes but i'll probably go
77:54 - long
77:56 - so thank you mustafa okay so
77:58 - um i um um let's go to um
78:03 - the coding train for a second
78:05 - um under videos
78:07 - and here under the monty hall problem
78:11 - uh what am i not logged i'm not oh i'm
78:13 - in the incognito window okay let's go
78:16 - back to here
78:18 - and uh okay so i'll let this play i'm
78:21 - gonna do and um
78:23 - let's look at the comments so
78:25 - if you haven't um
78:29 - if you haven't seen this video yet i i
78:32 - would love for you to check it out this
78:33 - was a lot of fun to make
78:35 - my
78:38 - diagrams about a bayes theorem are still
78:40 - over there on the whiteboard
78:41 - um
78:42 - and so um i wanted to just talk about a
78:46 - few things
78:47 - so first let me just show you in case
78:50 - you didn't see
78:52 - that
78:53 - um
78:54 - if you want to experiment with this
78:56 - problem here is the web demo so the
79:00 - monty hall problem i'm going to just
79:02 - re-explain it briefly i'm going to talk
79:03 - about what i missed in the video
79:05 - for those of you who might have watched
79:07 - it and thank you for all the comments
79:08 - and the feedback this is the monty hall
79:10 - problem there is a prize behind one of
79:12 - these doors
79:14 - uh in the video i sort of say it's a
79:16 - trip on the coding train express
79:19 - um so i'm gonna pick a door one
79:23 - so i picked door one and then door two
79:26 - was open now this happened very fast in
79:28 - the actual in an actual
79:30 - sequence of playing this game out in a
79:31 - game show there would be a lot of
79:33 - fanfare and a lot of drama
79:35 - now the idea is that once i pick door
79:37 - number one
79:38 - the the the doors without the prize have
79:41 - a goat behind them is what you're using
79:43 - here you know of course the goat we all
79:45 - know is the true prize
79:46 - but um the idea here is that i've picked
79:49 - door number one
79:51 - and the host is going to open door
79:54 - number two to say like ah look there's a
79:56 - goat here
79:57 - so now in theory do you want to keep
80:00 - your door oh i'm gonna offer you a
80:02 - chance to switch
80:03 - like trying to re-explain this
80:05 - and running into some of the same issues
80:09 - so there's come so there's a couple
80:11 - things that in the video i didn't
80:12 - explain too well now in an actual game
80:15 - show the it might be that the host is
80:18 - intentionally trying to mislead you or
80:21 - not really explain all of the ins and
80:23 - outs of what's going on and just create
80:25 - this fun
80:27 - scenario where you have to really
80:29 - dramatically decide whether you're like
80:31 - are you going to switch and maybe you
80:32 - really had it or are you going to keep
80:34 - what you have but maybe you really
80:35 - should have switched like what do you do
80:37 - and sort of feels like a coin toss at
80:39 - this point because there's two doors we
80:40 - know the prizes in one of those places
80:43 - but
80:43 - what is really important about
80:46 - about this probability pro the specific
80:48 - problem that i'm talking about is that
80:50 - the host is all knowing
80:53 - the host
80:54 - knows what's behind all the doors so the
80:57 - host couldn't but so if the host didn't
81:00 - know anything and they were just like
81:01 - you picked door number one well let's
81:02 - show you one of the doors just to see
81:04 - those could buy accidents show you the
81:05 - prize and then you know you have 100
81:08 - chance of losing at that point right you
81:10 - can't pick or switch because you can't
81:11 - switch someone but in this case the host
81:14 - there's only three
81:16 - there's only a couple possibilities
81:18 - one
81:19 - if there's only three three scenarios
81:21 - right one is you picked
81:23 - the correct prize in which case it
81:26 - doesn't matter which door the host opens
81:28 - uh you've got the prize under your door
81:31 - the other
81:32 - uh scenario is the prize is actually
81:34 - under door number three so the host has
81:36 - to open door number two
81:38 - the other scenario is
81:41 - the prize is under door number two and
81:42 - so the host has to open up door number
81:44 - three so i'm not necessarily doing a
81:46 - better job explaining this than i did in
81:47 - the video but i'm just trying to sort of
81:49 - rehash it and explain that i wasn't
81:52 - incredibly clear
81:54 - about that the host being i didn't
81:55 - mention it but you know it's a little
81:57 - tricky to follow in the video um and so
82:00 - one of the things that i did in the
82:01 - video in particular maybe we can find
82:03 - one of these comments let's just look
82:04 - and see if any of the i meant to go
82:06 - through and like um
82:08 - youtube keeps changing its interface and
82:10 - i can't find the comments now here they
82:12 - are
82:12 - um
82:14 - uh
82:15 - let's just see there were some useful
82:17 - ones
82:18 - um that people had get some nice
82:21 - corrections to me
82:22 - uh yes so this is simon has a great
82:24 - comment here so um one of the things
82:26 - that i said in the video was that um
82:30 - there and you could think of it as there
82:32 - are
82:33 - four possibilities right back to these
82:35 - doors again or no where what was i
82:41 - oh i was at the demo ah let me go back
82:43 - to simon's comment
82:45 - um
82:47 - sorry
82:48 - i've lost what i'm doing here
82:50 - um
82:53 - where's simon's comment there it is um
82:56 - that i s there you could think of it uh
82:58 - let's let's um
83:01 - let's refresh this right
83:03 - i'm picking door number one
83:06 - if the prize
83:08 - i said like let's say if the prize is
83:10 - behind them door number two then the
83:12 - host has to open up door number three
83:16 - if the prize is behind door number three
83:18 - the host has to open up door number two
83:20 - that's two scenarios now what if the
83:23 - prize is behind door number one
83:27 - well
83:28 - in the way that i explained it you might
83:29 - have been misled that there are now two
83:31 - other possibilities because the host
83:33 - could open door two or door three but
83:36 - those are one scenario right the idea
83:40 - that the way to think about this and i
83:42 - think this is much more clear maybe i'll
83:43 - just use the whiteboard for a second
83:45 - um is that
83:55 - hello welcome to the monty hall problem
83:58 - i am going to pick
84:00 - uh i'm the contestant i'm gonna pick
84:02 - door number one
84:06 - and now monty hall
84:08 - is going to say
84:10 - you could have door number one
84:12 - or you could have both doors number two
84:14 - and three
84:16 - so you know they all had prizes on to
84:18 - them first of all you'd probably want to
84:19 - take these two because probably the
84:21 - combined prizes would be more than just
84:23 - one price but regardless i don't know
84:24 - why i went off with that tangent you
84:26 - would want a switch because if you could
84:29 - have um two chances out of three over
84:32 - one chance out of three then absolutely
84:34 - you would want to so those are the three
84:37 - pot there's really only three
84:38 - possibilities door is behind here
84:41 - the prize is here the price is here or
84:43 - the price is here
84:45 - if you pick both doors two and three
84:47 - you're gonna lose when the price is here
84:49 - but you're gonna win when it's here or
84:50 - and you're gonna win when it's here so
84:52 - two out of three times you're going to
84:54 - win
84:55 - so it's very hard to wrap your head
84:57 - around it
84:58 - obviously i think you know it's often
85:00 - demonstrated well through playing out
85:02 - the simulation that's what this is for
85:04 - so if i put on auto run
85:07 - it's going to just play the game over
85:08 - and over again i'm going to turn the
85:09 - speed way up and we're gonna see it's
85:11 - just playing it and randomly deciding
85:14 - whether to switch or stay and you can
85:16 - see like over time like right now it's
85:18 - kind of doing better than expected it's
85:20 - like hovering up around 68 or 69 percent
85:23 - but over time and
85:24 - this should be around 33
85:26 - and this should be around 67
85:29 - the other thing that's um that i like
85:31 - about this demonstration is i can change
85:34 - to have it uh 25 doors for example so
85:37 - let me just do this for a second so um
85:40 - let's say i pick door 18
85:43 - and the host shows all of those doors
85:45 - have goats do i want to switch
85:48 - like i'm i do really right because uh
85:51 - yeah there we go and i won the prize so
85:52 - we could do this again many many times
85:55 - and
85:57 - you know i'm gonna you know at some
85:58 - point i might lose by accident
86:01 - and then if i auto run this one
86:03 - we're gonna see that i haven't even so
86:05 - far out of all these times
86:07 - i'm still at zero percent eventually at
86:09 - some point this will be more than zero
86:11 - percent let's wait and see
86:12 - um
86:16 - right so alex is saying the best
86:18 - explanation is from brilliant so one of
86:20 - the reasons why i wanted to talk about
86:24 - this video today uh one is i just like
86:26 - to
86:27 - uh
86:28 - revisit previous videos that i made in
86:30 - the live stream and answer any questions
86:32 - and talk about comments
86:34 - um
86:36 - and uh i i i need to do a better job of
86:39 - being prepared for that because there
86:40 - were some other great comments there in
86:41 - that thread but i want to move on to
86:43 - looking at some apple basic stuff today
86:46 - and i also want to tell you about
86:48 - today's sponsor and i am going to
86:52 - manually
86:53 - oh i know why the banner didn't show up
86:56 - because i'm a
86:58 - dum-dum and the banner the banner
87:00 - appears on this screen not on the other
87:02 - screen that's why it didn't show up at
87:03 - the beginning so i want to tell you
87:05 - about today's sponsor brilliant so this
87:08 - demo
87:09 - this dem live demo that i did of the
87:11 - monty hall problem
87:13 - where you can interact with it and try
87:15 - any given scenario whether auto running
87:17 - it this is like a
87:20 - pale in comparison to all of the
87:22 - incredible demonstrations and
87:24 - interactive lessons on math and science
87:27 - and probability and calculus and etc
87:29 - that are on
87:31 - the brilliant website so let's walk over
87:34 - i'm not walking anywhere i'm just going
87:35 - in my browser over to brilliant
87:38 - brilliant is a website full of
87:41 - interactive lessons and challenges and
87:43 - courses on all sorts of topics and the
87:46 - thing that i like to talk about is you
87:48 - know i appreciate that people watching
87:50 - the coding train watch my videos and
87:53 - that maybe you gain some inspiration you
87:54 - learn something and then but the most
87:56 - important thing of watching my videos is
87:57 - then going trying it yourself and
87:59 - brilliant is a thing that's all you're
88:01 - basically doing is trying things
88:02 - yourself and i think the the best um
88:05 - thing for me to show is just look at all
88:06 - these core i mean every time i look at
88:07 - this list of courses i'm like oh i want
88:09 - to do that one and that one and that one
88:10 - beautiful geometry is absolutely one of
88:12 - my favorites great uh great ideas for
88:15 - doing coding challenges and
88:17 - about fractals and infinity and all
88:18 - sorts of beautiful stuff
88:21 - i wanted to look today um
88:24 - at the um
88:25 - probability course
88:29 - um
88:30 - which is the there's there's several
88:32 - different courses but i want to look at
88:33 - the
88:34 - introduction to probability course i do
88:36 - want to point out though before i get
88:38 - there and i think this should come up um
88:41 - that
88:42 - one of the courses that brilliant has is
88:45 - their neural network course that i was
88:47 - looking at recently and there's this
88:48 - incredible i usually show the
88:50 - demonstration of it recognizing
88:51 - handwritten digits but this course
88:53 - actually allows you to play with neurons
88:57 - and activation functions
88:59 - to look at how the weights affect the
89:01 - output neuron and adjusting those
89:04 - weights
89:05 - and and looking at how
89:08 - activation functions and the different
89:10 - bits and parts of neural networks work
89:12 - so i really recommend if you're
89:13 - interested in machine learning and
89:14 - neural network stuff i would definitely
89:16 - recommend looking at that
89:17 - um let me come back over to here so
89:19 - let's start this probability course
89:21 - together for a little bit
89:23 - um
89:25 - sorry simon i don't have discord open
89:27 - right now i screwed up my screens today
89:30 - so i will look at it briefly if it's
89:32 - urgent you're gonna have to uh
89:34 - tell me uh sooner somehow what you're
89:37 - trying to get to me okay so let's start
89:40 - this lesson
89:42 - and let's make this uh-oh
89:45 - suppose scientists detected a large
89:48 - asteroid headed straight for earth
89:51 - if the asteroid were to collide with
89:53 - earth how likely do you think it would
89:54 - be to hit a city
89:56 - all right
89:58 - about as likely as a person being hit by
90:00 - lightning
90:01 - about as likely as an expecting mother
90:04 - having twin children
90:06 - about as likely as a person correctly
90:08 - guessing a six-sided die roll
90:11 - okay i really don't think it's the
90:13 - bottom like if you think about the
90:15 - surface area
90:17 - of the earth
90:19 - how much of that first of all so much of
90:21 - it is just ocean
90:22 - right
90:23 - then the parts that's not ocean how much
90:25 - of it is it
90:26 - is it
90:28 - is its city
90:29 - so i definitely think
90:33 - that
90:34 - um
90:35 - i'm seeing there's a question in the
90:36 - chat about why i don't interact with the
90:38 - chat i do my best
90:40 - i'm really trying to get
90:42 - some someday i'll have this all worked
90:44 - out but i'm doing my best but yes the
90:46 - chat is not my my primarily primary
90:48 - point of focus
90:49 - i mean
90:50 - i want to say like
90:53 - it's probably the hit by lightning i
90:55 - don't you know
90:58 - maybe it's twix how often what are what
91:00 - is the what is the probability of having
91:02 - twins i don't know it's certainly one of
91:03 - these two what do you all think i'm
91:05 - looking at the chat
91:10 - to see i'm just gonna go with
91:12 - i'm gonna go with lightning
91:18 - by the end of the lesson we'll find out
91:19 - which answer was correct
91:21 - all right
91:22 - well clearly it's more likely to strike
91:23 - land i think that's right you can't hit
91:26 - a city oh canada city without also
91:28 - hitting land okay
91:30 - so that's true so uh okay so that was
91:33 - obvious i the question kind of tricked
91:34 - me because i sort of thought of it as
91:36 - city or non-city again this is why i
91:38 - like these and i haven't done this
91:39 - course before i specifically waited to
91:41 - do this with you live so i could
91:43 - embarrass myself fully in front of you
91:45 - all
91:46 - um
91:47 - the map shows the distribution of land
91:49 - and water okay so let's use it to
91:52 - estimate the probability that asteroid
91:53 - hits land
91:55 - it's less likely that's that to me with
91:58 - this by the way this is really
91:59 - interesting to look at this uh
92:01 - perspective view most of the times that
92:04 - we look at maps and this is i've talked
92:06 - about in other videos like mercator
92:07 - projection different kinds of ways of
92:09 - taking this the earth that is a sphere
92:11 - and turning it into a flat map really
92:13 - distorts the relative scale
92:16 - but
92:16 - looks like this view is doing a fairly
92:18 - accurate job but
92:19 - regardless i can see that it's more less
92:21 - likely to hit land
92:23 - okay less of the earth's surface is
92:25 - covered by land than by water okay
92:27 - that's right so let's keep going
92:29 - all right
92:30 - now imagine reshaping the areas covered
92:32 - by land and water a pair of rectangles
92:34 - uh this is cool see
92:35 - like i
92:36 - my instinct when i see these things is
92:38 - like oh i want to make this in p5
92:40 - uh
92:41 - okay so this is cool
92:43 - adjust the divider so i'm gonna say
92:47 - this
92:48 - too much water okay
92:50 - uh
92:51 - correct 70 okay
92:54 - 30 covered by land
92:57 - there is a one out of three chance that
92:58 - the asteroid hits land
93:01 - um okay all cities are on land
93:06 - to find the property event identified on
93:07 - a grid of all outcomes the probability
93:09 - of n is the area of the event divided by
93:10 - the area of entire grid that totally
93:12 - makes sense
93:14 - um
93:16 - so let's look at that likely the
93:17 - asterisk hit some particular country if
93:19 - we know it hits land
93:21 - so
93:22 - russia covers 11 of all land so it's 11
93:25 - of the 30
93:27 - i think i might have been wrong here but
93:29 - let's see 11
93:30 - canada 6 china 6
93:33 - so
93:34 - russia being the largest we would say
93:36 - that it's most likely to be hit
93:40 - correct by the way one of the really
93:41 - nice things about brilliant also is i
93:42 - can um
93:44 - see these uh explanations as well and
93:46 - that one was fairly intuitive for me so
93:48 - i don't but many a time i'm checking oh
93:50 - and i have a hint
93:51 - since an earthbound asteroid is more
93:53 - likely to hit russia
93:56 - and india we can also estimate how much
93:58 - more likely
94:00 - uh so how much more likely is the
94:02 - asteroid to hit russia than india well
94:04 - if russia is 11 and india
94:07 - is 2 wouldn't it be 5 times more likely
94:10 - because 2 times 5 is 10.
94:15 - i hope that's right i could look at the
94:16 - hint
94:17 - correct okay i got it right
94:20 - we saw earlier that the asteroid hits a
94:22 - city with a probability of 30 percent by
94:25 - now we know probability equals relative
94:27 - area we can get much better estimate by
94:28 - finding earth's total urban area okay
94:32 - okay this nighttime view of the
94:33 - mediterranean sea oh
94:36 - cities show up and since they're
94:37 - brightly lit oh that's a lot more city
94:39 - than i thought
94:42 - that's more city than i saw just looking
94:44 - at this sort of european area
94:46 - what kind of land are the vast majority
94:48 - of cities located near water okay
94:52 - um
94:53 - okay
94:54 - uh coastal it turns out ten percent of
94:56 - all land on earth is coastal
95:00 - so
95:02 - being struck by lightning is exceedingly
95:04 - rare i think it must be the twins
95:06 - the twins thing but i think my instinct
95:08 - was wrong
95:10 - so 10 of the land is coastal land
95:14 - is that the green land i'm confused
95:20 - uh are the yellow i'm confused seventy
95:22 - percent is
95:25 - is that what i want i want it the other
95:27 - is green coastal
95:29 - too much coast no the other way around
95:30 - okay right the yellow is coastal i guess
95:32 - i should have gotten that
95:34 - okay correct
95:37 - splitting all land area into coast and
95:39 - inland gives us three regions
95:43 - got it
95:44 - ten percent
95:47 - ninety percent
95:49 - all right what's the probability that
95:51 - the asteroid strikes coastal land the
95:53 - strip of land that touches water
95:55 - okay so it's ten percent of thirty
95:58 - percent that should be three percent
96:00 - right
96:02 - three percent well okay you i definitely
96:05 - do not have a three percent chance of
96:06 - being struck by lightning
96:08 - but i think that's probably that sounds
96:10 - like about the probability for twins
96:14 - but maybe cities aren't all the coast
96:16 - i'm not sure
96:18 - since only three percent of the
96:20 - probably ask him to coastline is three
96:21 - percent
96:22 - okay the vast majority of cities are in
96:25 - coastal lands probability of a city
96:27 - impact should be no greater than three
96:28 - percent
96:31 - what information would let us add cities
96:33 - to the grid
96:34 - the total number of cities on earth
96:37 - the total number of coastal cities on
96:39 - earth the percentage of earth's coastal
96:41 - land area that's covered by cities
96:47 - well
96:52 - i would say the last one
96:55 - uh
96:58 - yeah everyone's uh
97:00 - um i want to say this let's look at the
97:02 - hint i feel like i need a hint here
97:04 - which would be easier to represent on a
97:06 - grid a number of cities or a percentage
97:08 - of land yes definitely a percentage of
97:10 - land
97:11 - so i was right because these are we
97:12 - useful to know the total number of
97:14 - cities but that that doesn't really give
97:16 - us any sense of like how much land
97:19 - they're taking up because how big are
97:21 - the cities except there could be a
97:22 - million cities if they're all like tiny
97:24 - tiny cities that would be much less than
97:27 - um
97:28 - you know 100 000 super big cities okay
97:32 - correct okay
97:35 - turns out that ten percent of all
97:37 - coastal land is covered by cities
97:39 - so it means it can spit up close to land
97:41 - and strip into two regions
97:44 - so ten percent of three percent is point
97:46 - three percent
97:48 - and that's sounding much more like
97:50 - probability of having twins
97:53 - yeah uh again like if there's a point
97:55 - three percent chance of being struck by
97:57 - lightning
97:58 - i don't know if that's in your lifetime
97:59 - or on any given day i don't that's that
98:01 - would obviously be there'd be a slight
98:03 - but i think it's so remote that almost
98:05 - that doesn't there's probably not that
98:06 - much of a distinction between those two
98:11 - having twins okay
98:13 - so i definitely got it wrong i don't
98:15 - know i i felt like so sometimes i have
98:16 - this instinct does that mean where i
98:18 - feel like i'm trying to be i'm trying to
98:19 - be tricked by the question
98:21 - so to me it seemed like the obvious
98:22 - answer was having twins but i thought i
98:24 - was trying to be tricked by the question
98:26 - so i i got afraid and slowly went by
98:28 - struck by lightning but obviously
98:30 - um if uh what i what i love about this
98:33 - lesson first of all is that i got it
98:34 - wrong and the steps really made it
98:35 - obvious how to think think this through
98:37 - so that was great
98:38 - um
98:40 - okay review and reflect
98:44 - uh puzzling
98:45 - result from medicine so actually i
98:48 - wonder if
98:49 - um
98:51 - look at me on my six day streak um
98:55 - people people there's lots of excellent
98:57 - feedback in the chat so you know the
98:58 - idea of this problem by the way is not
99:00 - really to get into the nitty-gritty of
99:03 - actual like sort of asteroid behavior
99:07 - it's more of a thought experiment of
99:09 - this very like sort of constrained
99:10 - scoped problem of all there happens to
99:12 - be an asteroid
99:13 - going towards earth it has an equal
99:15 - probability of hitting any given like
99:18 - latitude and longitude which may not
99:19 - actually be true based on like how the
99:21 - earth spins and all the gravitational
99:24 - stuff of all the things around it
99:26 - um but oh continue
99:29 - i didn't see that so um so i'm going to
99:32 - move on now but the reason why i'd
99:34 - really like this lesson thank you
99:37 - continue so this is really interesting
99:39 - um because i have a feeling and i um
99:42 - that this is leading towards bayesian
99:45 - probability so one of the
99:47 - most so i i in my video about the monty
99:50 - hall problem i tried to relate and you
99:53 - know we can see this still here
99:55 - um
99:56 - the monty hall problem
99:58 - to
99:59 - bayesian probability analysis and bayes
100:01 - theorem and i'm not going to rehash this
100:03 - right now but essentially this is bayes
100:06 - theorem and i was using various uh
100:09 - probability
100:11 - analyses of different pieces of the
100:13 - three-door problem to then calculate the
100:15 - probability that you will win if you
100:17 - switch doors which is two-thirds
100:19 - a much more common way
100:22 - to
100:23 - understand about bayes to to learn about
100:26 - bayesian probability
100:28 - analysis is to look at
100:31 - um
100:33 - the common scenario is looking at a
100:35 - medical testing so because one of the
100:37 - interesting things about a medical test
100:39 - you know testing like for example if we
100:40 - think about you know the the covid
100:42 - pandemic for example a coronavirus test
100:45 - is the tests aren't a hundred percent
100:47 - reliable right if i get
100:51 - a positive test
100:53 - saying i have covid well there's a high
100:56 - likelihood i really do have covid but
100:57 - there's a small there's a chance there
100:59 - that that was a false positive vice
101:01 - versa if the test is negative there's
101:03 - probably a higher chance of false false
101:05 - negative again you know don't quote me
101:07 - on these figures i'm not like i'm just
101:09 - talking about in the sort of abstract
101:11 - sense
101:12 - so
101:13 - getting a positive result
101:16 - uh is dependent
101:18 - one on the rate of false positives but
101:22 - not just that it also depends on like
101:25 - how common is having this disease or
101:28 - this uh i i've seen this done with
101:31 - different tests for cancer for example
101:34 - um so for example if if let's make up
101:36 - something like coding train
101:38 - illness
101:40 - coding trainingitis
101:41 - if you have coding if there's only a
101:44 - zero zero zero zero zero zero one
101:47 - percent chance you know one out of 100
101:48 - million people in the world ever get
101:50 - coding train itis
101:52 - we all have coding trainitis by the way
101:54 - it's just
101:55 - it makes your arms move around like a
101:57 - kind of a crazy person um
101:59 - so uh one out of uh you know hundreds of
102:02 - millions of people get it
102:04 - you know even if you get a positive test
102:06 - it's so unlikely that you would have it
102:09 - you know what's the rate of false
102:10 - positives that's all of those prior
102:13 - probabilities
102:14 - um are as well as the sort of event
102:17 - probabilities associated with taking the
102:19 - test are going to inform the actual
102:21 - likelihood that you actually have coding
102:23 - train itis so that was kind of a very
102:25 - cursive this is why like you listen to
102:26 - me talk about this and that was kind of
102:28 - a
102:29 - you know i would say a b minus
102:31 - explanation
102:32 - um but if i were i'm assuming that if i
102:34 - were to go on to complete this course um
102:37 - we're gonna start getting uh uh we're
102:40 - gonna be walked through how to learn
102:43 - about probability and thinking about
102:45 - real-world situations the chant the
102:47 - probability to chance affects the
102:49 - results of imperfect imperfect disease
102:52 - tests
102:54 - okay
102:55 - um alex is saying that pacific ocean is
102:57 - actually 35 so thank you for um thank
103:00 - you for brilliant for sponsoring the
103:02 - coding train today thank you
103:04 - to um all of you for watching the coding
103:06 - train in this sponsorship segment i
103:09 - really find that it just it works well
103:11 - because it's like i'm not even veering
103:13 - off my content because my content is
103:15 - working through these kinds of
103:16 - interesting probability problems and
103:17 - math problems and geometry problems and
103:20 - um these uh working through these always
103:22 - give me ideas for things to do in future
103:24 - coding videos and coding challenges so
103:26 - uh if you want to learn more about
103:28 - brilliant go to brilliant.org
103:29 - codingtrain you can sign up for free and
103:31 - get started um giving it a try that lets
103:34 - them know you found great from me and if
103:36 - you want to unlock everything that
103:38 - brilliant has to offer um you the first
103:41 - 200 people to do so will get 20 off the
103:43 - premium subscription um i'll also just
103:45 - point out that if you already have
103:46 - brilliant um
103:49 - you can gift a subscription which is a
103:50 - really nice thing to do for somebody you
103:53 - don't know what to get for them they
103:54 - seem to have everything but they like
103:55 - learning they don't want to give them
103:56 - like stuff that's more like plastic and
103:59 - all of that it just kind of goes into a
104:00 - landfill um here we go this is a great
104:03 - gift as well okay so i'm going to take
104:06 - like a less than
104:08 - three minute break
104:10 - i'm putting that never mind whenever i
104:12 - look at him stop in the middle but it's
104:13 - 12 45 already i'm gonna give myself to 1
104:15 - 30 and i'm going to come back and i'm
104:17 - going to start doing
104:18 - some um
104:22 - some uh basic programming in an emulator
104:25 - and maybe i'll move my camera to show
104:28 - you what's going on with my apple ii
104:29 - plus as well i'm gonna do that during
104:31 - the break um all right here we go into
104:36 - intermission land all right so you know
104:38 - i'm just going to put this on
104:39 - i'm going to be i'm going to hopefully
104:41 - be less than five minutes
104:43 - i wonder if i can i can't it's a video
104:45 - that plays it's not the timer's not
104:46 - dynamic so i'll be back in less than
104:48 - five minutes but i am giving myself five
104:49 - minutes
105:10 - do
105:20 - do
105:47 - so
106:46 - do
108:23 - do
108:41 - all right i'm going to switch the camera
108:45 - to
108:47 - this
108:48 - hopefully you're seeing the apple ii
108:50 - plus computer right now and hearing me
108:52 - okay
108:54 - i can fade out the music um
108:57 - let me bring
108:59 - so i can see the chat let me bring this
109:03 - ipad over here with me
109:09 - um
109:16 - oh no no no
109:20 - okay great
109:21 - all right hi everybody um
109:24 - hello camera so this is my um apple ii
109:28 - plus
109:29 - um that
109:30 - if you've been following my saga that
109:32 - i've been posting a bit on twitter about
109:35 - that um this is my um original uh
109:39 - childhood computer but it i did get it
109:42 - to work for about a half an hour when i
109:44 - first turned it on
109:46 - but i'm just gonna say hi hi um
109:49 - but uh since then uh
109:51 - um the power supply kind of
109:54 - the some of the capacitors in started to
109:57 - smoke and fry and so one of the things
109:59 - that i was able to do is i
110:01 - got this um
110:02 - let me see if i'm just going to move the
110:04 - camera down a little bit i can't so i'm
110:05 - not seeing a live picture of the camera
110:06 - so i don't know what i'm doing but this
110:08 - is a power supply that i got from a
110:10 - reactive micro
110:11 - um
110:12 - you know
110:13 - i don't know i know how well this is
110:15 - going to work just moving the camera
110:16 - around but um you can see it here um so
110:18 - this is a a rebuilt power supply so i
110:21 - have that now built um comes with a nice
110:23 - little fan
110:26 - and so
110:27 - oops
110:28 - so that works
110:29 - quite well
110:33 - and
110:34 - um
110:37 - um what i'm gonna do is turn it on
110:43 - and turn this on
110:46 - and um
110:48 - i then also had some problems with the
110:50 - logic board and this is actually
110:54 - not the original i took all the
110:56 - expansion cards out i tried to fix some
110:59 - things
111:00 - uh like remove some of these chips and
111:02 - like check connections and stuff and
111:04 - clean some things but i wasn't having
111:05 - luck i actually just bought a um
111:09 - a
111:09 - repaired logic board for an apple ii
111:11 - plus off of ebay and that's what's in
111:13 - here right now
111:14 - so um
111:17 - last i checked this was working
111:20 - but let's see what's happening here and
111:22 - this is the monitor
111:25 - which i don't think is going to work so
111:26 - what i'm going to do right now
111:28 - unfortunately my monitors also stopped
111:31 - working
111:32 - and i was told don't open up your
111:34 - monitor you you get electrocuted so what
111:37 - i'm gonna do right now is
111:39 - i'm going to plug in this video cable i
111:42 - have this like little
111:44 - ah there we go look
111:46 - so uh i don't know what you're seeing
111:48 - now
111:49 - um
111:51 - so i don't know why i'm seeing
111:52 - garbledness that's not a good sign
111:55 - ah there we go look at that apple two
111:58 - plus so things are
112:00 - working and
112:03 - i have a stand for this monitor and
112:05 - everything i just i should have
112:06 - i should have clearly gotten that ready
112:09 - um and
112:10 - i can
112:12 - type things like
112:14 - uh
112:16 - print
112:20 - now by the way i cleaned the keyboard
112:21 - spacebar i still can't get to work i
112:24 - don't know why i cleaned the keyboard
112:26 - and kind of like took it apart and
112:29 - um so the keyboard is working much
112:30 - better now print
112:33 - oops
112:40 - whoops
112:41 - choo choo
112:44 - so i've typed
112:46 - print choo choo
112:48 - and i'm going to hit enter
112:49 - and there we go we wrote some apple
112:50 - basic and there it is
112:53 - um
112:57 - uh
112:58 - i'm just looking at the chat right now
113:03 - so um
113:05 - so i'm trying to figure out what so next
113:07 - week i'm planning to shoot this uh
113:10 - create this course and i'm hopefully by
113:13 - this weekend i'm gonna have more time to
113:15 - work on seeing you know somebody told me
113:17 - just try banging on your mind
113:20 - uh maybe i'll buy another monitor off
113:22 - ebay maybe i'll just use this monitor
113:24 - um but i really want to get i really
113:26 - want to do the course on this actual
113:28 - computer but it is quite awkward
113:31 - especially right now for me to to do
113:33 - that so i just wanted to show this to
113:35 - you
113:36 - um
113:37 - i'm going to turn it off now
113:41 - and
113:42 - turn off the monitor
113:44 - and i am going to
113:46 - hi
113:47 - hello i'm going to go back to my
113:49 - computer
113:50 - and
113:52 - run an emulator to show you some of the
113:53 - basic stuff
113:55 - put the monitor in front of the keyboard
113:59 - what does that mean
114:04 - uh
114:06 - yeah chris is writing my grandfather has
114:09 - um an apple
114:11 - two he's keeping as his father's memoirs
114:13 - on the floppy disk so these drives do
114:16 - work
114:17 - um
114:18 - so
114:18 - if i can help you read some discs
114:21 - these drives work but i i don't know
114:23 - that i want to be responsible for
114:25 - some precious
114:27 - uh restoring some precious yes like that
114:29 - okay um
114:30 - oh the cameras wasn't on the monitor
114:32 - well so apologies um i'm to just leave
114:35 - the camera here
114:37 - and i'm going back to
114:38 - my computer
114:41 - let me bring
114:43 - this back with me
114:54 - okay so
114:56 - here i am
114:58 - my computer went to sleep
115:00 - um let's look for
115:11 - so this is one that um
115:13 - this is a great i'm gonna let's use this
115:14 - one
115:16 - because this is a true emulator
115:20 - let's see
115:26 - okay
115:31 - how do i get the dos prompt with this
115:36 - uh
115:38 - do i have to load something
115:43 - i want to load applesoft basic let's see
115:55 - beaglebasic i have the beaglebasic disks
115:58 - let's just go to blank blank to us
116:00 - okay
116:03 - okay great oh no that's not it
116:09 - oh
116:10 - that's what i want
116:24 - oh look at this just i haven't used this
116:26 - emulator before i was using a different
116:28 - emulator but i just found this one
116:38 - oops
116:42 - um
116:54 - i'm confused
116:56 - let's open up beagle basic
117:04 - i'm very confused by this emulator
117:09 - nobody wants to help me in the chat
117:14 - hold on let's
117:15 - uh let's keep looking
117:18 - uh
117:19 - i actually was using this really cool
117:21 - downloadable emulator
117:31 - yeah this is the one i was using
117:33 - this one's pretty wild okay let's try
117:35 - this
117:36 - um
117:41 - so i'm gonna run this emulator i like
117:43 - having it as a totally separate
117:46 - application
117:47 - and i'm sure that i'm gonna have to do
117:49 - this
118:00 - okay we want to do
118:02 - applesoft basic interpreter there we go
118:06 - perfect
118:08 - i'm going to put caps lock on all right
118:11 - we're in business here so let me go to
118:16 - apple basic
118:18 - reference
118:21 - okay this is a pretty good reference
118:25 - all right so i have been studying up on
118:27 - basic in the last couple of weeks so i
118:30 - uh but the one thing i didn't get a
118:31 - chance to experiment with yet is
118:34 - graphics mode and so uh i want to do
118:38 - some programming today
118:41 - in
118:43 - [Music]
118:46 - i want to do some programming today
118:48 - using graphics mode so let's just get
118:50 - started by writing a pro so the way you
118:52 - write a program in basic is you have to
118:54 - give line numbers and um i'm gonna so
118:56 - i'm gonna create line number ten i'm
118:58 - just gonna call home so home is a
119:00 - command by the way that clears the
119:02 - screen
119:03 - if i type list it's going to show me
119:05 - what's in my program if i try run it's
119:08 - going to run my program so
119:10 - um actually we should do 10 print let's
119:12 - try to get 10 print going so if you're
119:14 - so uh let's actually let's do ten print
119:17 - ten print uh coding train so if you
119:20 - remember
119:22 - and this is gonna go to the old website
119:23 - but that's fine um
119:27 - this uh video that i did to create the
119:29 - 10 print algorithm in p5.js using canvas
119:32 - and drawing 10 print comes from the old
119:35 - commodore 64. this famous one line of
119:37 - code that either prints a random forward
119:40 - slash or a backward slash and when you
119:42 - layer that line by line by line it ends
119:44 - up creating this maze pattern
119:46 - so
119:49 - i know that i could say line 20 print
119:54 - slash
119:55 - so if i were to run this program it's
119:57 - going to clear the screen and print a
119:59 - slash and then if i were to say line 30
120:02 - print
120:05 - forward slash
120:08 - then i could say i could
120:11 - run the program let's look at the
120:12 - program again i'm printing
120:14 - backslash and forward slash i could run
120:16 - the program
120:18 - and i wonder if this is big enough for
120:20 - everybody i should maybe zoom in on it
120:22 - and i get backslash and forward slash
120:24 - now
120:25 - how do i print them without the line
120:27 - break if i want multiple calls to print
120:30 - this i actually don't know
120:33 - um
120:40 - so the question is so
120:43 - let's see what happens if
120:46 - i just now add line 40 and i say go to
120:49 - 20.
120:50 - so go to this is like one of the
120:53 - wonderful things about old-timey basic
120:55 - programming
120:56 - is
120:57 - when you get to
121:00 - um
121:02 - the way that you control the flow of a
121:03 - program is by actually referencing
121:05 - specific line numbers so this is now
121:07 - going to be essentially an infinite loop
121:10 - where it's going to clear the screen
121:13 - print backslash print forward slash go
121:15 - to 20.
121:17 - and so now i'm going to hit
121:18 - run
121:20 - and we can see now how would i get it to
121:22 - do that though without the line breaks
121:25 - semicolon at the end i'm being told now
121:27 - i need to control c
121:29 - we'll quit the program
121:32 - so um
121:36 - so if i change it to print
121:39 - forward slash
121:40 - semicolon
121:43 - 30 print
121:45 - backslash
121:49 - semicolon and now run it
121:51 - there we go okay so this is now but i'm
121:54 - obviously not picking them randomly
121:57 - so how do i pick them randomly well
122:00 - there is an r d function in basic
122:04 - um
122:07 - so i know and if somebody in the chat i
122:08 - think just put it in there this could
122:10 - certainly be done the whole point of the
122:12 - whole sort of conceit of the 10 print
122:14 - program is you do it in one line of code
122:16 - but i am going to attempt
122:19 - to do it so written in a lengthier way
122:22 - so the first thing that i want to do is
122:25 - store a random number so i'm going to
122:28 - add a line of code the reason why i let
122:30 - numbered them 10 20 30 40. so i know i
122:32 - knew the line of code needs to go
122:33 - between 10 and 20. so i'm going to make
122:35 - that 15.
122:37 - and i'm going to say let r equal rnd
122:40 - one and i believe
122:43 - um if i were to say print r and d one
122:46 - right you can see it's giving me a
122:48 - random number
122:50 - between zero and one
122:55 - so there already is built into even
122:57 - apple soft basic a random number
123:00 - generator
123:02 - so looking at the program
123:04 - i get this
123:06 - r value which equals random one so now i
123:08 - want to say
123:11 - i'm going to say line
123:12 - uh 16
123:14 - [Music]
123:16 - if
123:20 - r is greater than 0.5
123:23 - then go to
123:24 - 30.
123:26 - so um so basically what i'm doing is
123:29 - this is a very awkward clunky way of
123:30 - doing it but this is fun
123:32 - if
123:37 - if the number is greater than 0.5
123:40 - that's a 50 chance of that skip all the
123:42 - way to line 30
123:44 - which will say
123:46 - print the forward slash
123:49 - now if that's not the case it's not
123:51 - going to go to 30 so it's going to go on
123:53 - to line 20 and print the backslash
123:55 - so then at 25 i should say go to 40.
123:59 - right if we look at this program now
124:01 - this is so wonky but basically i'm
124:04 - saying pick a random number
124:06 - i can zoom into this so i can gesture to
124:07 - a little bit pick a random number if
124:10 - that random is greater than 0.5
124:12 - then skip here to do backslash then we
124:14 - get to here
124:16 - and we go to line oh we don't want to go
124:17 - to line 20. line 40 needs to go back to
124:20 - line 15 now
124:21 - so 40 has to be go to line 15
124:26 - right so
124:27 - if r
124:28 - is greater than 0.5
124:31 - go to print the backslash then
124:33 - get another number if it's not greater
124:36 - than 0.5 we're going to sorry print the
124:38 - forward slash if it's not greater than
124:40 - 0.5 we're going to print the backslash
124:42 - and then i guess this could actually
124:43 - just say go to 15 but i kind of like the
124:45 - idea of like skipping this line because
124:48 - what if there are other things that were
124:49 - supposed to happen
124:50 - so
124:51 - now i am going to run this program
124:56 - and here we go it is
125:00 - ten
125:04 - print oh this is so awesome i didn't
125:07 - realize how happy this was going to make
125:08 - me i think i'd done i should have done
125:10 - that as a coding challenge make a little
125:12 - video i'm going to do apple basic coding
125:14 - challenges um
125:15 - after next week
125:22 - oh my god so fun first of all also like
125:24 - i don't know if you'd see this but i
125:25 - just love the sort of zoomed in look of
125:27 - these
125:28 - these little like rectangular pixels
125:31 - um just so
125:32 - lovely
125:34 - all right so
125:36 - there's so much more i could do with
125:38 - this and demonstrate
125:41 - but i wanted to look at the thing and
125:42 - i've been working with apple basic a lot
125:44 - in the last week
125:46 - but i wanted to look at graphics mode
125:47 - and just see how that was
125:49 - so um
125:52 - can i save this somehow
125:56 - uh save
125:58 - ten print
126:00 - dot
126:01 - what was the there was a a file
126:03 - extension for a basic program i don't
126:05 - remember what it is but now i'm going to
126:06 - do type txt
126:10 - did that actually save it somewhere
126:16 - today 107. yeah
126:18 - yeah look at that i don't know where
126:20 - this is on my computer
126:22 - but that's cool it saved it somewhere
126:25 - i i'll figure out where local tender
126:27 - it's probably just in like a
126:29 - default directory i guess
126:31 - if i were to go to
126:33 - i'm just curious where did it save it
126:43 - coding train micro m810 print.txt
126:46 - awesome that's really cool so i could if
126:49 - i were to say new
126:50 - new is a command that clears your
126:52 - program
126:53 - so there's no problem can i say load ten
126:55 - print
126:56 - dot txt
126:58 - load 10 print dot txt
127:02 - oh man
127:05 - i'm i think to be honest i think what
127:07 - i'm probably going to end up doing
127:10 - is using the computer more as a prop
127:12 - than doing the actual coding more on an
127:15 - emulator
127:16 - um dot um
127:19 - uh
127:20 - so
127:21 - i also um but what i was gonna say is
127:28 - the one that i was using
127:30 - is not a true emulator from what i
127:32 - understand
127:34 - is it this one
127:36 - no yeah this one so this is one that i
127:39 - was using which is really fun because um
127:42 - like it's a little bit easier because i
127:43 - can just sort of like type
127:45 - i have basically access to a more like
127:47 - modern text editor
127:49 - and um so for example now if i were to
127:52 - go and grab this code here paste it in
127:54 - here and hit run
127:56 - like i've got the program running here
127:58 - but it's quite a bit easier for me to
128:00 - like mess around with it you know i
128:02 - could say like oh let's change this to
128:03 - 0.75
128:05 - and now i'm much more likely to have the
128:06 - forward slash
128:08 - et cetera et cetera by the way one thing
128:10 - that i found interesting is that there's
128:13 - no native apple basic delay function and
128:17 - the way that you would write a delay
128:18 - function i'm going to show you
128:20 - is uh let's let's make 45
128:24 - go to 15
128:25 - i'm gonna say four
128:28 - um
128:29 - i i forget i forget
128:34 - equals one two
128:36 - five thousand
128:39 - next uh
128:42 - next i
128:43 - so the way to do a delay is just to
128:45 - build into your code like a loop where
128:47 - nothing happens so let's just see what
128:49 - this does
128:51 - right so now i have like this slight
128:53 - delay that's doing them just like line
128:55 - by line but i look there's no weight
128:57 - there's no sleep nothing like that an
128:59 - apple basic
129:00 - i think this is actually weirdly enough
129:02 - the standard way to do it also i should
129:04 - point out then this is what i can do i
129:06 - can also make like
129:08 - i can put this as a function now it's
129:10 - not really a function but i can take
129:11 - this line of code and put it at like
129:13 - line 1000 then i can add a return
129:16 - statement right after it
129:18 - and so
129:19 - now i can use the go sub
129:22 - go sub is like a way of calling a
129:24 - function go to a subroutine this is a
129:26 - subroutine with line numbers much higher
129:28 - later
129:30 - that i can run this code and then return
129:32 - will send me back so this if i just
129:34 - wanted to make it a slight delay let's
129:36 - change it to 500
129:39 - this would work
129:40 - pretty interesting stuff huh so i would
129:42 - love to build out like full projects
129:46 - with
129:48 - with apple basic
129:50 - okay
129:53 - [Music]
129:57 - so
129:58 - now what did i want to do i wanted to
130:00 - look at and i'm going to take a little
130:02 - bit of time here
130:03 - to look at
130:05 - the graphics mode
130:08 - so let's see let's use this
130:11 - gr
130:12 - set display to mixed test low resolution
130:16 - graphics
130:17 - clear to black
130:21 - so
130:22 - oh
130:24 - um so let's try and can i make this
130:27 - bigger well yeah i can i should have
130:29 - just done that in the first place
130:33 - okay so let's try
130:35 - saying by the way i think no let's try
130:37 - saying 10
130:38 - home
130:39 - 20 gr
130:42 - oh let me let me say a new program
130:47 - there's nothing in there right now i'm
130:49 - going to say 10 home 20 gr
130:53 - and then let's try just doing
130:59 - a
131:00 - point
131:03 - zero to thirty nine
131:05 - oh is it forty by forty
131:08 - color equals
131:10 - color i don't have color here
131:12 - let's try just doing
131:14 - plot
131:16 - uh 10
131:18 - oh do i do this plot 10 comma 10.
131:24 - plot expects two or three parameters at
131:27 - line
131:29 - 30.
131:36 - oh the graphics mode is still in there
131:38 - how do i get out of graphics mode
131:42 - ooh that's not what i meant to do
131:48 - uh
131:50 - how do you exit graphics mode
132:06 - another reference
132:12 - oh
132:12 - peek and poke i remember those
132:15 - plot graphics
132:17 - oh this is more stuff
132:21 - uh
132:26 - um
132:30 - okay
132:32 - uh clears text mode
132:36 - so maybe i do that
132:38 - so like
132:41 - ah yes whoa that's cool
132:45 - okay
132:46 - so i lost my code
132:48 - gr
132:52 - plot oh plot no parentheses
132:55 - plot
132:57 - uh 10 comma 10.
132:59 - oh 20.
133:01 - oh wait can i just hold on a second
133:06 - so let's just
133:07 - so one of the nice things about apple
133:09 - basic is i can just i don't need to
133:11 - write it as a program so i'm just
133:12 - putting this off to the side
133:14 - i can just write the commands now can
133:16 - you see this in the bottom here okay so
133:18 - let's try doing plot
133:25 - i don't see anything let's try the line
133:28 - h line
133:33 - from 0 to 40
133:35 - at 10.
133:38 - oh i have to set a color
133:40 - maybe it's like black
133:46 - ah whoa
133:51 - cool
133:58 - ah
133:59 - i see
134:03 - h plot
134:07 - plots a dot what is the difference
134:08 - between h plot and plot
134:14 - h plot x one y one two x two y two
134:24 - whoops i think i crashed it
134:37 - whoa
134:38 - yeah each plot is not where it's
134:40 - crashing it
134:43 - that's interesting
134:46 - i was going to try to do like um
134:51 - um i was going to i was going to try to
134:53 - make a little like snake game like thing
134:56 - so let's just do 10 let's try writing
134:58 - this program 10
135:00 - gr
135:02 - 20 let
135:03 - x equal 10
135:05 - 30
135:06 - let y equal 10
135:10 - um
135:13 - 40
135:14 - um
135:17 - well let's let's do a random walk
135:20 - x equals x plus r and d
135:23 - 1
135:28 - minus
135:29 - 0.5 oh no r and d times 2
135:32 - minus 1.
135:35 - y equals y
135:37 - plus r and d
135:40 - times 2 minus 1.
135:44 - 60
135:45 - color equals i'm just going to do 1
135:48 - because i don't know what else to do and
135:50 - then 70 is plot now let's see if it can
135:53 - handle floating points and just like
135:55 - take off the decimal point
135:58 - and then 80 would be
136:00 - go to
136:02 - 40.
136:06 - all right
136:07 - should we give this a try
136:10 - anybody see anything i got wrong
136:17 - what happens when it goes off
136:26 - this is wild
136:28 - it's somehow like
136:31 - cycling around the edges automatically
136:35 - that is crazy okay
136:38 - how do i clear
136:40 - uh
136:43 - clear there must be like a hole clear
136:51 - full screen graphics
136:54 - mixed mode color on the screen
136:57 - oh you can actually get the pixel color
136:59 - at a given pixel that's wild
137:03 - um
137:04 - set the rotation to x for shape drawing
137:09 - do i have shape drawing
137:13 - so i don't believe
137:16 - i don't believe the argument i'm passing
137:18 - into rand is actually the range
137:21 - um let's look at the rand function
137:24 - i haven't gone through this in a lot of
137:25 - detail let's see if we can find it this
137:28 - is the actual documentation here if x is
137:31 - greater than zero a random number
137:33 - between zero and one
137:34 - if x equals zero repeats the last random
137:37 - number
137:38 - and if x is less than zero begins new
137:41 - repeatable sequence so the argument is
137:43 - more about seeding the random
137:46 - the random value
137:48 - oh look i have math functions
137:54 - so the other thing i wanted to do is so
137:56 - let's
137:59 - let's go back
138:00 - to um
138:02 - so i wanted to see if i could get
138:04 - keyboard control
138:06 - so i believe
138:08 - oops do not want to print
138:14 - i i see remember peak
138:16 - is a way to look at the value in a given
138:19 - memory address
138:21 - and there is a memory address for the
138:23 - last key pressed i believe
138:26 - so
138:27 - [Music]
138:28 - peak apple
138:30 - basic
138:31 - key
138:32 - press
138:38 - uh
138:42 - whoa
138:45 - there's actually a
138:56 - um
138:58 - i've seen when i was looking the other
139:00 - day i saw in a manual
139:05 - a page that described
139:10 - oh tetris for apple basic that would be
139:12 - fun to try
139:14 - um
139:20 - oh so i'm just taking a peek i'm taking
139:22 - a peek at the chat
139:24 - uh
139:26 - applesoft is what i'm looking for
139:32 - this is what i was looking at maybe
139:37 - the big tip book the funny thing is i
139:38 - have manuals for apple basic and stuff
139:40 - just sitting over there
139:42 - i'm
139:43 - uh
139:44 - somewhere was it in this book
139:48 - there was like a chart for peak and poke
139:50 - well this is wild
140:00 - i mean really like
140:02 - in the dawn of personal computers you
140:05 - you had to programming was the whole
140:07 - point yeah look at this the lay loops
140:10 - look
140:13 - your apple doesn't mind in fact it's
140:15 - good for him slash her i think them
140:17 - would be the would be more appropriate
140:19 - okay
140:20 - print peek 51
140:23 - what language you're using okay
140:28 - oh i need to go sub poker
140:31 - integer basic i want to
140:33 - [Music]
140:37 - uh
140:38 - memory and speed
140:42 - look at this
140:44 - this is incredible
140:46 - oh i need to read this whole thing
140:56 - look at this tip
140:58 - clear mem
141:01 - i'm expander
141:03 - like right i mean there's like literally
141:05 - 48 kilobytes
141:07 - of ram
141:08 - oh that apple 2 plus
141:11 - you know this computer has what eight
141:13 - eight gigabytes of ram
141:15 - 80 columns okay
141:17 - 40 columns this is for the text
141:20 - um
141:25 - too long i'm like
141:28 - text tips
141:31 - page inverse inverse typer
141:35 - input oh right input a oh that's fun
141:38 - to reverse what you type in that would
141:39 - that's a fun little challenge
141:42 - text screen
141:47 - um
141:49 - peak 49152
142:00 - yeah
142:01 - this is the old 49512
142:12 - let's see it read slot regain paddle
142:14 - toggle speaker
142:16 - read keyboard here it is
142:19 - if 127 the key has been pressed okay
142:22 - four nine five one two
142:24 - so
142:26 - uh
142:30 - so 40 will be i'm going to say
142:34 - let's c
142:38 - equal peak
142:40 - 49512
142:44 - um
142:45 - [Music]
142:47 - and then actually so let's
142:50 - let's do this um hold on ctrl c well
142:53 - that's fine put it in there
142:54 - um
142:56 - 50 print
143:02 - c so that's fine i'm just plotting it
143:06 - just should be printing over and over
143:07 - again what key was pressed let's see
143:11 - a
143:13 - b
143:13 - [Music]
143:16 - why am i only getting 136.
143:36 - one five not five one
143:39 - what was it
143:41 - four nine one five two no wonder
143:48 - thank you
143:50 - 32
143:52 - yeah okay
143:53 - now we get different numbers
143:55 - there's no reason why i can't convert
143:57 - that into a character
144:06 - and i should be able to say
144:08 - let's see now a string
144:11 - in apple b in basic you have to indicate
144:14 - the type of what's in the variable by so
144:16 - i can have c would be the number
144:18 - and this would be i believe there's a
144:20 - function yeah it's actually filling this
144:21 - in for me
144:23 - where i can do this
144:24 - but i think i need to subtract 127 from
144:27 - it well let's not bother to try let's
144:29 - just see what happens first
144:31 - um
144:34 - so now
144:36 - um
144:37 - 55 is
144:42 - um print
144:45 - let's print that
144:52 - all right so i have an x and a y
144:56 - i'm peeking out what's in the keyboard
144:58 - converting it to a character
145:00 - and again there's a lot of wasted memory
145:02 - here so but i'm just writing out the
145:04 - long printing it out and plotting x
145:07 - so let's run this now k a
145:10 - b c d e f g h i j k l n n o p perfect
145:16 - i don't know why i saw that somewhere i
145:18 - was looking at some examples they were
145:20 - subtracting 127 but maybe that was
145:22 - doing like lower lowercase or something
145:23 - okay so now
145:25 - oh what are the arrow keys oh this is a
145:28 - problem if i want to use the arrow keys
145:33 - i'm not seeing anything here u
145:36 - k
145:37 - j
145:38 - this is weird well let's just use wasd
145:42 - i'm going to do that
145:45 - okay so um i keep having clear which
145:48 - doesn't do anything
145:52 - so now what i want to do is say
145:57 - 56 if
145:59 - c
146:01 - equals a
146:03 - then x equals x plus 1.
146:06 - no no x minus 1.
146:11 - 57 if c
146:13 - equals d
146:15 - then x equals x plus 1.
146:20 - 58
146:22 - if c this is very bad that i'm how i'm
146:24 - doing this c equals w
146:26 - then y equals y minus 1. i assume
146:31 - it counts from top to bottom just like
146:33 - modern graphics windows
146:35 - if c
146:38 - equals
146:40 - s
146:43 - then y equals y plus 1.
146:48 - all right
146:50 - um
146:51 - so
146:52 - i start at 10 comma 10
146:54 - i look at what's in the keyboard convert
146:56 - it to a character
146:58 - and then i'm checking if i do a d wrs
147:02 - and then changing the x and y values
147:04 - accordingly
147:05 - okay
147:08 - old school is z x for left right and p l
147:11 - for up down yeah
147:13 - so let's do this
147:18 - now
147:22 - why is this not working
147:26 - okay
147:27 - we gotta debug
147:42 - um
147:43 - okay i have an idea
148:09 - so i'm going to debug by printing both
148:11 - what's in c and the value
148:14 - of the boolean
148:16 - expression
148:19 - c
148:20 - equals the boolean test i don't think
148:22 - there's any double equals in old timey
148:24 - basic
148:27 - oh
148:28 - whoops
148:32 - what just happened here
148:35 - i'm so confused
148:47 - hold on this is why i want to use that
148:49 - other emulator because ah
148:52 - let me just try something here
148:55 - will you please let me copy paste this
148:58 - no it won't let's do save
149:06 - uh
149:10 - i'm setting c to a i don't think so
149:19 - there is no
149:21 - there is no a boolean expression oh but
149:24 - the printing
149:25 - might not work because i've done this
149:30 - that's not true
149:35 - that's true
149:56 - so this is what i'm doing in the code i
149:59 - want to print the value of the variable
150:00 - test
150:02 - and the colon allows me to do oh
150:05 - not colon semicolon semicolon
150:09 - colon
150:11 - allows me to put so that is setting c
150:14 - equal to a
150:16 - so that definitely was setting c equal
150:18 - to a
150:19 - this is what i meant to do
150:21 - a1 ah
150:25 - so this should be
150:26 - print c
150:29 - semicolon a space
150:32 - semicolon
150:34 - c
150:35 - equals a
150:38 - all right now this i should be able to
150:40 - debug
150:43 - yes
150:45 - huh
150:48 - so it
150:49 - seems to be now it seems to be working
150:52 - uh
150:54 - but i
150:58 - i'm so confused
151:03 - yeah yeah yeah
151:05 - yeah if you're constantly reading the
151:06 - last key pressed
151:10 - yeah i wonder if
151:13 - it makes sense for me to
151:18 - um
151:26 - only do it if there's a new i have an
151:28 - idea oh this is so
151:31 - so crazy
151:35 - what if unfortunately i could put a
151:36 - delay in there but i have a weird idea
151:39 - what if i were to say
151:42 - let's say 35
151:44 - let
151:47 - i know what to call this i'm going to
151:48 - call it direction
151:52 - and i'm going to set it equal to
151:54 - just
151:56 - zero
151:57 - so i'm going to start with a direction
151:59 - of zero
152:01 - and i'm going to say
152:06 - after i read the character and let's
152:09 - just change 40 to be let c
152:12 - equal cr hr string
152:15 - peak
152:16 - 4
152:17 - 4
152:18 - 4 9 1 5 2. so there was really no reason
152:21 - for me to have line 40 and 50. i could
152:24 - do it all at once
152:29 - so line 50 can now be
152:32 - if
152:35 - c
152:39 - is
152:40 - equal
152:43 - to the direction
152:47 - then
152:48 - set the direction
152:52 - back equal to
152:54 - zero
152:56 - so like
152:57 - oops
152:59 - i'm sort of thinking this through as i'm
153:01 - doing it
153:03 - so i want to do something where if the
153:06 - character is what it was last
153:09 - then direction is zero
153:12 - and then i can say
153:18 - um
153:21 - go to
153:26 - let's do 55 go to
153:29 - 56.
153:32 - uh
153:35 - all right
153:36 - so
153:38 - i'm starting with the direction and then
153:42 - but
153:44 - oh
153:45 - oh no no no no
153:47 - [Music]
153:51 - no no no no
153:52 - do i need to go sub can i do two things
153:54 - with a then
153:56 - i think i can like can i say
153:59 - if c
154:00 - is equal to dir
154:03 - if it's the same then
154:06 - oh why don't i just go to
154:09 - just skip go to line 80 like don't draw
154:11 - anything new
154:13 - just skip everything that's fine
154:15 - and then
154:16 - 55 i want to say
154:19 - dir
154:22 - equals
154:25 - c
154:26 - so get the new thing
154:30 - and then oh i should have i already have
154:32 - to rewrite all these lines of code
154:37 - oh that's terrible see this is
154:39 - my kingdom for a code editor
154:41 - if dir dollar sign
154:45 - equals a
154:51 - hold on let me just look at this and see
154:53 - if this is right
154:55 - so i'm starting at 10 comma 10 and i'm
154:58 - starting with don't move anywhere then
155:00 - i'm going to read
155:02 - the current character if it's a new
155:04 - character then set that to its direction
155:07 - execute the move
155:09 - plot the thing
155:10 - go back to read another character now if
155:12 - it's the same character it's going to
155:14 - skip
155:15 - okay i think this is right so i just
155:17 - think unfortunately
155:19 - i have to the way i wrote this
155:24 - there's got to be a different way of
155:26 - doing this but
155:39 - and y equals y minus 1.
155:44 - i hate that i have no
155:46 - lines left in between if d i r equals
155:51 - s
155:52 - then y
156:01 - am i missing a parenthesis on lines 56
156:04 - to 59
156:05 - no there are no parentheses around
156:08 - boolean expressions in basic
156:10 - and also like why
156:13 - no this does nothing i guess i just i
156:16 - just the lines of code are too long
156:19 - um
156:23 - okay
156:28 - wait i need some debugging
156:33 - uh
156:37 - so what do i need to do i want to
156:43 - line 45
156:45 - print
156:47 - what it's reading
156:52 - and
156:53 - let's print
156:54 - that and
156:56 - d
156:59 - this is what it's reading
157:01 - and this is the current value of dir
157:09 - so it's reading d
157:11 - and it is d
157:22 - but why is nothing moving
157:34 - oh
157:44 - there should be
157:48 - yeah i'm busy
157:56 - once i get a new character
157:59 - it should go do the things all right
158:01 - let's
158:03 - let's
158:04 - i just want to like enter in 45
158:09 - um
158:10 - how do i delete a line can i just do
158:11 - this
158:14 - 45 is gone now
158:16 - let's print
158:22 - um
158:26 - let's print do we ever get here
158:36 - do we ever get here
158:42 - do we ever get to the point
158:46 - we should as soon as we get a character
158:47 - that's new we should get
158:54 - there yeah
159:00 - okay so every time we type in a new
159:02 - character i'm seeing the old let's be
159:04 - methodical about this
159:06 - a
159:07 - b
159:08 - c
159:09 - d e f that makes sense
159:12 - c d uh every time i k um
159:16 - oh hold on why is this
159:19 - this is backwards
159:21 - use ren to renumber the program
159:25 - oh
159:27 - your character quality check
159:30 - yeah the character oh maybe the
159:31 - character equality check isn't right
159:34 - okay hold on
159:36 - hold on
159:38 - ah no oh no i lost it i lost it i typed
159:42 - exit just like instinctually
159:44 - and i hadn't saved it it just like quit
159:47 - oh my god i lost all my code
159:51 - right
159:52 - it's gone completely gone
159:57 - oh it's like i'm like i don't know why i
159:59 - typed that it was just like it came out
160:00 - of my brain
160:03 - okay hold on
160:05 - uh
160:08 - wait i don't know why we're converting a
160:10 - key press to a character
160:13 - yeah
160:15 - because i don't want to have to like
160:17 - check the number
160:20 - oh that's why there's -127
160:25 - maybe
160:26 - i didn't save it to test i'd saved there
160:29 - was that test.txt but that was
160:33 - that was oh that's actually okay so hold
160:35 - on
160:40 - all right let's
160:43 - oh it's not letting me copy paste
160:46 - all right let's go back to just for
160:49 - because it's all 140 and i really got to
160:50 - get going here
160:52 - um i'm gonna cheat a little bit
160:55 - no no i'm not i i gotta get this done
160:58 - okay
161:01 - i'll just use this as a reference i'm a
161:02 - fast typer
161:05 - i'm a fast typer
161:09 - so let me actually not do all of this
161:11 - because
161:12 - let's do 4 c40
161:15 - let c
161:17 - equal i want to try it just with my
161:19 - converting it
161:21 - uh
161:23 - let's what if i do this let's let's try
161:25 - with my converting it
161:28 - let c equal
161:31 - oh sorry peak
161:34 - 4 9 1 5 2.
161:43 - if
161:45 - c
161:47 - equals a
161:50 - print a
161:53 - and you know that let's just try this
161:59 - 60 go to
162:01 - 40.
162:12 - i keep letting exit again what's wrong
162:14 - with me
162:16 - what
162:18 - what is why am i doing that
162:20 - ah
162:22 - it's like some weird instinct home is
162:24 - what i'm trying to type oh my god
162:28 - everybody
162:29 - stay calm
162:36 - okay
162:37 - uh
163:00 - oh peek
163:02 - i clearly i need to eat lunch
163:08 - i'm
163:12 - all right
163:16 - sorry everybody
163:23 - okay
163:24 - now whatever i type
163:27 - goes in here okay
163:32 - um
163:33 - now
163:56 - yes so
164:00 - whatever i'm getting is not equal to the
164:02 - a character
164:05 - it's easier to work with the underlying
164:06 - number i know that's what i should do
164:09 - but i have a feeling
164:23 - this is what it
164:26 - wants me to do
164:51 - oh just one parenthesis there okay
165:02 - all right fine we're gonna work with the
165:03 - number
165:06 - okay
165:07 - good idea
165:11 - oh wait no
165:20 - 65.
165:51 - four nine
166:04 - ah 193
166:07 - yeah
166:09 - 193
166:13 - 127 right no 128
166:20 - 128
166:22 - okay
166:27 - okay
166:29 - let's go into graphics mode
166:40 - uh oh you know i could do the arrow keys
166:42 - then
166:48 - 139 136 149 138
166:54 - 136 is left
167:02 - 149
167:05 - is right
167:09 - up is 1
167:11 - whoops
167:14 - 149 is right 136 up is 139
167:21 - and down is 138 okay
167:24 - okay
167:29 - okay everybody here we go ready
167:32 - uh
167:37 - so oh man i had all that code so i've
167:39 - gotta rethink that logic
167:41 - so
167:44 - what i wanna have is
167:46 - a variable dir the let is optional by
167:49 - the way dir is zero
167:52 - um
167:54 - oops
167:55 - i didn't mean to overwrite that and then
167:59 - 50 c equals peak 49152
168:05 - if
168:06 - dir equals
168:08 - c
168:11 - then
168:12 - go to
168:13 - 40. just go back
168:15 - keep reading from the keyboard until
168:17 - there's something new
168:27 - oops
168:31 - if i forgot to do a line number dr
168:32 - equals c go to
168:34 - just go back to reading whoops
168:38 - oh lets me do the up arrow that's so
168:41 - nice
168:42 - can you really do that on an apple ii
168:43 - plus
168:45 - okay
168:47 - 193.
168:51 - okay
168:52 - so go back to 40.
168:56 - otherwise keep going and say if dir
169:00 - is equal to 136
169:03 - x equals x
169:05 - plus one
169:10 - no minus one
169:13 - and let's just only do that right now
169:16 - then 80
169:18 - 80 90 100 so let's say 110
169:21 - color equals one
169:23 - 120 plot x comma y
169:27 - 130 go to
169:33 - oh don't this shouldn't be go to 40 it
169:35 - needs to be go to 50 but let's this is
169:37 - go to 50
169:39 - and 60 let's just do this let's always
169:42 - draw it if dir equals c go to 120
169:46 - or go to 110.
169:48 - so i'm going to be drawing over itself
169:50 - but that's fine then i need it then also
169:52 - i needed that
169:55 - save
169:57 - uh snake dot txt okay
170:00 - in case i lose it again okay go to
170:02 - graphics mode
170:05 - start at 10 comma 10.
170:07 - start without moving
170:09 - check the key board
170:11 - if
170:12 - the keyboard is something new
170:15 - great
170:16 - based on what it is oh only if it's to
170:18 - the left move to the left and draw it
170:20 - then check the keyboard again let's see
170:23 - you have bad code on line 193 now
170:25 - there's no more line 193
170:28 - dir will be zero oh right
170:31 - sorry so 65 i need to say dir equals c
170:36 - thank you that's
170:38 - something i missed
170:40 - so i if it's a new thing i pick up that
170:42 - value
170:45 - lot syntax error line 70.
170:48 - oh
170:50 - uh text
170:54 - if oh i forgot that then if dir equals
170:57 - 136
171:00 - then x equals x minus one
171:03 - no parentheses
171:06 - oh no but that's on the line ah
171:08 - 70.
171:10 - if dir equals 136
171:12 - then x
171:14 - equals x minus 1. okay
171:19 - and let's just add some more of them i
171:20 - can type fast 80 if dir equals 149 then
171:26 - x equals x plus 1
171:28 - 90 if
171:30 - dir
171:31 - equals 139
171:33 - then y
171:34 - equals y minus 1
171:37 - 100 if
171:38 - dir equals 138 then y equals y plus 1.
171:48 - all right here's the whole program
171:55 - clear oh there's poke 49168 to clear the
171:58 - keyboard oh i could have done that
172:01 - i actually just done that but that's
172:03 - fine that's good to know that would be a
172:04 - better solution
172:06 - so just always clear the keyboard but
172:09 - why are some then
172:11 - oh so i'm doing everything in all
172:13 - capitals
172:14 - because my apple ii plus doesn't support
172:16 - lowercase
172:18 - my older one but um this emulator does
172:22 - so uh but it's not case sensitive i
172:25 - don't even think variable names are case
172:26 - sensitive
172:30 - yeah
172:33 - yeah variable names are not nothing's
172:34 - case sensitive
172:36 - let's try running it
172:40 - oh all right
172:44 - oh i can't do it
172:47 - i can't do it more than once in a row
172:51 - oh this is so silly it's not just a new
172:53 - one
172:57 - so i do need this clear keyboard thing
173:01 - so
173:12 - so for the ren does that renumber
173:18 - oh it renumbered everything for me
173:21 - look at that
173:23 - so that's really useful renumber will
173:25 - just take all my weird lines of code and
173:27 - renumber everything and even the go to's
173:29 - are all updated
173:31 - don't type exit don't type exit
173:34 - you want to clear the keyboard and reset
173:37 - dir yeah so what was clearing the
173:39 - keyboard poke
173:41 - right
173:44 - so after i draw
173:48 - let's say poke
173:50 - what was it
173:57 - what was it
173:58 - clear keyboard
174:02 - clear keyboard
174:04 - 49168 comma zero
174:10 - four nine one six eight comma zero
174:17 - so
174:18 - then
174:20 - 103 0 i don't need
174:23 - oh no no no no yeah 103 0 i don't need
174:26 - then 1040 let's say dir equals peak
174:30 - 49152
174:33 - and then
174:34 - get rid of 106 0.
174:38 - so i'm just getting the keyboard
174:42 - i don't need 105 0.
174:46 - i'm getting the keyboard i'm getting the
174:48 - direction
174:50 - moving x and y plotting it clearing the
174:53 - keyboard and then going back
175:01 - oh there we go
175:04 - well that was much easier
175:08 - than i thought
175:11 - so i could definitely do the snake game
175:12 - now i need an array and some other stuff
175:18 - all right
175:19 - look at that
175:24 - oh so many possibilities
175:26 - save it yes
175:33 - keyboard draw i don't know what to call
175:35 - this
175:40 - all right everybody
175:44 - i don't know what i did with today
175:46 - i hope you enjoy tuning in it seems to
175:48 - be a lot of people watching so let's
175:50 - before i go
175:52 - let's do another round of gifting
175:54 - memberships all right everybody
175:56 - this is way too much fun
175:58 - for me not to just do that okay before i
176:01 - go don't leave people
176:05 - don't leave
176:07 - because i am
176:08 - about to gift
176:14 - here we go everybody
176:23 - okay
176:25 - uh thank you to brilliant for sponsoring
176:27 - today's live stream check brilliant out
176:28 - at brilliant.org codingtrain
176:31 - uh lots of fun math and science and
176:33 - probability based things to learn
176:35 - uh i'm seeing all the gifts go to focus
176:38 - on me junaid rigid abhishek
176:42 - astro penguin gulam
176:45 - jason khon ryan eru
176:51 - [Music]
176:54 - you've just won
176:56 - a membership the coding train don't
176:58 - really get anything with it but you can
177:00 - try syncing your
177:02 - youtube account with your discord
177:03 - account you know
177:05 - in theory members get stickers but you
177:07 - have to be kind of a member for a few
177:09 - months
177:10 - so uh you know maybe go easy on the
177:13 - requesting the stickers if you just got
177:14 - my little membership gift
177:18 - um
177:20 - but uh thanks everybody i um i should be
177:23 - back
177:24 - so the so the monty hall problem video
177:26 - came out the wave function collapse
177:28 - video is currently 90 minutes long
177:30 - actually what i could have been doing
177:32 - for the last hour was watching it
177:34 - through and kind of like finding some
177:35 - more things to edit out
177:37 - um
177:38 - but and i think it's going to be at
177:39 - least another week or so before that's
177:41 - ready um but there's a a big video on a
177:44 - long video on coding a wave function
177:46 - collapse algorithm from start to finish
177:49 - that will be coming out soon on the
177:50 - coding train
177:51 - um thank you everybody uh if you enjoyed
177:54 - this like coding in apple basic let me
177:56 - know because i think i would actually
177:58 - like to do some videos where i'm just
178:00 - building projects in apple basic those
178:02 - will come later
178:03 - after i do this nebula class
178:06 - but um
178:08 - but yeah so
178:09 - um thanks everybody um i really
178:12 - appreciate you i appreciate you being
178:14 - here i appreciate you watching my videos

178:23 - i don't know what you're referring to dj
178:25 - mangus and i'm sorry that i didn't have
178:27 - discord open

178:30 - um
178:31 - everybody say a prayer
178:33 - for my
178:36 - um
178:39 - apple ii oh that's just the power supply
178:41 - apple ii plus computer

178:45 - um
178:46 - oh and jason is wearing your refactor it
178:48 - now t-shirt so thank you everybody
178:50 - i will see you
178:52 - next time on
178:54 - the coding train hopefully
178:58 - everything goes well next week i'll be
178:59 - back live streaming next friday no more
179:03 - i i misread that no apple basic you said
179:06 - more apple basic all right more apple

do do so i know the timer went to zero but i'm not ready yet here i come all right switching over some buttons lowering you cannot hear me ah now you can did you hear any of that none of it all of the funny cute endearing wonderful things i just said you heard none of that i was talking about all of you living inside the camera lens i can't go back and recreate that ever um so then now you hear me though i'm gonna wait till this i'm gonna wait till the chat catches up um and something was wrong with my mic which you know never happens i also forgot to turn a light on i'm such a pro at this live streaming stuff it's like a welloiled machine here i don't know if that if that made things better or worse but i'm a little bit brighter now because i forgot one of the lights i've got a little screen over here with the chat going oh no oh no okay this is okay everybody i know what the issue is here's the thing i have a this is terrible let's see if this will last the battery is dead i guess that i have a rechargeable battery but this is no problem because this this uh mic also takes uh double a batteries so i just need to find some double a batteries i'm going to put the music on i have a guest uh shenzhen from p5 is about to come on and say hi and i was thinking oh maybe let me have them come on and say hi and then i'll get the batteries but let me work this out i'm going to be right back you all talk amongst yourselves we'll see how long this lasts if i look for batteries do do all right all right everybody i'm back in business if i'm i'm charging up the special rechargeable battery that goes with this and now why can't we can i just have a doover a complete doover please it's only 1109. how bad was that okay jonathan walsh says hurry up i did my best i did my best okay i was saying so i had a plan i was organized i was getting ready to get started i'm completely lost now so um let me not um delay any further uh one of the things that i think is the most important thing that i want to share with you on today's live stream we do lots of fun interesting things i have lots of things to share with you but i want to tell you about something called p5 access day which is happening tomorrow saturday uh may uh 21st and rather than just have me talk about uh p5 access day i have brought uh lead of the p5.js uh project to come say hello to you uh shen chen who um will tell you all about p5 access day and i'm not really set up for an interview kind of dialogue thing here so what i'm going to do is take take about 10 seconds here to change some to unplug some things and plug some other things back in and have shenzhen here uh speaking to you and then i will return afterwards uh okay so here we go uh i'm bringing open the zoom i'm gonna make this full screen um uh and now i'm gonna switch over to this button this button here and then i'm going to turn up the laptop audio so um all right you are all live on camera now can you say hi and see if our audio comes through hi yes your audio is coming through so i'm actually going to mute myself and let you just take over thank you so much for uh i know this sort of like last minute uh just jumping on here uh into this uh zoo meeting to broadcast on the coding train but i think it's uh so wonderful that you're here because you're gonna do an excellent job talking about people access they way better than i would and you're one of the organizers of it like uh so who better than than you so uh take it away thank you thank you dan for having me hi uh my name is chen chen yeah i'm the current lead of p5.js access i'm sorry i'm the current leader p5.js and the organizer of p5.js access day i am going to share my screen with you all um here it is um so today i'm joining the access day because sorry today i'm joining the coding train because i want to show you a very exciting event happening this saturday may 21st p5.js access day it is a oneday public online conference of talks about access in open source software for the arts and the great issues beyond the software p5.js access day starts from 10 a.m and ends at 3 30 pacific standard time on may 21st this saturday the zoom event features four themed sessions critical web accessibility disability arts access and community building and access via translation you can join us for four sessions or popping in the sessions of your interest you will need to rsvp to receive the zoom link you can find the rsvp link on all the p5.js social media and we will copy the link to the chat later as well i will do a very brief uh intro about each session so the first session is critical web accessibility moderated by kate hollenbach panelists cassie luiz and jess will share their experience working on web accessibility for p5.js and assistive technologies the second session is disability arts moderated by xiaoweiwang in this session panelists natalie cami and cameron will share their experience in their art and community building practice on disability arts crypt fantasy technology and digital accessibility the third session is access and community building moderated by dorsey santos who is the executive director of processing foundation the session invites panelists uh tiny takazin closes at home and designed to reflect on their practice and how each uh prints us towards a vision of a community building that is more accessible and inclusive the last session is a access video translation moderated by kenneth flemm so panelists can ingua chihaya and philippe will share their experience translating p50s website and documentation to simplify chinese korean hindi and portuguese and discuss the impact and the future plan of translation for p5.js so for each session the speaker will give a brief presentation and followed by a open discussion among the panelists and the live q a with zoom participants so if you join you can ask questions to the panelists directly asl interpretations and live captions will be provided all the sessions will be recorded and posted with captions for those who cannot attend don't forget to rsvp to get the zoom link to join the live event tomorrow and receive updates about the recordings when they come available so don't forget rsvp uh you can find the rsvp link again on all the p5.js social media and we will share the link to the chat um hope to see you on saturday thank you okay i'm back now i'm on the screen with you thank you so much i was frantically trying to type into the chat um as you were speaking i put a link in i don't know if it worked like somehow i i i've like forgotten how to use computers this morning but and i'm um so it is uh but we'll make sure if they're especially if there's any um coding trained moderators who can put a link to the link tree but i'm also what i'll do is after you go um i'll just pull up on the browser and show the p5.js twitter account as well as the link tree page so people i will come back to the youtube later and paste the remember a link there too perfectly the thing about youtube is it doesn't let you post links in the chat unless you are previously approved to but if you but if you're in the chat and say hello i could click on your name and allow you to post got it thank you yeah um people are uh so i'm i'm looking at too many screens here thank you so much for being here talking about um p5 access day i'm going to be popping in and out all throughout the day tomorrow i'm really excited if you don't i i don't know if you if i i'm talking to this camera but nobody can see me on that camera so i'm going to talk to this camera i don't know if people realize but that lineup of speakers and moderators is just absolutely incredible if all if many of those names and faces are unfamiliar to you um you really i can't encourage you enough to come and join and learn from and be inspired by all of these incredible wonderful um people who have come together to celebrate p5 and talk about access and open source so thank you so much for organizing this wonderful event i look forward to more collaborations between coding train and processing foundation and p5 and all the stuff that i'm sure we will get up to uh this summer and beyond all right thank you thank you so much okay byebye okay giant face of me leave meeting uh now uh i see this let me go back to this view okay this is hard this live streaming stuff is hard you think i'd have gotten it all down by now all right um the link is wrong i know i know the link i posted wasn't right i was trying to type it out manually let me do you all a favor and i'm just going to come over here to show my computer screen um well i've got my invisible mug here so where you want to go for all uh for all links is link tree slash p5.js there is where you can find the rsvp for p5 access day as well as more information about the p5.js community statement and the website you can also find out um so if i click on here it's just going to take me to the eventbrite page which will have lots of information but i would also encourage you to check out uh twitter.com p5xjs um and um you'll a you'll find the link tree link there as well as more information similar to what you just saw in the slides and this is um shenzhen's uh twitter account here and so i'm sure you could also tweet at them if you have any questions okay i also forgot i was going to do this first and then do p5 access day but i i might my battery was dead everything was all messed up so let me just briefly say a quick thank you to today's sponsor of the coding train and i hope this button worked i didn't test it of course it doesn't i will fix that why doesn't that work am i in the wrong place oh well no that's that's a everything has gone wrong for me today i'm so fired from all of my many jobs but um brilliant is a wonderful um uh website for learning if you like watching my videos you're probably interested in the kind of topics you find on the brilliant website there's also an app i recently did a video about the monty hall problem and there is this incredible uh probability fundamentals course on the brilliant website so about halfway through today's today's live stream i'm gonna come back and start to work on going through um that probability course and see what i get right and see what i get wrong because honestly i learn the most when i get it wrong so the interactive lessons that allow you to try it all sorts of ideas on brilliant um are really fantastic you can go to brilliant.org codytrain it's a link that's in the video description i'll pin it in the chat as well uh to sign up for free um and then of course you want to unlock everything on the brilliant website um you through that link you will get the first 200 people to do so will get a 20 uh discount okay uh everybody is asking you know so first of all i like to say that um you know especially if i have a guest on you know keep the chat the questions in the chat to the topic being discussed but you know if i'm just here prattling on you can ask anything you want and uh uh how old are you uh and just to sort of normalize people in their later years streaming on youtube somewhat incompetently i will tell you that i am 48 and i will be 49 this summer and then a year from then i will be 50. what are we gonna do for my 50th birthday i don't know i'm gonna go on a big train trip somewhere that's my plan it's hard to get up in the morning all the muscles hurt and all that stuff okay um all right um let me just see if this will work can i oh i'm hold on i'm gonna uh queue i am going to attempt to give you moderator privileges um so let me see add moderator so q is now a moderator for the channel in which case you should be able to post any links you want um in the chat so please enjoy go forth and post you all the links of all the p5.js stuff i'll post a link to brilliant and then uh in fact i'm just gonna put that as my pin the chat message which will help uh oh ish says can't wait for basic well i've got a i've got some news for you okay uh so there you go the brilliant link is also a pinned chat message um all right what have i gotten to so far i said hello uh we talked about p5 access day i talked about brilliant um i'm going to talk about apple soft basic in a moment that's what i'm going to start working on setting up to code but i have two other announcements one is a short one and one is kind of a long one both of these are repeating things that i talked about on tuesday's very brief stream that i did before the itp ima semester show so um now i am going to close oh no i have to have this open but i'll just have it in the background um let me come over here and let me [Laughter] uh simon is here you know it's hard simon you got to wake up early in the morning now that you're in the same time zone as me i believe uh everyone say hi to simon in the chat of course just joining us uh um simon we talked about p5 access day um which maybe i'll see you there tomorrow if you're free but no worries if you're not basically this is this live stream is just a oneonone where i can like talk to simon briefly all right what was i what was that ah let me do my announcements so um i mentioned this uh speaking of simon this is very funny timing p c d c p h so and back to processing i just want to again mention that processing community day in copenhagen is happening on june 4th 2022. i mean there's lots of community days and there's the io festival there's all sorts of things i can tell you about but the reason why i'm telling you about this one is because i'm going to be there i'm going to copenhagen i have a plane ticket i have a picture of me on the website where i was had a little bit less gray hair even though that was only like two years ago so i don't know what's been going on it's very stressful this last couple have you noticed what the world is like i have it way easier than probably most so i really don't need to complain but i i know everybody's having a a range of emotions and challenges in their lives these days so hopefully the coding train can bring something positive to you that's um that's one of my goals here with this whether it's educational or entertainment or just pure vibes is coding train a vibes show or a plot show i don't even know if it's a show but is it more vibes or is it more plot i think it might be more vibes at least so far right now all right uh so yeah so please especially if you are in the denmark area is that a thing people say the denmark we say like the tristate area for here if you're in that the the new york city kind of i mean there's other states that are not just new york but the the denmark area the northern europe area um i would love to see you there i've heard from people on the twitters and on the youtube chat and the comments and all of that that they're planning to come that's really great not sure yet what i'll be doing there but some kind of coding stuff um copenhagen area okay i'm also thinking of going to stockholm maybe i heard that you could take this overnight boat from stockholm to helsinki and then visit health thank you for the day and then take the boat back i'm thinking about that i don't know why i should be just like talking about all my travel plans here but i've never really been around sort of northern european area so i'm excited to to do some visiting there okay let's see i'm going to try to do the shorter things first looking at my list let me just check off that it said hello we talked to pp5 access day all right so this one is a little bit longer but let's go for it so this is not going to be total news to um actually before i even get to that um let me switch back over here so youtube let's let's talk for a minute about coding train and live streaming because first of all i'm i'm probably i'm not going to have any live streams pro actually no i have one that i'm going to try i'm going to try to do one next friday if all goes well one of the reasons why i am working on learning relearning applesoft basic is because i am filming something for the streaming service nebula that i've talked about um a short a class if you go to nebula uh if you start if you go to nebula.app and look at nebula classes you'll see there's a whole bunch there already and i'm doing a quick set of programming tutorials in basic so lots more to say about that then but i'm doing that next week so today i wanted to get my feet wet a little bit and tinker around in basic again um so that'll help me mentally prepare for next week but that's been a big project it's kind of slowed me down on my youtube production of stuff i have been streaming quite a bit on twitch um which i really enjoy i like a lot of the features and you know i can imagine doing some interesting things with the twitch api in the chat so i'm kind of waffling back and forth between the two platforms but uh here i am today on youtube um and one of the things that's been interesting to follow is how various features that appear on twitch then make their way over to youtube and i'm very excited that youtube seems to have added something called gifting memberships so i'm going to try this now i'm going to gift 20 memberships to the chat and let's just see what happens uh so 20 of you watching right now i apparently i i thought you could assign them not that i want to be in charge of picking who gets them but uh let's see how that goes so i just gifted 20 memberships um i'm looking at the chat now uh pink chris manning pink lemonade raj fun planet muhammad muchitaba this is this is so fun unless you think i'm being super generous that money just goes right back to me i mean not really because uh youtube i don't know what youtube takes i think 30 actually so if it was like i guess i guess that was like for 20 memberships it was like a dollar and change each um but this is fun to see uh how this works anyway um so it's very confusing how you support the coding train for those of you first of all i'm just happy you're here watching i'm happy if you decided i'm not going to watch anymore because i'm doing other stuff with my life or if you want to just send me a tweet that says hey i like your videos or hey you know you know i don't really like your videos because you wave your arms around too much i mean i i i love getting those messages but you say it in a nice constructive feedback way i totally accept it anyway i'm saying um uh but i do appreciate that there are people who have the capacity and desire to support the coding train financially um i'm kind of running this whole ship as a train it's not a ship as a kind of break even small business basically and i have folks who are helping me with maintaining the website and the open source repositories and doing video editing and illustration and helping me with other projects and research so i'm trying to grow that to some extent although i don't i would like to just still be just like a small easy to manage simple things so anyway for those of you who are supporting in that way that's great one of the things that is confusing is there are many different avenues on which to find coding train content as well as support the coding train so this is all a big segue to talk about the new codingtrain website are you ready we're at my live stream on tuesday you already saw it so it's not too exciting um but um let's have a looksie at it um and talk about it for a bit okay so first of all the new coding train website is not actually live at thecodingtrain.com the plan is for it to have its official launch um in pcd uh um copenhagen so um that's kind of like the deadline i'm i'm going to move it over to the propertycodingtrain.com domain before then but right now you can preview it at uh codingtrain preview.netifly.app one of the things i've been learning which has been super fun is how to deploy a web application to netlify i would love to do some videos on that this is what it looks like this is the home page i'm going to go through pieces of it in a bit and i'm also going to show you how to download the repository and run it download the website and run it locally build it locally so one of the things that i just wanted to show you is here in the footer i'm trying to be better organized so these are sort of the current avenues that come with various different benefits and rewards in terms of youtube membership patreon github sponsorship a twitch subscription and the nature of code book so um but this is not the primary thing i wanted to talk about about the website so um i one of the things i'm planning to do this will probably happen at the very beginning of june is i'm going to do some really lengthy i don't want to say all day but like several hour live streams on twitch probably um where i'll be working on updating the website and asking for people to help um so um this is just a little taste of that because i don't want to spend the whole stream like here i am i'm going to like build a page for the website that needs that's not there right now but i want to show you so that any of you who are interested could get started tinkering with it contributing to it and the main thing i want to show you is how you can add your own uh versions of the different coding examples that are in my videos to the website itself i'm trying to keep my eye on the chat um i don't know where to look at it here okay hydro pn thank you so much so all of you who are just like suddenly gifted this membership so i'm sorry for the random number generator i'll maybe i'll do another one a little bit um um but um you should the main thing for you to do is link your um link your oh yes link your youtube and discord accounts then go to the coding trained discord which you can get to at thecodingtrain.com discord and um there you will have access to some of the supporter member channels and yeah i can answer your questions there and i guess it'll go away i guess i just gifted you one month and then when that's over it'll go away unless you choose to continue it i don't know maybe that's uh i don't i actually don't know how this works i'm just experimenting with it twitch has had this kind of gift subscription thing forever so um okay uh let's see oh a dark mode feature for the website so feel free to file an issue for that um we can have that discussion um uh you know the the the vibe of the coding train is bright and cheery but oh one of the things actually that's one of the things we're talking about doing is having the scene change the time of day based on the time of day but um i see that it's already 11 30. i want to make sure that i'm moving into um moving into some of the other stuff i want to do today soon enough so let's take a look at just a quick lesson i know lessons probably the wrong word a quick demonstration of how you can get your hands into the website locally on your computer okay so this is the github repo it is at oh and unchained just joined that's like a genuine legitimate membership joining oh you have just won your very own membership to the coding range you didn't really win it because you you paid for it and then google took a large portion of that and then the rest at some point will anyway thank you so much i really appreciate your support um okay uh so no fave icon yet yeah file these as issues people we want to hear from you so okay so what i'm going to do here now first of all if you want if you want to just download everything that has to do with the website you can just go right here onto github and click download zip there are ways for you to contribute and edit the website by going through the github repository the git repository on github itself clicking edit creating a pull request these are things i would really love to remake my whole git and github tutorial series maybe it actually makes sense for me to do that using the coding train website if i'm thinking about this right now it's kind of an interesting idea but um i want to just look at what is a bit more of a higher degree of difficulty uh element which is to uh and especially if anybody is sort of has a lot of experience with web development out there who wants to sort of see how the website works and think about how they might want to contribute to it this is what you'll need to do so i'm going to go here under uh code and um i should probably start using this github command line and by the way i have a million people to thank about this website i'll have to come back and do that later because i'm not really prepared i don't want to forget anyone today but um uh so apologies for not giving like sort of full credit of course if you just go through the repo and look at the history you'll see all the wonderful people working on the website so it is there and findable um so i am going to click uh copied um and i am going to uh uh go over here and go to the desktop um so i'm in item any sort of terminal or console access will do here i am going to say git clone and then i'm going to paste the url for the repository which should bring the entire website uh down to my computer uh it looks like it's finished i'm going to go and just look in the finder now here and we can see so let's just look at what's here first of all for a second so there's a couple things that are interesting about this one is there is no website in the way that you're viewing it here what is in all these folders is the raw data and design materials for the website so i have to build the website but what is important for me to try to briefly explain and talk about and i think this is not my area of expertise or my forte here but this is what's known as a statically built website uh unchained thank you unchained that's that's i appreciate that uh clarification on the name pronunciation um so what i mean by that is when you're looking at the website you're looking at a flat rendered html page that's loading images and animations and embedding all sorts of other things there's no engine that is live rendering that is that is that is um i want to say like generating the page that's pulling from a database i wanted the website and this is something that we talked a lot about in the development design systems international is the creative firm that um has done designed this website and worked with me to build it um so i wanted the website to be something that you could just grab and run locally that you could edit directly on github you don't need to have some kind of secret keys environment variables and a dummy database and the website is just everything for the website is all here in all these folders and if i go under content you'll start to see there's pages there's templates there's tracks there's videos and if you go in there you can start to see like oh there's something for every there's a folder for every coding challenge if i go into this one but suddenly aha this doesn't look like a web page that's not an html file that's a json file if i were to now open this up in a code editor like visual studio code and i were to go to content pages uh challenges no no uh where videos challenges and go to this one i don't know which ones and go here we would see oh look object oriented fractal trees oh the description is blank let's we're going to do something about that right now there's a date there's a video id there's some languages there's some topics there's links to the code examples this is all json but when i go to the website if i were to go under videos tracks no videos challenges and i were to go to which one was i looking at objectoriented fractal trees here it is this looks like a webpage with you know a navigation bar the video links to the code examples the description is empty uh this other thing about a passenger showcase thing so where is all of that and how does that happen this website is built with a build system actually it's it's something called gatsby which i don't know uh gatsby let's let's look up what gatsby is build gatsby static sites with react and no no that's a udemy course that's an ad story blog this is an ad give me this thing yeah so this is what gatsby is it is essentially an engine that is able to take all of the raw materials and generate the website but rather than do that on the fly the moment when a page is requested it does that anytime the developers of the website make a change and rebuild it so i can i can now do that process so i have all of the data here on my computer in this folder all the data for the website and if i want to start to build the website look at it locally make changes to it and then send those changes back to the actual website i can do that by issuing some node commands to install whatever package dependencies i need to build the website to build to test to run tests on the website all those kinds of things so the first one i'm going to want to do is type npm install now if the word node is completely unfamiliar to you um you know i might have some tutorials that you could watch and i wish i could just sort of like bring them up right now oh if only i had a website that organized everything well i'd be able to go right to the page where my node tutorials are coming soon but node.js is a javascript framework for um you know i want to say serverside coding but it's so much more i guess it's a runtime it's a way of like executing javascript just on any computer without a browser context so javascript is most commonly found as code running inside a web browser but you can run it anywhere so i want to run some javascript code right here on my computer inside of this folder well i need to make sure if i'm going to run all the scripts that go with the website i need to install all the packages npm node package manager so i'm going to hit enter there and we're going to run all of this and i'll talk about people are asking about how maybe i'll talk about the deployment process i'll get to that how that gets deployed then so it's installing a bunch of things so by the way to contribute to the website you don't have to know any programming and you don't have to know anything about git i mean you have to be willing to try these things but i'm looking for though all of you who have never done any of this before to contribute to the website let it be a friendly welcoming place for you to do your first open source contribution um p5 and processing a lot of the other projects i'm involved with are those kind of places too but the website that's really an invitation i'm really inviting you like i want you to be in there like i've never tried this before can i figure it out if you can't we've done something wrong on our end right we've got to fix that wow that was a lot of node packages to install um all right and i realize you probably can't see the bottom here because my desk is so now that i've done npm install one thing i want to just look at briefly is an important file to look at is this package.json file so any node project the package.json file is like a configuration file it is a file that tells you all about the project and if i go here it'll say things like oh it's the coding train and it's version one it's not actually private anymore it was private there's a description oh roon matson is the author of the coding trade website he's the one who started this project uh a designer uh one of the founders of dsi but what i'm really looking for these are all the dependencies right all of these things that it's using you know we could get into any of these individually but what i wanted to show you are these scripts so this is important uh if i want to build the website serve the website clean the build which is something i'll get to test the website or work on developing the website i can run any of these commands update your packages you have three criticals all right what uh what do i do npm audit maybe or update or something audit fix um i don't know i don't know what i'm doing anymore let's write npm audit fix so one of the things about these node packages is they're constantly being updated and especially some of the older ones can have you know security vulnerabilities in them um so i think i'm gonna have to look at this later but there's also something that was telling me to like update my npm or something i'm just going to run npm install again wasn't it telling me uh oh npm fun i don't know i don't know i'm gonna deal with this later we're gonna live with the vulnerabilities hi kay um so what was i looking for i was on a on a path here i had done yes i got distracted by the chat though thank you for that important message um so the one that i want to look at right now is uh let's try npm so these are just aliases the actual command that we're running is like gatsby serve or gatsby build build but these are things like i can make this uh called unicorn and then i could say npm run unicorn and that's going to run the development command um but i i there's no reason for me to make that change so let me go back and call it dev and let me just say npm run dev so this is what i want to do first so what this is actually doing is it's building the website it's a little bit different than npm build because what it's doing is it's building the website and hosting the website and then keeping its eye on all of the files so if i were to change any file it's going to quickly rebuild that page and this is what you want to do while you're developing it right when you build the website it's a onetime operation i build the website there it is i change the json file it's not going to be a new it's not going to update until i rebuild npm run dev is like we're going to be building it continuously in the background while you're working on it it's inefficient you would never want that in production so to speak like oh it's just constantly rebuilding but while you're working on it makes sense so i got one problem zero errors one warning so um and now we see that the website is now running locally so i am able to go to um this particular url localhost at this port and i'm just to type it in manually although i could click on that localhost localhost 8000 and we see there's the website looks just like the website that is currently did i lose it where is it oh yeah it's here the website that is currently um on deploy to netlify right now but we can do things like let's go back to that file uh videos challenges objectoriented so this has no description so what i would like to do here is let's find this video objectoriented tree so this is at the page for it on the old website which is fine so i'm actually going to take this description here from the old website i'm going to paste it into here well first let's quickly go and have this page open locally so we can see the magic of this this is the local version of the site videos challenges um which is the one i'm looking for maybe i go to the next page this one 15. so notice how this description here is blank let's try it i'm going to put this in here let me turn on word wrap uh put a period there and now there you go look at that it appeared boom because i'm running that and if we went to the terminal it's going to say you can see like it you can see all these information about how it's uh re it ah it found this changed file and it's rebuilding stuff and all that one thing that's interesting to look at by the way i don't understand what this is exactly but there's this view graphyql an inbrowser ide to explore your site's data and schema let's take a look at that so this is like uh i know maybe somebody in the chat can explain what this is i'm gonna take a look um yeah so i i see there's some discussion in the chat i'm not sure what the question was but you do not need you could be on any this website should build on any platform that supports node so the server network i assume is where i have it deployed i assume is running some type of linux server unixbased server i'm running it on mac right now you can run node on windows on linux obviously so yeah um yes you can do what i'm doing so now let me read this over to see if i want to make any edits in this coding challenge i can so i don't think i think that's redundant uh can i continue the topic uh let's just change it to more algorithmic botany um uh another way to render i don't know this is hard to do in real time while i'm live streaming this is uh i'm kind of regretting this decision to try to edit this but i wanted to show you like i'm trying to freshen up all the content as i'm bringing it over another way to um generate a fractal tree is to consider every part of the tree an object so that we can apply forces and attributes to all the branches all the branches and leaves and more okay so i'm going to make that edit to the description let's go back and see if this is the old website where is it here localhost so we can see the description here um this might be um whoa what just happened oh it refreshed so i'm wondering just about this read more here with this particular length and then i say read more and it's like kind of a lot of extra space so this might be a bug to work on let's go to the code examples and make sure they work so this goes to p5 sketch uh great this is the code example so that's working what do these do um this takes me to ah the code on uh github and then this one let's see what this does uh downloads the code uh directly okay um and that's and i think these are supposed to have like the processing or p5 logo so that might at one point that was there but i'm not sure what happened to that um okay so there's lots more that could be done uh the time stamps are not here that's something that i would want to add so i'm looking for people to contribute all of these things like if you again i don't want to uh my goal for this is not to take advantage of people's generosity and get free labor like if you are really interested you know i um i have people who are paid to work on porting and but uh and and like building out the content to the website but if this would be a enjoyable learning experience for you to pick one coding challenge or one video page or one thing and try to add some material to it i welcome your contribution um so and and joseph in the chat is saying graphql is a query length so eric writes graph eql pronounced like graphical is a dev endpoint for working with testing the graph graphical api or graphql api which is a query language a way to query data then multiple rest endpoints so it's kind of like the beginnings of an api so i would think that um um i would think that um that's that's good news for like eventual development of being able to serve a lot of the content on the website as an api so let's think about fractals generative art let's add object oriented programming as another topic maybe um uh and i don't know if algorithmic botany really makes sense these are kind of like tags let's add that so the next thing i'm going to do is i'm going to here oops let's look at git status you can see that i've changed the object oriented fractal trees page i'm going to make a separate branch which is live stream demo i'm going to go to that branch um i'm going to hit add just to add those changes to the sort of get staging thingy my mom someday when i do a proper video about git i'll have the vocabulary at the ready um then i'm going to write a commit message now as uh i always have the voice of darius kazemi in the back of my mind that says don't do this don't just write a short message so i'm going to do git commit i'm going to follow the wise words and say like this is a demonstration that i am doing live on youtube to show how to contribute to the new coding train website so and then so the idea here is that i can see what's modified and i could write a longer more thoughtful message i think there's a way to have a title and uh but um i'm gonna then go ahead and quit out of here no how do i how do i get out of this i think i'm in like vi or vim or something no wait cole and q right or x uh there was an error i don't know what i did wrong all right i'm sorry i failed uh live demo live demo of website edit let's go back to this uh then i'm going to push it to uh get push origin uh that and uh apologies i realize some of you watching this like it is all completely unfamiliar to just soak it in um uh maybe check out my uh well there's plenty of wonderful materials online to learn about getting github my tutorial series is called github for poets which you would find on the website or youtube so i'm going to push this up oh interesting i'm not authenticated oh crud um i made a mistake here but let's let's see if i can do this real quickly um i usually have myself authenticated through um keys on my machine then i just have a passcode but i i'm in my coding train login which i guess i haven't done this um so let's see what happens here if um boy you can't see the password that's on this phone can you let me put it here i might have to redo that password yeah it failed why did it fail this is so sad uh isn't my username this all right well this is kind of a little bit of a little you can't use it i mean i have two factor in all of that so um i guess i probably want to use the cli or be authenticated through my keys i wonder if i had cloned it actually through i didn't think to do this but usually oh what oh because i'm not logged in i usually clone it through hold on how do i do that info thing i want to see a five if how if i have a key stored a global um look at the chat get me the pass go to github settings create a token okay but i'm not even logged in i don't know what happened to me um i want to make this happen let's let's let's go forth um all right i'm stubborn i'm going to make this happen um now i need to go to my event my two factor um um okay so what is what are people telling me i need to do um that i should not be doing while showing um but probably that should be should not be showing live uh use the cli it's easy to authenticate uh generally took on the website use that instead of a password all right where do i do that token token token token developer settings password and authentication um i really should probably not be having this open live um keys yeah that's why i cloned it this is still okay let's go back everybody stay calm i'm going to do this i cloned it with https which is what to do if you're not like logged in through your account but i can use ssh try to let's try this yes i this is me being authenticated now oh i'm sorry everybody uh we're just gonna just do this again i'm gonna run in pretend none of that happened developer settings generate tokens so i could have done that um where was that developer settings developer settings personal access token all right i'm i'm moving to this view just in case it shows it expiration custom i'm gonna have this expire tomorrow live and select scopes can i do everything oh boy this is bad i'm giving myself every every possible permission generate token copy it okay so i made a personal access token and now let's try it back in here just curious get put push origin live stream demo so shiffman password so put in my personal access token i just created ah there we go so that works so i can show you that page that doesn't have the access token on it anymore but um wherever that was i think i might have closed it actually um but now all right so sorry for that slight diversion there are this is why this stuff is hard and confusing to navigate because there's so many different ways to do it and so many ways that you could get stuck but the way that i usually work with github is by cloning repos through uh secure shell ssh and i've set up my all sorts of configuration settings on my computer to allow that what i happen to do here i hear this github cli is particularly useful so you can look into installing that but what happened is i used this particular url which is what you would use if you're not authenticated into the it's not like your repo you're not authenticated into it and then um you're able to uh you can generate a personal token and all that kind of stuff is what i showed you so but that's neither here or nor there the important thing is you'll see that all of a sudden i now have this new branch called live stream demo i'm going to do compare and pull request i'm going to say i'm adding description to coding challenge oop fractal tree and this is happening live right now i'm going to create this pull request oh and i forgot to show you how to run the tests so one thing i should have done by the way and you can see here this is what i changed right it's showing me the new description the new topics and what i uh one thing that i should have done first is do npm run test because this will check the changes to see if there is a typo or error in it but they all passed so for example if i were to go back to this and i if i were to forget this quote obviously like uh visual studio code is showing me through syntax highlighting that there's a mistake but if i were to do this and do npm run test it's going to tell me that the tests failed and if sometimes i can sort of figure out but like syntax error at this place and blah blah blah so i could go back to the file and try to figure out what i got wrong um the pull request itself is actually running these tests so it is running a test and it's even going to do a deploy preview i think so i'm going to wait for that to happen i'm going to take a look at the chat the cli is good um people are saying yeah it's using jest the i have not i did not write any of the tests again this website was designed and developed by uh design systems international let's see how their uh google uh this is their website um they did the website for uh processing and you can see other projects of theirs on um um on uh on their website and they are doing the coding train website which at some point will um i would expect will hopefully appear wow they they redid their website recently um um which i assume will at some point appear on their website as well so check out design systems international um let's see here joseph asks are you using eslint to share styles i don't know i would like to i wanted to one thing that's changing so the previous website in addition to host in addition to holding all of the metadata around all of the videos also held the actual source code for the videos and i'm now going to decouple that it was way too much to manage within one github repository so any page on the website like this being one of them the code examples are all links to urls outside of the website itself now one thing that's a little bit weird is that the url that's going to the source code for processing is currently pointing to the old websites repository because that's where the code is but it's my intention to move those so that's another project that i absolutely need help with i would like to make one repo for all the coding challenges sometimes like for the wave function collapse um project i just have a whole repo that's just wave function collapse romantic hall i have that so it's gonna the source code is going to be able to be flexibly in more than one place under any kind of organization on a casebycase basis and then the web page just links to it um so uh chris i i talked a bit about how uh the website how it's um uh static build using gatsby and that kind of thing um we'll be revisiting this again more in future streams i guess these take quite a bit of time um i i don't know if um oh oh but look we have a no that's a deploy log um oh so can if i i think i probably have to log into netlify i am logged in so we can see um so i have a netlify account and what this is showing is that this is kind of like what happens is anytime github and netlify are linked to each other and so basically like when there are changes made to the source code repository on github communication happens that tells netlify hey you can rebuild run all the gatsby build commands to rebuild the website to host it um so it's not rehosting it the the the actual website like this is codingtame preview and if i go to challenges and that same page right this is the page on the live netlify preview uh the live website this is the local host page and you can see localhost page has these extra topics the live website does not but at some point it takes quite a while i guess i uh oh wait wait is it is it there is it getting there oh yeah deploy preview ready so i think i can go here ah yes look at this so this is what's so cool about using netlify it created a deploy preview so i could actually see what the website looks like with the new changes i've made before it goes to the live website and it would look this way even when it's at the codingtrain.com actually i don't know what it'll look like maybe it'll do some kind of subdomain thing so i should wait for all the tests to finish before i merge it i kind of know it's going to be fine maybe i'll wait let's see if there's other questions and then once i merge it it would then those changes would then appear live on the actual website so this is such a useful process because even if you don't want if you if you're not doing this locally like let me let me show you probably the way that you're more likely to engage with this it's like and somebody did this recently if i go here to um spelling fixes so for example um supercrafter went through the website and made just like small edits to a lot of different pages um and then i looked at them and merged them but i can actually just do that through the github interface itself like for example if i were to go to a different challenge like the barnsley fern and go here to index.json and if i wanted to edit the description i could just do it right here in the github interface and i could say visualizing the barnsley firm fractal with processing java and then i could this is a trivial change but do we have fractals generative art um what were some things that i said like algorithmic botany i don't know that we need that as a tag but um so if i wanted to add those um demonstrate uh updating barnsley i saw that wrong barnsley fern and then i could create a new branch and live demo two propose change um and then i could make this a pull request and um now i can look at this pull request i uh chris i appreciate i appreciate your comments about wanting to see a dynam uh a database layer and a dynamic setup but i made a very specific decision to go with a static website it was a long discussion that we ran around a lot of circles on and i i appreciate your feedback and i i you know we'll see what happens in the future but this is definitely the direction that um i've chosen to go in so ah now we can see that this one has completed running its tests and i can merge it in so i'm going to hit merge and then at some point it will take some time this being the actual preview of the website on netlify i can i can uh refresh here and at some point the new website will build and we'll see the new topics coming in um okay so i'm trying to think of what else i might want oh yes the most important part so what i didn't get to really show here now but i'm going to show you in a second is here under uh closed let's look at this one so um yesterday i believe i received this wonderful pull request um from rue dash a who contributed their particular um uh project so if you want to create your own so let's look at the website to see where this is so i'm going to go to challenges and which one was this that i'm looking at this one is l16l systems so um where was that i'm gonna go to why am i lost here um oh i'm on the website i'm going to 16. don't know what what order they're in i'm going to go here um and one of the things you'll see oh where is it is this the wrong one okay hold on let's figure out what's going on here so i am on challenges 16 l systems fractal tree showcase this was merged contribution 6. so why is it not showing up let's look at it locally here for a second so i'm going to look at the local version whoops challenges video i'm going to videos challenges oh my god it's afternoon already this is insane i guess i guess i should have allocated a lot more time for the website let's go to 16 fractal tree l system passenger showcase so let's now look at what's in there showcase so contribution one two three four five six uh one two three four five oh there it is did i just not scroll far enough to the right let's go back to here no oh maybe it hasn't redeployed do i have to do something to redeploy the website because it's actually showing here so this is what this is what i was trying to show you you can by creating your own json file and uploading a thumbna thumbnail image and the the plan is to both have a cli as well as a form that you can enter in to do this so you ultimately don't have to do it by like manually creating a json file you can see this is the contribution and it appears um so um okay so what i'm confused about is why it's not actually appearing on the main website do i need to do something to actually i'm not logged in all right i have to figure out i'll have to figure this out i i didn't realize that maybe there's an extra step that when something is merged to main for it to redeploy to the actual website itself because i'm not seeing it i'm still looking at the preview i know but the preview is sorry it's confusing the preview is the live website right now i just haven't i just haven't this is not a deploy preview i probably shouldn't have called it preview i should have called it coding train uh almost published to be moved to the actual domain this is the equivalent of the live website unless it's just cached because i looked at that page before let's just try this uh videos tracks no i always go videos challenges um uh what was i looking for um this one i'm gonna force refresh yeah i don't know why it's not building it's there how is it there thank you yes i see the discussion is continuing and i i totally get it i appreciate the feedback um i don't think it's a perfect solution by any means and i definitely would like to do i definitely i plan to do i mean this is i'm kind of realizing how long this takes but i plan to do a full live stream this is practically becoming that dedicated to the website and uh being more organized about how to walk people through working on it um you stayed on the page and refreshed just now so weird i'm not seeing it here but let's go just out of curiosity let's go to this one i i um which one the object this one oh yeah this appeared so this is strange so the changes i just made today appeared so there maybe there's like a caching thing going on let me just go to like a new incognito window and go to challenges and um which one this one is the one i'm looking for no so strange oh does it maybe only show a certain number not all of them no i think it whoops i think it shows it's very hard to scroll this that's one actually a little bit of feedback that might oh i have this here like does it only show a random number of them all right i i have to move on hold shift yes i've done that i've holden i've held shift press the refresh button many times uh i think it's time for me to move on um um to uh the next part of today's live stream so i wanted to come back to monty hall um let me come back to a monty hall sorry i i i got a little that drained me getting stuck with a few things and trying to like maneuver between all these different windows how's everybody doing i need a break for sure um there should be moderators on this stream yes um but you know sometimes that's not the case so if we need some moderation help um let's um let's uh let's let's get there okay interestingly enough just just one last you indulge me with one last check so where i should see it oh no wait that doesn't make any sense okay i'm lost never mind i'm gonna come back to this later uh um and yeah it should so i i i went through a sort of opening discussion about this but i encourage everybody to um to play around the website um to to add your versions of things you've made from the videos to it and stay tuned in early june i will be returning to do a much longer session probably on twitch where we just spend all day kind of helping people and through adding stuff to the website okay well in theory i was going to be done in about 40 minutes but i'll probably go long so thank you mustafa okay so um i um um let's go to um the coding train for a second um under videos and here under the monty hall problem uh what am i not logged i'm not oh i'm in the incognito window okay let's go back to here and uh okay so i'll let this play i'm gonna do and um let's look at the comments so if you haven't um if you haven't seen this video yet i i would love for you to check it out this was a lot of fun to make my diagrams about a bayes theorem are still over there on the whiteboard um and so um i wanted to just talk about a few things so first let me just show you in case you didn't see that um if you want to experiment with this problem here is the web demo so the monty hall problem i'm going to just reexplain it briefly i'm going to talk about what i missed in the video for those of you who might have watched it and thank you for all the comments and the feedback this is the monty hall problem there is a prize behind one of these doors uh in the video i sort of say it's a trip on the coding train express um so i'm gonna pick a door one so i picked door one and then door two was open now this happened very fast in the actual in an actual sequence of playing this game out in a game show there would be a lot of fanfare and a lot of drama now the idea is that once i pick door number one the the the doors without the prize have a goat behind them is what you're using here you know of course the goat we all know is the true prize but um the idea here is that i've picked door number one and the host is going to open door number two to say like ah look there's a goat here so now in theory do you want to keep your door oh i'm gonna offer you a chance to switch like trying to reexplain this and running into some of the same issues so there's come so there's a couple things that in the video i didn't explain too well now in an actual game show the it might be that the host is intentionally trying to mislead you or not really explain all of the ins and outs of what's going on and just create this fun scenario where you have to really dramatically decide whether you're like are you going to switch and maybe you really had it or are you going to keep what you have but maybe you really should have switched like what do you do and sort of feels like a coin toss at this point because there's two doors we know the prizes in one of those places but what is really important about about this probability pro the specific problem that i'm talking about is that the host is all knowing the host knows what's behind all the doors so the host couldn't but so if the host didn't know anything and they were just like you picked door number one well let's show you one of the doors just to see those could buy accidents show you the prize and then you know you have 100 chance of losing at that point right you can't pick or switch because you can't switch someone but in this case the host there's only three there's only a couple possibilities one if there's only three three scenarios right one is you picked the correct prize in which case it doesn't matter which door the host opens uh you've got the prize under your door the other uh scenario is the prize is actually under door number three so the host has to open door number two the other scenario is the prize is under door number two and so the host has to open up door number three so i'm not necessarily doing a better job explaining this than i did in the video but i'm just trying to sort of rehash it and explain that i wasn't incredibly clear about that the host being i didn't mention it but you know it's a little tricky to follow in the video um and so one of the things that i did in the video in particular maybe we can find one of these comments let's just look and see if any of the i meant to go through and like um youtube keeps changing its interface and i can't find the comments now here they are um uh let's just see there were some useful ones um that people had get some nice corrections to me uh yes so this is simon has a great comment here so um one of the things that i said in the video was that um there and you could think of it as there are four possibilities right back to these doors again or no where what was i oh i was at the demo ah let me go back to simon's comment um sorry i've lost what i'm doing here um where's simon's comment there it is um that i s there you could think of it uh let's let's um let's refresh this right i'm picking door number one if the prize i said like let's say if the prize is behind them door number two then the host has to open up door number three if the prize is behind door number three the host has to open up door number two that's two scenarios now what if the prize is behind door number one well in the way that i explained it you might have been misled that there are now two other possibilities because the host could open door two or door three but those are one scenario right the idea that the way to think about this and i think this is much more clear maybe i'll just use the whiteboard for a second um is that hello welcome to the monty hall problem i am going to pick uh i'm the contestant i'm gonna pick door number one and now monty hall is going to say you could have door number one or you could have both doors number two and three so you know they all had prizes on to them first of all you'd probably want to take these two because probably the combined prizes would be more than just one price but regardless i don't know why i went off with that tangent you would want a switch because if you could have um two chances out of three over one chance out of three then absolutely you would want to so those are the three pot there's really only three possibilities door is behind here the prize is here the price is here or the price is here if you pick both doors two and three you're gonna lose when the price is here but you're gonna win when it's here or and you're gonna win when it's here so two out of three times you're going to win so it's very hard to wrap your head around it obviously i think you know it's often demonstrated well through playing out the simulation that's what this is for so if i put on auto run it's going to just play the game over and over again i'm going to turn the speed way up and we're gonna see it's just playing it and randomly deciding whether to switch or stay and you can see like over time like right now it's kind of doing better than expected it's like hovering up around 68 or 69 percent but over time and this should be around 33 and this should be around 67 the other thing that's um that i like about this demonstration is i can change to have it uh 25 doors for example so let me just do this for a second so um let's say i pick door 18 and the host shows all of those doors have goats do i want to switch like i'm i do really right because uh yeah there we go and i won the prize so we could do this again many many times and you know i'm gonna you know at some point i might lose by accident and then if i auto run this one we're gonna see that i haven't even so far out of all these times i'm still at zero percent eventually at some point this will be more than zero percent let's wait and see um right so alex is saying the best explanation is from brilliant so one of the reasons why i wanted to talk about this video today uh one is i just like to uh revisit previous videos that i made in the live stream and answer any questions and talk about comments um and uh i i i need to do a better job of being prepared for that because there were some other great comments there in that thread but i want to move on to looking at some apple basic stuff today and i also want to tell you about today's sponsor and i am going to manually oh i know why the banner didn't show up because i'm a dumdum and the banner the banner appears on this screen not on the other screen that's why it didn't show up at the beginning so i want to tell you about today's sponsor brilliant so this demo this dem live demo that i did of the monty hall problem where you can interact with it and try any given scenario whether auto running it this is like a pale in comparison to all of the incredible demonstrations and interactive lessons on math and science and probability and calculus and etc that are on the brilliant website so let's walk over i'm not walking anywhere i'm just going in my browser over to brilliant brilliant is a website full of interactive lessons and challenges and courses on all sorts of topics and the thing that i like to talk about is you know i appreciate that people watching the coding train watch my videos and that maybe you gain some inspiration you learn something and then but the most important thing of watching my videos is then going trying it yourself and brilliant is a thing that's all you're basically doing is trying things yourself and i think the the best um thing for me to show is just look at all these core i mean every time i look at this list of courses i'm like oh i want to do that one and that one and that one beautiful geometry is absolutely one of my favorites great uh great ideas for doing coding challenges and about fractals and infinity and all sorts of beautiful stuff i wanted to look today um at the um probability course um which is the there's there's several different courses but i want to look at the introduction to probability course i do want to point out though before i get there and i think this should come up um that one of the courses that brilliant has is their neural network course that i was looking at recently and there's this incredible i usually show the demonstration of it recognizing handwritten digits but this course actually allows you to play with neurons and activation functions to look at how the weights affect the output neuron and adjusting those weights and and looking at how activation functions and the different bits and parts of neural networks work so i really recommend if you're interested in machine learning and neural network stuff i would definitely recommend looking at that um let me come back over to here so let's start this probability course together for a little bit um sorry simon i don't have discord open right now i screwed up my screens today so i will look at it briefly if it's urgent you're gonna have to uh tell me uh sooner somehow what you're trying to get to me okay so let's start this lesson and let's make this uhoh suppose scientists detected a large asteroid headed straight for earth if the asteroid were to collide with earth how likely do you think it would be to hit a city all right about as likely as a person being hit by lightning about as likely as an expecting mother having twin children about as likely as a person correctly guessing a sixsided die roll okay i really don't think it's the bottom like if you think about the surface area of the earth how much of that first of all so much of it is just ocean right then the parts that's not ocean how much of it is it is it is its city so i definitely think that um i'm seeing there's a question in the chat about why i don't interact with the chat i do my best i'm really trying to get some someday i'll have this all worked out but i'm doing my best but yes the chat is not my my primarily primary point of focus i mean i want to say like it's probably the hit by lightning i don't you know maybe it's twix how often what are what is the what is the probability of having twins i don't know it's certainly one of these two what do you all think i'm looking at the chat to see i'm just gonna go with i'm gonna go with lightning by the end of the lesson we'll find out which answer was correct all right well clearly it's more likely to strike land i think that's right you can't hit a city oh canada city without also hitting land okay so that's true so uh okay so that was obvious i the question kind of tricked me because i sort of thought of it as city or noncity again this is why i like these and i haven't done this course before i specifically waited to do this with you live so i could embarrass myself fully in front of you all um the map shows the distribution of land and water okay so let's use it to estimate the probability that asteroid hits land it's less likely that's that to me with this by the way this is really interesting to look at this uh perspective view most of the times that we look at maps and this is i've talked about in other videos like mercator projection different kinds of ways of taking this the earth that is a sphere and turning it into a flat map really distorts the relative scale but looks like this view is doing a fairly accurate job but regardless i can see that it's more less likely to hit land okay less of the earth's surface is covered by land than by water okay that's right so let's keep going all right now imagine reshaping the areas covered by land and water a pair of rectangles uh this is cool see like i my instinct when i see these things is like oh i want to make this in p5 uh okay so this is cool adjust the divider so i'm gonna say this too much water okay uh correct 70 okay 30 covered by land there is a one out of three chance that the asteroid hits land um okay all cities are on land to find the property event identified on a grid of all outcomes the probability of n is the area of the event divided by the area of entire grid that totally makes sense um so let's look at that likely the asterisk hit some particular country if we know it hits land so russia covers 11 of all land so it's 11 of the 30 i think i might have been wrong here but let's see 11 canada 6 china 6 so russia being the largest we would say that it's most likely to be hit correct by the way one of the really nice things about brilliant also is i can um see these uh explanations as well and that one was fairly intuitive for me so i don't but many a time i'm checking oh and i have a hint since an earthbound asteroid is more likely to hit russia and india we can also estimate how much more likely uh so how much more likely is the asteroid to hit russia than india well if russia is 11 and india is 2 wouldn't it be 5 times more likely because 2 times 5 is 10. i hope that's right i could look at the hint correct okay i got it right we saw earlier that the asteroid hits a city with a probability of 30 percent by now we know probability equals relative area we can get much better estimate by finding earth's total urban area okay okay this nighttime view of the mediterranean sea oh cities show up and since they're brightly lit oh that's a lot more city than i thought that's more city than i saw just looking at this sort of european area what kind of land are the vast majority of cities located near water okay um okay uh coastal it turns out ten percent of all land on earth is coastal so being struck by lightning is exceedingly rare i think it must be the twins the twins thing but i think my instinct was wrong so 10 of the land is coastal land is that the green land i'm confused uh are the yellow i'm confused seventy percent is is that what i want i want it the other is green coastal too much coast no the other way around okay right the yellow is coastal i guess i should have gotten that okay correct splitting all land area into coast and inland gives us three regions got it ten percent ninety percent all right what's the probability that the asteroid strikes coastal land the strip of land that touches water okay so it's ten percent of thirty percent that should be three percent right three percent well okay you i definitely do not have a three percent chance of being struck by lightning but i think that's probably that sounds like about the probability for twins but maybe cities aren't all the coast i'm not sure since only three percent of the probably ask him to coastline is three percent okay the vast majority of cities are in coastal lands probability of a city impact should be no greater than three percent what information would let us add cities to the grid the total number of cities on earth the total number of coastal cities on earth the percentage of earth's coastal land area that's covered by cities well i would say the last one uh yeah everyone's uh um i want to say this let's look at the hint i feel like i need a hint here which would be easier to represent on a grid a number of cities or a percentage of land yes definitely a percentage of land so i was right because these are we useful to know the total number of cities but that that doesn't really give us any sense of like how much land they're taking up because how big are the cities except there could be a million cities if they're all like tiny tiny cities that would be much less than um you know 100 000 super big cities okay correct okay turns out that ten percent of all coastal land is covered by cities so it means it can spit up close to land and strip into two regions so ten percent of three percent is point three percent and that's sounding much more like probability of having twins yeah uh again like if there's a point three percent chance of being struck by lightning i don't know if that's in your lifetime or on any given day i don't that's that would obviously be there'd be a slight but i think it's so remote that almost that doesn't there's probably not that much of a distinction between those two having twins okay so i definitely got it wrong i don't know i i felt like so sometimes i have this instinct does that mean where i feel like i'm trying to be i'm trying to be tricked by the question so to me it seemed like the obvious answer was having twins but i thought i was trying to be tricked by the question so i i got afraid and slowly went by struck by lightning but obviously um if uh what i what i love about this lesson first of all is that i got it wrong and the steps really made it obvious how to think think this through so that was great um okay review and reflect uh puzzling result from medicine so actually i wonder if um look at me on my six day streak um people people there's lots of excellent feedback in the chat so you know the idea of this problem by the way is not really to get into the nittygritty of actual like sort of asteroid behavior it's more of a thought experiment of this very like sort of constrained scoped problem of all there happens to be an asteroid going towards earth it has an equal probability of hitting any given like latitude and longitude which may not actually be true based on like how the earth spins and all the gravitational stuff of all the things around it um but oh continue i didn't see that so um so i'm going to move on now but the reason why i'd really like this lesson thank you continue so this is really interesting um because i have a feeling and i um that this is leading towards bayesian probability so one of the most so i i in my video about the monty hall problem i tried to relate and you know we can see this still here um the monty hall problem to bayesian probability analysis and bayes theorem and i'm not going to rehash this right now but essentially this is bayes theorem and i was using various uh probability analyses of different pieces of the threedoor problem to then calculate the probability that you will win if you switch doors which is twothirds a much more common way to understand about bayes to to learn about bayesian probability analysis is to look at um the common scenario is looking at a medical testing so because one of the interesting things about a medical test you know testing like for example if we think about you know the the covid pandemic for example a coronavirus test is the tests aren't a hundred percent reliable right if i get a positive test saying i have covid well there's a high likelihood i really do have covid but there's a small there's a chance there that that was a false positive vice versa if the test is negative there's probably a higher chance of false false negative again you know don't quote me on these figures i'm not like i'm just talking about in the sort of abstract sense so getting a positive result uh is dependent one on the rate of false positives but not just that it also depends on like how common is having this disease or this uh i i've seen this done with different tests for cancer for example um so for example if if let's make up something like coding train illness coding trainingitis if you have coding if there's only a zero zero zero zero zero zero one percent chance you know one out of 100 million people in the world ever get coding train itis we all have coding trainitis by the way it's just it makes your arms move around like a kind of a crazy person um so uh one out of uh you know hundreds of millions of people get it you know even if you get a positive test it's so unlikely that you would have it you know what's the rate of false positives that's all of those prior probabilities um are as well as the sort of event probabilities associated with taking the test are going to inform the actual likelihood that you actually have coding train itis so that was kind of a very cursive this is why like you listen to me talk about this and that was kind of a you know i would say a b minus explanation um but if i were i'm assuming that if i were to go on to complete this course um we're gonna start getting uh uh we're gonna be walked through how to learn about probability and thinking about realworld situations the chant the probability to chance affects the results of imperfect imperfect disease tests okay um alex is saying that pacific ocean is actually 35 so thank you for um thank you for brilliant for sponsoring the coding train today thank you to um all of you for watching the coding train in this sponsorship segment i really find that it just it works well because it's like i'm not even veering off my content because my content is working through these kinds of interesting probability problems and math problems and geometry problems and um these uh working through these always give me ideas for things to do in future coding videos and coding challenges so uh if you want to learn more about brilliant go to brilliant.org codingtrain you can sign up for free and get started um giving it a try that lets them know you found great from me and if you want to unlock everything that brilliant has to offer um you the first 200 people to do so will get 20 off the premium subscription um i'll also just point out that if you already have brilliant um you can gift a subscription which is a really nice thing to do for somebody you don't know what to get for them they seem to have everything but they like learning they don't want to give them like stuff that's more like plastic and all of that it just kind of goes into a landfill um here we go this is a great gift as well okay so i'm going to take like a less than three minute break i'm putting that never mind whenever i look at him stop in the middle but it's 12 45 already i'm gonna give myself to 1 30 and i'm going to come back and i'm going to start doing some um some uh basic programming in an emulator and maybe i'll move my camera to show you what's going on with my apple ii plus as well i'm gonna do that during the break um all right here we go into intermission land all right so you know i'm just going to put this on i'm going to be i'm going to hopefully be less than five minutes i wonder if i can i can't it's a video that plays it's not the timer's not dynamic so i'll be back in less than five minutes but i am giving myself five minutes do do so do do all right i'm going to switch the camera to this hopefully you're seeing the apple ii plus computer right now and hearing me okay i can fade out the music um let me bring so i can see the chat let me bring this ipad over here with me um oh no no no okay great all right hi everybody um hello camera so this is my um apple ii plus um that if you've been following my saga that i've been posting a bit on twitter about that um this is my um original uh childhood computer but it i did get it to work for about a half an hour when i first turned it on but i'm just gonna say hi hi um but uh since then uh um the power supply kind of the some of the capacitors in started to smoke and fry and so one of the things that i was able to do is i got this um let me see if i'm just going to move the camera down a little bit i can't so i'm not seeing a live picture of the camera so i don't know what i'm doing but this is a power supply that i got from a reactive micro um you know i don't know i know how well this is going to work just moving the camera around but um you can see it here um so this is a a rebuilt power supply so i have that now built um comes with a nice little fan and so oops so that works quite well and um um what i'm gonna do is turn it on and turn this on and um i then also had some problems with the logic board and this is actually not the original i took all the expansion cards out i tried to fix some things uh like remove some of these chips and like check connections and stuff and clean some things but i wasn't having luck i actually just bought a um a repaired logic board for an apple ii plus off of ebay and that's what's in here right now so um last i checked this was working but let's see what's happening here and this is the monitor which i don't think is going to work so what i'm going to do right now unfortunately my monitors also stopped working and i was told don't open up your monitor you you get electrocuted so what i'm gonna do right now is i'm going to plug in this video cable i have this like little ah there we go look so uh i don't know what you're seeing now um so i don't know why i'm seeing garbledness that's not a good sign ah there we go look at that apple two plus so things are working and i have a stand for this monitor and everything i just i should have i should have clearly gotten that ready um and i can type things like uh print now by the way i cleaned the keyboard spacebar i still can't get to work i don't know why i cleaned the keyboard and kind of like took it apart and um so the keyboard is working much better now print oops whoops choo choo so i've typed print choo choo and i'm going to hit enter and there we go we wrote some apple basic and there it is um uh i'm just looking at the chat right now so um so i'm trying to figure out what so next week i'm planning to shoot this uh create this course and i'm hopefully by this weekend i'm gonna have more time to work on seeing you know somebody told me just try banging on your mind uh maybe i'll buy another monitor off ebay maybe i'll just use this monitor um but i really want to get i really want to do the course on this actual computer but it is quite awkward especially right now for me to to do that so i just wanted to show this to you um i'm going to turn it off now and turn off the monitor and i am going to hi hello i'm going to go back to my computer and run an emulator to show you some of the basic stuff put the monitor in front of the keyboard what does that mean uh yeah chris is writing my grandfather has um an apple two he's keeping as his father's memoirs on the floppy disk so these drives do work um so if i can help you read some discs these drives work but i i don't know that i want to be responsible for some precious uh restoring some precious yes like that okay um oh the cameras wasn't on the monitor well so apologies um i'm to just leave the camera here and i'm going back to my computer let me bring this back with me okay so here i am my computer went to sleep um let's look for so this is one that um this is a great i'm gonna let's use this one because this is a true emulator let's see okay how do i get the dos prompt with this uh do i have to load something i want to load applesoft basic let's see beaglebasic i have the beaglebasic disks let's just go to blank blank to us okay okay great oh no that's not it oh that's what i want oh look at this just i haven't used this emulator before i was using a different emulator but i just found this one oops um i'm confused let's open up beagle basic i'm very confused by this emulator nobody wants to help me in the chat hold on let's uh let's keep looking uh i actually was using this really cool downloadable emulator yeah this is the one i was using this one's pretty wild okay let's try this um so i'm gonna run this emulator i like having it as a totally separate application and i'm sure that i'm gonna have to do this okay we want to do applesoft basic interpreter there we go perfect i'm going to put caps lock on all right we're in business here so let me go to apple basic reference okay this is a pretty good reference all right so i have been studying up on basic in the last couple of weeks so i uh but the one thing i didn't get a chance to experiment with yet is graphics mode and so uh i want to do some programming today in i want to do some programming today using graphics mode so let's just get started by writing a pro so the way you write a program in basic is you have to give line numbers and um i'm gonna so i'm gonna create line number ten i'm just gonna call home so home is a command by the way that clears the screen if i type list it's going to show me what's in my program if i try run it's going to run my program so um actually we should do 10 print let's try to get 10 print going so if you're so uh let's actually let's do ten print ten print uh coding train so if you remember and this is gonna go to the old website but that's fine um this uh video that i did to create the 10 print algorithm in p5.js using canvas and drawing 10 print comes from the old commodore 64. this famous one line of code that either prints a random forward slash or a backward slash and when you layer that line by line by line it ends up creating this maze pattern so i know that i could say line 20 print slash so if i were to run this program it's going to clear the screen and print a slash and then if i were to say line 30 print forward slash then i could say i could run the program let's look at the program again i'm printing backslash and forward slash i could run the program and i wonder if this is big enough for everybody i should maybe zoom in on it and i get backslash and forward slash now how do i print them without the line break if i want multiple calls to print this i actually don't know um so the question is so let's see what happens if i just now add line 40 and i say go to 20. so go to this is like one of the wonderful things about oldtimey basic programming is when you get to um the way that you control the flow of a program is by actually referencing specific line numbers so this is now going to be essentially an infinite loop where it's going to clear the screen print backslash print forward slash go to 20. and so now i'm going to hit run and we can see now how would i get it to do that though without the line breaks semicolon at the end i'm being told now i need to control c we'll quit the program so um so if i change it to print forward slash semicolon 30 print backslash semicolon and now run it there we go okay so this is now but i'm obviously not picking them randomly so how do i pick them randomly well there is an r d function in basic um so i know and if somebody in the chat i think just put it in there this could certainly be done the whole point of the whole sort of conceit of the 10 print program is you do it in one line of code but i am going to attempt to do it so written in a lengthier way so the first thing that i want to do is store a random number so i'm going to add a line of code the reason why i let numbered them 10 20 30 40. so i know i knew the line of code needs to go between 10 and 20. so i'm going to make that 15. and i'm going to say let r equal rnd one and i believe um if i were to say print r and d one right you can see it's giving me a random number between zero and one so there already is built into even apple soft basic a random number generator so looking at the program i get this r value which equals random one so now i want to say i'm going to say line uh 16 if r is greater than 0.5 then go to 30. so um so basically what i'm doing is this is a very awkward clunky way of doing it but this is fun if if the number is greater than 0.5 that's a 50 chance of that skip all the way to line 30 which will say print the forward slash now if that's not the case it's not going to go to 30 so it's going to go on to line 20 and print the backslash so then at 25 i should say go to 40. right if we look at this program now this is so wonky but basically i'm saying pick a random number i can zoom into this so i can gesture to a little bit pick a random number if that random is greater than 0.5 then skip here to do backslash then we get to here and we go to line oh we don't want to go to line 20. line 40 needs to go back to line 15 now so 40 has to be go to line 15 right so if r is greater than 0.5 go to print the backslash then get another number if it's not greater than 0.5 we're going to sorry print the forward slash if it's not greater than 0.5 we're going to print the backslash and then i guess this could actually just say go to 15 but i kind of like the idea of like skipping this line because what if there are other things that were supposed to happen so now i am going to run this program and here we go it is ten print oh this is so awesome i didn't realize how happy this was going to make me i think i'd done i should have done that as a coding challenge make a little video i'm going to do apple basic coding challenges um after next week oh my god so fun first of all also like i don't know if you'd see this but i just love the sort of zoomed in look of these these little like rectangular pixels um just so lovely all right so there's so much more i could do with this and demonstrate but i wanted to look at the thing and i've been working with apple basic a lot in the last week but i wanted to look at graphics mode and just see how that was so um can i save this somehow uh save ten print dot what was the there was a a file extension for a basic program i don't remember what it is but now i'm going to do type txt did that actually save it somewhere today 107. yeah yeah look at that i don't know where this is on my computer but that's cool it saved it somewhere i i'll figure out where local tender it's probably just in like a default directory i guess if i were to go to i'm just curious where did it save it coding train micro m810 print.txt awesome that's really cool so i could if i were to say new new is a command that clears your program so there's no problem can i say load ten print dot txt load 10 print dot txt oh man i'm i think to be honest i think what i'm probably going to end up doing is using the computer more as a prop than doing the actual coding more on an emulator um dot um uh so i also um but what i was gonna say is the one that i was using is not a true emulator from what i understand is it this one no yeah this one so this is one that i was using which is really fun because um like it's a little bit easier because i can just sort of like type i have basically access to a more like modern text editor and um so for example now if i were to go and grab this code here paste it in here and hit run like i've got the program running here but it's quite a bit easier for me to like mess around with it you know i could say like oh let's change this to 0.75 and now i'm much more likely to have the forward slash et cetera et cetera by the way one thing that i found interesting is that there's no native apple basic delay function and the way that you would write a delay function i'm going to show you is uh let's let's make 45 go to 15 i'm gonna say four um i i forget i forget equals one two five thousand next uh next i so the way to do a delay is just to build into your code like a loop where nothing happens so let's just see what this does right so now i have like this slight delay that's doing them just like line by line but i look there's no weight there's no sleep nothing like that an apple basic i think this is actually weirdly enough the standard way to do it also i should point out then this is what i can do i can also make like i can put this as a function now it's not really a function but i can take this line of code and put it at like line 1000 then i can add a return statement right after it and so now i can use the go sub go sub is like a way of calling a function go to a subroutine this is a subroutine with line numbers much higher later that i can run this code and then return will send me back so this if i just wanted to make it a slight delay let's change it to 500 this would work pretty interesting stuff huh so i would love to build out like full projects with with apple basic okay so now what did i want to do i wanted to look at and i'm going to take a little bit of time here to look at the graphics mode so let's see let's use this gr set display to mixed test low resolution graphics clear to black so oh um so let's try and can i make this bigger well yeah i can i should have just done that in the first place okay so let's try saying by the way i think no let's try saying 10 home 20 gr oh let me let me say a new program there's nothing in there right now i'm going to say 10 home 20 gr and then let's try just doing a point zero to thirty nine oh is it forty by forty color equals color i don't have color here let's try just doing plot uh 10 oh do i do this plot 10 comma 10. plot expects two or three parameters at line 30. oh the graphics mode is still in there how do i get out of graphics mode ooh that's not what i meant to do uh how do you exit graphics mode another reference oh peek and poke i remember those plot graphics oh this is more stuff uh um okay uh clears text mode so maybe i do that so like ah yes whoa that's cool okay so i lost my code gr plot oh plot no parentheses plot uh 10 comma 10. oh 20. oh wait can i just hold on a second so let's just so one of the nice things about apple basic is i can just i don't need to write it as a program so i'm just putting this off to the side i can just write the commands now can you see this in the bottom here okay so let's try doing plot i don't see anything let's try the line h line from 0 to 40 at 10. oh i have to set a color maybe it's like black ah whoa cool ah i see h plot plots a dot what is the difference between h plot and plot h plot x one y one two x two y two whoops i think i crashed it whoa yeah each plot is not where it's crashing it that's interesting i was going to try to do like um um i was going to i was going to try to make a little like snake game like thing so let's just do 10 let's try writing this program 10 gr 20 let x equal 10 30 let y equal 10 um 40 um well let's let's do a random walk x equals x plus r and d 1 minus 0.5 oh no r and d times 2 minus 1. y equals y plus r and d times 2 minus 1. 60 color equals i'm just going to do 1 because i don't know what else to do and then 70 is plot now let's see if it can handle floating points and just like take off the decimal point and then 80 would be go to 40. all right should we give this a try anybody see anything i got wrong what happens when it goes off this is wild it's somehow like cycling around the edges automatically that is crazy okay how do i clear uh clear there must be like a hole clear full screen graphics mixed mode color on the screen oh you can actually get the pixel color at a given pixel that's wild um set the rotation to x for shape drawing do i have shape drawing so i don't believe i don't believe the argument i'm passing into rand is actually the range um let's look at the rand function i haven't gone through this in a lot of detail let's see if we can find it this is the actual documentation here if x is greater than zero a random number between zero and one if x equals zero repeats the last random number and if x is less than zero begins new repeatable sequence so the argument is more about seeding the random the random value oh look i have math functions so the other thing i wanted to do is so let's let's go back to um so i wanted to see if i could get keyboard control so i believe oops do not want to print i i see remember peak is a way to look at the value in a given memory address and there is a memory address for the last key pressed i believe so peak apple basic key press uh whoa there's actually a um i've seen when i was looking the other day i saw in a manual a page that described oh tetris for apple basic that would be fun to try um oh so i'm just taking a peek i'm taking a peek at the chat uh applesoft is what i'm looking for this is what i was looking at maybe the big tip book the funny thing is i have manuals for apple basic and stuff just sitting over there i'm uh somewhere was it in this book there was like a chart for peak and poke well this is wild i mean really like in the dawn of personal computers you you had to programming was the whole point yeah look at this the lay loops look your apple doesn't mind in fact it's good for him slash her i think them would be the would be more appropriate okay print peek 51 what language you're using okay oh i need to go sub poker integer basic i want to uh memory and speed look at this this is incredible oh i need to read this whole thing look at this tip clear mem i'm expander like right i mean there's like literally 48 kilobytes of ram oh that apple 2 plus you know this computer has what eight eight gigabytes of ram 80 columns okay 40 columns this is for the text um too long i'm like text tips page inverse inverse typer input oh right input a oh that's fun to reverse what you type in that would that's a fun little challenge text screen um peak 49152 yeah this is the old 49512 let's see it read slot regain paddle toggle speaker read keyboard here it is if 127 the key has been pressed okay four nine five one two so uh so 40 will be i'm going to say let's c equal peak 49512 um and then actually so let's let's do this um hold on ctrl c well that's fine put it in there um 50 print c so that's fine i'm just plotting it just should be printing over and over again what key was pressed let's see a b why am i only getting 136. one five not five one what was it four nine one five two no wonder thank you 32 yeah okay now we get different numbers there's no reason why i can't convert that into a character and i should be able to say let's see now a string in apple b in basic you have to indicate the type of what's in the variable by so i can have c would be the number and this would be i believe there's a function yeah it's actually filling this in for me where i can do this but i think i need to subtract 127 from it well let's not bother to try let's just see what happens first um so now um 55 is um print let's print that all right so i have an x and a y i'm peeking out what's in the keyboard converting it to a character and again there's a lot of wasted memory here so but i'm just writing out the long printing it out and plotting x so let's run this now k a b c d e f g h i j k l n n o p perfect i don't know why i saw that somewhere i was looking at some examples they were subtracting 127 but maybe that was doing like lower lowercase or something okay so now oh what are the arrow keys oh this is a problem if i want to use the arrow keys i'm not seeing anything here u k j this is weird well let's just use wasd i'm going to do that okay so um i keep having clear which doesn't do anything so now what i want to do is say 56 if c equals a then x equals x plus 1. no no x minus 1. 57 if c equals d then x equals x plus 1. 58 if c this is very bad that i'm how i'm doing this c equals w then y equals y minus 1. i assume it counts from top to bottom just like modern graphics windows if c equals s then y equals y plus 1. all right um so i start at 10 comma 10 i look at what's in the keyboard convert it to a character and then i'm checking if i do a d wrs and then changing the x and y values accordingly okay old school is z x for left right and p l for up down yeah so let's do this now why is this not working okay we gotta debug um okay i have an idea so i'm going to debug by printing both what's in c and the value of the boolean expression c equals the boolean test i don't think there's any double equals in old timey basic oh whoops what just happened here i'm so confused hold on this is why i want to use that other emulator because ah let me just try something here will you please let me copy paste this no it won't let's do save uh i'm setting c to a i don't think so there is no there is no a boolean expression oh but the printing might not work because i've done this that's not true that's true so this is what i'm doing in the code i want to print the value of the variable test and the colon allows me to do oh not colon semicolon semicolon colon allows me to put so that is setting c equal to a so that definitely was setting c equal to a this is what i meant to do a1 ah so this should be print c semicolon a space semicolon c equals a all right now this i should be able to debug yes huh so it seems to be now it seems to be working uh but i i'm so confused yeah yeah yeah yeah if you're constantly reading the last key pressed yeah i wonder if it makes sense for me to um only do it if there's a new i have an idea oh this is so so crazy what if unfortunately i could put a delay in there but i have a weird idea what if i were to say let's say 35 let i know what to call this i'm going to call it direction and i'm going to set it equal to just zero so i'm going to start with a direction of zero and i'm going to say after i read the character and let's just change 40 to be let c equal cr hr string peak 4 4 4 9 1 5 2. so there was really no reason for me to have line 40 and 50. i could do it all at once so line 50 can now be if c is equal to the direction then set the direction back equal to zero so like oops i'm sort of thinking this through as i'm doing it so i want to do something where if the character is what it was last then direction is zero and then i can say um go to let's do 55 go to 56. uh all right so i'm starting with the direction and then but oh oh no no no no no no no no do i need to go sub can i do two things with a then i think i can like can i say if c is equal to dir if it's the same then oh why don't i just go to just skip go to line 80 like don't draw anything new just skip everything that's fine and then 55 i want to say dir equals c so get the new thing and then oh i should have i already have to rewrite all these lines of code oh that's terrible see this is my kingdom for a code editor if dir dollar sign equals a hold on let me just look at this and see if this is right so i'm starting at 10 comma 10 and i'm starting with don't move anywhere then i'm going to read the current character if it's a new character then set that to its direction execute the move plot the thing go back to read another character now if it's the same character it's going to skip okay i think this is right so i just think unfortunately i have to the way i wrote this there's got to be a different way of doing this but and y equals y minus 1. i hate that i have no lines left in between if d i r equals s then y am i missing a parenthesis on lines 56 to 59 no there are no parentheses around boolean expressions in basic and also like why no this does nothing i guess i just i just the lines of code are too long um okay wait i need some debugging uh so what do i need to do i want to line 45 print what it's reading and let's print that and d this is what it's reading and this is the current value of dir so it's reading d and it is d but why is nothing moving oh there should be yeah i'm busy once i get a new character it should go do the things all right let's let's i just want to like enter in 45 um how do i delete a line can i just do this 45 is gone now let's print um let's print do we ever get here do we ever get here do we ever get to the point we should as soon as we get a character that's new we should get there yeah okay so every time we type in a new character i'm seeing the old let's be methodical about this a b c d e f that makes sense c d uh every time i k um oh hold on why is this this is backwards use ren to renumber the program oh your character quality check yeah the character oh maybe the character equality check isn't right okay hold on hold on ah no oh no i lost it i lost it i typed exit just like instinctually and i hadn't saved it it just like quit oh my god i lost all my code right it's gone completely gone oh it's like i'm like i don't know why i typed that it was just like it came out of my brain okay hold on uh wait i don't know why we're converting a key press to a character yeah because i don't want to have to like check the number oh that's why there's 127 maybe i didn't save it to test i'd saved there was that test.txt but that was that was oh that's actually okay so hold on all right let's oh it's not letting me copy paste all right let's go back to just for because it's all 140 and i really got to get going here um i'm gonna cheat a little bit no no i'm not i i gotta get this done okay i'll just use this as a reference i'm a fast typer i'm a fast typer so let me actually not do all of this because let's do 4 c40 let c equal i want to try it just with my converting it uh let's what if i do this let's let's try with my converting it let c equal oh sorry peak 4 9 1 5 2. if c equals a print a and you know that let's just try this 60 go to 40. i keep letting exit again what's wrong with me what what is why am i doing that ah it's like some weird instinct home is what i'm trying to type oh my god everybody stay calm okay uh oh peek i clearly i need to eat lunch i'm all right sorry everybody okay now whatever i type goes in here okay um now yes so whatever i'm getting is not equal to the a character it's easier to work with the underlying number i know that's what i should do but i have a feeling this is what it wants me to do oh just one parenthesis there okay all right fine we're gonna work with the number okay good idea oh wait no 65. four nine ah 193 yeah 193 127 right no 128 128 okay okay let's go into graphics mode uh oh you know i could do the arrow keys then 139 136 149 138 136 is left 149 is right up is 1 whoops 149 is right 136 up is 139 and down is 138 okay okay okay everybody here we go ready uh so oh man i had all that code so i've gotta rethink that logic so what i wanna have is a variable dir the let is optional by the way dir is zero um oops i didn't mean to overwrite that and then 50 c equals peak 49152 if dir equals c then go to 40. just go back keep reading from the keyboard until there's something new oops if i forgot to do a line number dr equals c go to just go back to reading whoops oh lets me do the up arrow that's so nice can you really do that on an apple ii plus okay 193. okay so go back to 40. otherwise keep going and say if dir is equal to 136 x equals x plus one no minus one and let's just only do that right now then 80 80 90 100 so let's say 110 color equals one 120 plot x comma y 130 go to oh don't this shouldn't be go to 40 it needs to be go to 50 but let's this is go to 50 and 60 let's just do this let's always draw it if dir equals c go to 120 or go to 110. so i'm going to be drawing over itself but that's fine then i need it then also i needed that save uh snake dot txt okay in case i lose it again okay go to graphics mode start at 10 comma 10. start without moving check the key board if the keyboard is something new great based on what it is oh only if it's to the left move to the left and draw it then check the keyboard again let's see you have bad code on line 193 now there's no more line 193 dir will be zero oh right sorry so 65 i need to say dir equals c thank you that's something i missed so i if it's a new thing i pick up that value lot syntax error line 70. oh uh text if oh i forgot that then if dir equals 136 then x equals x minus one no parentheses oh no but that's on the line ah 70. if dir equals 136 then x equals x minus 1. okay and let's just add some more of them i can type fast 80 if dir equals 149 then x equals x plus 1 90 if dir equals 139 then y equals y minus 1 100 if dir equals 138 then y equals y plus 1. all right here's the whole program clear oh there's poke 49168 to clear the keyboard oh i could have done that i actually just done that but that's fine that's good to know that would be a better solution so just always clear the keyboard but why are some then oh so i'm doing everything in all capitals because my apple ii plus doesn't support lowercase my older one but um this emulator does so uh but it's not case sensitive i don't even think variable names are case sensitive yeah yeah variable names are not nothing's case sensitive let's try running it oh all right oh i can't do it i can't do it more than once in a row oh this is so silly it's not just a new one so i do need this clear keyboard thing so so for the ren does that renumber oh it renumbered everything for me look at that so that's really useful renumber will just take all my weird lines of code and renumber everything and even the go to's are all updated don't type exit don't type exit you want to clear the keyboard and reset dir yeah so what was clearing the keyboard poke right so after i draw let's say poke what was it what was it clear keyboard clear keyboard 49168 comma zero four nine one six eight comma zero so then 103 0 i don't need oh no no no no yeah 103 0 i don't need then 1040 let's say dir equals peak 49152 and then get rid of 106 0. so i'm just getting the keyboard i don't need 105 0. i'm getting the keyboard i'm getting the direction moving x and y plotting it clearing the keyboard and then going back oh there we go well that was much easier than i thought so i could definitely do the snake game now i need an array and some other stuff all right look at that oh so many possibilities save it yes keyboard draw i don't know what to call this all right everybody i don't know what i did with today i hope you enjoy tuning in it seems to be a lot of people watching so let's before i go let's do another round of gifting memberships all right everybody this is way too much fun for me not to just do that okay before i go don't leave people don't leave because i am about to gift here we go everybody okay uh thank you to brilliant for sponsoring today's live stream check brilliant out at brilliant.org codingtrain uh lots of fun math and science and probability based things to learn uh i'm seeing all the gifts go to focus on me junaid rigid abhishek astro penguin gulam jason khon ryan eru you've just won a membership the coding train don't really get anything with it but you can try syncing your youtube account with your discord account you know in theory members get stickers but you have to be kind of a member for a few months so uh you know maybe go easy on the requesting the stickers if you just got my little membership gift um but uh thanks everybody i um i should be back so the so the monty hall problem video came out the wave function collapse video is currently 90 minutes long actually what i could have been doing for the last hour was watching it through and kind of like finding some more things to edit out um but and i think it's going to be at least another week or so before that's ready um but there's a a big video on a long video on coding a wave function collapse algorithm from start to finish that will be coming out soon on the coding train um thank you everybody uh if you enjoyed this like coding in apple basic let me know because i think i would actually like to do some videos where i'm just building projects in apple basic those will come later after i do this nebula class but um but yeah so um thanks everybody um i really appreciate you i appreciate you being here i appreciate you watching my videos and sending me nice messages on twitter and all that stuff um did i do that on twitch i don't remember i don't know what you're referring to dj mangus and i'm sorry that i didn't have discord open and all that stuff um everybody say a prayer for my um apple ii oh that's just the power supply apple ii plus computer and um oh and jason is wearing your refactor it now tshirt so thank you everybody i will see you next time on the coding train hopefully everything goes well next week i'll be back live streaming next friday no more i i misread that no apple basic you said more apple basic all right more apple basic coming soon uh check out twitch because i i continue to do live streams there also as well um check out the new website all that stuff all right everybody uh goodbye and i will see you next time on the coding train oh wait why am i playing that as always i always forget that this stop this stop this stop just stop i'm going to do this hi everybody my mic is still on i've completely like all the energy has drained from my body this dot never forget this dot somebody composed that song for me i'm gonna say once again here we go coordination autotune and the internet will fix that for me unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what else is there yes kittens thank you very much kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice that look what i get i'm really losing my mind okay let's do it and kittens kids i feel just sort of like a nice feeling of relaxation everything's gonna be okay today dream is not broken it has not frozen this is a this is a wonderful thing okay we're gonna do it i'm really getting to something i need my sound effects all sorts of text generation analysis things that i will use continuously over and over again first thing i need to do is kittens kittens and yes and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens you
