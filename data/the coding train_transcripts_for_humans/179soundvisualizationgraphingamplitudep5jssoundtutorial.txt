00:00 - hello welcome to another video with
00:02 - p5.js sound as you can see the previous
00:04 - video this is the result of that one
00:06 - where I have this talking ellipse which
00:09 - moves as I speak is really just
00:12 - responding not to my voice but any sound
00:15 - and so what I want to do is now connect
00:19 - this same volume listening thing to an
00:22 - mp3 file instead of my voice and see
00:24 - what happens when we get that so let's
00:25 - take a few steps to do that the first
00:27 - thing I need to do is well make sure I
00:29 - have an mp3 file which I do you can see
00:32 - it right here it's called this dash dot
00:33 - dash K P it's a little song about not
00:36 - forgetting the this dot and JavaScript
00:38 - that Christian Petersen on soundcloud
00:41 - created I'll include a link in this
00:43 - video to that song if you want to mess
00:44 - with it let me go to the code and what I
00:47 - want to do is I want to say I'm going to
00:48 - create a variable called song and I'm
00:51 - just going to use the preload function
00:53 - to load that sound this dot Kate KP dot
01:02 - mp3 and then I'm going to say a here
01:06 - song dot play so let's just run it like
01:09 - that make sure the sound plays as always
01:11 - I always forget the dis stop this stop
01:13 - this stop just duck Energy's this stop
01:15 - is a this fist stop this dock just done
01:18 - I'm gonna do the phrase easy stop is
01:20 - done so of course it's working so to
01:24 - speak because the mic is listening the
01:26 - sound is coming out of the speakers and
01:28 - the mic hears that but I think what you
01:30 - might ultimately really want to do here
01:32 - is not listen to this song through the
01:34 - microphone but actually connect the song
01:36 - itself and to do that you need something
01:39 - in p5 called an amplitude object so I'm
01:41 - going to in this example now get rid of
01:43 - the mic completely and I'm just going to
01:50 - set the volume equal to one here and we
01:53 - can see if I run this again as always I
01:57 - always forget to this stop this stop
01:59 - this stop just done in order for the
02:02 - song to be able to pause so we don't I
02:05 - don't have to we don't to listen to
02:06 - constantly while I'm talking or whatever
02:07 - I'm just going to add quickly a button
02:12 - and I'm going to call it a toggle and I
02:18 - want to say button mouse pressed toggle
02:22 - toggle song and so I need to write a
02:26 - function called toggle song where if
02:31 - song is playing song pause otherwise
02:37 - song dot play so I think if I just add
02:40 - that really quickly
02:42 - my unmute the tab as always I always
02:46 - forget this stop this stop this stop
02:48 - just dr. Randi so I should now I can at
02:52 - least play him pause the song really
02:53 - easily right there in the browser and
02:55 - that'll make working with you you
02:57 - watching this video presumably a little
02:59 - easier okay so now I have this song
03:01 - loaded and I have it playing now how do
03:04 - I listen to the amplitude so I need to
03:08 - add another variable I'm going to call
03:09 - it a mp4 amplitude amplitude being
03:12 - another word for volume and in setup I
03:15 - can create amplitude equals new p5
03:19 - amplitude object now here's the thing
03:22 - the next step should probably be or
03:26 - might likely be in many spheres of
03:29 - existence connect the amplitude analysis
03:33 - object to the song so there's an
03:37 - amplitude object and a song object and
03:40 - they need to be connected so the
03:41 - amplitude object can listen to the
03:42 - amplitude of the song the thing about is
03:44 - what p5 will do I think if I've got this
03:47 - correct automatically behind the scenes
03:49 - is just kind of that amplitude object is
03:51 - just going to listen to the stuff that's
03:53 - playing by default so I really only have
03:55 - to get into the detail of this if I have
03:57 - multiple songs playing at the same time
03:59 - and only want to listen to one but we
04:01 - don't really have to worry about this I
04:02 - should just be able to say a and P get
04:04 - level let's see what we've got here now
04:07 - as always I always forget to this stop
04:10 - this stop this stop this duck and indeed
04:12 - this style is Dido Vegas
04:14 - stop sir make a little bit character
04:16 - this stock will stop is enough this
04:18 - stock okay but before I do that I think
04:22 - something that might be interesting to
04:24 - try in this video is a to graph that
04:27 - volume level so let's think about how we
04:30 - might do that so there's a variety of
04:33 - ways we could do that but I think
04:34 - something a useful way might be I'm
04:37 - going to create a variable called
04:38 - history which is just an array and I'm
04:42 - going to say each time through draw I'm
04:47 - going to say history dot push volume so
04:51 - let's run this again as always I always
04:53 - forget to this stop it's not push is not
04:56 - a function line 30 history dot push bar
05:00 - history ah you know what I think history
05:04 - is probably the worst name of anything I
05:06 - could ever come up there with there
05:08 - because and this happens a lot of
05:09 - JavaScript I'm working with p5 in the
05:12 - global namespace meeting I'm just like
05:15 - I'm just writing variables I'm doing
05:17 - whatever I want borrow this borrow that
05:19 - function this and you know it this can
05:22 - get you into it's great for prototyping
05:24 - and getting started and make it stuff
05:25 - and sketching out ideas but you do there
05:28 - are things like what if I were to say
05:30 - var window that's a big problem - I have
05:33 - a feeling history is a kind of built in
05:36 - global variable in javascript in the
05:38 - browser that is related to the browser's
05:39 - history or some so I'm going to say
05:41 - volume history vol history and I'm gonna
05:47 - do this now it's always I already miss
05:50 - stopped this stuff and I got this stuff
05:52 - looking again so here's stop this stop
05:54 - is this dis daca see already I've cut
05:57 - this is giant array with every single
06:00 - volume value from whenever this program
06:02 - started so let's go back to the code and
06:05 - let's do something with that so what I
06:08 - want to do is I'm going to say for VAR i
06:09 - equals 0 is less than vol history dot
06:13 - length i plus plus let's just draw a
06:16 - little point point i comma whatever the
06:22 - volume is so let's do that let's comment
06:27 - out the ellipse
06:28 - and here we go as always I always forget
06:32 - the dis daughter stop that kids don't
06:34 - get going on this stuff is Stowe why not
06:37 - so one thing that's going on here is
06:39 - what I want is I want that volume but
06:41 - just between zero and one when it's at
06:44 - point five I want to see it in the
06:45 - middle of the screen maybe when it's at
06:47 - one I want to see it at the top when
06:49 - it's at zero I want to see it at the
06:50 - bottom so really what I should do is I
06:52 - should get a y-value which is mapping of
06:55 - all history which goes between zero and
06:57 - one and I want to say when it's one when
07:01 - it's zero I want it to be at the bottom
07:02 - of the window and when it's one I want
07:04 - it to be at the top and so I'm kind of
07:08 - inverting that mapping and now I should
07:10 - be able to do this now let's run this as
07:14 - always I always get to this stop this
07:16 - stop I add a stroke I think this stop
07:19 - this stuff as always I always forget to
07:21 - this stop this stop this source in that
07:24 - ball you wrapped over time but this is
07:26 - no less the pace done you know a couple
07:29 - things that I want to do here number one
07:30 - is I want to actually draw this as a
07:32 - continuous form so I'm going to say
07:34 - begin shape and end shape and change
07:36 - this to vertex and I'm gonna say no fill
07:40 - because I just want it I don't want to I
07:42 - don't want to fill in the vertex so I'm
07:44 - gonna do that as always I always forget
07:46 - the dis stop this stop this stop just up
07:48 - and see them all you be a stop there and
07:50 - that's what I can do is I can just say
07:52 - yeah this is top of all history da this
07:56 - time if ball history dot length is
08:00 - greater than width then I can just save
08:05 - all history dot splice I want to get I
08:08 - want to up the the first element so I'm
08:12 - kind of like building up the history and
08:14 - then once I get to the end I want to
08:18 - delete the oldest one and get the new
08:21 - history because I just want to see the
08:22 - graph from what it's been with it with
08:24 - this then this or the most recent
08:26 - history so if I run this again as always
08:28 - I always forget to this stop this stop
08:30 - this stop this done
08:32 - this stock the stock singers rappers
08:34 - stop this stop just stop this stop just
08:37 - stop
08:37 - I just got this job yeah I could Center
08:40 - it so mikalai in the chat mentions I
08:43 - could Center it o clappy bird that was
08:45 - the idea yeah so I'm going to Center it
08:49 - meaning when it's zero I want it to be
08:56 - at a height / - right
09:01 - as always I always forget to do so but
09:03 - it stopped it stopped actually what I
09:05 - really want is like this naturally I
09:07 - guess search throughout the range is
09:09 - done have about the center vibe well
09:11 - this time guys came to stop make this
09:13 - work this table this table I should make
09:17 - a red vertical line to show a real-time
09:19 - style then I like that idea
09:21 - okay so oh I could Center it like yes so
09:28 - what if I did something like but you
09:31 - guys are giving me all sorts of silly
09:33 - idea so those if I were to make a red
09:36 - line that is where that is is line at
09:42 - the end with which is really uh with
09:45 - comma zero with comma one of course it's
09:49 - really with minus one so if I run this
09:53 - as always I always forget the dis stop
09:55 - this stop this stop this duck an
09:57 - easy-access stop is savvy on this this
10:00 - stop is docked is done this falls
10:04 - this dock starts on this dog this dock
10:09 - is God as always I always forget to this
10:13 - stop now just stop just stop
10:15 - and indeed this stop is dying I mean yes
10:17 - when I could you know just docking today
10:19 - is if it's greater than we always stop -
10:23 - if you talk as always I always forget to
10:26 - this stop this stop this stop just stop
10:28 - and indeed this stop this stop is this
10:30 - this stop this dock kill anyway I can
10:32 - keep going with this I think this ends
10:34 - this video and in the next video I'm
10:37 - gonna work that stop how I can listen to
10:40 - more information about the sound other
10:43 - than just the volume so what would it
10:45 - mean instead of listening to the overall
10:46 - amplitude to listen for the amplitude at
10:49 - various different frequency levels okay
10:51 - see you in a future video
10:53 - and we're back some of the chat had a
10:55 - great suggestion I misunderstood that
10:56 - your suggestion which is not sort of
10:58 - centering the graph on the page but what
11:00 - if this does discuss maybe that rat this
11:05 - is the first volume I'm always drawn at
11:08 - the center point and so the whole thing
11:11 - is kind of shifts up and down that might
11:13 - visually create an interesting effect so
11:14 - I'm going to use translate for this so
11:16 - what if I were to say let me give myself
11:19 - a little more space here this is where
11:22 - I'm calculating the Y value so this is
11:25 - the Y position that's where that vertex
11:27 - is being set but before I do any of this
11:30 - okay so let's do this let's map it
11:33 - between zero and height and let me say
11:37 - though translate to height divided by
11:41 - two so in this case as always I always
11:44 - forget the dis stop it stop it stop just
11:46 - done whoops
11:48 - did I do that in the wrong place Oh
11:50 - can't translate sorry zero height
11:53 - divided by two as always I buy that it
11:55 - is negative rates with you as always I
11:58 - always forget live now translate put it
12:00 - on this stuff energy this stop is
12:02 - let's get rid of the red line is done
12:05 - I'm gonna do this and what I want to do
12:07 - though is actually take the current
12:10 - volume right what's the current Y level
12:13 - so the current y whatever the newest
12:20 - right current y is whatever that actual
12:25 - current volume is and what if I
12:27 - translate everything up but shifted by
12:32 - that volume negative height divided by 2
12:35 - plus that current Y as always I always
12:41 - forget about this stop this stop this
12:43 - stop just done I just want to translate
12:45 - back by current Y right as always I
12:49 - always forget to this stuff if I want to
12:51 - get off this duck and ejector is stop
12:53 - this stop as always I always forget the
12:56 - dis stop let's stop this stop just done
12:58 - and then he's talking with the vista red
13:00 - line that just stuck gonna forget to
13:03 - this stop this stop this stop this duck
13:05 - and then that got put up this dis stop
13:08 - it stop this dotted red line should not
13:10 - be affected by this this stop as always
13:14 - I always forget you this stop this stop
13:16 - this stop I don't know if this is better
13:17 - or worse I'm glad I kind of imagined
13:20 - this little different attack this dog
13:21 - Athena okay we'll be back this next
13:23 - video this stops

Cleaned transcript:

hello welcome to another video with p5.js sound as you can see the previous video this is the result of that one where I have this talking ellipse which moves as I speak is really just responding not to my voice but any sound and so what I want to do is now connect this same volume listening thing to an mp3 file instead of my voice and see what happens when we get that so let's take a few steps to do that the first thing I need to do is well make sure I have an mp3 file which I do you can see it right here it's called this dash dot dash K P it's a little song about not forgetting the this dot and JavaScript that Christian Petersen on soundcloud created I'll include a link in this video to that song if you want to mess with it let me go to the code and what I want to do is I want to say I'm going to create a variable called song and I'm just going to use the preload function to load that sound this dot Kate KP dot mp3 and then I'm going to say a here song dot play so let's just run it like that make sure the sound plays as always I always forget the dis stop this stop this stop just duck Energy's this stop is a this fist stop this dock just done I'm gonna do the phrase easy stop is done so of course it's working so to speak because the mic is listening the sound is coming out of the speakers and the mic hears that but I think what you might ultimately really want to do here is not listen to this song through the microphone but actually connect the song itself and to do that you need something in p5 called an amplitude object so I'm going to in this example now get rid of the mic completely and I'm just going to set the volume equal to one here and we can see if I run this again as always I always forget to this stop this stop this stop just done in order for the song to be able to pause so we don't I don't have to we don't to listen to constantly while I'm talking or whatever I'm just going to add quickly a button and I'm going to call it a toggle and I want to say button mouse pressed toggle toggle song and so I need to write a function called toggle song where if song is playing song pause otherwise song dot play so I think if I just add that really quickly my unmute the tab as always I always forget this stop this stop this stop just dr. Randi so I should now I can at least play him pause the song really easily right there in the browser and that'll make working with you you watching this video presumably a little easier okay so now I
