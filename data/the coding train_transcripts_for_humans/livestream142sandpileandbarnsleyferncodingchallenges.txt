With timestamps:

00:02 - no yes
00:12 - if you see me in my life
00:32 - okay so that confirms that today's
00:34 - livestream has begun
00:36 - I haven't who ukulele apparently needs
00:39 - to be tuned you know one of the reasons
00:47 - one thing that I really want to do is
00:54 - that I would like to make a like guitar
01:01 - tuner string tuner violin tune or
01:02 - ukulele tuner application I can't do I
01:13 - can't my break and I concentrate on more
01:15 - than one thing at a time
01:17 - [Music]
01:36 - all right I'm not gonna sing or use the
01:39 - ukulele right now too much longer I just
01:42 - wanted to see how that goes I'm here so
01:45 - welcome everybody today is a Tuesday it
01:48 - is I don't know if it's definitely the
01:50 - summer time yet it's June I have
01:54 - listened to you all many of whom have
01:57 - said I'm a little tired of the machine
01:59 - learning tensorflow jazz stuff and I am
02:04 - this is not the end of the tension float
02:06 - is machine learning stuff but I'm gonna
02:08 - take a break from that today I will be
02:10 - back tomorrow and I'm going to tomorrow
02:12 - work on building an actual classifier
02:16 - with some actual data that's the next
02:19 - step that I'm gonna do in my machine
02:21 - learning tutorial series and I'm gonna
02:23 - at the end of this livestream talk about
02:26 - the data set that I think will will work
02:29 - well for this idea that I have so I'll
02:32 - be here for a couple hours and sometime
02:33 - about a half an hour before it's time to
02:35 - go I'm gonna start trying to build a
02:37 - little web page where people where I'm
02:40 - in a crowd source this dataset about
02:42 - color that I want to talk about all
02:43 - right so I hadn't erase this in a moment
02:45 - so what am I going to do today so it's
02:47 - been a little while since I just did
02:49 - some frivolous algorithmic coding
02:52 - challenges and so that's the plan for
02:54 - today to catch up on some of those so
02:56 - let me head on over to rainbow topics
03:02 - I'm going to go I like what one thing
03:05 - that I do is I if it's something that
03:07 - I'm kind of thinking about doing it soon
03:09 - ish I assign it to myself so I'm gonna
03:12 - go here and these are the ones of Simon
03:16 - loyal coding trained viewers Simon Tiger
03:19 - has suggested quite a few excellent
03:21 - suggestions I just have not gotten to
03:23 - recently so barn Tilly's fern is one and
03:26 - the other one Oh sand piles is enough
03:30 - so these are the two that I would like
03:32 - to do obviously this morning but it's
03:34 - really not the morning these are the two
03:36 - that I would like to do today I kind of
03:38 - want to do I kind of I did I kind of
03:47 - want to do this
03:49 - this four-dimensional hypercube
03:53 - tesseract thing because maybe if I could
03:55 - simulate this in processing I might
03:57 - suddenly be able to take over the
03:59 - universe that's what I hear happens when
04:01 - you get one of these but do some
04:09 - research I mean the one I'm looking at
04:10 - this and I can see I mean there's
04:12 - there's really like eight cubes here but
04:14 - in a way there's I see very clearly if I
04:19 - could freeze this at this moment like
04:21 - now there's kind of like an inner cube
04:23 - and an outer cube and the vertices of
04:25 - the inner cube are kind of moving and
04:27 - then expanding and then growing and then
04:28 - peeling back so I feel like just to I
04:32 - really what I really need are eight one
04:34 - two three four five six seven eight
04:36 - sixteen points and I just need those
04:38 - points to follow there's these
04:40 - consistent paths and then I need to
04:41 - connect them and that will visualize
04:43 - this all right I don't know I'm afraid
04:47 - to try this right now so I'm not going
04:51 - to I am however going so I'm going to
04:54 - start today with sand piles let me think
04:57 - is there any housekeeping that I need to
05:04 - do ah
05:05 - I have a very important question for you
05:07 - the viewer watching right now is my mic
05:11 - is the is my voice speaking is the
05:12 - microphone is the sound quality good on
05:14 - the most recent coding challenge that I
05:17 - uploaded or I saw okay let's do X or
05:21 - again but like the different way no no
05:25 - more X or solving X or coding John's but
05:27 - in that tensorflow jazz X or coding
05:29 - challenge that I uploaded the other day
05:31 - might I think I had the microphone
05:32 - turned up too high there was a lot of
05:34 - when I listened back to it was the my
05:36 - voice was peaking and kind of getting
05:38 - staticky so I want to hear that this
05:40 - sounds okay today sounds great all sides
05:43 - it sounds good
05:44 - it is like two sliding rostral rights it
05:46 - is like two sliding cubes one larger I
05:48 - think I probably should take some time
05:50 - to go over the calendar with everybody
05:52 - um so one thing that I'm trying to do is
05:56 - that if I go to the channel you'll see
05:59 - that this is live now 367 people
06:02 - watching and then upcoming live streams
06:05 - this is tomorrow I might push this back
06:07 - to 11:30 but I'm trying to get get
06:10 - started by 11 this is tomorrow's
06:12 - livestream so I'm trying to as I know
06:14 - when a livestream is coming up add them
06:16 - and then though you'll find them here
06:18 - and you can set a reminder like if I
06:20 - click this the reminders on what am I
06:22 - logged in as I'm logged as myself and
06:24 - you can if you I can't subscribe to
06:27 - myself but you can get all you can you
06:29 - do you know YouTube will give you all
06:30 - sorts of notifications if you want but
06:32 - you know we need to live in a world with
06:33 - fewer notifications probably so I don't
06:35 - want to add to the noise if it helps you
06:37 - great but you can also don't bother go
06:40 - bother with all this now oh yeah I
06:41 - should also mention I'm being told I
06:44 - look like Santa Claus which I don't
06:45 - think anyone has ever said to me in my
06:47 - entire life but I don't know would
06:52 - Wilderness Dan play the ukulele
06:54 - [Music]
07:00 - comes on the coding dream wilderness tan
07:05 - wilderness man really needs to get a
07:09 - haircut
07:12 - oh boy I really by the way the first
07:16 - time I ever played this instrument was
07:17 - two weeks ago
07:18 - so coming a little slack I was at a
07:22 - place called Guitar Center uh Lana
07:25 - Kavanaugh and Brooklyn and I was looking
07:28 - at electronic drum kits for my son who
07:31 - is about to turn ten and he played the
07:33 - drums getting him a new drum kit as a
07:35 - birthday present and I saw this ukulele
07:38 - on sale for $35 buy that cuz and I you
07:43 - know learned a few chords I can also
07:45 - play like it's really out of tune though
07:48 - yeah why is it kidding this is I guess
07:50 - it's what happened to get a cheap on I
07:57 - [Music]
07:58 - don't think I get copyright notices if I
08:07 - tuning is hard
08:10 - [Music]
08:27 - I got a high practice this is terrible
08:48 - okay we're gonna we're gonna compose a
08:52 - sand pile song soon enough have I let's
08:54 - see have I have I gotten fewer people
08:56 - what let's see how many people left
08:57 - trying to drive people away my ukulele
09:00 - playing oh no no other people are coming
09:03 - and joining alright okay so what was I
09:09 - saying I was saying something before I
09:13 - spent oh the ukulele Guitar Center
09:16 - wilderness Dan who knows okay
09:22 - so Wow the other thing that's kind of is
09:28 - completely insane to me is I seem to be
09:30 - getting remarkably close to 500,000
09:32 - subscribers really what's wrong with all
09:39 - of your bball there are plenty of
09:41 - legitimate places with professional
09:46 - thoughtful and like knowledgeable
09:49 - instruction I don't know what you're
09:52 - getting here but I feel like I should do
09:54 - something to celebrate the 500,000
09:56 - subscribers for subscribers if it comes
09:59 - to pass I mean I don't know what that
10:01 - would be alright so alright
10:10 - create a tuning tool for the ukulele
10:12 - oh that's coming I'm going to do that
10:15 - that's why one of the reasons why I have
10:16 - it up here I'm going to do a ukulele
10:19 - tuning coding challenge and I'm going to
10:21 - be using machine learning to recognize
10:22 - the pitch that's coming soon should just
10:27 - do it today but I'm not going to do it
10:29 - today I thought there was like some
10:32 - housekeeping
10:32 - oh it's talking about schedule that's
10:34 - what it was okay so this is the next
10:38 - livestream tomorrow
10:39 - I am hoping there's going to be a live
10:42 - stream on Monday June 18th and then
10:47 - there will hope there will possibly be
10:49 - one more live stream the last week of
10:52 - June and then I will be gone for two
10:54 - weeks so just to put in your mental
10:56 - calendar of your life I will not be or
11:00 - I'm going away on a little vacation for
11:04 - two weeks I think June 28th July 12th so
11:07 - there will be no coding trade live
11:09 - streams during that time when I come
11:11 - back in July I hope to have four live
11:13 - streams for the last couple weeks of
11:15 - July and then it will also be away again
11:17 - for a couple weeks in August but my goal
11:19 - here in terms of having these sponsors
11:21 - and the patreon is to have four live
11:25 - streams per month and that would be
11:29 - eight with two so over two months eight
11:32 - and so keep me honest let's see if I can
11:34 - keep that up you could always
11:36 - unsubscribe and do whatever you want but
11:38 - that's what I'm trying all right
11:42 - people are asking all sorts of questions
11:44 - I'm going to the wilderness I'm getting
11:46 - prepared to go to the wilderness
12:01 - [Music]
12:26 - [Music]
12:28 - if I ever will
12:42 - [Music]
12:51 - okay sand miles is the coding challenge
12:57 - [Music]
13:00 - I'm going to see if I can figure out the
13:04 - algorithm and I'm gonna tape it on the
13:06 - computer with my hand and then it might
13:11 - make some pretty colors you'll love your
13:15 - own version and we'll leave and go to
13:20 - the wilderness where there won't be any
13:23 - computers just something I think flying
13:31 - overhead that might look like a chat
13:34 - yeah so head of tune all right hmm
13:41 - I've really got to work on that all
13:43 - right so what's happening now let's do
13:44 - that how much time have I wasted is it
13:46 - feel like it's been a while so they're
13:47 - just wasted time live streaming doing
13:49 - absolutely nothing but amusing myself
13:56 - [Music]
14:01 - [Music]
14:05 - and I I like that there's actually in
14:10 - the chat part is requesting interactive
14:12 - emne Spencer up oh boy oh boy I
14:16 - don't think I better do that today all
14:17 - right so let's move over here to where
14:19 - this camera has shut off let us clean
14:23 - the whiteboard oh you know I should
14:32 - mention that where I learned to play the
14:35 - ukulele is I think it's christina
14:38 - ukulele youtube i learned by watching
14:43 - YouTube no no no shoot I'm gonna find
14:47 - the channel that I was watching ukelele
14:54 - lava song tutorial because she has a lot
14:58 - yeah Cynthia I don't know why I thought
15:00 - christina so this is like this 1.2
15:03 - million views see come on everybody hold
15:07 - on let's look I mean seriously like 1.2
15:15 - million views to download okay okay okay
15:22 - fine
15:22 - I actually did pay some money I think
15:24 - when I downloaded it the first time so I
15:26 - got to get an email whose oh boy oh boy
15:31 - oh download download download all right
15:37 - all right everybody 1.2 million views
15:40 - actually the thing is she's talented and
15:41 - can sing all right Thank You Cynthia
15:51 - Lynn for turning the coding trade into
15:54 - the coding ukulele the ukulele train all
15:57 - aboard the ukulele train oh it's still
16:02 - attitude
16:05 - a long long time ago there was a volcano
16:20 - [Music]
16:31 - we got changes in the sand pile song
16:34 - [Music]
16:37 - there was a two dimensional array of
16:43 - zeros in it but in the middle it had one
16:45 - really large number it passed its notes
16:50 - and to the neighbors
16:52 - and the neighbors pass their sin to
16:54 - their neighbors and the neighbors nice
16:57 - their sin to their neighbors and to pick
16:58 - some color pick some colors to color it
17:03 - [Music]
17:08 - that's and biles boom pretty graphics
17:14 - for you
17:18 - make your own version of it with
17:20 - prettier colors because I don't color
17:22 - design okay
17:32 - I really like that song actually 23
17:38 - chords the ukulele is not that mean you
17:41 - can get it you can get a lot done with
17:42 - three chords and if I had some talent it
17:45 - would be even better I did play the
17:47 - violin for 12 years Thank You Cynthia
17:49 - Lyn not an official sponsor of the cotan
17:52 - train but I'm gonna add her to my friend
17:55 - channels alright I have wasted enough
17:58 - time it is time we were going to write
18:00 - we were going to erase the whiteboard
18:11 - [Music]
18:20 - [Music]
18:23 - I'm being told to say hello to Peter Oh
18:26 - Kedar our computer studies teacher I
18:29 - that name we've had emails you're in
18:33 - Canada somewhere correct hello you're
18:35 - watching like in class this is very bad
18:37 - idea go back to class go back to class
18:39 - don't watch this people are saying I'm
18:52 - gonna get a copyright strike you know
18:53 - I'm happy to give my money to whoever
18:56 - compose that wonderful song by the way I
19:06 - might actually go get a haircut tonight
19:07 - so this might be the end it's summer
19:11 - what would happen if I just came in and
19:13 - had a completely shaved beard which but
19:15 - freaked people out cuz I mean I can I
19:18 - only had a beard since like not even ten
19:22 - years it's kind of a thing you do good
19:25 - to your forties and you just give up
19:28 - imadori syllabus that's kind of I kind
19:37 - of stole that joke from John Hodgman I
19:39 - don't know what his wording was but I'm
19:41 - reading John hodgman's book that I have
19:43 - now buzz marketing Vacationland quite
19:50 - entertaining I would like to read more I
19:58 - would like to go to the theater more saw
20:00 - Angels in America part one Sunday fan
20:03 - amazing spider-man looks fantastic I saw
20:13 - the original in the in the 90s it's
20:17 - really interesting I don't really
20:19 - remember it
20:20 - [Music]
20:28 - [Music]
20:30 - I saw somebody in the chat requesting
20:36 - the return of the timer I don't think
20:38 - this makes sense to have the timer well
20:42 - come up with something with the timer at
20:43 - some point okay whoo good exercise
20:51 - I started physical therapy for my back
20:54 - feeling much better learned a lot of
20:56 - different exercises I hope credibly weak
20:59 - do apparently have to muscle over here
21:03 - that you where you can't see really
21:06 - working on those I've been you know I've
21:07 - been running for years and years and
21:09 - years but I don't do a lot of strength
21:10 - training I think I let certain muscles
21:12 - basically stop working and then I had
21:14 - that injury last summer charlie didn't
21:16 - help so we'll see all right hmm
21:23 - apparently we just reached issue 1000 on
21:28 - the rainbow topics github coding
21:34 - challenge so I should do you know I
21:37 - should do whatever is coding chat
21:39 - whatever is issue number 500 I should do
21:43 - that one for the 500 thousand
21:46 - subscribers and then I'll do this one
21:48 - when I reach 1 million
21:56 - [Music]
22:01 - I can do this make an AI that solves the
22:09 - 15 tile sliding puzzle I guess you were
22:15 - also to program the puzzle to begin with
22:18 - now think about this what people are
22:23 - really completing the chat about not
22:26 - getting around to anything I buy with
22:28 - recent life streams I was coding within
22:30 - the first 10 minutes when I first
22:31 - started doing live streams it usually
22:33 - would take me at least 45 minutes to an
22:34 - hour to get started with anything it's
22:36 - only been a half an hour all right let's
22:38 - get let's get started I'm gonna do this
22:40 - in processing and I need to pull up some
22:43 - references here so I have where is
22:48 - Simon's sand piles great here we go
22:52 - this is the issue I also want to
22:54 - reference the number files video let's
23:03 - let's put this somewhere in towards the
23:07 - end is where we get two nice pretty
23:08 - pictures with a much better color scheme
23:14 - the color scheme that I should maybe try
23:16 - to emulate okay so I think this is good
23:20 - um and I think I'm ready yes topher in
23:27 - the slack channel set rights complaints
23:29 - must be coming from the YouTube jet yes
23:31 - that is correct
23:33 - [Laughter]
23:36 - Oh
23:37 - greasy whoops sponsor is in is in the
23:40 - high so we got to make Alka we got to
23:42 - make the icons for people sponsoring and
23:46 - emojis and various things like that I
23:48 - forgot about that I've been waiting like
23:51 - a year for you to Voronoi diagrams
23:53 - mm-hmm yeah that's uh that would be nice
23:58 - I should do that all right
24:06 - little love lucy' I like to be
24:27 - all right how's this marker I'm just
24:31 - gonna write over here where you can't
24:32 - see the sea if markers okay yep all
24:35 - right great hamstring stretch everybody
24:48 - let's do a hamstring stretch together
24:50 - okay and over feel this hamstring
24:52 - stretch see this channel it's like
24:55 - exercise ukulele and some time sort of
25:01 - coding poorly all right hold on
25:16 - I'd rather I wanna do this in processing
25:18 - so let me get processing open
25:32 - all right
25:41 - oh hello it's time for a coding
25:46 - challenge in processing which is a Java
25:49 - based thing you can find more about it
25:51 - at processing dot org I am going to
25:53 - attempt to create something that looks
25:55 - like this otherwise known as a sand pile
25:58 - so first thank you very much to coding
26:01 - trained viewer Simon Tiger who suggested
26:04 - this on January 26 there is a nice
26:07 - little discussion here a link to the
26:09 - numberphile video that I just watched
26:12 - earlier this morning now here's the
26:14 - thing I highly encourage you if you want
26:15 - to pause right now and go and watch the
26:18 - sand piles I can want to say sand file
26:21 - because it's numberphile and sand pile
26:23 - but anyway you don't watch that video
26:25 - right now to find out more about the
26:27 - mathematics of sand piles I'm gonna kind
26:29 - of skip all that and go cut right to the
26:31 - chase and just look at the basic idea
26:34 - and then what happens when we take that
26:36 - idea and turn it into color in a
26:38 - processing sketch so let me come over
26:40 - here and talk to you about the basic
26:42 - idea so first of all this video is going
26:45 - to the code that I'm going to write I
26:47 - think I've written it yet so it's going
26:49 - to look a lot like the game of life or
26:51 - maybe even like a blur image processing
26:54 - blur algorithm because what I'm going to
26:56 - do with this sand pile algorithm is look
27:00 - at a 2-dimensional space divided into
27:06 - cells and the core sort of the core
27:10 - building block here that I need to look
27:11 - at just in the simplest way is a 3x3
27:15 - grid so ultimately I'm going to take
27:18 - this algorithm and apply it to a
27:20 - processing sketch that might be
27:22 - something like 600 by 600 pixels and I'm
27:24 - gonna let this sand piles thing happen
27:26 - all throughout this window and color it
27:28 - but what is what actually needs to
27:30 - happen I can reduce and describe to you
27:33 - in terms of just this 3x3 grid ok so why
27:38 - is it called sand pile well the idea is
27:40 - that if I have this grid here I might
27:42 - dribble sand on it and I'm like sort of
27:45 - have a few pieces of sand like there
27:47 - might be two pieces of sand here and
27:49 - three pieces of sand here and a
27:53 - the air one there none there none there
27:55 - three there five there and one there
27:58 - right so this idea is that each cell has
28:01 - a certain amount of sand in it but there
28:04 - is a limit there is a limit and in some
28:07 - sense this is kind of arbitrary but it
28:09 - works out nicely with this number the
28:11 - limit is 4 meaning it can't actually
28:13 - literally is 3 the maximum amount of
28:15 - sand that in one of these cells can have
28:18 - in it is 3 pieces so this begs the
28:21 - question what happens if I dribble a lot
28:24 - and put say 100 pieces of sand in that
28:27 - spot right there well let's look at it
28:31 - this way let's say this is the initial
28:36 - starting point of this sand pile there
28:40 - are four pieces of sand right here and
28:42 - no pieces of sand anywhere else what
28:46 - happens is this becomes this cell which
28:53 - has four pieces of sand
28:55 - loses all of its and at tuples and the
28:57 - sand falls onto its neighbors one piece
29:00 - in each direction just the neighbors to
29:03 - the right to left the top to bottom now
29:05 - I'm sure is after you watch this video
29:06 - you look at my code and maybe you
29:07 - implemented yourself well what happens
29:09 - if you change that number the max to
29:11 - three what happens if you let the stay
29:12 - and fall in different ways all sorts of
29:13 - possibilities but I'm going to follow
29:14 - the core sandpile algorithm the one
29:17 - described in the numberphile video okay
29:19 - so now it looks like this zero one zero
29:21 - zero zero zero
29:24 - oh no no sorry one zero one zero one
29:28 - zero so all four pieces left the center
29:31 - spot they went up to the right now I
29:33 - could have a more complex scenario for
29:36 - example I could have two three zero zero
29:41 - four two three zero zero if this is the
29:48 - case what happens here is the same sort
29:51 - of thing in that this this remains a two
29:57 - this now becomes a four this remains a
30:00 - zero this now becomes a 1 this becomes a
30:03 - zero this
30:04 - three this stays a three this becomes a
30:08 - one and this stays a zero now I have
30:10 - this and so on and so forth all of a
30:13 - sudden now this topples so this goes out
30:16 - and this becomes a 1 and this becomes a
30:18 - 3 and this becomes a 1 and this becomes
30:21 - a 0 and this other piece of sand just
30:23 - sort of leaves the universe here now
30:24 - it's interesting we think of this as an
30:26 - infinite space or if we think of it
30:28 - maybe as it a torus weren't like wraps
30:30 - around to the other side there's all
30:32 - sorts of kind of weird possibilities we
30:33 - could try but ultimately the core idea
30:36 - is that any cell that has more than 3
30:40 - pieces of sand loses 4 pieces those go
30:43 - out to the neighbors so for example with
30:45 - this 100 what hat would happen here is
30:47 - this would become 96 and we would add
30:50 - one to each of the neighbors then the
30:52 - next generation this would become 92 so
30:54 - I'm talk about generations because I'm
30:57 - going to on one hand we could just look
30:58 - at the end result but I'm gonna watch it
31:00 - as an animation ok that's an explanation
31:02 - I am now going to go and write the code
31:05 - I took way too long the explaining that
31:07 - I wanted it to be much shorter but such
31:09 - is life
31:12 - ok pause for a second did I get anything
31:17 - terribly wrong there oh it looks like I
31:21 - got a super chat from John Doe in some
31:24 - sort of currency that I don't not
31:26 - familiar with thank you very much I
31:32 - would encourage you to instead of a
31:35 - super chat click the sponsor button with
31:37 - the sponsor button I will invite you to
31:39 - the flacc channel I'll mail you some
31:41 - stickers and you get fancy emojis and
31:43 - all that sort of thing but so of course
31:45 - super chats are very nice ok
31:49 - any any any any nobody's correcting me
31:54 - is Simon watching Simon are you watching
31:59 - Danish kroner oh that's what it was ok
32:02 - of course thank you alright so I'm going
32:07 - to now come back
32:12 - and write some code stirred up fossils
32:17 - our strokes offals the things you know
32:20 - no that's a Dutch just different than
32:24 - Denmark we Americans please somebody
32:28 - come and help us we're so close we need
32:31 - to be part of the world we should all be
32:34 - learning different languages and exposed
32:36 - to different cultures okay is my
32:47 - favorite dessert cookies and some kind
32:54 - of other stuff and actually have it in
32:58 - whole foods but I don't think it's very
32:59 - authentic
33:01 - all right all right I not seeing anyone
33:10 - anyone complaining so here we go all
33:18 - right so let's see do we think we could
33:20 - get some sort of result like this I
33:22 - don't know maybe let's try so I'm going
33:24 - to close the browser
33:25 - I've got processing open here all I need
33:28 - is a setup function and a draw function
33:32 - and then I need I need a to do I
33:36 - wouldn't use a two-dimensional array to
33:38 - describe the grid of sand piles I mean
33:42 - the thing is this is I'm kind of mixing
33:44 - my oh I got a sponsor pause welcome
33:55 - Tristan outer Pole thank you so much for
33:57 - the sponsorship I will try not to stop
34:00 - in the middle of my coding challenges
34:03 - brick come on it's exciting I didn't
34:04 - have my I can you know the lights the
34:07 - things the cameras a confetti I want to
34:09 - have like a little thing that like
34:10 - shoots confetti with hearts I just want
34:13 - to have that anyway forget about the
34:14 - sponsorship stuff a two-dimensional
34:19 - array let me use a two-dimensional array
34:22 - to describe these sand piles that are
34:26 - part of this processing window that I'm
34:29 - gonna draw into so I'm gonna call that
34:35 - sand piles then I'm gonna create I'm
34:39 - gonna just start with like a 200 by 200
34:41 - window that'll sort of be simple and I'm
34:44 - gonna you'll be interesting to think
34:46 - about the resolution or like sort of the
34:48 - size of each cell on this grid but I'm
34:50 - just gonna have each cell be one pixel
34:52 - it's an easy way for me to work and then
34:55 - so I need to say sand piles is a new
34:57 - array with with new two-dimensional
35:02 - array with width and height spaces in it
35:04 - okay now then what I need to do is in
35:10 - draw let's write a function to render
35:14 - and to render I'm gonna say load pixels
35:18 - update pixels and I am going to loop
35:22 - through every single spot every single
35:29 - pile of sand every X and every Y and I
35:35 - am going to say now so what do I need to
35:39 - do all right let's jump so how much how
35:42 - much how many how much sand is there I'm
35:44 - going to say int num and piles index X
35:49 - index Y then according to that I need to
35:53 - set a pixel now the pixels aren't in the
35:56 - two-dimensional array they're in a
35:57 - one-dimensional array I have feel like
35:59 - I'm Sisyphus who just goes up the hill
36:01 - to mention about this formula from a
36:02 - one-dimensional rate it to dementia
36:03 - retro one-dimensional right I've done
36:05 - this countless times but X plus y times
36:07 - width that's going to give me the unique
36:10 - integer index of the pixel associated
36:12 - with the XY coordinate then I just need
36:15 - to give that some sort of color and so
36:17 - let's call that Co L now I want the
36:20 - color to be according to the number of
36:25 - the color to be according to how much
36:27 - sand there is so we can see here in the
36:29 - numberphile video zero grains one grain
36:32 - two Grange three grains
36:33 - these are nice colors I'm going to be
36:38 - very arbitrary about this right now and
36:39 - I'm gonna say color color equals white
36:44 - and then of course you're going to all
36:47 - want to tell me about how I should use a
36:49 - switch statement but I'm just gonna say
36:52 - if there are zero grains of sand it
36:56 - should be black if there's one grain of
36:58 - sand it should be pink and if they're
37:08 - two it'll be some other color and if
37:13 - there are three and if someone in the
37:16 - slack group wants to give me a color
37:18 - scheme I will take it there it will be
37:21 - this color so let's I don't know let's
37:24 - do this
37:26 - and then let's do this there we go okay
37:28 - so now and then if in draw I call render
37:31 - what we should see right now is whoops
37:34 - let's save this yeah that's good idea
37:37 - let's call this sand piles if I run this
37:44 - we should see a black window right
37:47 - because the these sand piles were
37:50 - initialized with all zeroes and I'm
37:55 - getting some color suggestions from the
37:56 - chat I will come back and and use those
37:59 - in a little bit okay now if I were to
38:03 - say sand piles
38:04 - let's but so what the way that image was
38:07 - generated in the numberphile video not
38:09 - to spoiler alert we tell you what
38:11 - happens at the end of the numberphile
38:12 - video is that just a lot of sand is
38:14 - dropped in the middle so what happens we
38:17 - just drop a huge amount of sand in the
38:19 - middle and watch it topple topple topple
38:20 - topple rippling out so let's do that and
38:24 - so I'm gonna say I'm gonna just have the
38:25 - middle be with the sort of spot that's
38:28 - width divided by two height divided by
38:29 - two and I'm gonna put right now I'm just
38:32 - going to put four four pieces of grains
38:36 - of sand there so let's run this again
38:37 - and hopes let's run this again and we
38:41 - should see there it is now I have a
38:43 - white dot in the center there because
38:46 - there are four grains of sand pause for
38:49 - a sec
38:57 - let me save this color scheme Oh colors
39:01 - Co app I see okay
39:05 - yeah ad piles with clicks that's a good
39:07 - idea
39:08 - okay alright yeah I missed why can't I
39:18 - have by the way I have another computer
39:20 - I checked this computer out from
39:24 - downstairs I borrowed it because it has
39:27 - all the keys on the keyboard work but
39:28 - then I like was I didn't want to be 50
39:30 - even later than I was I have some
39:33 - problems with some keys on the keyboard
39:34 - here let me let me just do a save as
39:37 - this will get great okay okay so the
39:48 - next thing we need to do is figure out
39:49 - the topple algorithm topple what happens
39:53 - when the sand pile topples well if it's
39:55 - greater than 4 pass out
39:58 - top pass one grain of sand top left
40:01 - right bottom and then subtract 4 so the
40:04 - first thing I need to do is probably
40:05 - create a so if this is my current sand
40:09 - pile what I want to do is create kind of
40:11 - like the next pile and the next pile is
40:15 - going to start with all zeros in it and
40:17 - then if a cell doesn't have 4 like if if
40:23 - the cell has less than 4 then it can
40:28 - have that same number in the next pile
40:30 - and then so I could go and copy over
40:33 - everything that's less than 4 and then
40:35 - after that I could topple things so I
40:39 - could probably do this in one pass but I
40:41 - think doing it in two passes will work
40:42 - that's the way I'm thinking about it
40:43 - right now
40:44 - nor if you're following me but you might
40:45 - follow me when I'm writing the code so
40:46 - let's let's come back and do that now
40:48 - so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
40:49 - write a function called topple and I'm
40:54 - going to say int next piles is also a
41:00 - just a blank array and then I am going
41:04 - to do this same for loop to look at
41:07 - every single spot I'm
41:09 - do this twice I'm not sure if this is
41:11 - necessary but it's a way that I'm
41:13 - thinking about it right now
41:14 - I'm gonna say okay int num I need this
41:17 - again how many are in that spot and if
41:23 - num is less than four then next piles X
41:30 - Y is just equal to a sand piles X Y so
41:38 - this is me copying over every single
41:41 - pile of sand that doesn't need to be
41:44 - toppled then what I'll do afterwards is
41:48 - I'll do this exact same loop again but
41:53 - if the number is greater than or equal
41:55 - to four greater than or equal to four
42:01 - then next piles will equal what it
42:05 - currently was minus four so subtract
42:08 - those four and then all of the neighbors
42:11 - X plus one X plus one X minus 1 y plus 1
42:22 - and y -1 will each increase by one so I
42:28 - need to additively because there could
42:30 - be multiple piles with more than four on
42:34 - different size they didn't be able to
42:35 - add everything together so I think if I
42:37 - just take the current amount of sand
42:41 - subtract 4 and then send that each each
42:44 - of those four grains of sand out to each
42:46 - of the four neighbors this should be
42:48 - good and then at the end these sand
42:50 - piles is now next piles so let's take a
42:56 - look at this what do I see now oh I have
43:00 - to call that function so I want to
43:02 - render in draw and a render then topple
43:05 - and let's actually set the frame rate to
43:07 - one because maybe I can see it look at
43:13 - that so look at that I toppled that
43:15 - Center cell right it was white the first
43:19 - frame and then it now it has each one of
43:21 - those neighbors just has one
43:23 - pile of sand one grain of sand and that
43:26 - should be if I look at the render
43:28 - function one greatest fan is pink okay I
43:33 - think we're done we're actually kind of
43:35 - done I have to deal with the edge cases
43:37 - and lots of other stuff but let's
43:38 - actually down now we could just do
43:39 - something goofy we're gonna be like I
43:41 - don't know let's just add 400 things of
43:43 - sand oh now I'm still at one frame per
43:47 - second so looking at this we can kind of
43:50 - watch what it's doing
43:52 - the sand is toppling in each of the
43:53 - cells of coloring now it probably would
43:55 - be good for me to have created a version
43:57 - of this that was kind of zoomed in so
44:00 - you can see it's zooming in using like a
44:03 - software zoom so it's sort of blurring
44:05 - each one of these pixels but I might as
44:08 - well just kind of go for it take out
44:10 - this frame rate one and just watch it go
44:12 - so now we can see this is what's
44:14 - happening now all of that sand and it
44:17 - finished so it toppled in got done so we
44:19 - need more sand how much sand can I put
44:23 - in how about that much there we go oh
44:28 - let's get a better color scheme so I was
44:33 - I was given a color scheme pause for a
44:36 - second I'm being told it looks wrong
44:40 - it's not symmetrical Oh welcome to
44:43 - sponsor Jay's shown thank you for the
44:46 - new sponsorship if you would check if
44:49 - your neighbors are not then three you
44:51 - could use one pass hold on I'm getting
44:57 - so many different color schemes I don't
44:59 - know which one to pick and I'm also
45:01 - concerned that maybe there is a an error
45:08 - I don't know I look symmetrical to me
45:12 - this looks right I think it's just we're
45:15 - seeing it play out in a kind of
45:17 - asymmetric way
45:46 - yeah this is what I was trying to figure
45:48 - out the order in which you iterate
45:49 - matters if you have three four three
45:51 - both the first and the last three will
45:53 - update to four but the last three will
45:54 - update as well right that's why I was
46:00 - thinking I needed to do two passes
46:03 - because it should have fourfold symmetry
46:10 - oh the toppling is based on the current
46:19 - highest amount of stand instead of going
46:21 - over it like a scanner pixel of fried
46:26 - greens are giving out for your toppling
46:29 - at three grains and two grains as well
46:31 - which isn't what you want no all right
46:41 - so what have I done wrong I'm thinking
46:43 - about this you need two arrays topple
46:47 - one copy to display and render yeah that
46:49 - I have two arrays I like how this looks
47:05 - I think it so one thing that I want to
47:12 - check here is let me just call topple
47:20 - like a lot of times
47:51 - I can't I think it's symmetrical but
47:54 - just
48:02 - right it's got the fourfold symmetry
48:05 - that it finished
48:16 - when efficient last time it ended up
48:17 - with some white it's not completely
48:22 - symmetrical
48:24 - yeah but give an infinite time would it
48:27 - be
48:36 - are you checking the new array or the
48:38 - old one hmm all right let's look at my
48:42 - topple algorithm again
49:22 - may get an uneven resolution oh that's
49:25 - interesting
49:26 - oh yeah
49:51 - the amount of CO the amount of sand is
49:54 - not perfectly divided divisible by four
49:55 - interesting
50:07 - let's look at let's let it finish
50:19 - so that's it finishing
50:26 - try toppling from the highest point of
50:28 - sand then reading out from there so in
50:32 - other words you know that shouldn't
50:36 - matter I agree so I have a feeling it's
50:39 - the order that I'm doing things in but I
50:41 - don't see how that couldn't matter
50:42 - because I am never touching and changing
50:45 - the values in the original I'm just
50:51 - copying over so I'm never checking the
51:00 - next pile I don't see how this this
51:07 - seems to me this looks like it's
51:08 - completely order agnostic right there's
51:12 - no way that I am it is because you're
51:17 - removing 4 and adding one in the same
51:19 - grit pass I agree that that would be a
51:23 - problem except it's not like I'm
51:24 - checking next piles I'm still looking at
51:28 - so I think it's ok to like funnel them
51:31 - out oh oh wait a sec wait a sec
51:41 - if I remove four I could overwrite I
51:45 - could overwrite another one hmm all
51:49 - right okay okay I figured out the
51:50 - problem I figured out the problem
51:54 - I figure out the problem I have to think
51:56 - about how to correct it I mean I say
52:02 - this this line of code right here could
52:08 - overwrite some sand grains that have
52:11 - already been added into next piles right
52:15 - there could be sand grains added into
52:17 - next piles that are selling in and get
52:19 - overwritten so this should actually be
52:24 - plus equals right the amount of sand
52:29 - from before minus 4 right I shouldn't be
52:33 - setting it I should just be adding the
52:37 - amount of sand from before minus 4 I
52:45 - think that may not be the right fix
52:47 - that's not the right fix oh yeah right I
52:58 - think I fixed I think I figured it out
53:00 - right all right I'm gonna have to
53:10 - discuss let me go back and
53:19 - you guys can tell me if that was right
53:27 - where am i hero
53:37 - and let this run for a little while
53:48 - none - for thank you John Doe I will I
53:51 - will do it that way okay so I let this
53:59 - run for a little bit and Wow I have to
54:01 - admit I picked some like kind of
54:03 - horrendous colors and it is doing
54:05 - something kind of beautiful and
54:06 - interesting and weird it's not correct
54:08 - and the chat pointed out to me that this
54:10 - should have fourfold symmetry right
54:12 - there's no reason why and it it had this
54:14 - like nice symmetric quality to it but
54:16 - it's not the right kind of symmetry let
54:18 - it run a little longer so maybe you can
54:19 - see it I'm also gonna cycle the camera
54:22 - while doing that alright so what is the
54:30 - problem and it did take me a little bit
54:31 - of time to think about this and so the
54:34 - problem is I believe is here this is a
54:39 - very dangerous thing that I'm doing the
54:42 - point of next Pyles is i opes the point
54:52 - of next Pyles
54:54 - is that I always want next piles to
54:56 - accumulate the sand from previous that's
54:58 - why I'm copying over things that are
55:00 - less than four and then adding up things
55:03 - that went in there toppled and also need
55:05 - to subtract the four from the thing that
55:07 - was toppled but I'm not just subtracting
55:11 - the four I'm overwriting anything that
55:13 - was there before so it could be that two
55:15 - cells with more than four are near next
55:19 - to each other and so one gets one from
55:21 - the other and but then I just but I
55:23 - don't but I then then as soon as I get
55:25 - to the next cell I don't take that in
55:27 - consideration more so this should
55:28 - actually be adding and this by the way
55:31 - just can be the current amount which is
55:33 - none so I need to add na minus four so
55:38 - whatever it was before I want to put in
55:40 - that pile all of the sand except for the
55:43 - four that are going out to the neighbors
55:44 - and I believe that if I run this we
55:49 - should see it be much more symmetrical
55:51 - and you can see that already okay so the
55:54 - next thing that I'm gonna do I'm gonna
55:55 - do two more things so there's so much
55:57 - you could do with this I'm not gonna do
55:59 - I'm gonna let you do it I'm at least
56:01 - gonna pick
56:01 - different colors and I'm going to speed
56:04 - up the animation to see to be able to
56:09 - get to the end result a little bit more
56:10 - quickly yes and the chat is telling me
56:15 - the parenthesis do nothing I just put
56:17 - them there for my own personal sanity
56:22 - [Applause]
56:27 - okay now let me find some colors I got
56:31 - so many color suggestions
56:45 - alright okay Alka whoops in the slack
56:52 - group invitation might be a sponsor to
56:56 - get an invitation has some rainbow
57:02 - colors for me let me say that again
57:08 - alright Alka in the patron sponsor group
57:11 - in slack has some rainbow color
57:15 - suggestions for me so let's put those in
57:16 - where are they color this first color is
57:21 - to 5500 the next color is to 5500 the
57:26 - next color is 0-1 8563
57:31 - the next color is zero 104 255 and the
57:36 - last color is 120 to 0 229 I probably
57:43 - could use HSB color or tap the colors
57:46 - change over time there's so many things
57:47 - I could do but I'm just gonna just show
57:49 - you that the colors that you picked make
57:51 - a difference here so here we go there's
57:53 - our nice rainbow colors now what I want
57:56 - to do is I want to see the end result a
57:59 - bit more quickly well I mean one thing
58:01 - that I could do is just sit here and
58:02 - wait and I could if you're watching the
58:04 - recorded version of this I'll speed up
58:05 - the video to get to the end but just for
58:07 - this the sake of showing you how I could
58:10 - see it more quickly is I am going to all
58:13 - I need to do is call topple multiple
58:16 - times each time through draw so I'm
58:18 - going to write an extra loop in here
58:20 - like if I just say call topple ten times
58:22 - and run it we can see here that you can
58:26 - see it looks as if it's going faster
58:28 - it's not actually going faster just
58:29 - animating faster well it's doing ten
58:33 - sorry doing ten updates per frame of
58:34 - animation let's do a thousand there we
58:41 - go and I'm not so sure about these
58:43 - colors and then let's and of course we
58:50 - got an array out of bounds exception so
58:52 - let's fix that so we need to figure out
58:54 - so we need to say like as long as X plus
58:57 - one is less
58:58 - than with and as long as X minus one is
59:04 - greater than is greater than negative
59:06 - one I guess I could say greater than
59:08 - equal to zero and then this one I want
59:13 - to say if y plus y plus 1 is less than
59:17 - height and this one and by the way I'm
59:20 - not using any I never do this but and I
59:23 - probably should just put the curly
59:25 - brackets in there but if you only ever
59:27 - have one line of code that comes after
59:29 - an if statement the curly brackets can
59:31 - be assumed for just that one line and
59:33 - then I'm going to say if Y y -1 is
59:40 - greater than or equal to 0 so this will
59:44 - at least now fix the edge problem let's
59:47 - let it go as far as it can go
60:09 - Oh crazy wait first of all the chat is
60:15 - done I got the wrong colors second is
60:20 - 255 255 0 oh yeah
60:25 - so had the wrong colors oh there we go
60:31 - that's nicer Oh much prettier dude
60:34 - oh the bit rates gonna be a disaster on
60:38 - these YouTube videos this is quite
60:40 - lovely so the next thing I want to do is
60:42 - just finish this off by saying like 800
60:45 - by 800 and run it oh so slow probably
60:51 - some kind of magical shader thing could
60:53 - make it happen faster let's at least I
60:56 - wanted to animate a little faster so
60:58 - let's let's topple it only a hundred
61:01 - times per frame and I'm gonna just work
61:03 - on my email and some other stuff for a
61:05 - little bit and then I'll be back with
61:07 - this gets a little further along
61:21 - I'm gonna let this run Mattia does will
61:23 - do his fun thing where this speeds up
61:27 - [Music]
61:35 - well sorry
61:52 - [Music]
61:54 - my email how's this going everybody how
61:58 - long have I been honest are some
61:59 - questions there while we're waiting how
62:01 - long have I been coding for about an
62:05 - hour now looks longer than playing the
62:08 - ukulele I started coding I mean I did
62:17 - code as a child but I would say I really
62:20 - started coding in 2001 rainbows and
62:31 - piles
62:32 - [Music]
62:39 - art asks any new tensorflow jazz videos
62:45 - [Music]
62:53 - I will do a color a classification
62:59 - tutorial shouldn't the canvas be one
63:05 - pixel bigger or does it not matter a
63:08 - pixel there a pixel mare's now I want to
63:26 - get this let's see how far we can get
63:28 - this
63:29 - I can't dynamically stop it but I guess
63:32 - I could take a screenshot I can to miss
63:38 - at least boy this is really takes a long
64:09 - time
64:09 - [Music]
64:34 - all right think that's gonna have to be
64:36 - good enough all right it's taking a
64:40 - really long time to render so I think
64:42 - that's good enough for this coding
64:43 - challenge there you go
64:45 - sand piles in processing I cannot wait
64:48 - to see what people make to this this
64:50 - user you could we could start to do
64:52 - stuff where you drop the sand you could
64:55 - pick your own color schemes you could
64:56 - have the colors change over time you
64:57 - could render something out to a giant
64:59 - poster and print it I don't know there's
65:01 - so many possibilities if you watch the
65:02 - numberphile video probably get more
65:04 - ideas thank you for watching this coding
65:05 - challenge and see you in a future one on
65:08 - something else bye alright do you play
65:18 - the uke in non virtual classes as well
65:21 - no I'm never play I do not play the
65:22 - ukulele in my regular glasses I don't
65:25 - know if it's special treatment it's kind
65:27 - of the opposite of that if you ask me
65:28 - all right
65:35 - next up we're going to do that Barnsley
65:38 - fern thing which to be honest I don't
65:42 - know how to do it all how bad could it
65:45 - be I think I need to do some like matrix
65:47 - transformation
66:01 - I wonder how long that's gonna end up
66:18 - being hopefully it's not more than a
66:19 - half an hour still going still going
66:50 - could you use them now I know it's like
66:52 - I kind of want to like add things to it
66:53 - but I just don't want to I don't want to
66:56 - stop it oh wait I've lost the slack
66:59 - group yeah I probably shouldn't have
67:05 - done this on a per pixel basis but
67:08 - that's just what I did
67:10 - play these chords on the ukulele ce7 a
67:14 - minor a seven D minor
67:15 - oh that's already good that's already
67:17 - went too far off in the chat for me to
67:18 - do that
67:29 - right there's probably ways they can
67:31 - make this much faster yeah I like how
67:36 - this was looking now all right now let's
67:44 - let me let me look at the barn while
67:45 - this is running a little bit longer it
67:48 - looks like this it probably should have
67:50 - used the same colors oh I should have
67:55 - now I feel sad that I didn't come here
67:58 - and like a compare but that's fine but
68:09 - that's okay yeah I'm planning to use the
68:16 - there's a there's a machine learning
68:18 - model for the pit for the ukulele tuner
68:20 - there's a machine learning model called
68:23 - CREP or clip here it is this a neural
68:39 - network with a perfect pitch so it's
68:42 - going to use this clip a model to get
68:47 - the pitch of a sound and actually you
68:51 - could probably do this already without
68:52 - even me because it is an example and
68:56 - again this has not been sort of
68:57 - officially released yet but if I go here
69:00 - under reference and under oh maybe it's
69:06 - not in here yet so I think we don't have
69:09 - a reference page for CREP yeah oh pitch
69:11 - detection there you go pitch detection
69:14 - this is what I was this is what I'm
69:16 - planning to use well spoiler alert
69:20 - alright but um we'll come back to this
69:23 - oh boy this is this is gonna be released
69:25 - I mean it's released it's there you can
69:26 - use it but we're still working on it
69:27 - making some changes Friday is the goal
69:30 - to have this out and I need to go work
69:32 - on that library I gotta go I'm gonna do
69:34 - Barnsley fern first alright
69:37 - bar okay so first I want to go back to
69:40 - Simon's Barnsley fern github issue
69:44 - let's close this let's go to here and
69:48 - this should be the result that we're
69:51 - gonna get should look something like
69:52 - that and all right
69:54 - Oh affine transformation this isn't so
69:59 - bad though right isn't this just matrix
70:01 - math so I start with a point okay the
70:10 - first point is drawn at the origin 0 0
70:12 - and then new points are it early
70:14 - computed by randomly applying one of the
70:16 - following for coordinate transformations
70:19 - oh yeah I don't even know yeah great and
70:26 - then I probably need to do some mapping
70:28 - of negative 1 to 1 right I probably need
70:33 - to do some mapping to like to have the
70:36 - pixel window have 0 0 in the center
70:40 - negative 1 to 1 negative 1 to 1 and then
70:43 - just apply one of these for
70:44 - transformations and then do the next
70:47 - point right all right how hard is this
70:48 - gonna be can it separate notes I don't
70:58 - believe it can do the correct model I
71:00 - don't believe can do that all right so
71:09 - what's the let's
71:18 - affine transformation X equals MX plus B
71:24 - yeah
71:32 - I'm just looking at this right it's like
71:35 - the dot product thingy yeah this
71:40 - multiplied by this this multiplied by
71:42 - this plus all right yep okay okay right
71:52 - x equals 0.85 plus 0.04 and then y
71:59 - equals point negative 0.04 0.85 plus 1.6
72:04 - there we go okay all right this actually
72:06 - is not going to be very hard Oh
72:07 - famous last words all right how we doing
72:15 - there look at this
72:16 - leave this beauty here you go Matt yeah
72:22 - let's make a nice thumbnail for you
72:27 - although I should have this be the we're
72:36 - gonna make a thumbnail for a match yet
72:38 - sand piles here we're going to zoom in
72:44 - put this lower zoom in zoom in zoom in I
72:48 - wanted to say sand piles there I guess
72:52 - we don't need to say same piles there
72:53 - we'll just let's get this kind of like
72:55 - there we go
73:01 - well let's get this mouse out of the way
73:04 - okay okay
73:15 - Oh something something will come up
73:17 - there all right I'm gonna have to turn
73:19 - this off now I want to let it keep
73:20 - running but I'm gonna have to turn it
73:21 - off okay I just turn it off I did that
73:28 - okay
73:29 - now save save as a desktop what we
73:34 - calling this Barnsley let's go to the
73:39 - Barnsley fern whoops and named by
73:50 - British mathematician Michael Barnsley
73:55 - okay Barnsley fern and then
74:11 - okay all right
74:16 - here we go I'm gonna try later today if
74:28 - anyone wants to do it for me
74:30 - I've tried later today to render like a
74:32 - super high res can I could use you could
74:34 - use create graphics and just render to a
74:37 - pixel buffer super high-res or you could
74:39 - actually I you could do it if you're if
74:41 - we're doing it if we use the rectangle
74:42 - function to actually draw them as
74:44 - rectangles and use the PDF renderer that
74:46 - might be an interesting to try too so if
74:48 - anybody wants to make these some like
74:49 - super high-res sand piles with that code
74:52 - that I could use for sharing on social
74:54 - media and publishing with the video that
74:56 - might be helpful alright I could use
74:58 - tensors what not using yes for this
75:02 - because first of all I'm doing this in
75:04 - processing alright
75:13 - hello to another coding challenge in
75:16 - this coding challenge I am going to
75:18 - attempt to make the Barnsley fern that a
75:21 - beautiful plant to me we can make a
75:23 - rainbow Barnsley fern I don't know
75:24 - so fergal why is it called Barnsley fern
75:27 - named for the British bath edition
75:29 - Michael Barnsley who first described
75:30 - this in his book fractals everywhere so
75:33 - I encourage you to check out the
75:34 - Wikipedia page which could give you more
75:36 - background about where this algorithm
75:38 - comes from thanks once again to coding
75:40 - trained viewers Simon Tiger who
75:42 - suggested this one and let's try to
75:45 - implement it so here's the thing let me
75:46 - actually just describe to you briefly
75:48 - what's gonna happen so in order to do
75:51 - this one I think I actually have not
75:52 - coded this before we'll see if what not
75:55 - my way of thinking about it is right is
75:57 - if we look at the Wikipedia page let's
75:59 - actually go back to look at the
76:00 - Wikipedia page it's gonna tell us a
76:01 - little bit it's going to say somewhere
76:05 - here the first point is drawn at the
76:08 - origin x equals 0 y equals 0 so
76:12 - basically the way that this works is I'm
76:14 - going to draw a point at 0 0 so I'm
76:16 - going to consider 0 0 to be in the
76:19 - middle so I'm gonna have to do some type
76:21 - of transformation mapping of the pixel
76:25 - canvas which usually has zeros there on
76:27 - the top left
76:28 - maybe it's 600 by 600 and have 0 0 P in
76:31 - the center and what it says here is it's
76:36 - basically I need to pick one of these
76:39 - for affine transformations now this when
76:43 - you look at this you think to yourself
76:44 - wait I'm gonna go to something else like
76:47 - matrices and curly brackets and f of X
76:50 - but this is actually really much simpler
76:53 - than you think
76:55 - and this is known as an a transformation
76:58 - or affine transformation here where what
77:01 - I want to do is I want to say if X 0 is
77:08 - that 0 and y 0 is at 0 what I need to do
77:13 - is I want to say X 1 is some function of
77:17 - X 0 y 0 and maybe some constant ax 0
77:23 - plus B times y 0 plus C
77:27 - basically and then X Bug sorry and then
77:29 - y1 is a some other number but like a Y
77:37 - zero time out let me go back and say
77:49 - this again
77:49 - so is it going to be confusing if I use
77:53 - the same it's different a B's and C's so
77:56 - I'm gonna do de and F yeah okay and then
78:08 - y1 is maybe D times x0 plus e times y 0
78:14 - plus F and then I'm gonna do the same
78:18 - thing x2 y2 is some numbers plus x1 plus
78:24 - y plus some number plus y1 plus some
78:26 - other constant so what are the values of
78:28 - a b c d e and f well those are the
78:32 - values that are here so x1 is actually 0
78:39 - times x plus 0 times y this this one
78:44 - does nothing it just turns it into 0 but
78:47 - you can see here this would be a better
78:49 - one X so we can write this out x2 let me
78:58 - get me start this whole video over
79:00 - because I don't want to get to this to
79:03 - hook this whole thing over it's not
79:06 - element wise it's the dot products to
79:07 - definitely the dot product yes
79:11 - did I get it wrong
79:16 - right isn't it
79:18 - right X and plus 1 is 0.85 times X plus
79:24 - point zero four times y plus 0 yeah I
79:28 - have it right okay oh I'm not in there
79:30 - I'm in the wrong screen sorry let's
79:32 - start over
79:32 - I wanna let me just let's start this
79:35 - whole thing over
79:38 - I don't let my replaced confusing
79:45 - notation with more confusing notation I
79:48 - think if I actually I'm just going to
79:51 - use that actual example and I'm going to
79:55 - go check it okay all right starting over
79:59 - again cycling cameras all right
80:31 - hello welcome to another coding
80:34 - challenge well I'm excited about this
80:35 - one
80:35 - in this coding challenge I'm going to
80:37 - attempt to make this fern the Barnsley
80:41 - firm named for the British mathematician
80:43 - Michael Barnsley I encourage you to read
80:46 - this Wikipedia page which will give you
80:48 - more background on it I'm what I'm gonna
80:50 - do is just look at the algorithm and try
80:51 - to write that algorithm into code and
80:53 - see if we can get that result and then
80:55 - you the creative viewer of this coding
80:58 - challenge will make your own version
81:00 - with different colors and you'll think
81:01 - about animating it and do all sorts of
81:03 - things that I couldn't possibly even
81:04 - imagine so first what is the algorithm
81:07 - here so if we look down here I'm just
81:09 - gonna skip down down here it says the
81:11 - first point is drawn at the origin x
81:13 - equals 0 y equals 0 so what this means
81:15 - is where you need some sort of
81:17 - two-dimensional space it could be a
81:20 - processing canvas and I want to start at
81:22 - 0 0
81:23 - now I'm gonna think of 0 0 in the center
81:25 - here and I'm gonna have to probably
81:26 - figure out some ways of tray of well if
81:29 - the pixels are here or than 0 0 in the
81:31 - pixel space is here but I'm not gonna
81:32 - worry about that right now and then
81:34 - what's the next step
81:36 - the next step is and then the new points
81:39 - are iteratively computed by randomly
81:41 - applying one of the four following
81:43 - coordinate transformations and here they
81:45 - are to find out this is the kind of
81:48 - stuff that you might see and think this
81:52 - looks like matrix math with linear
81:54 - algebra but but this is actually first
81:56 - of all if you watched all my matrix
81:57 - videos this is gonna change leg enough
81:59 - to make sense to you but let me actually
82:01 - show you that this math is actually
82:02 - quite simple let's use just on this
82:05 - second one and let's rewrite this over
82:07 - on the board yeah so f of 2 X comma y
82:15 - equals so I'm have to go back and check
82:18 - it point 85 0.04 0.85 0.04 negative 0.04
82:30 - negative 0.04 I should have made up my
82:33 - own numbers 0.85 0.85 then we have X
82:41 - why Oh No I'm running out of space you
82:48 - can see that zero and one point six what
82:55 - does this mean well this is actually the
83:02 - matrix product or the dot matrix
83:03 - multiplication of the dot product what
83:05 - it means is I want this I want to find
83:08 - the values if this is x1 y1 what I want
83:12 - to get is the next values for X so I
83:14 - have one point and I want to know where
83:16 - does that point go
83:17 - what's x2 y2 so this being x2 equals
83:23 - this number times that 0.85 sorry times
83:30 - x1 plus this number times that the row
83:36 - gets multiplied by the column 0.04 times
83:40 - y1 and then Plus this number Plus 0 and
83:46 - then y2 then equals negative 0.04 times
83:52 - x1 plus 0.85 and my handwriting's
83:56 - terrible times y1 this column times this
84:00 - column plus one point six so it's really
84:03 - just this formula if I have an XY
84:06 - coordinate I get the next s XY
84:08 - coordinate with this math and we can
84:10 - just double check that this is right
84:11 - look at that for a second with my
84:13 - horrible messy handwriting and then
84:15 - let's go down here and see look at this
84:17 - it's the same thing X the next X is this
84:21 - number times the previous X plus this
84:23 - number times the previous Y and the next
84:24 - Y is this number times the previous X
84:26 - plus this number times our previous y
84:28 - plus one point six so we just need to do
84:31 - one of these four and each one of those
84:35 - four we do according to a particular
84:40 - probability right or ABCDEF that could
84:45 - have written it this way that's the
84:47 - generic way of writing it okay so all
84:49 - right so let's go let's go back and
84:50 - let's start writing some code
84:56 - all right so I have a processing sketch
84:59 - a Java based programming environment
85:02 - with a nice API for drawing stuff and
85:04 - lots more processing org I am going to
85:07 - say background equals zero I'm going to
85:10 - have an x and a y I'm going to set those
85:14 - to be 0 to start I'm going to draw I'm
85:17 - gonna say stroke 255 stroke weight
85:24 - stroke weight sorry
85:26 - stroke stroke weight 8 and then I'm
85:29 - gonna draw a point at X comma Y okay and
85:32 - then what I need to do is get the next
85:35 - value so act next x equals some number a
85:46 - times X plus B times y plus C and
85:54 - actually so let's just use these numbers
85:57 - here let's just copy these 0.85 0.04
86:02 - 0.85 negative 0.04 negative zero point
86:08 - oh four point eight five
86:18 - and next why is negative point oh four
86:23 - point eight five eight five plus one
86:36 - point six okay did I get that right this
86:42 - is a positive one all right okay I must
86:50 - lying all these things up know what's
86:53 - going on okay everything's fine now
86:56 - breathe everybody breathe with me
86:58 - okay so this is applying that particular
87:03 - transformation and then I could just say
87:06 - x equals next X y equals next Y so what
87:13 - if I were to do this and run this I
87:15 - don't get any arrows errors but I do see
87:18 - this like circle over here being drawn
87:20 - so here's the thing I'm only applying
87:22 - one of those transformations I need to
87:25 - pick one of four and I also not thinking
87:28 - sort of thoughtfully about the pixel
87:29 - space so I need to do a napping right X
87:32 - with pixels goes from 0 to 600 0 to 600
87:37 - but maybe I want to think of this as a
87:39 - space between negative 1 and 1 and
87:41 - negative 1 and 1 so what I want to do is
87:45 - say when I actually go to draw it pixel
87:50 - x equals map X which goes between
87:52 - negative 1 and 1 to 0 and width and
87:55 - pixel Y between negative 1 and 1 and I'm
88:00 - gonna flip the access height comma 0 and
88:02 - then I'm gonna draw the point at P X py
88:05 - let's run this and then ah ok and I'd
88:08 - only to want to draw the background once
88:10 - and we can see there we go so if I apply
88:13 - that transformation over and over again
88:15 - we can see the point going up that way
88:17 - now is that right
88:26 - that doesn't look right to me I guess
88:32 - it's right
88:42 - I need to pick for one or four okay I
88:44 - guess I guess that's right cuz I'm just
88:46 - picking one
88:54 - it's really just going to go up
88:55 - diagonally like that this transformation
88:57 - I guess so
89:10 - second match should be why Oh what was
89:13 - this okay
89:13 - yes sorry everybody I that looked weird
89:16 - to me this has to be why yes this needs
89:19 - to be why I was like mapping the x-value
89:21 - that was like why is it all right
89:23 - so mmm all right it's not moving very
89:26 - much but that's fine I'm just applying
89:28 - this one transformation so here's the
89:31 - thing oh is this an office Oh time out
89:37 - is this an offset no it's actually the
89:40 - new point yeah yeah everyone's
89:45 - correcting me in the chat okay
90:02 - I'm looking at the chat still let's look
90:08 - at the values just to sort of see what
90:12 - those values are doing and we can see
90:15 - there we go now it kind of settled
90:17 - interestingly enough it's settled to a
90:19 - fixed point but here's the thing we need
90:21 - to do one of four transformations so I
90:25 - need to do the tedious thing I know I
90:27 - could probably write the encode these in
90:29 - two arrays and like automatically but
90:32 - I'm gonna do this in a very long-winded
90:34 - way just to see the code I'm gonna have
90:37 - four of these possibilities so this is
90:39 - actually number two I need to have one I
90:44 - need to have three and I need to have
90:48 - four and I probably should put these in
90:51 - a function but oh there's so many ways I
90:54 - could organize the code to be better but
90:56 - I'm gonna just do it this way right now
90:57 - and I'm gonna wavy I'll refactor it
90:59 - later I'll let you do that so let's go
91:01 - back and look at the algorithm this is
91:03 - just zero and point one six times y so
91:07 - this one is actually just zero and this
91:09 - is actually just 0.1 0.16 times y that's
91:15 - option number one option number two we
91:17 - did option number three option number
91:19 - three is point 2 negative point two six
91:22 - point two mmm negative zero point two
91:27 - six and then point two three point two
91:30 - to one point six point two three point
91:35 - two to two point six was that it was one
91:38 - point six and then option number four is
91:41 - negative point one five point two eight
91:45 - you really watch me do this negative 1/5
91:48 - and two eight that's not right
91:52 - yeah it is right and then two six two
91:55 - four four four two six two four four
92:03 - four let's autoformat all this okay now
92:06 - this is the really important part
92:10 - [Music]
92:16 - no no this plus has to go here this has
92:18 - to go there that's okay now this is okay
92:20 - that's fine that's fine okay it's fine
92:23 - now everything's okay everybody Oh ain't
92:25 - gonna know just I need a zero here it
92:27 - definitely need a zero there okay what's
92:30 - wrong oh no no these have to go over
92:31 - because there's no negative there oh and
92:33 - this has a yeah I don't like this this
92:35 - has to go over to yes yes okay this has
92:37 - to go over there we go okay that's much
92:39 - better now now the other thing is I'm
92:43 - just gonna say float next X float next Y
92:49 - and then I'm gonna because I just want
92:54 - to declare the variables once and I'm
92:59 - gonna get rid of all of these yes you're
93:01 - watching me do this in the most tedious
93:03 - ridiculous way possible but it's good
93:05 - this is good for you because you're
93:09 - gonna you're gonna improve your coding
93:11 - skills by doing it in a different way
93:13 - like watching me and my poor poor poor
93:15 - way of doing this okay so this is good
93:19 - now I need to now I'm gonna pick a
93:20 - random number and I'm just gonna say I'm
93:25 - gonna just do this if R is less I'm
93:27 - gonna I'm gonna do a 1 out of 4 chance
93:28 - for each of these if R is less than 0.25
93:30 - do this otherwise if R is less than 0.5
93:35 - do this one otherwise otherwise if R is
93:41 - less than 0.75 do this one and then
93:44 - otherwise do the last one so now I'm
93:50 - just doing a 1 out of 4 chance of doing
93:52 - any of these and pausing for a second
93:59 - because I'm seeing lots of shouting in
94:00 - the chat
94:06 - [Applause]
94:13 - all right no one is okay so let's all
94:18 - right so let's run this and see what
94:20 - happens we're not gonna get the fern cuz
94:22 - hey but we should look at this I'm
94:23 - getting something
94:25 - it's just look at this oh it might even
94:27 - be like tree like so one thing I want to
94:31 - do is I want to pick that I want to take
94:34 - this which is like sort of like next
94:38 - point and I'm going to put that into its
94:40 - own function next point so that I can
94:48 - because I'm probably going to want to
94:50 - also do this and then I'm gonna take
94:52 - this and draw a point and then because I
94:59 - might want to do these multiple times in
95:01 - draw so I think just and I could
95:04 - probably do this in an object-oriented
95:05 - way I should probably store an array of
95:07 - all the points but let's just look at
95:10 - this
95:10 - so now let's let me let this go a little
95:14 - faster so let me say do a hundred of
95:17 - these transformations per frame and we
95:23 - can see and by the way zero zero should
95:25 - be at the bottom I'm now sort of
95:26 - figuring out so I'm going to put zero
95:28 - zero at the bottom so I'm gonna map this
95:31 - from a to two down to zero right oh well
95:39 - I did that no zero to two I mean zero to
95:41 - two there we go so here's my weird tree
95:44 - thing that I'm making without being
95:47 - thoughtful about those probabilities now
95:51 - let's go look at those I still think
95:53 - there might be a mistake here but I
95:54 - haven't implemented the probability so
95:56 - let see what happens if I implement the
95:58 - probabilities okay so let's look at the
96:01 - Wikipedia page it says then somewhere
96:06 - [Music]
96:08 - where are those probabilities
96:14 - these then I'm gonna the match Yemen is
96:22 - P the probabilities a threat for the
96:26 - coefficients o P represents that
96:27 - probability factor oh I'm such a silly
96:29 - goose let's go look a bit let's go look
96:36 - at the Wikipedia page for those
96:37 - probabilities and you can see they're
96:40 - actually right here in this table so
96:42 - this table is actually defining all
96:43 - those coefficients and here under P
96:46 - probability so we have a 1% chance of
96:48 - the first one 85 percent chance of the
96:50 - second 7 percent chance of the third and
96:53 - 7 percent chance of the fourth so I'm
96:56 - actually gonna put this I'm going to
96:58 - amazingly do this in an array well
97:03 - actually so so okay so there is let's
97:05 - think about this back here there's one
97:07 - percent chance of this first one so I
97:09 - know that should be this now I want to
97:12 - have a 80 85 percent chance of this
97:17 - second one so now I actually need to
97:19 - look and see is it less than point eight
97:21 - six because if it's point less than
97:24 - point zero one that's a 1% chance and
97:27 - between point zero one and point eight
97:29 - six is 85 percent then I need to do less
97:33 - than point 93 right because there's a 7%
97:38 - chance of this third one and in all
97:40 - other cases the fourth one so let's look
97:42 - at this now and are we going to get a
97:46 - Barnsley firm
97:56 - okay map range is limited - yes I need -
98:03 - all right so this is looking okay this
98:07 - is looking pretty good now everything's
98:08 - like way off the screen right cuz I
98:10 - wasn't for I was like oh I'll just make
98:12 - it between negative 1 and 1 but you
98:14 - might have noticed affirmative the chest
98:15 - I mean plus one point six so clearly the
98:18 - point can go further than that so let's
98:20 - give ourselves some more space so where
98:22 - are the mappings the mappings are here
98:25 - let's go from 0 to 4 and let's try
98:28 - negative 2 to 2 and let's make the
98:32 - stroke weight a little bit less let's
98:34 - give our let's give ourselves much more
98:36 - space ah look at that ah beauteous Ness
98:45 - [Music]
98:46 - Barnsley fern that looks about right
98:48 - okay so I'm done even though I want to
98:50 - do so much more but I'm not going to I'm
98:53 - going to let you do more because what
98:56 - can you how could you animate this how
98:58 - could you pick color how could you
98:59 - consider this space how could you
99:01 - connect the points how could you render
99:04 - this in a different way there's so many
99:05 - possibilities but I'm gonna leave this
99:07 - at this I've just done the core
99:09 - algorithm and we have this Barnsley fern
99:12 - and we you know you can by the way you
99:13 - can try you can see here there's
99:15 - variations of this why is mine kind of
99:17 - different than this though hold on a
99:21 - second mine looks different
99:32 - let's check our numbers oh okay so first
99:42 - of all i'm discovering here this is
99:44 - actually giving me the correct range
99:46 - so let's actually do this range let's go
99:53 - into the code and implement the range
99:56 - that was on the wikipedia page so
100:00 - negative two there and then zero two
100:10 - let's try this see what happens what did
100:16 - I get wrong here oh there we go okay so
100:27 - I was not mapping the proper range so it
100:30 - didn't curve to the right but now I am
100:32 - mapping the full Barnsley fern thank you
100:35 - very much I really want to make it
100:38 - rainbow color and do other stuff but we
100:40 - have completed it this is the Barnsley
100:42 - fern fractal in processing in about
100:45 - three hours and 42 minutes thanks for
100:47 - watching this entire video and I hope
100:50 - you make a variation of this in some way
100:52 - that I couldn't possibly imagine and
100:53 - share it with me share it in the
100:55 - comments there's a way you can go to the
100:57 - coding training calm and submit a link
100:58 - to your contribution and on Twitter at
101:00 - Schiffman or at decoding drain okay
101:02 - thanks and I will see you all in the
101:04 - next co2 challenge
101:10 - okay so I think I'm done for today
101:27 - mostly and I did these two coding
101:30 - challenges I'm very pleased with them do
101:33 - a sierpinski triangle haven't I done
101:36 - that before but what I want oh I forgot
101:40 - that I'm still live sweetie I was like
101:42 - I've done I'm back talking to myself we
101:47 - probably need a Barnsley fern song
101:49 - apparently but all my songs just used
101:50 - the same chords
101:55 - actually let's let's watch it more
101:56 - slowly let's watch it more slowly for
102:00 - fun it's made with processing and some
102:15 - code it's by me well not by because the
102:20 - algorithm or really be the first person
102:23 - write this code and lots of other people
102:25 - have done it I'm just doing it my own
102:27 - way that's kind of in a poor way without
102:29 - easily changed because I should probably
102:31 - do some rays and we affect the code and
102:32 - you think about doing it on oriented and
102:34 - Coates really terrible but it works it's
102:37 - pretty I have done constant Papa asking
102:46 - the chat I have done strange attractors
102:48 - it looks great with lower stroke weight
102:51 - yeah you know this just the thing is
102:54 - like I don't want to I really think it
102:57 - would be interesting to like you know if
102:59 - I could use some alpha and give it like
103:03 - a higher stroke weight like what would
103:04 - happen and I want to put this back and I
103:11 - could like you know I think there's lots
103:13 - of interesting possibilities here you
103:15 - know I could pick from a color palette
103:25 - so I encourage you to make your own make
103:32 - your own Barnsley fern with your own
103:36 - stuff alright alright
103:42 - mapping y coordinate to hue would look
103:44 - pretty that's what it that's it that's a
103:46 - great idea so the color and what if I
104:00 - did
104:04 - map Y to between 0 and 255 something
104:11 - like this right oh there we go there's
104:16 - our rainbow I don't know why I don't
104:23 - know why I didn't do this as part of the
104:24 - video here we can make this a screenshot
104:29 - here's a thumbnail for you Matt's yeah
104:31 - hold on let's go back to stroke wait -
104:36 - and let's give it a little alpha and
104:42 - let's do it 500 times per frame
104:52 - and I believe the background color is
104:55 - incorrect
104:55 - it's supposed to be 51 how many of you
104:58 - been watching my channel long enough but
104:59 - that means something to you there we go
105:19 - okay all right now all right so what I
105:25 - want to do is talk about and what's
105:29 - gonna try to build this so here's where
105:31 - I'm thinking for a classification I'm
105:33 - going to do a machine learning tutorial
105:35 - about classification with tensorflow djf
105:37 - and I want to do this tomorrow so what I
105:41 - was thinking of building was and let me
105:45 - let me switch to make a p5 sketch real
105:50 - quick all right so let's actually make
105:59 - this maybe this will become a video give
106:01 - me it give me a moment here
106:14 - oops I'm gonna be here for a little bit
106:17 - longer I'm gonna work on this thing that
106:19 - I want to try I'm just trying to decide
106:22 - if I should I think I'm just going to
106:23 - use a Google sheet it's just gonna be so
106:24 - hackable if I use firebase that's not
106:29 - gonna be everything's gonna be hackable
106:32 - in the way that I do this well I'll just
106:34 - clean the data though hopefully the
106:38 - trolls will not get me so p5 G - B crowd
106:52 - source color
106:57 - [Music]
107:09 - great and don't need the library's
107:13 - directory okay what would make it
107:30 - hackable I think if I write all the data
107:32 - to a oh the Google she just needs to be
107:36 - public I just think if I I don't know
107:43 - how to so that this is what I'm planning
107:46 - to do let me stick the sir what I'm
107:47 - planning to do is make a really simple
107:50 - web page that just shows you a random
107:52 - color and then has a drop-down and asks
107:54 - you to categorize that color and hit
107:56 - submit
107:57 - and it'll write the RGB values and your
107:59 - category your label to a spreadsheet so
108:03 - if I do this with Google sheets the
108:06 - easiest way to do this is to just make
108:07 - the Google sheet public and then just
108:11 - write to it from the web page but then
108:13 - if the Google sheet is public and my
108:15 - code is out there public anybody could
108:17 - just like write their own script to like
108:19 - delete everything on the page or to add
108:21 - like a bunch of labels that are bad
108:23 - words for example so I could write it to
108:25 - firebase and I have to put some database
108:28 - protections but then I need a server to
108:30 - like hide the keys so I think I'm gonna
108:32 - rely on the goodwill of the internet cuz
108:34 - what could possibly go wrong to try my
108:37 - best
108:40 - firebase can be write new only huh well
108:48 - here's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna build
108:50 - a kind of like hack a version with no
108:54 - security as part of the tutorial and
108:57 - then I'm going to put I'm going to make
109:02 - a version with some security after the
109:05 - fact you the coding train viewers will
109:07 - help me and I will and I will use that
109:13 - as the thing where I asked people to
109:15 - submit stuff make it fill in a Google
109:17 - Form yeah I was just going to use a
109:20 - Google Form for this the reason why I
109:22 - didn't want I didn't
109:23 - feel like I could could I use a Google
109:24 - form where it generates so so let's
109:26 - let's investigate this for a second so
109:28 - this is what I want to do so I don't
109:33 - know what I'm logged in as let me shoot
109:36 - what kind of Google accounts do I have
109:38 - here I don't want to log into myself oh
109:40 - let me I know I know
109:45 - go back how do I remove these isn't
109:50 - there like usually a button for remove
109:52 - because I want to port John Henry
109:54 - Thompson is still on here now I keep
109:56 - showing his email coding rainbow live
110:03 - alright fine I just don't I have to you
110:07 - don't need to host the firebase keys oh
110:12 - you mean I could make I can make people
110:20 - um yeah I don't didn't really feel like
110:23 - using firebase hold on let me coding
110:28 - rainbow live is a perfectly fine Google
110:30 - account for me to use I just need to
110:32 - figure out what my password is I got a
110:33 - look-in password
110:49 - so many Google accounts oh my goodness
110:55 - crazy password time looking at my
111:00 - password manager on the other my other
111:02 - computer here's what I'm doing you're
111:04 - wondering okay so new new Google for
111:18 - whoops new Google form color label er
111:28 - creating a data set for machine learning
111:33 - classification example and label this
111:40 - color oh I could embed the form on a
111:43 - page how could I get that so then I just
111:47 - need a like multiple choice and I'm
111:50 - gonna do something like blue-ish red-ish
111:56 - green ish orange-ish purple-ish yellow
112:11 - ish what's missing from this good enough
112:17 - right
112:17 - or like greyish okay
112:30 - so this is the idea so now if I were to
112:33 - look at this form this is what I want
112:43 - the issue is what I want is to show a
112:46 - randomly generated color here and then
112:51 - and then have that color also be part of
112:55 - the spreadsheet with this form so what
112:57 - would be the easiest way to do that I
112:59 - mean I was just gonna build my own
113:00 - interface and write to a Google
113:03 - spreadsheet directly but I'd love to
113:06 - just use a Google Form rainbow ish so I
113:12 - will wait and see if anybody has any
113:13 - suggestions for me yeah I was gonna do
113:25 - labeling them by sentiment but I think
113:29 - what I wanted to do I wanted to do that
113:31 - but I think that I think that's more of
113:33 - an exercise for the viewer what Eric is
113:40 - writing to me in the slack group I like
113:42 - the idea of labeling I had this idea of
113:44 - like Oh instead of like having them but
113:46 - I just kind of want to show like it's a
113:48 - very trivial thing that works brown-ish
113:54 - I'm missing okay I meant make the custom
113:58 - web page fill out the Google Form yeah
114:05 - or emotion right I was gonna do I yeah I
114:10 - was thinking that my example would ask
114:12 - people to then make their own version of
114:15 - this with different more creative labels
114:27 - alright I'm gonna I'm gonna go my way
114:31 - I'm gonna write to a Google form using
114:34 - tabletop j/s and I am going to so let me
114:40 - create a new sheet got it color data are
114:56 - red green blue label okay so I'm gonna
115:11 - write to this spreadsheet
115:28 - all right okay so
115:45 - okay I don't know if this really is
115:47 - going to make sense as a video tutorial
115:49 - but I am going to include it anyway
116:08 - usually what I use for API access to
116:12 - Google Spreadsheets is a tabletop j/s
116:15 - because it's pretty easy to use and I
116:25 - can write to it pretty easily I've done
116:26 - this before and I just this currently
116:31 - being maintained yeah April 4th that's
116:34 - not too long ago and yeah okay all right
116:50 - all right welcome to a new session of
116:53 - intelligence and learning tutorial
116:55 - compilation thing so this session is
116:57 - going to be a series of videos and I'm
116:59 - going to build a classifier so what do I
117:02 - mean by build a classifier hold on
117:11 - everybody
117:54 - okay now I've done this before I have
117:58 - some video tutorials where I did a
117:59 - doodle classifier and this is somewhat
118:01 - similar and I'm also going to redo the
118:03 - doodle classifier with a convolutional
118:05 - neural network that's coming but here
118:07 - what I want to start with is a very
118:09 - baseline of just doing classification
118:12 - and so sorry
118:35 - classification now in order for me to do
118:39 - a classification example the full story
118:43 - from training testing to deployment of a
118:48 - machine learning model to classify some
118:49 - data I need to first think about data
118:55 - now
118:56 - what I'm going to do in this series is
119:00 - use a trivial data set address data set
119:03 - that really doesn't have much of a point
119:05 - of view that's not particularly
119:06 - meaningful I just want to show you the
119:08 - full story of how all the pieces work
119:11 - together when I kind of get to the end
119:14 - of this series I'll talk to you a bit
119:16 - more of what where you might find your
119:18 - own data sets how you might collect your
119:20 - own data and sort of think about where
119:22 - you might take this but you know I can't
119:24 - emphasize enough that the data the data
119:29 - that you're using in the data that
119:30 - you're not using is the primary most
119:34 - fundamental piece of all of this if you
119:37 - you know if you just want to try out the
119:38 - algorithm what I'm doing is just fine
119:40 - but if you actually want to build
119:41 - something that classify studying in the
119:43 - real world there are a lot of questions
119:45 - you should ask yourself starting from
119:46 - the very first one should you be doing
119:48 - this in the first place like is what
119:50 - you're doing good or is it causing harm
119:52 - who's being left out in the data there's
119:54 - lots of really important critical
119:56 - questions you want to
119:56 - think about so putting that aside we'll
119:59 - come back to it at the end the data set
120:01 - that I'm going to use I'm just going to
120:03 - make a color dataset so and I'm gonna
120:07 - crowdsource this from you the viewer by
120:11 - the time you're watching this I might
120:12 - have already finished all the
120:13 - crowdsourcing but there'll be links in
120:15 - this video's description
120:16 - it's where you can find the various
120:16 - elements so I'm going to create
120:19 - essentially a spreadsheet it's going to
120:23 - have four columns red green blue and
120:27 - then label so each record each req data
120:35 - point is going to have three values like
120:39 - 255 0 0 and it's label is going to be
120:42 - something like you know red ish then I
120:47 - might have 0 255 0 and its label would
120:51 - be green ish so I'm again this is what I
120:55 - mean by totally trivial I am labeling
120:57 - colors into a certain number of buckets
120:59 - reddish greenish yellowish blueish
121:01 - purple-ish orangish grayish brownish
121:04 - something like that and then I'm gonna
121:07 - have this massive data set won't be that
121:09 - big but a big data set and it's going to
121:11 - learn from this labeled data how to take
121:14 - a new color right there are millions of
121:16 - possible colors 256 to the third power
121:18 - and automatically label it according to
121:22 - what human beings generally think of
121:24 - those colors in those certain categories
121:26 - so this is what I'm going to build so
121:27 - this first part of the video series is
121:30 - just about me figuring out how to
121:31 - collect this data and so the way that
121:33 - I'm going to do it is I'm gonna make a
121:34 - p5 sketch that shows a random color and
121:36 - gives you a little drop-down menu or a
121:38 - multiple-choice thing to like pick which
121:40 - category and hit submit and it gets
121:42 - saved in a Google sheet and that Google
121:44 - sheet will be this spreadsheet that then
121:46 - I will then use later to load and feed
121:48 - into tensorflow j/s to train a model to
121:52 - learn to classify RGB colors according
121:54 - to some set of labels and from there you
121:57 - might start to think about more
121:58 - creatively well what did you actually
122:00 - crowdsource to labels for I'm going to
122:05 - sit here and I'll come back to the data
122:06 - so I'll come back to that
122:13 - this chat died everything's okay we're
122:16 - still going there's some code here in
122:22 - the in the in the chat all right now I
122:30 - would have mentioned that this this idea
122:33 - comes from some work that Hannah Davis
122:36 - is doing here researching at ITP around
122:39 - data and crowdsourcing data she is
122:42 - actually making a data set around
122:45 - landscapes and tagging those landscapes
122:49 - with sort of what you might expect field
122:52 - ocean whatever tags you might expect
122:55 - anyway but also thinking about could you
122:57 - have emotional landscapes could you have
122:58 - a data set of landscapes these are
123:00 - landscapes that sort of that that embody
123:05 - the concept of fear or happiness or joy
123:07 - so that might be something you start to
123:09 - think about what kind of creative labels
123:12 - could you apply fixed set of labels to
123:14 - colors there's interesting possibilities
123:17 - there so you might make your own
123:18 - creative version of this but I'm gonna
123:20 - start with something very trivial and
123:21 - exactly as sort of written out here okay
123:26 - so let's go back and I've got a p5
123:30 - sketch here that I started with nothing
123:31 - in it and I want to add so the first
123:34 - thing I want to do is just pick a random
123:35 - color it's gonna be like the simplest
123:37 - thing ever so I'm going to and by the
123:40 - way April I could use a Google Form I
123:43 - could use something a service that that
123:47 - I can pay people to label data like
123:49 - Mechanical Turk or CrowdFlower
123:51 - maybe I'll try to look at some of those
123:52 - in another video but right here I'm
123:54 - gonna custom build my own thing and so I
124:01 - am what do I need to do I'm gonna I'm
124:05 - gonna pick up a random a random red
124:08 - value between 0 and 255
124:20 - then I am going to and I want to floor
124:23 - it because I kind of don't want to deal
124:25 - with floating-point numbers there's not
124:27 - really a reason for me to do that and
124:31 - then I want to then I want to show it so
124:38 - I'm gonna say background are RGB and
124:44 - then I am going to what do I want to do
124:48 - now I'm going to say drop-down equals
124:52 - create select and then I can add options
124:57 - to the drop-down like this let's just
125:04 - see if this works whoops blue fish red
125:11 - fish green ish okay
125:17 - so let's just see what this looks like
125:18 - so now if I go to the browser and look
125:21 - at this sketch and we can see here I've
125:26 - got my drop-down and every time i
125:29 - refresh the page I see a new color and
125:32 - then I can add also submit equals create
125:38 - button submit and submit dot
125:45 - mousepressed submit you know send data
125:50 - and then I can write a function called
125:52 - send data where I am going to send this
125:57 - data to something okay so this is the
126:01 - basic idea we don't need this to be so
126:05 - big there we go so this is what I want
126:12 - each time i refresh this page I'm going
126:16 - to pick a label and I'm going to hit
126:18 - submit and it'll hopefully do suss put
126:20 - that data somewhere where is it going to
126:22 - go I want it to go to this spreadsheet
126:24 - so I want to see the RGB
126:27 - and values and the label end up in this
126:29 - spreadsheet then I'm gonna turn it over
126:31 - to you all and I'm gonna get lots of
126:33 - lots of lots of data that I can then use
126:36 - for training the model time out okay
126:44 - okay so where have I done this before I
127:15 - think I've done this in
127:26 - the Mad Libs example yeah
127:38 - oh this isn't writing to it though this
127:43 - is just reading from it
128:01 - call back got data where is that oh yeah
128:03 - right
128:04 - so that's that's reading from it super
128:06 - simple did I do one where I write to the
128:09 - spreadsheet is that in a to z whoops
128:26 - [Music]
128:28 - load CSV Google sheets yeah got data I
128:40 - don't think I wrote to it in any of my
128:43 - examples right I just had a form so my
128:48 - examples I didn't write to it so let me
128:51 - look at table tough chess is there a
128:54 - feature for writing to it getting
128:56 - started share advanced anyone with a
128:59 - link I don't know if you can write to it
129:08 - with tabletop j/s
129:19 - I could certainly use
129:30 - yeah radio buttons would be much less
129:32 - annoying or just three submit buttons
129:35 - yeah I definitely want to change the
129:36 - interface I'm just trying to figure out
129:38 - how I want to do this table top J s
129:44 - right to Google sheet why I love table
129:54 - top but don't use it in production
130:03 - Oh
130:06 - what's this sheet see
130:29 - is this open source free Oh glitch I
130:34 - should make us a glitch app let's look
130:49 - sheet CJ s
130:58 - bsd it's open source
131:20 - [Music]
131:32 - let's look at this on glitch this is
131:34 - amazing
131:53 - I should probably just use firebase I
131:57 - don't know why I was avoiding using
131:59 - firebase get I don't I don't think this
132:09 - is writing to the file anywhere likes
132:12 - just using tabletop behind the scenes
132:19 - yeah you know none of these are writing
132:23 - to the spreadsheet which I know I can do
132:25 - with I don't know why I can't remember
132:26 - what this is called but turn spreadsheet
132:29 - into the service but it's not free
132:34 - she to this I've used before it's quite
132:38 - good but it's not free I don't believe
132:41 - it's so I don't think that I want to use
132:49 - it for this yeah you're a five Kody
132:55 - challenge 45 yeah in fact I have even
132:58 - simpler ones let's use firebase I think
133:02 - it's gonna make more sense to use
133:03 - firebase I have a whole set of firebase
133:05 - tutorials so firebase
133:14 - where's the firebase tutorials examples
133:19 - how come we're not seeing it
133:40 - which we catch the firebase stuff
134:05 - week nine firebase
134:16 - oh here we go this is what I'm looking
134:18 - for this is exactly what I need okay
134:23 - perfect
134:26 - great okay yeah Google sheets has its
134:33 - own API I just can't bring myself to use
134:36 - it all right
134:50 - okay
134:59 - so let me set this up on firebase using
135:02 - this coding train live account grapes
135:06 - get started and project okay okay all
135:23 - right
135:30 - so how do I do the radio buttons in p5
135:34 - anybody remember create radio yep create
135:41 - radio perfect okay so let me come back
135:47 - to here
135:55 - all right okay
136:02 - all right I really got to go but let's
136:04 - let's try see if I can push this a
136:05 - little bit further because I would like
136:07 - to finish this to get some data before
136:08 - tomorrow all right Maxie I don't know
136:12 - where I was so this is gonna be hard to
136:13 - edit but we'll do your best I think you
136:16 - can you can get rid of the part where I
136:18 - looked at the spreadsheet so maybe where
136:20 - I'm coming from here okay
136:22 - I don't remember where I was all right
136:27 - okay so I need to put this data
136:30 - somewhere I'm actually going to do that
136:31 - in the next part and do that in a
136:32 - separate part I am going to use a
136:36 - service called firebase which I have a
136:39 - whole set of tutorials about so if you
136:40 - want to learn a lot more about firebase
136:42 - I'll link to those tutorials in this
136:44 - video's description but I'm just gonna
136:45 - kind of jump right in and quickly like
136:47 - you know make a firebase project and
136:50 - send all my data there from this p5
136:52 - sketch so but before I go a great great
136:56 - point was made in the chat that this is
136:58 - particularly oops where am i this is a
137:02 - particularly awkward interface
137:04 - especially if I only get to do one I
137:06 - probably should make this that I could
137:07 - like do like five colors all at once but
137:09 - let's say I only get to do one it's
137:10 - gonna be really annoying to have to use
137:11 - this drop-down so one thing I could do
137:14 - is do create radio and then I'll just
137:21 - rename this and in p5 this is a p5 a Dom
137:24 - creation function that I believe should
137:27 - change this to this and you know again
137:29 - the layout here is a little bit awkward
137:31 - I will think about fixing that up but
137:36 - now we can see here the idea here I'm
137:38 - gonna pick blue and hit submit
137:39 - I'm gonna pick reddish blueish and it's
137:42 - a minute okay so I just need to I don't
137:46 - take this function send data and send
137:50 - the data to firebase and that's what I'm
137:56 - gonna do in the next video okay so the
137:58 - next video I'm going to send the data to
137:59 - firebase I'm gonna then upload this
138:01 - somewhere and let those of you who are
138:02 - watching this live
138:04 - give me some data okay see you soon
138:09 - all right okay
138:25 - let me add orange purple yellow pink
138:45 - brown gray worst worst interface ever
138:59 - what can I do really briefly to to make
139:04 - this better radio buttons style what is
139:13 - it actually making the what did it
139:23 - actually generate for me input type
139:25 - radio' label label input oh it's just
139:29 - putting these one after another
139:32 - float:left multiple buttons so just do a
139:40 - different button for each oh just do a
139:41 - different button for each one I like
139:43 - that multiple buttons great idea
139:55 - all right yeah display:block
140:07 - all right we just see if that's a quick
140:09 - fix yes yes I know the camera went off
140:25 - yeah you know what I'm just gonna I'm
140:27 - gonna make everything a button that
140:28 - doesn't need to be in
141:08 - let's do it this way red are red green
141:12 - blue orange yellow pink purple gray
141:27 - brown gray
141:38 - and let's just do
141:51 - oops
142:01 - there we go
142:04 - okay yes and this is totally bonkers
142:08 - I'll fix it up the point of this is not
142:11 - to worry about the DOM stuff so this
142:14 - will be this will be better let me close
142:18 - a bunch of these windows that don't need
142:19 - to be open
142:28 - just dismiss this right now
142:39 - okay close this okay this is my
142:45 - reference and okay okay
142:55 - can you change the background color of
142:57 - each button to be the same as the text
143:00 - oh how it'd be so good wouldn't it okay
143:03 - I'm not gonna do that right now that's a
143:06 - great idea and CSS layout it's just not
143:10 - not part of the what I'm doing right now
143:12 - okay
143:12 - okay I'm back by the way in between the
143:15 - last video in this one suggestion came
143:17 - in in the chat to say like oh you know
143:20 - be easier if you just had a bunch of
143:21 - buttons so like I could just click
143:22 - whichever button yeah I think the color
143:24 - is so this is like ah its greenish to me
143:27 - I'm gonna refresh oh that's also
143:30 - greenish that's purplish that's bluish
143:34 - right so I just click the button and it
143:36 - submits and actually probably when I hit
143:38 - when I do that I can have it then pick a
143:39 - new color so what I need to do is now is
143:42 - send the send the color to firebase
143:46 - alright so I'm now logged in to some
143:49 - arbitrary Google accounts called coding
143:51 - rainbow live and I'm going to add a
143:52 - project and I'm going to call this color
143:55 - classification and I'm gonna accept all
144:00 - sorts of and agree to all sorts of
144:01 - things I'm gonna hit create project I'm
144:05 - gonna wait for it to do its thing okay
144:22 - continue I knew Fred is ready all right
144:27 - really get started
144:29 - ah yes add firebase to your web app
144:31 - perfect okay so what I need is this
144:34 - stuff so let me grab this and go to
144:37 - index.html and and by the way there are
144:41 - so many things that could be done to
144:42 - improve the interface here I should
144:44 - probably work on an HTML and add CSS and
144:46 - all that stuff that's not the focus of
144:47 - this video so I don't at me is what I'm
144:51 - supposed to say but you should at me
144:54 - though I'm okay with being acted at at
144:56 - act act at will just be nice be nice
145:01 - alright so I'm gonna add this stuff so
145:05 - I'm gonna add this script tag for
145:07 - firebase
145:09 - and I'm actually just gonna take this
145:10 - and I'm gonna put this in in my peace
145:15 - with my p5 code I'm just gonna actually
145:18 - just do this at the beginning of setup
145:19 - okay so now I'm connected to firebase I
145:25 - don't know let's let's see what happens
145:28 - hit refresh you know it's not telling me
145:30 - anything but should be good yeah it
145:38 - something's happening here okay great
145:39 - now I need to by the way I need this
145:42 - send data to go with all these buttons
145:44 - so I should be able to say buttons dot
145:50 - length and I should just be able to say
145:54 - buttons dot mouse press a button x'
145:56 - index i dot mouse pressed send data so
146:01 - this is the assigning this send data
146:03 - event to every single one of those
146:04 - buttons and guess what right here I'm
146:07 - gonna just say console.log this dot HTML
146:12 - so by the way so when you use the p5
146:15 - mousepressed function and give it an
146:18 - event that event is bound to the Dom
146:21 - element upon which it was called and
146:23 - referenced in the keyword this so and
146:26 - then HTML is the text of the button so
146:29 - this should if I do this we can see
146:31 - whatever button I click I get the label
146:36 - in the console that's good so now I need
146:39 - to send the data to firebase so gonna
146:42 - tell me how to do that here
146:43 - okay so I could start to look at the
146:45 - firebase documentation but I'm gonna and
146:48 - you know I could go back and watch my
146:49 - firebase tutorials cuz I completely
146:51 - forgotten how to use it but I do have
146:52 - one of my examples and this example here
146:55 - has some code in it which send to
146:59 - firebase so and it's actually quite easy
147:02 - for me to do this I just want to need to
147:04 - create a reference database I'm going to
147:07 - call it like colors or something I need
147:09 - to put some data in it so let me grab
147:12 - all this code here and I'm gonna grab
147:17 - this code and I'm going to put it I'll
147:18 - link to that particular example as well
147:21 - I'm going to
147:22 - put it in here I'm gonna use let and I'm
147:26 - not my example that I made before the
147:28 - firebase tutorial is about fruits but
147:30 - I'm gonna do color I'm gonna say color
147:34 - label of the databases color database
147:38 - and I'm gonna call it colors the data
147:42 - that I want to send is has an R and that
147:46 - is and I need these then to be global
147:50 - variables if I want to be able to access
147:51 - them so so I'm gonna make these global
147:55 - variables and give them an initial value
147:59 - I'm actually going to put this though in
148:02 - a function called pick color
148:05 - I think that'll make everything nicer
148:07 - I'm gonna say function a pick color and
148:13 - then I'm going to create an object with
148:16 - oh I could use that what's that thing
148:20 - called an es6 now where I could just
148:22 - make the object if I want the R value to
148:24 - be are the G value to be G there's a way
148:26 - to do that the B value to be B and then
148:29 - I want the label to be this dot HTML so
148:35 - this is the object this is what I want
148:36 - to send to firebase the red green and
148:38 - blue value and the label so then I'm
148:41 - just going to say let the the particular
148:46 - color be the color database push push
148:54 - that data and when it's finished
148:56 - oh it's going to give me this like key
148:57 - which is interesting to see because
148:59 - everything has this unique every record
149:01 - in a database has a unique ID so I could
149:03 - look at that just to see if it's right
149:05 - and I can have this callback finished
149:07 - something went wrong I could you use
149:10 - console dot error or data save
149:13 - successfully and let's see so let's
149:17 - let's do console dot log saving saving
149:26 - data and then also log the data and
149:30 - let's see what happens okay so now I'm
149:34 - going to go back to here
149:36 - and that that to me is pinkish and
149:39 - oppressed pinkish database is not
149:41 - defined oh yeah line 49 Oh
149:47 - firebase initialized so what did I not
149:49 - do that I did in this particular example
149:53 - when I initialized it oh did I create I
149:57 - have to create a database object so I
149:59 - have to create a database object from
150:02 - after I initialize firebase so let's go
150:05 - and do that that's a step that I missed
150:07 - and I'm gonna that's going to be a
150:09 - global variable called database now I'm
150:13 - gonna run this again
150:15 - that looks very greenish to me and
150:18 - saving this data 52:26 sixty-five with
150:21 - this label it generated a key but
150:23 - permission denied
150:25 - so now what I need to do is do something
150:27 - to allow myself to write to the database
150:30 - and I'm gonna do something not so great
150:33 - but I'm gonna do it anyway I forget
150:39 - where this is pause for a second this
150:42 - can be edit point pretty sure I am I
150:58 - real-time database rules okay it returns
151:05 - a promise I'm not using promises for
151:12 - this
151:29 - oh thanks what's the what's that entry
151:34 - right not if data exists so you can't
151:36 - overwrite some buddies thing is that
151:39 - what that does okay so I need to change
151:49 - the permissions that are in my firebase
151:51 - project so how come I've lost where that
151:54 - is probably understeer project settings
151:59 - color classification where is it
152:03 - users and permissions no hold on the
152:09 - interface has changed I have to figure
152:11 - out where it is anybody know where it is
152:12 - now Oh me I go to here
152:30 - I'm in color classification machine ml
152:35 - kit hosting storage develop database
152:43 - rules I guess I have to do get started
152:50 - uh okay okay okay okay
153:07 - do we go
153:20 - so now I have to be thoughtful and think
153:23 - about like the privacy and security of
153:25 - the data which is a really important
153:27 - point but again in this sort of like
153:29 - thing that I'm just working on to try to
153:31 - just get to the finish line here and
153:33 - with a trivial data set I'm going to at
153:35 - least just sort of open up and make make
153:37 - the data base easily writable without a
153:38 - lot of security rules so let's see so I
153:41 - need to go to firebase and I need to go
153:43 - to your two database and actually I
153:45 - don't even have a real time database
153:47 - available yet so I need to do get
153:49 - started and then look at this
153:51 - so make your database private by denying
153:54 - all reads and writes which is something
153:56 - that you really that that in many cases
153:58 - you're gonna want to do start in test
154:00 - mode anyone with your database reference
154:03 - will be able to read and write to your
154:04 - database I'm gonna hit an able I am
154:06 - gonna add one more thing to the I am
154:10 - gonna add one more thing to the rules so
154:13 - and thank you to me I am so me from the
154:15 - chat I can add in a rule for color data
154:23 - I'm gonna add another rule and let me
154:26 - zoom in here so you can see what I'm
154:27 - doing I would I want to do is I don't
154:28 - want to let somebody overwrite somebody
154:30 - else's entry that they already put in
154:33 - and so if I say dollar sign entry and
154:38 - then I set the write the dot write
154:43 - property to not data exists and again
154:49 - you can look through the documentation
154:51 - to see all the different things let's
154:54 - see does this is this right here I think
154:55 - I've got this right color data Open
154:59 - bracket close bracket dollar sign entry
155:02 - open bracket close bracket dot write not
155:06 - data exists this should hopefully give
155:08 - me a little bit more protection I'm
155:10 - gonna hit publish and now click back to
155:15 - database Oh get started where is it well
155:19 - maybe I have good I haven't written any
155:21 - data yet let's now run this again what
155:25 - is that that's kind of brownish I guess
155:27 - there we go looks like it's saved the
155:29 - data successfully and let's go now back
155:33 - to here
155:34 - and see what we got there we go
155:38 - colors and here it is there's my first
155:41 - data point I could go and add a bunch
155:43 - more reddish Oh what I wanted to do is
155:50 - then also have it pick a new color so as
155:53 - soon as it finishes data saved
155:55 - successfully let's say pick color and
155:58 - we'll get a new one right because it's
156:02 - going to pick color pick color should
156:04 - also draw the color so that's greenish
156:09 - greenish bluish bluish greenish purplish
156:16 - greenish oops oh I messed up but that's
156:20 - okay
156:20 - reddish greenish okay so I think we're
156:23 - done this is finished I'm going to put
156:26 - this somewhere on the internet maybe
156:27 - clean it up and add some interface stuff
156:29 - to it just here we can quickly see we
156:33 - can quickly see my data set these are
156:36 - all the things that are ventured so far
156:38 - with the RGB values and a label okay so
156:41 - now what I'm going to do between now and
156:43 - the next video is I'm gonna let this
156:45 - live for a bit try to collect the data
156:47 - I might have to clean the data a bit
156:48 - which I'll talk about put it into a
156:50 - spreadsheet figure out what I want to do
156:51 - with it but but and then I'll see you in
156:54 - the next video and I'll start to work on
156:56 - building the machine learning model to
156:58 - actually training a model based on this
157:00 - data okay thanks for watching and I'll
157:01 - see you soon could I do something where
157:12 - I make it could I do something by adding
157:15 - security where I if I make it readable
157:17 - or writable only from a certain IP
157:19 - address or something so you have to use
157:21 - the particular Oh color data two colors
157:31 - I didn't match it shoot
157:36 - oh that should be colors okay let me go
157:41 - back this should be colors right
157:56 - maybe Matt youyou can splice this in in
157:59 - the middle of the video we could do this
158:08 - thing again
158:17 - oops oops color data should actually be
158:24 - colors let me we tried to get because
158:29 - I'm not dude
158:32 - oops color data based on the way I wrote
158:36 - the code should actually be called
158:37 - colors so I'm just gonna really fix that
158:41 - real quick colors and so apologies for
158:44 - that but now it's corrected and whoops I
158:47 - can't get back back back okay I don't
159:04 - know
159:04 - sorry that's you don't I'll do it one
159:09 - other way oh this is actually incorrect
159:17 - this should actually be because in my
159:19 - code it needs to match what I wrote here
159:25 - colors so if I go back to this this
159:28 - should actually be color colors and then
159:32 - and there we go
159:35 - okay and the rules are published that'll
159:39 - spice it I don't know all right so hold
159:45 - on set global write to false to test
159:50 - what would that do
160:10 - I don't understand what what will okay
160:13 - so oh you mean
160:14 - Oh like just do this
160:40 - I don't understand
160:52 - it's letting me do it yes
161:04 - Oh publish this oh this now now won't
161:08 - let me do anything just to test that
161:09 - it's like huh but let me do it shouldn't
161:17 - let me not right now if I can't right if
161:24 - you make doubt write false then you need
161:26 - to run a server that's writing the data
161:28 - on behalf of the user
161:36 - I am NOT a bj AMCs how's this stopping
161:41 - us the viewers just filling your
161:42 - database with junk it's not I'm relying
161:45 - on your goodwill oh I see
162:01 - oh I can write two colors only I see so
162:05 - this is now the whole database is closed
162:08 - but colors is open but I should come
162:13 - back got it one more time oh boy this is
162:19 - fun isn't it one more time for the video
162:29 - editor I made a bad mistake like all the
162:43 - things
162:45 - [Music]
162:58 - in front of a green screen
163:04 - just kidding alright alright stop for a
163:12 - second
163:12 - I made some errors here or I could in
163:15 - that in the permissions and the rules
163:17 - there behind me
163:18 - so let me come back and actually show
163:21 - you what's wrong here so first of all
163:23 - color data let me bring this back up
163:26 - color data should not be called color
163:28 - data it needs to match it needs to match
163:33 - what is actually in the video here
163:36 - it's called colors alright so alright I
163:39 - could change this to color data but
163:41 - since I've already done it added some
163:43 - data
163:43 - I'm gonna call change this to colors and
163:45 - then this which oh one more time for
163:58 - good measure do you guys have any where
164:01 - you need to be what what it was was like
164:03 - five people left watching this this is
164:06 - my process okay don't mess with the
164:08 - process
164:15 - stop stop I made a mistake okay so we
164:19 - bring this back up here and transition
164:21 - back to the computer so I made some
164:23 - mistake in the rules right behind me
164:25 - they're basically a couple things number
164:27 - what oh boy how many times do I get to
164:36 - do this stop stop stop stop stop
164:53 - I made a mistake though that's kind of
164:55 - important for me to correct so let me
164:57 - come back here to the computer no that
164:59 - doesn't work
165:00 - twister here all right so look at this I
165:02 - made some mistakes these are the rules
165:03 - that I just wrote but color data is
165:06 - incorrect so first of all color data
165:07 - needs to match the database reference
165:10 - it's in my code and I call that colors
165:12 - not color data I could change this now
165:16 - to color data here but since I already
165:18 - added a bunch of data under colors let's
165:20 - go change this to colors now the other
165:24 - thing that I want to change here I want
165:26 - to make this false because this now what
165:30 - I want I mean even though this is still
165:31 - kind of wide open and people could fill
165:33 - the database with data that I don't want
165:37 - to fill it up I'm hoping the internet is
165:39 - not going to do that I will clean the
165:41 - clean all that out anyway but at the
165:43 - very least you can only now right to the
165:45 - colors table itself and you can only
165:48 - write if there you can't overwrite
165:50 - somebody else's entry so I'm gonna hit
165:52 - publish here and this should be better
165:55 - now and you can go back and continue
165:56 - watching whatever nonsense I was doing
165:59 - in the other part thank you thank you
166:05 - thank you thank you very much
166:12 - okay so now so now I just need to put
166:19 - this somewhere and and people can pull
166:23 - requests to make this better
166:26 - so let me let's go to github.com coding
166:31 - train let me make a new repository crowd
166:38 - source color data crowd for crowd
166:46 - sourcing color data for a machine
166:50 - learning learning classification example
166:56 - public readme create repository let's
167:04 - just upload this well let's just
167:10 - actually just do this code direct from
167:19 - video dear diary I have designed a
167:26 - terrible interface I also did not do
167:32 - anything to secure the data in firebase
167:36 - help me internet you are my only hope
167:43 - sincerely Daniel no slides chief Mon and
167:52 - one will get that joke
167:57 - choo-choo-choo-choo Dan alright commit
168:04 - all right processing your files settings
168:12 - master branch save so how long do we
168:17 - have to wait we now can go to coding
168:20 - trained github dot
168:24 - crowdsource color data it's not the
168:29 - right URL it'll tell me in those
168:31 - settings why did I go away from that
168:37 - where was that
168:40 - settings here we go there we go so let's
168:51 - make sure this is actually still working
168:55 - what's that
168:56 - greenish okay yellowish greenish
169:01 - purplish bluish greenish I'm just gonna
169:04 - do this for a while bluish brownish
169:07 - bluish bluish greenish orangish greenish
169:13 - purplish pink blueish radish oh great
169:22 - bluish purplish purplish greenish
169:27 - greenish bluish reddish greenish
169:33 - purplish finish all right all right so
169:39 - here we go Oh a Vega volt this is
169:44 - come on internet be kind oh boy okay
169:49 - Internet be kind Internet be kind
169:51 - Internet
169:52 - I will shut this down I will shut this
169:55 - down I won't make that classification
169:56 - tutorial I pull this car over all right
169:59 - thanks everybody that's the end of
170:00 - today's live stream tomorrow I am
170:04 - actually going to come back and actually
170:09 - build the tensorflow J s model to the to
170:16 - to Tenten largest model to to to do the
170:19 - classification
170:25 - it is what time is it 2:30 and anybody
170:35 - have any questions
170:38 - boy I got a lot of date already do you
170:40 - think it's it's somebody flooding it or
170:43 - these are people just actually that
170:46 - doesn't look great that doesn't look
170:47 - gray that looks green that looks green
170:52 - I'm just gonna have to hope I'm gonna
170:55 - have to hope that I have good data
170:58 - alright everyone so I will um see you
171:03 - tomorrow
171:05 - I will be back tomorrow to make this
171:08 - classifier with tensorflow das and
171:14 - that's all clearly now I gotta get the
171:25 - chords for the coding train song it's
171:28 - time to say goodbye I wish there was
171:32 - more time but I've gotta go and
171:38 - [Music]
171:48 - I'd like to be under the sea when are
171:59 - you going to do a scratch coding
172:00 - challenge don't have any plans to do a
172:07 - scratch coding challenge I don't have
172:08 - any plans to do a scat scratch coding
172:10 - challenge anybody has any ideas to help
172:14 - me like write an algorithm to check the
172:17 - potatoe makes sense that would be
172:20 - appreciated but we're gonna I'm gonna
172:22 - work on cleaning up this data set and
172:25 - use it tomorrow
172:28 - Thank You Cody Garden with CJ it's
172:30 - closing time looks like the color isn't
172:34 - refreshing I don't know what that means
172:38 - purplish greenish bluish greenish
172:42 - greenish oh sorry purplish reddish
172:47 - purplish greenish pinkish all right
172:53 - thank you to the new sponsors how do I
172:57 - find the new sponsors I think I have
172:58 - some notice email notifications for that
173:00 - ah new sponsors new sponsors J shone and
173:12 - Tristan thank you so much for your
173:14 - sponsorship Google API key exposed on
173:20 - github oh I just got a security warning
173:23 - from get Guardian that they detected my
173:26 - API key so I was saying something I'm
173:39 - gonna go I'll be back tomorrow I have
173:41 - nothing else to say this has been coding
173:44 - train with me your host dan and
173:50 - looking forward to tomorrow 11:00 11:00
173:52 - 11:30 12:00 something like that boy do I
173:55 - have a lot of stuff to do so I will see
173:56 - you tomorrow thank you for watching Oh
173:59 - something I was saying wasn't there
174:02 - firebase warning that firebase data
174:04 - database color classification has
174:06 - reached its peak connections limit
174:08 - that's that's good at least they're
174:09 - protecting alright so thank you
174:13 - everybody
174:16 - make a video with CJ yes that would be
174:18 - fun
174:19 - CJ actually plays the guitar has a lot
174:21 - of talents really knows things about CSS
174:24 - and actual coding I like things and yeah
174:29 - I know you can see my firebase key and
174:33 - I'll see you all in the future okay oh I
174:37 - guess I'll play you out with my trailer
174:38 - oh no I saw you about the sponsorship
174:42 - yes sorry if you are a new sponsor go to
174:45 - the community tab look at the post that
174:48 - sponsors only and there's a link to a
174:50 - Google Form there to submit your youtube
174:52 - username and email address that's the
174:54 - only way for you to get a slack invite I
174:57 - don't have any automatic way to transfer
174:59 - your YouTube sponsorship to slack other
175:02 - than a manual process that's what I was
175:03 - saying okay good bye everybody
175:05 - I don't have a discord I'm using slack I
175:07 - don't know maybe I should use discord
175:10 - instead we have this discussion in the
175:11 - Select channel like once every few weeks
175:13 - but the I don't have the time or energy
175:15 - necessarily to do it all right and oh
175:22 - okay goodbye this is the trailer and are
175:25 - the the outro and good
175:30 - [Music]
175:34 - to make creation
176:18 - [Music]
176:25 - [Music]
176:28 - you

Cleaned transcript:

no yes if you see me in my life okay so that confirms that today's livestream has begun I haven't who ukulele apparently needs to be tuned you know one of the reasons one thing that I really want to do is that I would like to make a like guitar tuner string tuner violin tune or ukulele tuner application I can't do I can't my break and I concentrate on more than one thing at a time all right I'm not gonna sing or use the ukulele right now too much longer I just wanted to see how that goes I'm here so welcome everybody today is a Tuesday it is I don't know if it's definitely the summer time yet it's June I have listened to you all many of whom have said I'm a little tired of the machine learning tensorflow jazz stuff and I am this is not the end of the tension float is machine learning stuff but I'm gonna take a break from that today I will be back tomorrow and I'm going to tomorrow work on building an actual classifier with some actual data that's the next step that I'm gonna do in my machine learning tutorial series and I'm gonna at the end of this livestream talk about the data set that I think will will work well for this idea that I have so I'll be here for a couple hours and sometime about a half an hour before it's time to go I'm gonna start trying to build a little web page where people where I'm in a crowd source this dataset about color that I want to talk about all right so I hadn't erase this in a moment so what am I going to do today so it's been a little while since I just did some frivolous algorithmic coding challenges and so that's the plan for today to catch up on some of those so let me head on over to rainbow topics I'm going to go I like what one thing that I do is I if it's something that I'm kind of thinking about doing it soon ish I assign it to myself so I'm gonna go here and these are the ones of Simon loyal coding trained viewers Simon Tiger has suggested quite a few excellent suggestions I just have not gotten to recently so barn Tilly's fern is one and the other one Oh sand piles is enough so these are the two that I would like to do obviously this morning but it's really not the morning these are the two that I would like to do today I kind of want to do I kind of I did I kind of want to do this this fourdimensional hypercube tesseract thing because maybe if I could simulate this in processing I might suddenly be able to take over the universe that's what I hear happens when you get one of these but do some research I mean the one I'm looking at this and I can see I mean there's there's really like eight cubes here but in a way there's I see very clearly if I could freeze this at this moment like now there's kind of like an inner cube and an outer cube and the vertices of the inner cube are kind of moving and then expanding and then growing and then peeling back so I feel like just to I really what I really need are eight one two three four five six seven eight sixteen points and I just need those points to follow there's these consistent paths and then I need to connect them and that will visualize this all right I don't know I'm afraid to try this right now so I'm not going to I am however going so I'm going to start today with sand piles let me think is there any housekeeping that I need to do ah I have a very important question for you the viewer watching right now is my mic is the is my voice speaking is the microphone is the sound quality good on the most recent coding challenge that I uploaded or I saw okay let's do X or again but like the different way no no more X or solving X or coding John's but in that tensorflow jazz X or coding challenge that I uploaded the other day might I think I had the microphone turned up too high there was a lot of when I listened back to it was the my voice was peaking and kind of getting staticky so I want to hear that this sounds okay today sounds great all sides it sounds good it is like two sliding rostral rights it is like two sliding cubes one larger I think I probably should take some time to go over the calendar with everybody um so one thing that I'm trying to do is that if I go to the channel you'll see that this is live now 367 people watching and then upcoming live streams this is tomorrow I might push this back to 1130 but I'm trying to get get started by 11 this is tomorrow's livestream so I'm trying to as I know when a livestream is coming up add them and then though you'll find them here and you can set a reminder like if I click this the reminders on what am I logged in as I'm logged as myself and you can if you I can't subscribe to myself but you can get all you can you do you know YouTube will give you all sorts of notifications if you want but you know we need to live in a world with fewer notifications probably so I don't want to add to the noise if it helps you great but you can also don't bother go bother with all this now oh yeah I should also mention I'm being told I look like Santa Claus which I don't think anyone has ever said to me in my entire life but I don't know would Wilderness Dan play the ukulele comes on the coding dream wilderness tan wilderness man really needs to get a haircut oh boy I really by the way the first time I ever played this instrument was two weeks ago so coming a little slack I was at a place called Guitar Center uh Lana Kavanaugh and Brooklyn and I was looking at electronic drum kits for my son who is about to turn ten and he played the drums getting him a new drum kit as a birthday present and I saw this ukulele on sale for $35 buy that cuz and I you know learned a few chords I can also play like it's really out of tune though yeah why is it kidding this is I guess it's what happened to get a cheap on I don't think I get copyright notices if I tuning is hard I got a high practice this is terrible okay we're gonna we're gonna compose a sand pile song soon enough have I let's see have I have I gotten fewer people what let's see how many people left trying to drive people away my ukulele playing oh no no other people are coming and joining alright okay so what was I saying I was saying something before I spent oh the ukulele Guitar Center wilderness Dan who knows okay so Wow the other thing that's kind of is completely insane to me is I seem to be getting remarkably close to 500,000 subscribers really what's wrong with all of your bball there are plenty of legitimate places with professional thoughtful and like knowledgeable instruction I don't know what you're getting here but I feel like I should do something to celebrate the 500,000 subscribers for subscribers if it comes to pass I mean I don't know what that would be alright so alright create a tuning tool for the ukulele oh that's coming I'm going to do that that's why one of the reasons why I have it up here I'm going to do a ukulele tuning coding challenge and I'm going to be using machine learning to recognize the pitch that's coming soon should just do it today but I'm not going to do it today I thought there was like some housekeeping oh it's talking about schedule that's what it was okay so this is the next livestream tomorrow I am hoping there's going to be a live stream on Monday June 18th and then there will hope there will possibly be one more live stream the last week of June and then I will be gone for two weeks so just to put in your mental calendar of your life I will not be or I'm going away on a little vacation for two weeks I think June 28th July 12th so there will be no coding trade live streams during that time when I come back in July I hope to have four live streams for the last couple weeks of July and then it will also be away again for a couple weeks in August but my goal here in terms of having these sponsors and the patreon is to have four live streams per month and that would be eight with two so over two months eight and so keep me honest let's see if I can keep that up you could always unsubscribe and do whatever you want but that's what I'm trying all right people are asking all sorts of questions I'm going to the wilderness I'm getting prepared to go to the wilderness if I ever will okay sand miles is the coding challenge I'm going to see if I can figure out the algorithm and I'm gonna tape it on the computer with my hand and then it might make some pretty colors you'll love your own version and we'll leave and go to the wilderness where there won't be any computers just something I think flying overhead that might look like a chat yeah so head of tune all right hmm I've really got to work on that all right so what's happening now let's do that how much time have I wasted is it feel like it's been a while so they're just wasted time live streaming doing absolutely nothing but amusing myself and I I like that there's actually in the chat part is requesting interactive emne Spencer up oh boy oh boy I don't think I better do that today all right so let's move over here to where this camera has shut off let us clean the whiteboard oh you know I should mention that where I learned to play the ukulele is I think it's christina ukulele youtube i learned by watching YouTube no no no shoot I'm gonna find the channel that I was watching ukelele lava song tutorial because she has a lot yeah Cynthia I don't know why I thought christina so this is like this 1.2 million views see come on everybody hold on let's look I mean seriously like 1.2 million views to download okay okay okay fine I actually did pay some money I think when I downloaded it the first time so I got to get an email whose oh boy oh boy oh download download download all right all right everybody 1.2 million views actually the thing is she's talented and can sing all right Thank You Cynthia Lynn for turning the coding trade into the coding ukulele the ukulele train all aboard the ukulele train oh it's still attitude a long long time ago there was a volcano we got changes in the sand pile song there was a two dimensional array of zeros in it but in the middle it had one really large number it passed its notes and to the neighbors and the neighbors pass their sin to their neighbors and the neighbors nice their sin to their neighbors and to pick some color pick some colors to color it that's and biles boom pretty graphics for you make your own version of it with prettier colors because I don't color design okay I really like that song actually 23 chords the ukulele is not that mean you can get it you can get a lot done with three chords and if I had some talent it would be even better I did play the violin for 12 years Thank You Cynthia Lyn not an official sponsor of the cotan train but I'm gonna add her to my friend channels alright I have wasted enough time it is time we were going to write we were going to erase the whiteboard I'm being told to say hello to Peter Oh Kedar our computer studies teacher I that name we've had emails you're in Canada somewhere correct hello you're watching like in class this is very bad idea go back to class go back to class don't watch this people are saying I'm gonna get a copyright strike you know I'm happy to give my money to whoever compose that wonderful song by the way I might actually go get a haircut tonight so this might be the end it's summer what would happen if I just came in and had a completely shaved beard which but freaked people out cuz I mean I can I only had a beard since like not even ten years it's kind of a thing you do good to your forties and you just give up imadori syllabus that's kind of I kind of stole that joke from John Hodgman I don't know what his wording was but I'm reading John hodgman's book that I have now buzz marketing Vacationland quite entertaining I would like to read more I would like to go to the theater more saw Angels in America part one Sunday fan amazing spiderman looks fantastic I saw the original in the in the 90s it's really interesting I don't really remember it I saw somebody in the chat requesting the return of the timer I don't think this makes sense to have the timer well come up with something with the timer at some point okay whoo good exercise I started physical therapy for my back feeling much better learned a lot of different exercises I hope credibly weak do apparently have to muscle over here that you where you can't see really working on those I've been you know I've been running for years and years and years but I don't do a lot of strength training I think I let certain muscles basically stop working and then I had that injury last summer charlie didn't help so we'll see all right hmm apparently we just reached issue 1000 on the rainbow topics github coding challenge so I should do you know I should do whatever is coding chat whatever is issue number 500 I should do that one for the 500 thousand subscribers and then I'll do this one when I reach 1 million I can do this make an AI that solves the 15 tile sliding puzzle I guess you were also to program the puzzle to begin with now think about this what people are really completing the chat about not getting around to anything I buy with recent life streams I was coding within the first 10 minutes when I first started doing live streams it usually would take me at least 45 minutes to an hour to get started with anything it's only been a half an hour all right let's get let's get started I'm gonna do this in processing and I need to pull up some references here so I have where is Simon's sand piles great here we go this is the issue I also want to reference the number files video let's let's put this somewhere in towards the end is where we get two nice pretty pictures with a much better color scheme the color scheme that I should maybe try to emulate okay so I think this is good um and I think I'm ready yes topher in the slack channel set rights complaints must be coming from the YouTube jet yes that is correct [Laughter] Oh greasy whoops sponsor is in is in the high so we got to make Alka we got to make the icons for people sponsoring and emojis and various things like that I forgot about that I've been waiting like a year for you to Voronoi diagrams mmhmm yeah that's uh that would be nice I should do that all right little love lucy' I like to be all right how's this marker I'm just gonna write over here where you can't see the sea if markers okay yep all right great hamstring stretch everybody let's do a hamstring stretch together okay and over feel this hamstring stretch see this channel it's like exercise ukulele and some time sort of coding poorly all right hold on I'd rather I wanna do this in processing so let me get processing open all right oh hello it's time for a coding challenge in processing which is a Java based thing you can find more about it at processing dot org I am going to attempt to create something that looks like this otherwise known as a sand pile so first thank you very much to coding trained viewer Simon Tiger who suggested this on January 26 there is a nice little discussion here a link to the numberphile video that I just watched earlier this morning now here's the thing I highly encourage you if you want to pause right now and go and watch the sand piles I can want to say sand file because it's numberphile and sand pile but anyway you don't watch that video right now to find out more about the mathematics of sand piles I'm gonna kind of skip all that and go cut right to the chase and just look at the basic idea and then what happens when we take that idea and turn it into color in a processing sketch so let me come over here and talk to you about the basic idea so first of all this video is going to the code that I'm going to write I think I've written it yet so it's going to look a lot like the game of life or maybe even like a blur image processing blur algorithm because what I'm going to do with this sand pile algorithm is look at a 2dimensional space divided into cells and the core sort of the core building block here that I need to look at just in the simplest way is a 3x3 grid so ultimately I'm going to take this algorithm and apply it to a processing sketch that might be something like 600 by 600 pixels and I'm gonna let this sand piles thing happen all throughout this window and color it but what is what actually needs to happen I can reduce and describe to you in terms of just this 3x3 grid ok so why is it called sand pile well the idea is that if I have this grid here I might dribble sand on it and I'm like sort of have a few pieces of sand like there might be two pieces of sand here and three pieces of sand here and a the air one there none there none there three there five there and one there right so this idea is that each cell has a certain amount of sand in it but there is a limit there is a limit and in some sense this is kind of arbitrary but it works out nicely with this number the limit is 4 meaning it can't actually literally is 3 the maximum amount of sand that in one of these cells can have in it is 3 pieces so this begs the question what happens if I dribble a lot and put say 100 pieces of sand in that spot right there well let's look at it this way let's say this is the initial starting point of this sand pile there are four pieces of sand right here and no pieces of sand anywhere else what happens is this becomes this cell which has four pieces of sand loses all of its and at tuples and the sand falls onto its neighbors one piece in each direction just the neighbors to the right to left the top to bottom now I'm sure is after you watch this video you look at my code and maybe you implemented yourself well what happens if you change that number the max to three what happens if you let the stay and fall in different ways all sorts of possibilities but I'm going to follow the core sandpile algorithm the one described in the numberphile video okay so now it looks like this zero one zero zero zero zero oh no no sorry one zero one zero one zero so all four pieces left the center spot they went up to the right now I could have a more complex scenario for example I could have two three zero zero four two three zero zero if this is the case what happens here is the same sort of thing in that this this remains a two this now becomes a four this remains a zero this now becomes a 1 this becomes a zero this three this stays a three this becomes a one and this stays a zero now I have this and so on and so forth all of a sudden now this topples so this goes out and this becomes a 1 and this becomes a 3 and this becomes a 1 and this becomes a 0 and this other piece of sand just sort of leaves the universe here now it's interesting we think of this as an infinite space or if we think of it maybe as it a torus weren't like wraps around to the other side there's all sorts of kind of weird possibilities we could try but ultimately the core idea is that any cell that has more than 3 pieces of sand loses 4 pieces those go out to the neighbors so for example with this 100 what hat would happen here is this would become 96 and we would add one to each of the neighbors then the next generation this would become 92 so I'm talk about generations because I'm going to on one hand we could just look at the end result but I'm gonna watch it as an animation ok that's an explanation I am now going to go and write the code I took way too long the explaining that I wanted it to be much shorter but such is life ok pause for a second did I get anything terribly wrong there oh it looks like I got a super chat from John Doe in some sort of currency that I don't not familiar with thank you very much I would encourage you to instead of a super chat click the sponsor button with the sponsor button I will invite you to the flacc channel I'll mail you some stickers and you get fancy emojis and all that sort of thing but so of course super chats are very nice ok any any any any nobody's correcting me is Simon watching Simon are you watching Danish kroner oh that's what it was ok of course thank you alright so I'm going to now come back and write some code stirred up fossils our strokes offals the things you know no that's a Dutch just different than Denmark we Americans please somebody come and help us we're so close we need to be part of the world we should all be learning different languages and exposed to different cultures okay is my favorite dessert cookies and some kind of other stuff and actually have it in whole foods but I don't think it's very authentic all right all right I not seeing anyone anyone complaining so here we go all right so let's see do we think we could get some sort of result like this I don't know maybe let's try so I'm going to close the browser I've got processing open here all I need is a setup function and a draw function and then I need I need a to do I wouldn't use a twodimensional array to describe the grid of sand piles I mean the thing is this is I'm kind of mixing my oh I got a sponsor pause welcome Tristan outer Pole thank you so much for the sponsorship I will try not to stop in the middle of my coding challenges brick come on it's exciting I didn't have my I can you know the lights the things the cameras a confetti I want to have like a little thing that like shoots confetti with hearts I just want to have that anyway forget about the sponsorship stuff a twodimensional array let me use a twodimensional array to describe these sand piles that are part of this processing window that I'm gonna draw into so I'm gonna call that sand piles then I'm gonna create I'm gonna just start with like a 200 by 200 window that'll sort of be simple and I'm gonna you'll be interesting to think about the resolution or like sort of the size of each cell on this grid but I'm just gonna have each cell be one pixel it's an easy way for me to work and then so I need to say sand piles is a new array with with new twodimensional array with width and height spaces in it okay now then what I need to do is in draw let's write a function to render and to render I'm gonna say load pixels update pixels and I am going to loop through every single spot every single pile of sand every X and every Y and I am going to say now so what do I need to do all right let's jump so how much how much how many how much sand is there I'm going to say int num and piles index X index Y then according to that I need to set a pixel now the pixels aren't in the twodimensional array they're in a onedimensional array I have feel like I'm Sisyphus who just goes up the hill to mention about this formula from a onedimensional rate it to dementia retro onedimensional right I've done this countless times but X plus y times width that's going to give me the unique integer index of the pixel associated with the XY coordinate then I just need to give that some sort of color and so let's call that Co L now I want the color to be according to the number of the color to be according to how much sand there is so we can see here in the numberphile video zero grains one grain two Grange three grains these are nice colors I'm going to be very arbitrary about this right now and I'm gonna say color color equals white and then of course you're going to all want to tell me about how I should use a switch statement but I'm just gonna say if there are zero grains of sand it should be black if there's one grain of sand it should be pink and if they're two it'll be some other color and if there are three and if someone in the slack group wants to give me a color scheme I will take it there it will be this color so let's I don't know let's do this and then let's do this there we go okay so now and then if in draw I call render what we should see right now is whoops let's save this yeah that's good idea let's call this sand piles if I run this we should see a black window right because the these sand piles were initialized with all zeroes and I'm getting some color suggestions from the chat I will come back and and use those in a little bit okay now if I were to say sand piles let's but so what the way that image was generated in the numberphile video not to spoiler alert we tell you what happens at the end of the numberphile video is that just a lot of sand is dropped in the middle so what happens we just drop a huge amount of sand in the middle and watch it topple topple topple topple rippling out so let's do that and so I'm gonna say I'm gonna just have the middle be with the sort of spot that's width divided by two height divided by two and I'm gonna put right now I'm just going to put four four pieces of grains of sand there so let's run this again and hopes let's run this again and we should see there it is now I have a white dot in the center there because there are four grains of sand pause for a sec let me save this color scheme Oh colors Co app I see okay yeah ad piles with clicks that's a good idea okay alright yeah I missed why can't I have by the way I have another computer I checked this computer out from downstairs I borrowed it because it has all the keys on the keyboard work but then I like was I didn't want to be 50 even later than I was I have some problems with some keys on the keyboard here let me let me just do a save as this will get great okay okay so the next thing we need to do is figure out the topple algorithm topple what happens when the sand pile topples well if it's greater than 4 pass out top pass one grain of sand top left right bottom and then subtract 4 so the first thing I need to do is probably create a so if this is my current sand pile what I want to do is create kind of like the next pile and the next pile is going to start with all zeros in it and then if a cell doesn't have 4 like if if the cell has less than 4 then it can have that same number in the next pile and then so I could go and copy over everything that's less than 4 and then after that I could topple things so I could probably do this in one pass but I think doing it in two passes will work that's the way I'm thinking about it right now nor if you're following me but you might follow me when I'm writing the code so let's let's come back and do that now so what I'm going to do is I'm going to write a function called topple and I'm going to say int next piles is also a just a blank array and then I am going to do this same for loop to look at every single spot I'm do this twice I'm not sure if this is necessary but it's a way that I'm thinking about it right now I'm gonna say okay int num I need this again how many are in that spot and if num is less than four then next piles X Y is just equal to a sand piles X Y so this is me copying over every single pile of sand that doesn't need to be toppled then what I'll do afterwards is I'll do this exact same loop again but if the number is greater than or equal to four greater than or equal to four then next piles will equal what it currently was minus four so subtract those four and then all of the neighbors X plus one X plus one X minus 1 y plus 1 and y 1 will each increase by one so I need to additively because there could be multiple piles with more than four on different size they didn't be able to add everything together so I think if I just take the current amount of sand subtract 4 and then send that each each of those four grains of sand out to each of the four neighbors this should be good and then at the end these sand piles is now next piles so let's take a look at this what do I see now oh I have to call that function so I want to render in draw and a render then topple and let's actually set the frame rate to one because maybe I can see it look at that so look at that I toppled that Center cell right it was white the first frame and then it now it has each one of those neighbors just has one pile of sand one grain of sand and that should be if I look at the render function one greatest fan is pink okay I think we're done we're actually kind of done I have to deal with the edge cases and lots of other stuff but let's actually down now we could just do something goofy we're gonna be like I don't know let's just add 400 things of sand oh now I'm still at one frame per second so looking at this we can kind of watch what it's doing the sand is toppling in each of the cells of coloring now it probably would be good for me to have created a version of this that was kind of zoomed in so you can see it's zooming in using like a software zoom so it's sort of blurring each one of these pixels but I might as well just kind of go for it take out this frame rate one and just watch it go so now we can see this is what's happening now all of that sand and it finished so it toppled in got done so we need more sand how much sand can I put in how about that much there we go oh let's get a better color scheme so I was I was given a color scheme pause for a second I'm being told it looks wrong it's not symmetrical Oh welcome to sponsor Jay's shown thank you for the new sponsorship if you would check if your neighbors are not then three you could use one pass hold on I'm getting so many different color schemes I don't know which one to pick and I'm also concerned that maybe there is a an error I don't know I look symmetrical to me this looks right I think it's just we're seeing it play out in a kind of asymmetric way yeah this is what I was trying to figure out the order in which you iterate matters if you have three four three both the first and the last three will update to four but the last three will update as well right that's why I was thinking I needed to do two passes because it should have fourfold symmetry oh the toppling is based on the current highest amount of stand instead of going over it like a scanner pixel of fried greens are giving out for your toppling at three grains and two grains as well which isn't what you want no all right so what have I done wrong I'm thinking about this you need two arrays topple one copy to display and render yeah that I have two arrays I like how this looks I think it so one thing that I want to check here is let me just call topple like a lot of times I can't I think it's symmetrical but just right it's got the fourfold symmetry that it finished when efficient last time it ended up with some white it's not completely symmetrical yeah but give an infinite time would it be are you checking the new array or the old one hmm all right let's look at my topple algorithm again may get an uneven resolution oh that's interesting oh yeah the amount of CO the amount of sand is not perfectly divided divisible by four interesting let's look at let's let it finish so that's it finishing try toppling from the highest point of sand then reading out from there so in other words you know that shouldn't matter I agree so I have a feeling it's the order that I'm doing things in but I don't see how that couldn't matter because I am never touching and changing the values in the original I'm just copying over so I'm never checking the next pile I don't see how this this seems to me this looks like it's completely order agnostic right there's no way that I am it is because you're removing 4 and adding one in the same grit pass I agree that that would be a problem except it's not like I'm checking next piles I'm still looking at so I think it's ok to like funnel them out oh oh wait a sec wait a sec if I remove four I could overwrite I could overwrite another one hmm all right okay okay I figured out the problem I figured out the problem I figure out the problem I have to think about how to correct it I mean I say this this line of code right here could overwrite some sand grains that have already been added into next piles right there could be sand grains added into next piles that are selling in and get overwritten so this should actually be plus equals right the amount of sand from before minus 4 right I shouldn't be setting it I should just be adding the amount of sand from before minus 4 I think that may not be the right fix that's not the right fix oh yeah right I think I fixed I think I figured it out right all right I'm gonna have to discuss let me go back and you guys can tell me if that was right where am i hero and let this run for a little while none for thank you John Doe I will I will do it that way okay so I let this run for a little bit and Wow I have to admit I picked some like kind of horrendous colors and it is doing something kind of beautiful and interesting and weird it's not correct and the chat pointed out to me that this should have fourfold symmetry right there's no reason why and it it had this like nice symmetric quality to it but it's not the right kind of symmetry let it run a little longer so maybe you can see it I'm also gonna cycle the camera while doing that alright so what is the problem and it did take me a little bit of time to think about this and so the problem is I believe is here this is a very dangerous thing that I'm doing the point of next Pyles is i opes the point of next Pyles is that I always want next piles to accumulate the sand from previous that's why I'm copying over things that are less than four and then adding up things that went in there toppled and also need to subtract the four from the thing that was toppled but I'm not just subtracting the four I'm overwriting anything that was there before so it could be that two cells with more than four are near next to each other and so one gets one from the other and but then I just but I don't but I then then as soon as I get to the next cell I don't take that in consideration more so this should actually be adding and this by the way just can be the current amount which is none so I need to add na minus four so whatever it was before I want to put in that pile all of the sand except for the four that are going out to the neighbors and I believe that if I run this we should see it be much more symmetrical and you can see that already okay so the next thing that I'm gonna do I'm gonna do two more things so there's so much you could do with this I'm not gonna do I'm gonna let you do it I'm at least gonna pick different colors and I'm going to speed up the animation to see to be able to get to the end result a little bit more quickly yes and the chat is telling me the parenthesis do nothing I just put them there for my own personal sanity okay now let me find some colors I got so many color suggestions alright okay Alka whoops in the slack group invitation might be a sponsor to get an invitation has some rainbow colors for me let me say that again alright Alka in the patron sponsor group in slack has some rainbow color suggestions for me so let's put those in where are they color this first color is to 5500 the next color is to 5500 the next color is 01 8563 the next color is zero 104 255 and the last color is 120 to 0 229 I probably could use HSB color or tap the colors change over time there's so many things I could do but I'm just gonna just show you that the colors that you picked make a difference here so here we go there's our nice rainbow colors now what I want to do is I want to see the end result a bit more quickly well I mean one thing that I could do is just sit here and wait and I could if you're watching the recorded version of this I'll speed up the video to get to the end but just for this the sake of showing you how I could see it more quickly is I am going to all I need to do is call topple multiple times each time through draw so I'm going to write an extra loop in here like if I just say call topple ten times and run it we can see here that you can see it looks as if it's going faster it's not actually going faster just animating faster well it's doing ten sorry doing ten updates per frame of animation let's do a thousand there we go and I'm not so sure about these colors and then let's and of course we got an array out of bounds exception so let's fix that so we need to figure out so we need to say like as long as X plus one is less than with and as long as X minus one is greater than is greater than negative one I guess I could say greater than equal to zero and then this one I want to say if y plus y plus 1 is less than height and this one and by the way I'm not using any I never do this but and I probably should just put the curly brackets in there but if you only ever have one line of code that comes after an if statement the curly brackets can be assumed for just that one line and then I'm going to say if Y y 1 is greater than or equal to 0 so this will at least now fix the edge problem let's let it go as far as it can go Oh crazy wait first of all the chat is done I got the wrong colors second is 255 255 0 oh yeah so had the wrong colors oh there we go that's nicer Oh much prettier dude oh the bit rates gonna be a disaster on these YouTube videos this is quite lovely so the next thing I want to do is just finish this off by saying like 800 by 800 and run it oh so slow probably some kind of magical shader thing could make it happen faster let's at least I wanted to animate a little faster so let's let's topple it only a hundred times per frame and I'm gonna just work on my email and some other stuff for a little bit and then I'll be back with this gets a little further along I'm gonna let this run Mattia does will do his fun thing where this speeds up well sorry my email how's this going everybody how long have I been honest are some questions there while we're waiting how long have I been coding for about an hour now looks longer than playing the ukulele I started coding I mean I did code as a child but I would say I really started coding in 2001 rainbows and piles art asks any new tensorflow jazz videos I will do a color a classification tutorial shouldn't the canvas be one pixel bigger or does it not matter a pixel there a pixel mare's now I want to get this let's see how far we can get this I can't dynamically stop it but I guess I could take a screenshot I can to miss at least boy this is really takes a long time all right think that's gonna have to be good enough all right it's taking a really long time to render so I think that's good enough for this coding challenge there you go sand piles in processing I cannot wait to see what people make to this this user you could we could start to do stuff where you drop the sand you could pick your own color schemes you could have the colors change over time you could render something out to a giant poster and print it I don't know there's so many possibilities if you watch the numberphile video probably get more ideas thank you for watching this coding challenge and see you in a future one on something else bye alright do you play the uke in non virtual classes as well no I'm never play I do not play the ukulele in my regular glasses I don't know if it's special treatment it's kind of the opposite of that if you ask me all right next up we're going to do that Barnsley fern thing which to be honest I don't know how to do it all how bad could it be I think I need to do some like matrix transformation I wonder how long that's gonna end up being hopefully it's not more than a half an hour still going still going could you use them now I know it's like I kind of want to like add things to it but I just don't want to I don't want to stop it oh wait I've lost the slack group yeah I probably shouldn't have done this on a per pixel basis but that's just what I did play these chords on the ukulele ce7 a minor a seven D minor oh that's already good that's already went too far off in the chat for me to do that right there's probably ways they can make this much faster yeah I like how this was looking now all right now let's let me let me look at the barn while this is running a little bit longer it looks like this it probably should have used the same colors oh I should have now I feel sad that I didn't come here and like a compare but that's fine but that's okay yeah I'm planning to use the there's a there's a machine learning model for the pit for the ukulele tuner there's a machine learning model called CREP or clip here it is this a neural network with a perfect pitch so it's going to use this clip a model to get the pitch of a sound and actually you could probably do this already without even me because it is an example and again this has not been sort of officially released yet but if I go here under reference and under oh maybe it's not in here yet so I think we don't have a reference page for CREP yeah oh pitch detection there you go pitch detection this is what I was this is what I'm planning to use well spoiler alert alright but um we'll come back to this oh boy this is this is gonna be released I mean it's released it's there you can use it but we're still working on it making some changes Friday is the goal to have this out and I need to go work on that library I gotta go I'm gonna do Barnsley fern first alright bar okay so first I want to go back to Simon's Barnsley fern github issue let's close this let's go to here and this should be the result that we're gonna get should look something like that and all right Oh affine transformation this isn't so bad though right isn't this just matrix math so I start with a point okay the first point is drawn at the origin 0 0 and then new points are it early computed by randomly applying one of the following for coordinate transformations oh yeah I don't even know yeah great and then I probably need to do some mapping of negative 1 to 1 right I probably need to do some mapping to like to have the pixel window have 0 0 in the center negative 1 to 1 negative 1 to 1 and then just apply one of these for transformations and then do the next point right all right how hard is this gonna be can it separate notes I don't believe it can do the correct model I don't believe can do that all right so what's the let's affine transformation X equals MX plus B yeah I'm just looking at this right it's like the dot product thingy yeah this multiplied by this this multiplied by this plus all right yep okay okay right x equals 0.85 plus 0.04 and then y equals point negative 0.04 0.85 plus 1.6 there we go okay all right this actually is not going to be very hard Oh famous last words all right how we doing there look at this leave this beauty here you go Matt yeah let's make a nice thumbnail for you although I should have this be the we're gonna make a thumbnail for a match yet sand piles here we're going to zoom in put this lower zoom in zoom in zoom in I wanted to say sand piles there I guess we don't need to say same piles there we'll just let's get this kind of like there we go well let's get this mouse out of the way okay okay Oh something something will come up there all right I'm gonna have to turn this off now I want to let it keep running but I'm gonna have to turn it off okay I just turn it off I did that okay now save save as a desktop what we calling this Barnsley let's go to the Barnsley fern whoops and named by British mathematician Michael Barnsley okay Barnsley fern and then okay all right here we go I'm gonna try later today if anyone wants to do it for me I've tried later today to render like a super high res can I could use you could use create graphics and just render to a pixel buffer super highres or you could actually I you could do it if you're if we're doing it if we use the rectangle function to actually draw them as rectangles and use the PDF renderer that might be an interesting to try too so if anybody wants to make these some like super highres sand piles with that code that I could use for sharing on social media and publishing with the video that might be helpful alright I could use tensors what not using yes for this because first of all I'm doing this in processing alright hello to another coding challenge in this coding challenge I am going to attempt to make the Barnsley fern that a beautiful plant to me we can make a rainbow Barnsley fern I don't know so fergal why is it called Barnsley fern named for the British bath edition Michael Barnsley who first described this in his book fractals everywhere so I encourage you to check out the Wikipedia page which could give you more background about where this algorithm comes from thanks once again to coding trained viewers Simon Tiger who suggested this one and let's try to implement it so here's the thing let me actually just describe to you briefly what's gonna happen so in order to do this one I think I actually have not coded this before we'll see if what not my way of thinking about it is right is if we look at the Wikipedia page let's actually go back to look at the Wikipedia page it's gonna tell us a little bit it's going to say somewhere here the first point is drawn at the origin x equals 0 y equals 0 so basically the way that this works is I'm going to draw a point at 0 0 so I'm going to consider 0 0 to be in the middle so I'm gonna have to do some type of transformation mapping of the pixel canvas which usually has zeros there on the top left maybe it's 600 by 600 and have 0 0 P in the center and what it says here is it's basically I need to pick one of these for affine transformations now this when you look at this you think to yourself wait I'm gonna go to something else like matrices and curly brackets and f of X but this is actually really much simpler than you think and this is known as an a transformation or affine transformation here where what I want to do is I want to say if X 0 is that 0 and y 0 is at 0 what I need to do is I want to say X 1 is some function of X 0 y 0 and maybe some constant ax 0 plus B times y 0 plus C basically and then X Bug sorry and then y1 is a some other number but like a Y zero time out let me go back and say this again so is it going to be confusing if I use the same it's different a B's and C's so I'm gonna do de and F yeah okay and then y1 is maybe D times x0 plus e times y 0 plus F and then I'm gonna do the same thing x2 y2 is some numbers plus x1 plus y plus some number plus y1 plus some other constant so what are the values of a b c d e and f well those are the values that are here so x1 is actually 0 times x plus 0 times y this this one does nothing it just turns it into 0 but you can see here this would be a better one X so we can write this out x2 let me get me start this whole video over because I don't want to get to this to hook this whole thing over it's not element wise it's the dot products to definitely the dot product yes did I get it wrong right isn't it right X and plus 1 is 0.85 times X plus point zero four times y plus 0 yeah I have it right okay oh I'm not in there I'm in the wrong screen sorry let's start over I wanna let me just let's start this whole thing over I don't let my replaced confusing notation with more confusing notation I think if I actually I'm just going to use that actual example and I'm going to go check it okay all right starting over again cycling cameras all right hello welcome to another coding challenge well I'm excited about this one in this coding challenge I'm going to attempt to make this fern the Barnsley firm named for the British mathematician Michael Barnsley I encourage you to read this Wikipedia page which will give you more background on it I'm what I'm gonna do is just look at the algorithm and try to write that algorithm into code and see if we can get that result and then you the creative viewer of this coding challenge will make your own version with different colors and you'll think about animating it and do all sorts of things that I couldn't possibly even imagine so first what is the algorithm here so if we look down here I'm just gonna skip down down here it says the first point is drawn at the origin x equals 0 y equals 0 so what this means is where you need some sort of twodimensional space it could be a processing canvas and I want to start at 0 0 now I'm gonna think of 0 0 in the center here and I'm gonna have to probably figure out some ways of tray of well if the pixels are here or than 0 0 in the pixel space is here but I'm not gonna worry about that right now and then what's the next step the next step is and then the new points are iteratively computed by randomly applying one of the four following coordinate transformations and here they are to find out this is the kind of stuff that you might see and think this looks like matrix math with linear algebra but but this is actually first of all if you watched all my matrix videos this is gonna change leg enough to make sense to you but let me actually show you that this math is actually quite simple let's use just on this second one and let's rewrite this over on the board yeah so f of 2 X comma y equals so I'm have to go back and check it point 85 0.04 0.85 0.04 negative 0.04 negative 0.04 I should have made up my own numbers 0.85 0.85 then we have X why Oh No I'm running out of space you can see that zero and one point six what does this mean well this is actually the matrix product or the dot matrix multiplication of the dot product what it means is I want this I want to find the values if this is x1 y1 what I want to get is the next values for X so I have one point and I want to know where does that point go what's x2 y2 so this being x2 equals this number times that 0.85 sorry times x1 plus this number times that the row gets multiplied by the column 0.04 times y1 and then Plus this number Plus 0 and then y2 then equals negative 0.04 times x1 plus 0.85 and my handwriting's terrible times y1 this column times this column plus one point six so it's really just this formula if I have an XY coordinate I get the next s XY coordinate with this math and we can just double check that this is right look at that for a second with my horrible messy handwriting and then let's go down here and see look at this it's the same thing X the next X is this number times the previous X plus this number times the previous Y and the next Y is this number times the previous X plus this number times our previous y plus one point six so we just need to do one of these four and each one of those four we do according to a particular probability right or ABCDEF that could have written it this way that's the generic way of writing it okay so all right so let's go let's go back and let's start writing some code all right so I have a processing sketch a Java based programming environment with a nice API for drawing stuff and lots more processing org I am going to say background equals zero I'm going to have an x and a y I'm going to set those to be 0 to start I'm going to draw I'm gonna say stroke 255 stroke weight stroke weight sorry stroke stroke weight 8 and then I'm gonna draw a point at X comma Y okay and then what I need to do is get the next value so act next x equals some number a times X plus B times y plus C and actually so let's just use these numbers here let's just copy these 0.85 0.04 0.85 negative 0.04 negative zero point oh four point eight five and next why is negative point oh four point eight five eight five plus one point six okay did I get that right this is a positive one all right okay I must lying all these things up know what's going on okay everything's fine now breathe everybody breathe with me okay so this is applying that particular transformation and then I could just say x equals next X y equals next Y so what if I were to do this and run this I don't get any arrows errors but I do see this like circle over here being drawn so here's the thing I'm only applying one of those transformations I need to pick one of four and I also not thinking sort of thoughtfully about the pixel space so I need to do a napping right X with pixels goes from 0 to 600 0 to 600 but maybe I want to think of this as a space between negative 1 and 1 and negative 1 and 1 so what I want to do is say when I actually go to draw it pixel x equals map X which goes between negative 1 and 1 to 0 and width and pixel Y between negative 1 and 1 and I'm gonna flip the access height comma 0 and then I'm gonna draw the point at P X py let's run this and then ah ok and I'd only to want to draw the background once and we can see there we go so if I apply that transformation over and over again we can see the point going up that way now is that right that doesn't look right to me I guess it's right I need to pick for one or four okay I guess I guess that's right cuz I'm just picking one it's really just going to go up diagonally like that this transformation I guess so second match should be why Oh what was this okay yes sorry everybody I that looked weird to me this has to be why yes this needs to be why I was like mapping the xvalue that was like why is it all right so mmm all right it's not moving very much but that's fine I'm just applying this one transformation so here's the thing oh is this an office Oh time out is this an offset no it's actually the new point yeah yeah everyone's correcting me in the chat okay I'm looking at the chat still let's look at the values just to sort of see what those values are doing and we can see there we go now it kind of settled interestingly enough it's settled to a fixed point but here's the thing we need to do one of four transformations so I need to do the tedious thing I know I could probably write the encode these in two arrays and like automatically but I'm gonna do this in a very longwinded way just to see the code I'm gonna have four of these possibilities so this is actually number two I need to have one I need to have three and I need to have four and I probably should put these in a function but oh there's so many ways I could organize the code to be better but I'm gonna just do it this way right now and I'm gonna wavy I'll refactor it later I'll let you do that so let's go back and look at the algorithm this is just zero and point one six times y so this one is actually just zero and this is actually just 0.1 0.16 times y that's option number one option number two we did option number three option number three is point 2 negative point two six point two mmm negative zero point two six and then point two three point two to one point six point two three point two to two point six was that it was one point six and then option number four is negative point one five point two eight you really watch me do this negative 1/5 and two eight that's not right yeah it is right and then two six two four four four two six two four four four let's autoformat all this okay now this is the really important part no no this plus has to go here this has to go there that's okay now this is okay that's fine that's fine okay it's fine now everything's okay everybody Oh ain't gonna know just I need a zero here it definitely need a zero there okay what's wrong oh no no these have to go over because there's no negative there oh and this has a yeah I don't like this this has to go over to yes yes okay this has to go over there we go okay that's much better now now the other thing is I'm just gonna say float next X float next Y and then I'm gonna because I just want to declare the variables once and I'm gonna get rid of all of these yes you're watching me do this in the most tedious ridiculous way possible but it's good this is good for you because you're gonna you're gonna improve your coding skills by doing it in a different way like watching me and my poor poor poor way of doing this okay so this is good now I need to now I'm gonna pick a random number and I'm just gonna say I'm gonna just do this if R is less I'm gonna I'm gonna do a 1 out of 4 chance for each of these if R is less than 0.25 do this otherwise if R is less than 0.5 do this one otherwise otherwise if R is less than 0.75 do this one and then otherwise do the last one so now I'm just doing a 1 out of 4 chance of doing any of these and pausing for a second because I'm seeing lots of shouting in the chat all right no one is okay so let's all right so let's run this and see what happens we're not gonna get the fern cuz hey but we should look at this I'm getting something it's just look at this oh it might even be like tree like so one thing I want to do is I want to pick that I want to take this which is like sort of like next point and I'm going to put that into its own function next point so that I can because I'm probably going to want to also do this and then I'm gonna take this and draw a point and then because I might want to do these multiple times in draw so I think just and I could probably do this in an objectoriented way I should probably store an array of all the points but let's just look at this so now let's let me let this go a little faster so let me say do a hundred of these transformations per frame and we can see and by the way zero zero should be at the bottom I'm now sort of figuring out so I'm going to put zero zero at the bottom so I'm gonna map this from a to two down to zero right oh well I did that no zero to two I mean zero to two there we go so here's my weird tree thing that I'm making without being thoughtful about those probabilities now let's go look at those I still think there might be a mistake here but I haven't implemented the probability so let see what happens if I implement the probabilities okay so let's look at the Wikipedia page it says then somewhere where are those probabilities these then I'm gonna the match Yemen is P the probabilities a threat for the coefficients o P represents that probability factor oh I'm such a silly goose let's go look a bit let's go look at the Wikipedia page for those probabilities and you can see they're actually right here in this table so this table is actually defining all those coefficients and here under P probability so we have a 1% chance of the first one 85 percent chance of the second 7 percent chance of the third and 7 percent chance of the fourth so I'm actually gonna put this I'm going to amazingly do this in an array well actually so so okay so there is let's think about this back here there's one percent chance of this first one so I know that should be this now I want to have a 80 85 percent chance of this second one so now I actually need to look and see is it less than point eight six because if it's point less than point zero one that's a 1% chance and between point zero one and point eight six is 85 percent then I need to do less than point 93 right because there's a 7% chance of this third one and in all other cases the fourth one so let's look at this now and are we going to get a Barnsley firm okay map range is limited yes I need all right so this is looking okay this is looking pretty good now everything's like way off the screen right cuz I wasn't for I was like oh I'll just make it between negative 1 and 1 but you might have noticed affirmative the chest I mean plus one point six so clearly the point can go further than that so let's give ourselves some more space so where are the mappings the mappings are here let's go from 0 to 4 and let's try negative 2 to 2 and let's make the stroke weight a little bit less let's give our let's give ourselves much more space ah look at that ah beauteous Ness Barnsley fern that looks about right okay so I'm done even though I want to do so much more but I'm not going to I'm going to let you do more because what can you how could you animate this how could you pick color how could you consider this space how could you connect the points how could you render this in a different way there's so many possibilities but I'm gonna leave this at this I've just done the core algorithm and we have this Barnsley fern and we you know you can by the way you can try you can see here there's variations of this why is mine kind of different than this though hold on a second mine looks different let's check our numbers oh okay so first of all i'm discovering here this is actually giving me the correct range so let's actually do this range let's go into the code and implement the range that was on the wikipedia page so negative two there and then zero two let's try this see what happens what did I get wrong here oh there we go okay so I was not mapping the proper range so it didn't curve to the right but now I am mapping the full Barnsley fern thank you very much I really want to make it rainbow color and do other stuff but we have completed it this is the Barnsley fern fractal in processing in about three hours and 42 minutes thanks for watching this entire video and I hope you make a variation of this in some way that I couldn't possibly imagine and share it with me share it in the comments there's a way you can go to the coding training calm and submit a link to your contribution and on Twitter at Schiffman or at decoding drain okay thanks and I will see you all in the next co2 challenge okay so I think I'm done for today mostly and I did these two coding challenges I'm very pleased with them do a sierpinski triangle haven't I done that before but what I want oh I forgot that I'm still live sweetie I was like I've done I'm back talking to myself we probably need a Barnsley fern song apparently but all my songs just used the same chords actually let's let's watch it more slowly let's watch it more slowly for fun it's made with processing and some code it's by me well not by because the algorithm or really be the first person write this code and lots of other people have done it I'm just doing it my own way that's kind of in a poor way without easily changed because I should probably do some rays and we affect the code and you think about doing it on oriented and Coates really terrible but it works it's pretty I have done constant Papa asking the chat I have done strange attractors it looks great with lower stroke weight yeah you know this just the thing is like I don't want to I really think it would be interesting to like you know if I could use some alpha and give it like a higher stroke weight like what would happen and I want to put this back and I could like you know I think there's lots of interesting possibilities here you know I could pick from a color palette so I encourage you to make your own make your own Barnsley fern with your own stuff alright alright mapping y coordinate to hue would look pretty that's what it that's it that's a great idea so the color and what if I did map Y to between 0 and 255 something like this right oh there we go there's our rainbow I don't know why I don't know why I didn't do this as part of the video here we can make this a screenshot here's a thumbnail for you Matt's yeah hold on let's go back to stroke wait and let's give it a little alpha and let's do it 500 times per frame and I believe the background color is incorrect it's supposed to be 51 how many of you been watching my channel long enough but that means something to you there we go okay all right now all right so what I want to do is talk about and what's gonna try to build this so here's where I'm thinking for a classification I'm going to do a machine learning tutorial about classification with tensorflow djf and I want to do this tomorrow so what I was thinking of building was and let me let me switch to make a p5 sketch real quick all right so let's actually make this maybe this will become a video give me it give me a moment here oops I'm gonna be here for a little bit longer I'm gonna work on this thing that I want to try I'm just trying to decide if I should I think I'm just going to use a Google sheet it's just gonna be so hackable if I use firebase that's not gonna be everything's gonna be hackable in the way that I do this well I'll just clean the data though hopefully the trolls will not get me so p5 G B crowd source color great and don't need the library's directory okay what would make it hackable I think if I write all the data to a oh the Google she just needs to be public I just think if I I don't know how to so that this is what I'm planning to do let me stick the sir what I'm planning to do is make a really simple web page that just shows you a random color and then has a dropdown and asks you to categorize that color and hit submit and it'll write the RGB values and your category your label to a spreadsheet so if I do this with Google sheets the easiest way to do this is to just make the Google sheet public and then just write to it from the web page but then if the Google sheet is public and my code is out there public anybody could just like write their own script to like delete everything on the page or to add like a bunch of labels that are bad words for example so I could write it to firebase and I have to put some database protections but then I need a server to like hide the keys so I think I'm gonna rely on the goodwill of the internet cuz what could possibly go wrong to try my best firebase can be write new only huh well here's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna build a kind of like hack a version with no security as part of the tutorial and then I'm going to put I'm going to make a version with some security after the fact you the coding train viewers will help me and I will and I will use that as the thing where I asked people to submit stuff make it fill in a Google Form yeah I was just going to use a Google Form for this the reason why I didn't want I didn't feel like I could could I use a Google form where it generates so so let's let's investigate this for a second so this is what I want to do so I don't know what I'm logged in as let me shoot what kind of Google accounts do I have here I don't want to log into myself oh let me I know I know go back how do I remove these isn't there like usually a button for remove because I want to port John Henry Thompson is still on here now I keep showing his email coding rainbow live alright fine I just don't I have to you don't need to host the firebase keys oh you mean I could make I can make people um yeah I don't didn't really feel like using firebase hold on let me coding rainbow live is a perfectly fine Google account for me to use I just need to figure out what my password is I got a lookin password so many Google accounts oh my goodness crazy password time looking at my password manager on the other my other computer here's what I'm doing you're wondering okay so new new Google for whoops new Google form color label er creating a data set for machine learning classification example and label this color oh I could embed the form on a page how could I get that so then I just need a like multiple choice and I'm gonna do something like blueish redish green ish orangeish purpleish yellow ish what's missing from this good enough right or like greyish okay so this is the idea so now if I were to look at this form this is what I want the issue is what I want is to show a randomly generated color here and then and then have that color also be part of the spreadsheet with this form so what would be the easiest way to do that I mean I was just gonna build my own interface and write to a Google spreadsheet directly but I'd love to just use a Google Form rainbow ish so I will wait and see if anybody has any suggestions for me yeah I was gonna do labeling them by sentiment but I think what I wanted to do I wanted to do that but I think that I think that's more of an exercise for the viewer what Eric is writing to me in the slack group I like the idea of labeling I had this idea of like Oh instead of like having them but I just kind of want to show like it's a very trivial thing that works brownish I'm missing okay I meant make the custom web page fill out the Google Form yeah or emotion right I was gonna do I yeah I was thinking that my example would ask people to then make their own version of this with different more creative labels alright I'm gonna I'm gonna go my way I'm gonna write to a Google form using tabletop j/s and I am going to so let me create a new sheet got it color data are red green blue label okay so I'm gonna write to this spreadsheet all right okay so okay I don't know if this really is going to make sense as a video tutorial but I am going to include it anyway usually what I use for API access to Google Spreadsheets is a tabletop j/s because it's pretty easy to use and I can write to it pretty easily I've done this before and I just this currently being maintained yeah April 4th that's not too long ago and yeah okay all right all right welcome to a new session of intelligence and learning tutorial compilation thing so this session is going to be a series of videos and I'm going to build a classifier so what do I mean by build a classifier hold on everybody okay now I've done this before I have some video tutorials where I did a doodle classifier and this is somewhat similar and I'm also going to redo the doodle classifier with a convolutional neural network that's coming but here what I want to start with is a very baseline of just doing classification and so sorry classification now in order for me to do a classification example the full story from training testing to deployment of a machine learning model to classify some data I need to first think about data now what I'm going to do in this series is use a trivial data set address data set that really doesn't have much of a point of view that's not particularly meaningful I just want to show you the full story of how all the pieces work together when I kind of get to the end of this series I'll talk to you a bit more of what where you might find your own data sets how you might collect your own data and sort of think about where you might take this but you know I can't emphasize enough that the data the data that you're using in the data that you're not using is the primary most fundamental piece of all of this if you you know if you just want to try out the algorithm what I'm doing is just fine but if you actually want to build something that classify studying in the real world there are a lot of questions you should ask yourself starting from the very first one should you be doing this in the first place like is what you're doing good or is it causing harm who's being left out in the data there's lots of really important critical questions you want to think about so putting that aside we'll come back to it at the end the data set that I'm going to use I'm just going to make a color dataset so and I'm gonna crowdsource this from you the viewer by the time you're watching this I might have already finished all the crowdsourcing but there'll be links in this video's description it's where you can find the various elements so I'm going to create essentially a spreadsheet it's going to have four columns red green blue and then label so each record each req data point is going to have three values like 255 0 0 and it's label is going to be something like you know red ish then I might have 0 255 0 and its label would be green ish so I'm again this is what I mean by totally trivial I am labeling colors into a certain number of buckets reddish greenish yellowish blueish purpleish orangish grayish brownish something like that and then I'm gonna have this massive data set won't be that big but a big data set and it's going to learn from this labeled data how to take a new color right there are millions of possible colors 256 to the third power and automatically label it according to what human beings generally think of those colors in those certain categories so this is what I'm going to build so this first part of the video series is just about me figuring out how to collect this data and so the way that I'm going to do it is I'm gonna make a p5 sketch that shows a random color and gives you a little dropdown menu or a multiplechoice thing to like pick which category and hit submit and it gets saved in a Google sheet and that Google sheet will be this spreadsheet that then I will then use later to load and feed into tensorflow j/s to train a model to learn to classify RGB colors according to some set of labels and from there you might start to think about more creatively well what did you actually crowdsource to labels for I'm going to sit here and I'll come back to the data so I'll come back to that this chat died everything's okay we're still going there's some code here in the in the in the chat all right now I would have mentioned that this this idea comes from some work that Hannah Davis is doing here researching at ITP around data and crowdsourcing data she is actually making a data set around landscapes and tagging those landscapes with sort of what you might expect field ocean whatever tags you might expect anyway but also thinking about could you have emotional landscapes could you have a data set of landscapes these are landscapes that sort of that that embody the concept of fear or happiness or joy so that might be something you start to think about what kind of creative labels could you apply fixed set of labels to colors there's interesting possibilities there so you might make your own creative version of this but I'm gonna start with something very trivial and exactly as sort of written out here okay so let's go back and I've got a p5 sketch here that I started with nothing in it and I want to add so the first thing I want to do is just pick a random color it's gonna be like the simplest thing ever so I'm going to and by the way April I could use a Google Form I could use something a service that that I can pay people to label data like Mechanical Turk or CrowdFlower maybe I'll try to look at some of those in another video but right here I'm gonna custom build my own thing and so I am what do I need to do I'm gonna I'm gonna pick up a random a random red value between 0 and 255 then I am going to and I want to floor it because I kind of don't want to deal with floatingpoint numbers there's not really a reason for me to do that and then I want to then I want to show it so I'm gonna say background are RGB and then I am going to what do I want to do now I'm going to say dropdown equals create select and then I can add options to the dropdown like this let's just see if this works whoops blue fish red fish green ish okay so let's just see what this looks like so now if I go to the browser and look at this sketch and we can see here I've got my dropdown and every time i refresh the page I see a new color and then I can add also submit equals create button submit and submit dot mousepressed submit you know send data and then I can write a function called send data where I am going to send this data to something okay so this is the basic idea we don't need this to be so big there we go so this is what I want each time i refresh this page I'm going to pick a label and I'm going to hit submit and it'll hopefully do suss put that data somewhere where is it going to go I want it to go to this spreadsheet so I want to see the RGB and values and the label end up in this spreadsheet then I'm gonna turn it over to you all and I'm gonna get lots of lots of lots of data that I can then use for training the model time out okay okay so where have I done this before I think I've done this in the Mad Libs example yeah oh this isn't writing to it though this is just reading from it call back got data where is that oh yeah right so that's that's reading from it super simple did I do one where I write to the spreadsheet is that in a to z whoops load CSV Google sheets yeah got data I don't think I wrote to it in any of my examples right I just had a form so my examples I didn't write to it so let me look at table tough chess is there a feature for writing to it getting started share advanced anyone with a link I don't know if you can write to it with tabletop j/s I could certainly use yeah radio buttons would be much less annoying or just three submit buttons yeah I definitely want to change the interface I'm just trying to figure out how I want to do this table top J s right to Google sheet why I love table top but don't use it in production Oh what's this sheet see is this open source free Oh glitch I should make us a glitch app let's look sheet CJ s bsd it's open source let's look at this on glitch this is amazing I should probably just use firebase I don't know why I was avoiding using firebase get I don't I don't think this is writing to the file anywhere likes just using tabletop behind the scenes yeah you know none of these are writing to the spreadsheet which I know I can do with I don't know why I can't remember what this is called but turn spreadsheet into the service but it's not free she to this I've used before it's quite good but it's not free I don't believe it's so I don't think that I want to use it for this yeah you're a five Kody challenge 45 yeah in fact I have even simpler ones let's use firebase I think it's gonna make more sense to use firebase I have a whole set of firebase tutorials so firebase where's the firebase tutorials examples how come we're not seeing it which we catch the firebase stuff week nine firebase oh here we go this is what I'm looking for this is exactly what I need okay perfect great okay yeah Google sheets has its own API I just can't bring myself to use it all right okay so let me set this up on firebase using this coding train live account grapes get started and project okay okay all right so how do I do the radio buttons in p5 anybody remember create radio yep create radio perfect okay so let me come back to here all right okay all right I really got to go but let's let's try see if I can push this a little bit further because I would like to finish this to get some data before tomorrow all right Maxie I don't know where I was so this is gonna be hard to edit but we'll do your best I think you can you can get rid of the part where I looked at the spreadsheet so maybe where I'm coming from here okay I don't remember where I was all right okay so I need to put this data somewhere I'm actually going to do that in the next part and do that in a separate part I am going to use a service called firebase which I have a whole set of tutorials about so if you want to learn a lot more about firebase I'll link to those tutorials in this video's description but I'm just gonna kind of jump right in and quickly like you know make a firebase project and send all my data there from this p5 sketch so but before I go a great great point was made in the chat that this is particularly oops where am i this is a particularly awkward interface especially if I only get to do one I probably should make this that I could like do like five colors all at once but let's say I only get to do one it's gonna be really annoying to have to use this dropdown so one thing I could do is do create radio and then I'll just rename this and in p5 this is a p5 a Dom creation function that I believe should change this to this and you know again the layout here is a little bit awkward I will think about fixing that up but now we can see here the idea here I'm gonna pick blue and hit submit I'm gonna pick reddish blueish and it's a minute okay so I just need to I don't take this function send data and send the data to firebase and that's what I'm gonna do in the next video okay so the next video I'm going to send the data to firebase I'm gonna then upload this somewhere and let those of you who are watching this live give me some data okay see you soon all right okay let me add orange purple yellow pink brown gray worst worst interface ever what can I do really briefly to to make this better radio buttons style what is it actually making the what did it actually generate for me input type radio' label label input oh it's just putting these one after another floatleft multiple buttons so just do a different button for each oh just do a different button for each one I like that multiple buttons great idea all right yeah displayblock all right we just see if that's a quick fix yes yes I know the camera went off yeah you know what I'm just gonna I'm gonna make everything a button that doesn't need to be in let's do it this way red are red green blue orange yellow pink purple gray brown gray and let's just do oops there we go okay yes and this is totally bonkers I'll fix it up the point of this is not to worry about the DOM stuff so this will be this will be better let me close a bunch of these windows that don't need to be open just dismiss this right now okay close this okay this is my reference and okay okay can you change the background color of each button to be the same as the text oh how it'd be so good wouldn't it okay I'm not gonna do that right now that's a great idea and CSS layout it's just not not part of the what I'm doing right now okay okay I'm back by the way in between the last video in this one suggestion came in in the chat to say like oh you know be easier if you just had a bunch of buttons so like I could just click whichever button yeah I think the color is so this is like ah its greenish to me I'm gonna refresh oh that's also greenish that's purplish that's bluish right so I just click the button and it submits and actually probably when I hit when I do that I can have it then pick a new color so what I need to do is now is send the send the color to firebase alright so I'm now logged in to some arbitrary Google accounts called coding rainbow live and I'm going to add a project and I'm going to call this color classification and I'm gonna accept all sorts of and agree to all sorts of things I'm gonna hit create project I'm gonna wait for it to do its thing okay continue I knew Fred is ready all right really get started ah yes add firebase to your web app perfect okay so what I need is this stuff so let me grab this and go to index.html and and by the way there are so many things that could be done to improve the interface here I should probably work on an HTML and add CSS and all that stuff that's not the focus of this video so I don't at me is what I'm supposed to say but you should at me though I'm okay with being acted at at act act at will just be nice be nice alright so I'm gonna add this stuff so I'm gonna add this script tag for firebase and I'm actually just gonna take this and I'm gonna put this in in my peace with my p5 code I'm just gonna actually just do this at the beginning of setup okay so now I'm connected to firebase I don't know let's let's see what happens hit refresh you know it's not telling me anything but should be good yeah it something's happening here okay great now I need to by the way I need this send data to go with all these buttons so I should be able to say buttons dot length and I should just be able to say buttons dot mouse press a button x' index i dot mouse pressed send data so this is the assigning this send data event to every single one of those buttons and guess what right here I'm gonna just say console.log this dot HTML so by the way so when you use the p5 mousepressed function and give it an event that event is bound to the Dom element upon which it was called and referenced in the keyword this so and then HTML is the text of the button so this should if I do this we can see whatever button I click I get the label in the console that's good so now I need to send the data to firebase so gonna tell me how to do that here okay so I could start to look at the firebase documentation but I'm gonna and you know I could go back and watch my firebase tutorials cuz I completely forgotten how to use it but I do have one of my examples and this example here has some code in it which send to firebase so and it's actually quite easy for me to do this I just want to need to create a reference database I'm going to call it like colors or something I need to put some data in it so let me grab all this code here and I'm gonna grab this code and I'm going to put it I'll link to that particular example as well I'm going to put it in here I'm gonna use let and I'm not my example that I made before the firebase tutorial is about fruits but I'm gonna do color I'm gonna say color label of the databases color database and I'm gonna call it colors the data that I want to send is has an R and that is and I need these then to be global variables if I want to be able to access them so so I'm gonna make these global variables and give them an initial value I'm actually going to put this though in a function called pick color I think that'll make everything nicer I'm gonna say function a pick color and then I'm going to create an object with oh I could use that what's that thing called an es6 now where I could just make the object if I want the R value to be are the G value to be G there's a way to do that the B value to be B and then I want the label to be this dot HTML so this is the object this is what I want to send to firebase the red green and blue value and the label so then I'm just going to say let the the particular color be the color database push push that data and when it's finished oh it's going to give me this like key which is interesting to see because everything has this unique every record in a database has a unique ID so I could look at that just to see if it's right and I can have this callback finished something went wrong I could you use console dot error or data save successfully and let's see so let's let's do console dot log saving saving data and then also log the data and let's see what happens okay so now I'm going to go back to here and that that to me is pinkish and oppressed pinkish database is not defined oh yeah line 49 Oh firebase initialized so what did I not do that I did in this particular example when I initialized it oh did I create I have to create a database object so I have to create a database object from after I initialize firebase so let's go and do that that's a step that I missed and I'm gonna that's going to be a global variable called database now I'm gonna run this again that looks very greenish to me and saving this data 5226 sixtyfive with this label it generated a key but permission denied so now what I need to do is do something to allow myself to write to the database and I'm gonna do something not so great but I'm gonna do it anyway I forget where this is pause for a second this can be edit point pretty sure I am I realtime database rules okay it returns a promise I'm not using promises for this oh thanks what's the what's that entry right not if data exists so you can't overwrite some buddies thing is that what that does okay so I need to change the permissions that are in my firebase project so how come I've lost where that is probably understeer project settings color classification where is it users and permissions no hold on the interface has changed I have to figure out where it is anybody know where it is now Oh me I go to here I'm in color classification machine ml kit hosting storage develop database rules I guess I have to do get started uh okay okay okay okay do we go so now I have to be thoughtful and think about like the privacy and security of the data which is a really important point but again in this sort of like thing that I'm just working on to try to just get to the finish line here and with a trivial data set I'm going to at least just sort of open up and make make the data base easily writable without a lot of security rules so let's see so I need to go to firebase and I need to go to your two database and actually I don't even have a real time database available yet so I need to do get started and then look at this so make your database private by denying all reads and writes which is something that you really that that in many cases you're gonna want to do start in test mode anyone with your database reference will be able to read and write to your database I'm gonna hit an able I am gonna add one more thing to the I am gonna add one more thing to the rules so and thank you to me I am so me from the chat I can add in a rule for color data I'm gonna add another rule and let me zoom in here so you can see what I'm doing I would I want to do is I don't want to let somebody overwrite somebody else's entry that they already put in and so if I say dollar sign entry and then I set the write the dot write property to not data exists and again you can look through the documentation to see all the different things let's see does this is this right here I think I've got this right color data Open bracket close bracket dollar sign entry open bracket close bracket dot write not data exists this should hopefully give me a little bit more protection I'm gonna hit publish and now click back to database Oh get started where is it well maybe I have good I haven't written any data yet let's now run this again what is that that's kind of brownish I guess there we go looks like it's saved the data successfully and let's go now back to here and see what we got there we go colors and here it is there's my first data point I could go and add a bunch more reddish Oh what I wanted to do is then also have it pick a new color so as soon as it finishes data saved successfully let's say pick color and we'll get a new one right because it's going to pick color pick color should also draw the color so that's greenish greenish bluish bluish greenish purplish greenish oops oh I messed up but that's okay reddish greenish okay so I think we're done this is finished I'm going to put this somewhere on the internet maybe clean it up and add some interface stuff to it just here we can quickly see we can quickly see my data set these are all the things that are ventured so far with the RGB values and a label okay so now what I'm going to do between now and the next video is I'm gonna let this live for a bit try to collect the data I might have to clean the data a bit which I'll talk about put it into a spreadsheet figure out what I want to do with it but but and then I'll see you in the next video and I'll start to work on building the machine learning model to actually training a model based on this data okay thanks for watching and I'll see you soon could I do something where I make it could I do something by adding security where I if I make it readable or writable only from a certain IP address or something so you have to use the particular Oh color data two colors I didn't match it shoot oh that should be colors okay let me go back this should be colors right maybe Matt youyou can splice this in in the middle of the video we could do this thing again oops oops color data should actually be colors let me we tried to get because I'm not dude oops color data based on the way I wrote the code should actually be called colors so I'm just gonna really fix that real quick colors and so apologies for that but now it's corrected and whoops I can't get back back back okay I don't know sorry that's you don't I'll do it one other way oh this is actually incorrect this should actually be because in my code it needs to match what I wrote here colors so if I go back to this this should actually be color colors and then and there we go okay and the rules are published that'll spice it I don't know all right so hold on set global write to false to test what would that do I don't understand what what will okay so oh you mean Oh like just do this I don't understand it's letting me do it yes Oh publish this oh this now now won't let me do anything just to test that it's like huh but let me do it shouldn't let me not right now if I can't right if you make doubt write false then you need to run a server that's writing the data on behalf of the user I am NOT a bj AMCs how's this stopping us the viewers just filling your database with junk it's not I'm relying on your goodwill oh I see oh I can write two colors only I see so this is now the whole database is closed but colors is open but I should come back got it one more time oh boy this is fun isn't it one more time for the video editor I made a bad mistake like all the things in front of a green screen just kidding alright alright stop for a second I made some errors here or I could in that in the permissions and the rules there behind me so let me come back and actually show you what's wrong here so first of all color data let me bring this back up color data should not be called color data it needs to match it needs to match what is actually in the video here it's called colors alright so alright I could change this to color data but since I've already done it added some data I'm gonna call change this to colors and then this which oh one more time for good measure do you guys have any where you need to be what what it was was like five people left watching this this is my process okay don't mess with the process stop stop I made a mistake okay so we bring this back up here and transition back to the computer so I made some mistake in the rules right behind me they're basically a couple things number what oh boy how many times do I get to do this stop stop stop stop stop I made a mistake though that's kind of important for me to correct so let me come back here to the computer no that doesn't work twister here all right so look at this I made some mistakes these are the rules that I just wrote but color data is incorrect so first of all color data needs to match the database reference it's in my code and I call that colors not color data I could change this now to color data here but since I already added a bunch of data under colors let's go change this to colors now the other thing that I want to change here I want to make this false because this now what I want I mean even though this is still kind of wide open and people could fill the database with data that I don't want to fill it up I'm hoping the internet is not going to do that I will clean the clean all that out anyway but at the very least you can only now right to the colors table itself and you can only write if there you can't overwrite somebody else's entry so I'm gonna hit publish here and this should be better now and you can go back and continue watching whatever nonsense I was doing in the other part thank you thank you thank you thank you very much okay so now so now I just need to put this somewhere and and people can pull requests to make this better so let me let's go to github.com coding train let me make a new repository crowd source color data crowd for crowd sourcing color data for a machine learning learning classification example public readme create repository let's just upload this well let's just actually just do this code direct from video dear diary I have designed a terrible interface I also did not do anything to secure the data in firebase help me internet you are my only hope sincerely Daniel no slides chief Mon and one will get that joke choochoochoochoo Dan alright commit all right processing your files settings master branch save so how long do we have to wait we now can go to coding trained github dot crowdsource color data it's not the right URL it'll tell me in those settings why did I go away from that where was that settings here we go there we go so let's make sure this is actually still working what's that greenish okay yellowish greenish purplish bluish greenish I'm just gonna do this for a while bluish brownish bluish bluish greenish orangish greenish purplish pink blueish radish oh great bluish purplish purplish greenish greenish bluish reddish greenish purplish finish all right all right so here we go Oh a Vega volt this is come on internet be kind oh boy okay Internet be kind Internet be kind Internet I will shut this down I will shut this down I won't make that classification tutorial I pull this car over all right thanks everybody that's the end of today's live stream tomorrow I am actually going to come back and actually build the tensorflow J s model to the to to Tenten largest model to to to do the classification it is what time is it 230 and anybody have any questions boy I got a lot of date already do you think it's it's somebody flooding it or these are people just actually that doesn't look great that doesn't look gray that looks green that looks green I'm just gonna have to hope I'm gonna have to hope that I have good data alright everyone so I will um see you tomorrow I will be back tomorrow to make this classifier with tensorflow das and that's all clearly now I gotta get the chords for the coding train song it's time to say goodbye I wish there was more time but I've gotta go and I'd like to be under the sea when are you going to do a scratch coding challenge don't have any plans to do a scratch coding challenge I don't have any plans to do a scat scratch coding challenge anybody has any ideas to help me like write an algorithm to check the potatoe makes sense that would be appreciated but we're gonna I'm gonna work on cleaning up this data set and use it tomorrow Thank You Cody Garden with CJ it's closing time looks like the color isn't refreshing I don't know what that means purplish greenish bluish greenish greenish oh sorry purplish reddish purplish greenish pinkish all right thank you to the new sponsors how do I find the new sponsors I think I have some notice email notifications for that ah new sponsors new sponsors J shone and Tristan thank you so much for your sponsorship Google API key exposed on github oh I just got a security warning from get Guardian that they detected my API key so I was saying something I'm gonna go I'll be back tomorrow I have nothing else to say this has been coding train with me your host dan and looking forward to tomorrow 1100 1100 1130 1200 something like that boy do I have a lot of stuff to do so I will see you tomorrow thank you for watching Oh something I was saying wasn't there firebase warning that firebase data database color classification has reached its peak connections limit that's that's good at least they're protecting alright so thank you everybody make a video with CJ yes that would be fun CJ actually plays the guitar has a lot of talents really knows things about CSS and actual coding I like things and yeah I know you can see my firebase key and I'll see you all in the future okay oh I guess I'll play you out with my trailer oh no I saw you about the sponsorship yes sorry if you are a new sponsor go to the community tab look at the post that sponsors only and there's a link to a Google Form there to submit your youtube username and email address that's the only way for you to get a slack invite I don't have any automatic way to transfer your YouTube sponsorship to slack other than a manual process that's what I was saying okay good bye everybody I don't have a discord I'm using slack I don't know maybe I should use discord instead we have this discussion in the Select channel like once every few weeks but the I don't have the time or energy necessarily to do it all right and oh okay goodbye this is the trailer and are the the outro and good to make creation you
