With timestamps:

00:00 - all right so how I wanted to besides
00:04 - having you watch me erase this is I want
00:08 - to talk about Chrome extensions and I
00:10 - guess the anatomy of a Chrome extension
00:12 - I'm going to start with the most basic
00:13 - kind of Chrome extension you can
00:15 - possibly do so first of all again let's
00:19 - think about this diagram this is the
00:23 - Chrome browser maybe there is there's a
00:27 - toolbar there's an address bar there's a
00:30 - whole lot of elements here all of these
00:32 - elements are things we can control
00:33 - manipulate and and play around with as
00:36 - part of making a Chrome extension but
00:38 - I'm going to start with a sort of basic
00:39 - idea of affecting the actual content so
00:46 - for any Chrome extension that you make
00:49 - the first thing that you have to have is
00:52 - something called a manifest file
00:55 - manifest dot JSON so this is the first
01:01 - thing that you need this is a file that
01:03 - has all the configuration properties and
01:06 - information about your Chrome extension
01:09 - so that's let's go first make a
01:11 - manifesto JSON file all right so I'm
01:14 - gonna go to Adam I'm gonna make a new
01:18 - file I'm gonna call it manifest JSON and
01:20 - so this is just a sorry I lost my train
01:25 - of thought this is just a sorry this is
01:28 - just a JSON file so and it's going to
01:31 - have it's kind of like if you've ever
01:32 - made work with nodejs you need a package
01:34 - that JSON file that describes your
01:36 - project so there's a couple things that
01:38 - I need in here I need to say manifest
01:42 - version 2 and so I think there's
01:45 - different versions of like the Chrome
01:46 - extension API stuff and there was an
01:49 - older one maybe there's even a newer one
01:51 - but two is the one that I use and it
01:52 - works I could give it a name like coding
01:58 - train extension I can give it like a
02:05 - version which is just my made-up thing
02:07 - like oh it's version 0.001
02:11 - and yeah so that's let's actually just
02:15 - start with that okay so let's start with
02:19 - that so this is first what I need I need
02:21 - to have this kind of configuration file
02:23 - now there are a variety of kinds of
02:27 - Chrome extensions you can make we've
02:29 - mentioned this one that overrides the
02:31 - new tab page the first there's there's
02:35 - ones that add buttons to the interface
02:37 - there's browser action space all sort of
02:39 - things I'm gonna get to all that stuff
02:41 - the first thing that I want to add to my
02:44 - Chrome extension is something called a
02:46 - Content script and a con if you watched
02:50 - my previous bookmarklet video the
02:52 - content script is basically exactly the
02:55 - same thing that I did in the bookmarklet
02:58 - it's JavaScript code that will execute
03:00 - when the page loads and you can after
03:04 - the whole page is loaded and finished
03:06 - manipulate and draw and do things and
03:09 - alter the behavior and content of the
03:11 - web page work early on this is a very
03:13 - powerful thing for example let's say you
03:15 - want to make a Chrome extension that for
03:18 - anybody browsing the New York Times it
03:21 - swaps out any time the word computer
03:25 - appears with the word flower so if you
03:29 - wanted to do this project without a
03:30 - Chrome extension how would you do it oh
03:32 - maybe you'd have to create a whole fake
03:34 - website that kind of looks like the New
03:35 - York Times or you would load it and then
03:37 - you would are you would copy you jump
03:39 - through all these hoops to cry to create
03:41 - that illusion the Chrome extension is a
03:43 - program at least a Content script is a
03:45 - program that executes that runs for any
03:48 - given web page that the browser is
03:50 - currently on and you can say a lot of
03:52 - stuff like only for these URLs only for
03:54 - this you know you can know which tab
03:55 - you're on there's lots of possibilities
03:57 - there so this is the first thing that I
03:58 - want to add then a Content script can
04:00 - have a bunch of things associated with
04:02 - it but I'm going to associate with it
04:04 - just one thing which is a JavaScript
04:06 - file content jas so before we can start
04:10 - writing that javascript code we need to
04:12 - add tell the manifest.json file about
04:15 - this content script so let's add that so
04:19 - I think I say I might be getting some of
04:21 - this stuff wrong I think I say
04:23 - content scripts because there could be
04:27 - more than one and then that's an array
04:29 - and then I think I said you I say
04:33 - JavaScript wait and it's another it's an
04:35 - array of objects and I think I said no I
04:38 - think I CJ s and then I could say like
04:41 - content j s so for example here is this
04:46 - Chrome extension now has a Content
04:48 - script called that is where all the code
04:52 - for this content script is in this
04:53 - javascript file well I have to make that
04:54 - JavaScript file now content dot J s and
04:59 - all I'm gonna do is put console dot log
05:02 - you know Chrome extension ready to go
05:07 - whoa what did I just chrome Chrome
05:11 - extension go okay so I'm just gonna put
05:14 - a console log in the in the content
05:17 - script now I am missing a kind of key
05:19 - component here which is that by
05:21 - definition the Chrome extension runs
05:25 - first checks the URL that the current of
05:28 - the current page and then decides
05:30 - whether to run or not so one of the
05:32 - things that I can add to this I believe
05:34 - is matches and that's also an array and
05:42 - then so I could put things in here like
05:44 - you know any time I want the New York
05:47 - Times and you can I don't know if you
05:49 - can use a full regular expression in
05:50 - here but you can definitely use
05:51 - wildcards but I'm just gonna do I think
05:53 - it's all URLs so this is this should be
05:59 - what you put in if you want your Chrome
06:01 - extension to run on all URLs so we are
06:04 - by the way we're done we've actually
06:05 - made our first Chrome extension the only
06:08 - thing we need is the manifest.json file
06:10 - that describes the Chrome extension and
06:12 - we need the content j/s file which is
06:16 - the we actually don't need that but if I
06:18 - want to just do the basic one that is a
06:21 - Content script that's what we need so
06:23 - let's see now here's the question like
06:25 - oh my goodness how do we get this to run
06:26 - do I run a local server and I open up
06:28 - the JSON file in the browser No
06:30 - so this is a this is a an interesting
06:33 - it's actually quite simple to do but
06:35 - what I want to do is go to Chrome
06:38 - oh yes oh by the way so I can go to HTTP
06:42 - to look at URLs I can look at things on
06:44 - the file path in my in my previous
06:48 - bookmarklet videos I showed how you
06:49 - could go to like a JavaScript path to
06:51 - execute JavaScript code but a lot of
06:54 - things for Chrome you can get to like
06:56 - the version settings all that kind of
06:58 - thing through the URL address bar this
07:01 - is called by the way I think the omnibox
07:02 - I think because there's actually you can
07:05 - one of the things you could do with a
07:06 - Chrome extension is you can start to
07:08 - provide suggestions and make things
07:10 - happen based on people type in the
07:12 - omnibox I'm going to go to Chrome
07:16 - extensions and you could see here so
07:19 - here's here's my Chrome extensions page
07:22 - I only have one Chrome extension
07:25 - installed JSON format or I can enable it
07:27 - or disable it one thing you can see here
07:29 - is permissions so all Chrome extensions
07:32 - have permission to do certain things so
07:33 - it says they can read and change all of
07:35 - your data on the websites you visit this
07:37 - is actually the basic permissions for a
07:39 - content script that's what content
07:41 - scripts are allowed to do read and
07:42 - change all the data on the websites you
07:44 - visit so Chrome extensions are really
07:45 - something you have to opt into and there
07:47 - are all sorts of security and privacy
07:48 - questions that come with them but we're
07:50 - just experimenting playing around and
07:52 - where you want to make Chrome extensions
07:54 - just to run on this laptop here not to
07:56 - be necessarily released to the chrome
07:58 - store so how do I do that if I want to
08:01 - install run the Chrome extension code
08:03 - that I made I've got to go over here and
08:05 - first click developer mode and what you
08:08 - see now is that this miss these options
08:12 - now appear load unpacked extension pack
08:15 - extension the unpacked extension is just
08:18 - the raw code manifest that JSON the
08:21 - content is pack extension is then a
08:23 - thing I could do to like package it all
08:24 - into a single file to deploy it to the
08:26 - chrome store but again that's kind of
08:28 - beyond the scope of what I'm doing at
08:29 - least in this video it's really maybe in
08:31 - all the videos so i'm gonna click load
08:33 - unpacked extension i'm going to navigate
08:35 - to the desktop i'm gonna go to my folder
08:37 - called chrome extensions i'm gonna go to
08:39 - this one called basics which is where i
08:41 - have those files and i'm gonna hit
08:43 - select and now we might find out that i
08:46 - might have made a mistake i might get
08:47 - let's see so excellent I got an error
08:51 - loading an extension so this is what
08:53 - happens when you incorrectly format your
08:57 - manifest.json file so I'm gonna have to
09:00 - look I'm sure somebody in the chat is
09:02 - already telling me what I got wrong but
09:05 - I am going to I'm gonna try to look and
09:08 - see what it is so let me go here to
09:10 - manifest JSON
09:12 - oh I know what it is the JavaScript
09:16 - files associated with a particular
09:18 - content script can be more than one
09:20 - javascript file in fact you can actually
09:23 - put like if I wanted to use jQuery as
09:25 - part of my content script I could
09:27 - actually put other library files or p5
09:29 - library files in this so that needs to
09:31 - be an array and actually I should have
09:33 - had a clue to that because with saying
09:34 - here content scripts index 0 is invalid
09:37 - so this has to be an array so let's let
09:41 - me hit save and then I should be able
09:43 - hit retry boom we're great so we see
09:46 - coding train extension version 0.1
09:49 - didn't I say it was version 0.01
09:52 - shouldn't that be it's version version
09:54 - 2.0 yeah ok so for whatever reason it
09:59 - probably doesn't want let you do
10:00 - anything less than one decimal place
10:02 - version 1 I can check
10:06 - permissions which is that yes it can
10:08 - read it as a Content script so it can
10:10 - read and change all of your data on the
10:11 - websites you visit and it's running I
10:15 - could allow it to run incognito or not
10:17 - etc so it's enabled so here we go now
10:20 - I'm just gonna I'm gonna open up my
10:23 - console and I'm going to go to any web
10:26 - page like my tutorial and hit refresh
10:28 - Chrome extension goes so you can see
10:30 - that Chrome extension is going no matter
10:33 - what
10:33 - website i go to i go to google.com
10:36 - chrome extension go so that code now
10:39 - with that chrome extension installed
10:41 - runs for any web page that I'm on so now
10:44 - I can start to change whatever I want so
10:47 - let's let's do something similar to what
10:49 - I did with the bookmarklet I can say
10:51 - something like let paragraphs equal
10:54 - document dot document get elements by
10:59 - tag name you know I'm just trying
11:01 - think of something simple to do I can oh
11:05 - let me try using one of these new let me
11:08 - try using one of these new es6 loops
11:10 - why not this video randomly so I think I
11:12 - could say for element like element of
11:15 - paragraphs I think this is a new es6
11:18 - loop which so what I'm what I'm doing
11:20 - why am i covering this in the middle of
11:21 - this video I'll never know why I just
11:23 - decided to do this but instead of
11:24 - iterating over with I I can just say
11:26 - paragraphs is in it is an array and I
11:28 - want to look at each element of the
11:29 - array so let's see if I get this right
11:32 - and I'm gonna say element dot style
11:39 - background color equals you know some
11:48 - color so let's see now if we now here's
11:52 - the thing I'm gonna go back to this page
11:54 - and I'm gonna get this is where there's
11:55 - some paragraphs and I'm gonna hit
11:57 - refresh nothing happened okay let me
12:01 - make sure let me debug this right Chrome
12:04 - extension go Chrome extension go
12:06 - question mark I should see the new
12:09 - message right now I'm gonna go back and
12:11 - hit refresh hmm there's no question mark
12:14 - there so just as Chrome extension go so
12:16 - here's one of the things you it's really
12:18 - hard to remember but you have to
12:19 - remember when you change the code you've
12:21 - got to go back here and click reload
12:24 - you've got to ask Chrome extensions page
12:28 - to reload the source code from that
12:30 - unpack extension from that folder so I'm
12:32 - gonna hit reload and then I'm going to
12:36 - sorry I'm gonna go back to here and I'm
12:39 - gonna do this we can see there does this
12:42 - Chrome extension no matter what page I'm
12:44 - on i don't know i'll go to the IMA
12:47 - website for ITP right you can see it's
12:51 - made all the paragraphs pink on this
12:54 - page so so ah so this is pretty much
12:59 - this is done at least this first video
13:00 - what I wanted to show you is what are
13:03 - the pieces of a Chrome extension well
13:04 - one thing you can do with a Chrome
13:05 - extension is alter the content of the
13:08 - web page or
13:09 - the behavior right javascript code now
13:11 - it's really important to realize
13:12 - something that I didn't mention
13:14 - explicitly which i think is important to
13:16 - realize is if you look at the code
13:18 - there's no you know like in p5 you have
13:22 - to put stuff in function setup or in you
13:27 - know maybe there's like window dot
13:28 - onload or in jQuery there's some kind of
13:30 - like ready with a dollar sign or
13:32 - something crazy like that typically you
13:35 - want to execute your JavaScript code
13:37 - after the web page has loaded so you
13:39 - need an event the webpage is loaded
13:40 - execute this code a by definition the
13:44 - content script does not run until the
13:47 - page is already loaded I could also have
13:49 - the Chrome extension work for just a
13:51 - particular webpage there's a specific
13:54 - syntax to what you're allowed to put in
13:55 - matches and I'm often getting it wrong
13:57 - in fact there's a little edit point
13:58 - there because I just had some trouble
13:59 - figuring it out so me I am sue me and
14:02 - the chat just gave me a good suggestion
14:03 - so you can use wildcards so I think like
14:07 - this would basically say like any URL
14:10 - with Schiffman in it or like for example
14:13 - any URL with github in it let's just be
14:15 - I'm gonna be a little works but I'm
14:17 - gonna just also show you like I can say
14:19 - like I can say like any Schiffman net
14:24 - page whether it is so one thing I could
14:26 - do is like this whether it's HTTP or
14:28 - HTTPS I'm pretty sure this will work so
14:31 - now this content script will only
14:33 - execute on those pages so I'm gonna hit
14:35 - reload uh-oh there's a comma there wait
14:39 - should be a comma in there
14:40 - oh no there shouldn't be a comma here
14:41 - that's the last element of the array so
14:45 - retry there we go and now if I go to
14:48 - here whoops refresh still making
14:50 - everything pink but if I go to the ITP
14:53 - ima website we can see nothing is now
14:57 - pink so it's only it's only changing the
15:01 - it's only running this content script
15:03 - for those URLs and interesting enough
15:05 - notice how content scripts is an array
15:06 - so I can have certain content scripts
15:08 - for certain URLs and certain kind of
15:10 - script for other URLs all within the
15:12 - same extension so this is can become a
15:14 - much larger project with all sorts of
15:16 - permutations but this is the very basic
15:19 - idea okay so what I've shown you so far
15:21 - is the basic anatomy
15:23 - have a Chrome extension manifest file if
15:26 - you want to have a content not all
15:28 - Chrome extensions need content scripts
15:29 - but it's a good place to start
15:31 - content script what URLs that you want
15:33 - to match what's your JavaScript code
15:35 - what I haven't done is showing you
15:38 - anything about how to actually think
15:40 - about the browsing experience beyond
15:42 - just the actual web page you're on so
15:45 - for example what if I want to know when
15:47 - the user is typing here or what if I
15:50 - want to know when the user opens a new
15:51 - tab or what if I want to add a button to
15:54 - over there over there that I designed
15:57 - myself that when the user presses that
15:59 - button it shows them all the it shows
16:02 - them every time we're the word kitten
16:04 - appears on the web page by a with a
16:06 - count or something like a terrible
16:07 - example so this is what I'm going to do
16:09 - next and the thing that I need for that
16:11 - which I will do in the next video is
16:14 - what's called a background script so a
16:17 - Chrome extension can have a background
16:18 - script content script execute for every
16:22 - web web page that matches the URL after
16:24 - it's loaded the background script is
16:26 - actually a thing that runs as soon as
16:27 - you launch Chrome and it's always there
16:29 - listening for all of the events of the
16:31 - things you might be doing in chrome are
16:34 - you opening a new tab or are you
16:36 - pressing a button on the interface you
16:37 - typing in the address bar so this is
16:39 - going to unlock a lot of other kinds of
16:42 - possibilities and it's what I will show
16:43 - you in the next video
16:49 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

all right so how I wanted to besides having you watch me erase this is I want to talk about Chrome extensions and I guess the anatomy of a Chrome extension I'm going to start with the most basic kind of Chrome extension you can possibly do so first of all again let's think about this diagram this is the Chrome browser maybe there is there's a toolbar there's an address bar there's a whole lot of elements here all of these elements are things we can control manipulate and and play around with as part of making a Chrome extension but I'm going to start with a sort of basic idea of affecting the actual content so for any Chrome extension that you make the first thing that you have to have is something called a manifest file manifest dot JSON so this is the first thing that you need this is a file that has all the configuration properties and information about your Chrome extension so that's let's go first make a manifesto JSON file all right so I'm gonna go to Adam I'm gonna make a new file I'm gonna call it manifest JSON and so this is just a sorry I lost my train of thought this is just a sorry this is just a JSON file so and it's going to have it's kind of like if you've ever made work with nodejs you need a package that JSON file that describes your project so there's a couple things that I need in here I need to say manifest version 2 and so I think there's different versions of like the Chrome extension API stuff and there was an older one maybe there's even a newer one but two is the one that I use and it works I could give it a name like coding train extension I can give it like a version which is just my madeup thing like oh it's version 0.001 and yeah so that's let's actually just start with that okay so let's start with that so this is first what I need I need to have this kind of configuration file now there are a variety of kinds of Chrome extensions you can make we've mentioned this one that overrides the new tab page the first there's there's ones that add buttons to the interface there's browser action space all sort of things I'm gonna get to all that stuff the first thing that I want to add to my Chrome extension is something called a Content script and a con if you watched my previous bookmarklet video the content script is basically exactly the same thing that I did in the bookmarklet it's JavaScript code that will execute when the page loads and you can after the whole page is loaded and finished manipulate and draw and do things and alter the behavior and content of the web page work early on this is a very powerful thing for example let's say you want to make a Chrome extension that for anybody browsing the New York Times it swaps out any time the word computer appears with the word flower so if you wanted to do this project without a Chrome extension how would you do it oh maybe you'd have to create a whole fake website that kind of looks like the New York Times or you would load it and then you would are you would copy you jump through all these hoops to cry to create that illusion the Chrome extension is a program at least a Content script is a program that executes that runs for any given web page that the browser is currently on and you can say a lot of stuff like only for these URLs only for this you know you can know which tab you're on there's lots of possibilities there so this is the first thing that I want to add then a Content script can have a bunch of things associated with it but I'm going to associate with it just one thing which is a JavaScript file content jas so before we can start writing that javascript code we need to add tell the manifest.json file about this content script so let's add that so I think I say I might be getting some of this stuff wrong I think I say

I CJ s and then I could say like content j s so for example here is this Chrome extension now has a Content script called that is where all the code for this content script is in this javascript file well I have to make that JavaScript file now content dot J s and all I'm gonna do is put console dot log you know Chrome extension ready to go whoa what did I just chrome Chrome extension go okay so I'm just gonna put a console log in the in the content script now I am missing a kind of key component here which is that by definition the Chrome extension runs first checks the URL that the current of the current page and then decides whether to run or not so one of the things that I can add to this I believe is matches and that's also an array and then so I could put things in here like you know any time I want the New York Times and you can I don't know if you can use a full regular expression in here but you can definitely use wildcards but I'm just gonna do I think it's all URLs so this is this should be what you put in if you want your Chrome extension to run on all URLs so we are by the way we're done we've actually made our first Chrome extension the only thing we need is the manifest.json file that describes the Chrome extension and we need the content j/s file which is the we actually don't need that but if I want to just do the basic one that is a Content script that's what we need so let's see now here's the question like oh my goodness how do we get this to run do I run a local server and I open up the JSON file in the browser No so this is a this is a an interesting it's actually quite simple to do but what I want to do is go to Chrome oh yes oh by the way so I can go to HTTP to look at URLs I can look at things on the file path in my in my previous bookmarklet videos I showed how you could go to like a JavaScript path to execute JavaScript code but a lot of things for Chrome you can get to like the version settings all that kind of thing through the URL address bar this is called by the way I think the omnibox I think because there's actually you can one of the things you could do with a Chrome extension is you can start to provide suggestions and make things happen based on people type in the omnibox I'm going to go to Chrome extensions and you could see here so here's here's my Chrome extensions page I only have one Chrome extension installed JSON format or I can enable it or disable it one thing you can see here is permissions so all Chrome extensions have permission to do certain things so it says they can read and change all of your data on the websites you visit this is actually the basic permissions for a content script that's what content scripts are allowed to do read and change all the data on the websites you visit so Chrome extensions are really something you have to opt into and there are all sorts of security and privacy questions that come with them but we're just experimenting playing around and where you want to make Chrome extensions just to run on this laptop here not to be necessarily released to the chrome store so how do I do that if I want to install run the Chrome extension code that I made I've got to go over here and first click developer mode and what you see now is that this miss these options now appear load unpacked extension pack extension the unpacked extension is just the raw code manifest that JSON the content is pack extension is then a thing I could do to like package it all into a single file to deploy it to the chrome store but again that's kind of beyond the scope of what I'm doing at least in this video it's really maybe in all the videos so i'm gonna click load unpacked extension i'm going to navigate to the desktop i'm gonna go to my folder called chrome extensions i'm gonna go to this one called basics which is where i have those files and i'm gonna hit select and now we might find out that i might have made a mistake i might get let's see so excellent I got an error loading an extension so this is what happens when you incorrectly format your manifest.json file so I'm gonna have to look I'm sure somebody in the chat is already telling me what I got wrong but I am going to I'm gonna try to look and see what it is so let me go here to manifest JSON oh I know what it is the JavaScript files associated with a particular content script can be more than one javascript file in fact you can actually put like if I wanted to use jQuery as part of my content script I could actually put other library files or p5 library files in this so that needs to be an array and actually I should have had a clue to that because with saying here content scripts index 0 is invalid so this has to be an array so let's let me hit save and then I should be able hit retry boom we're great so we see coding train extension version 0.1 didn't I say it was version 0.01 shouldn't that be it's version version 2.0 yeah ok so for whatever reason it probably doesn't want let you do anything less than one decimal place version 1 I can check permissions which is that yes it can read it as a Content script so it can read and change all of your data on the websites you visit and it's running I could allow it to run incognito or not etc so it's enabled so here we go now I'm just gonna I'm gonna open up my console and I'm going to go to any web page like my tutorial and hit refresh Chrome extension goes so you can see that Chrome extension is going no matter what website i go to i go to google.com chrome extension go so that code now with that chrome extension installed runs for any web page that I'm on so now I can start to change whatever I want so let's let's do something similar to what I did with the bookmarklet I can say something like let paragraphs equal document dot document get elements by tag name you know I'm just trying think of something simple to do I can oh let me try using one of these new let me try using one of these new es6 loops why not this video randomly so I think I could say for element like element of paragraphs I think this is a new es6 loop which so what I'm what I'm doing why am i covering this in the middle of this video I'll never know why I just decided to do this but instead of iterating over with I I can just say paragraphs is in it is an array and I want to look at each element of the array so let's see if I get this right and I'm gonna say element dot style background color equals you know some color so let's see now if we now here's the thing I'm gonna go back to this page and I'm gonna get this is where there's some paragraphs and I'm gonna hit refresh nothing happened okay let me make sure let me debug this right Chrome extension go Chrome extension go question mark I should see the new message right now I'm gonna go back and hit refresh hmm there's no question mark there so just as Chrome extension go so here's one of the things you it's really hard to remember but you have to remember when you change the code you've got to go back here and click reload you've got to ask Chrome extensions page to reload the source code from that unpack extension from that folder so I'm gonna hit reload and then I'm going to sorry I'm gonna go back to here and I'm gonna do this we can see there does this Chrome extension no matter what page I'm on i don't know i'll go to the IMA website for ITP right you can see it's made all the paragraphs pink on this page so so ah so this is pretty much this is done at least this first video what I wanted to show you is what are the pieces of a Chrome extension well one thing you can do with a Chrome extension is alter the content of the web page or the behavior right javascript code now it's really important to realize something that I didn't mention explicitly which i think is important to realize is if you look at the code there's no you know like in p5 you have to put stuff in function setup or in you know maybe there's like window dot onload or in jQuery there's some kind of like ready with a dollar sign or something crazy like that typically you want to execute your JavaScript code after the web page has loaded so you need an event the webpage is loaded execute this code a by definition the content script does not run until the page is already loaded I could also have the Chrome extension work for just a particular webpage there's a specific syntax to what you're allowed to put in matches and I'm often getting it wrong in fact there's a little edit point there because I just had some trouble figuring it out so me I am sue me and the chat just gave me a good suggestion so you can use wildcards so I think like this would basically say like any URL with Schiffman in it or like for example any URL with github in it let's just be I'm gonna be a little works but I'm gonna just also show you like I can say like I can say like any Schiffman net page whether it is so one thing I could do is like this whether it's HTTP or HTTPS I'm pretty sure this will work so now this content script will only execute on those pages so I'm gonna hit reload uhoh there's a comma there wait should be a comma in there oh no there shouldn't be a comma here that's the last element of the array so retry there we go and now if I go to here whoops refresh still making everything pink but if I go to the ITP ima website we can see nothing is now pink so it's only it's only changing the it's only running this content script for those URLs and interesting enough notice how content scripts is an array so I can have certain content scripts for certain URLs and certain kind of script for other URLs all within the same extension so this is can become a much larger project with all sorts of permutations but this is the very basic idea okay so what I've shown you so far is the basic anatomy have a Chrome extension manifest file if you want to have a content not all Chrome extensions need content scripts but it's a good place to start content script what URLs that you want to match what's your JavaScript code what I haven't done is showing you anything about how to actually think about the browsing experience beyond just the actual web page you're on so for example what if I want to know when the user is typing here or what if I want to know when the user opens a new tab or what if I want to add a button to over there over there that I designed myself that when the user presses that button it shows them all the it shows them every time we're the word kitten appears on the web page by a with a count or something like a terrible example so this is what I'm going to do next and the thing that I need for that which I will do in the next video is what's called a background script so a Chrome extension can have a background script content script execute for every web web page that matches the URL after it's loaded the background script is actually a thing that runs as soon as you launch Chrome and it's always there listening for all of the events of the things you might be doing in chrome are you opening a new tab or are you pressing a button on the interface you typing in the address bar so this is going to unlock a lot of other kinds of possibilities and it's what I will show you in the next video
