00:00 - [BELL RINGING]
00:01 - Hello, I think at this point
until I make some more,
00:04 - this is the last
video in this section
00:07 - about arrays of objects.
00:08 - And one of the
things that comes up
00:10 - a lot, especially when you're
first learning to code,
00:14 - is with p5 and doing graphics
animations-- everything
00:17 - I've been doing pretty
much in all of these videos
00:19 - has just been with shapes.
00:21 - And so, as you can see here,
here is one of the examples
00:25 - arrays of objects where,
when I click on them,
00:29 - they change color.
00:30 - This was one of my
previous videos.
00:32 - What I want to look
at is what would
00:34 - it take to have each
one of these circles--
00:38 - each one of these
objects display
00:40 - instead of a shape an image--
00:43 - a JPEG or a PNG that I
load-- a file that I load.
00:46 - And how could I have
the same object?
00:49 - So, how could I
make a bubble class
00:51 - where each bubble
displays an image,
00:54 - but each bubble displays
a different image?
00:56 - So, the first thing
I'm going to do
00:57 - is just change all of
these into flowers.
01:00 - OK?
01:00 - So, I have a directory of images
associated with this project.
01:04 - I'm going to go over to my code.
01:07 - And it looks like this.
01:09 - It has a bunch-- it has one
image in it called flower.png.
01:13 - And it has a bunch of other
images called kitten.jpg.
01:15 - The reason why I'm
making this distinction
01:17 - is PNG is a format
for images that
01:19 - allows for transparent pixels.
01:21 - And that's something
that you're probably
01:22 - going to find very useful
when designing and using
01:25 - images in your code--
01:26 - that you can have
an image not just
01:29 - be that sort of like
rectangular thing,
01:30 - but rather have part of
the image be transparent.
01:34 - So, OK.
01:35 - So let's first-- I'm going
to-- one of the things--
01:38 - if I want to load
an image into p5,
01:41 - there are a variety
of ways to do it,
01:42 - and I'm sure I have other
videos in the future--
01:45 - even though I'm in
the future, but I
01:46 - made in the past that
are further ahead
01:48 - in this playlist--
01:49 - where I look at this
more specifically.
01:51 - But a quick way to load media--
01:54 - it seems a little bit silly.
01:55 - Like, oh, there's
a preload function?
01:58 - Setup is the function where all
the code at the beginning runs.
02:01 - Well, I want to load images
at the beginning to use.
02:04 - I should use those in Setup.
02:05 - But there's a funny way
about JavaScript-- the way
02:07 - that it loads media files
and large data files
02:11 - is that it can totally take a
while for those things to load.
02:17 - So, the preload function
is a way of saying,
02:19 - I'm going to have a variable--
02:21 - I'm going to call it flower--
02:22 - and in preload I'm
going to say flower
02:24 - equals loadImage flower.png.
02:30 - And this could be double
quotes or single quotes.
02:33 - They mean the same thing.
02:34 - I'm kind of like--
02:35 - I like single quotes these days.
02:37 - So, this right here
is saying, hey,
02:39 - I know you're about
to set up a p5 sketch.
02:42 - Before you do that, I want to
have a pre-setup to the setup
02:45 - where I want to load this image.
02:46 - So, this will guarantee
that the flower
02:48 - image is ready to be used by
the time you get to setup.
02:50 - Now the rest of our
work is really as simple
02:53 - as if I have this image--
02:56 - that data from that PNG file
stored in this variable flower,
03:00 - I can just go all the way
down to my bubble object--
03:03 - and look here.
03:04 - This is where I draw
the bubble as a circle.
03:07 - So, I can just get rid
of all of this code,
03:10 - and I can just change and use
this function called image.
03:13 - So, there's a function in
p5 called image which says,
03:15 - hey, I want to draw an
image to the screen.
03:17 - Just like I want to draw
an ellipse at this.x,
03:20 - this.y, now I want to draw
an image at this.x, this.y.
03:26 - So, now all I've done is
load that image in preload
03:29 - in a global variable and
then draw that image here
03:32 - in the show function.
03:34 - So, let's refresh.
03:36 - [LAUGHS] OK.
03:38 - So, what is this
error file not found?
03:41 - I forgot that I put the
images in this directory
03:46 - called kittens.
03:47 - So, I need to make sure I
reference that directory.
03:49 - Now note I also
need this directory
03:52 - to be part of the
same directory where
03:53 - my index.html and
sketch.js stuff is.
03:56 - So, there could be
some nuance here
03:57 - into where you store
your image files.
04:00 - But in this case, I just need to
make sure I include the folder
04:04 - name kittens/flower.png.
04:08 - And now if I do this,
you can say look,
04:10 - there my bubbles are flowers!
04:12 - Yay!
04:13 - Now, they aren't
different sizes.
04:16 - And so if I wanted
to, I could kind of
04:18 - go a little farther with this.
04:20 - And I could use this
variable r, and I
04:22 - could make that the width
and height of the image.
04:27 - Now, one thing to realize here--
04:29 - I'm looking over there to see if
I can use my whiteboard, which
04:31 - I'm about to.
04:31 - But I have to go erase it first.
04:33 - So, when I drew a circle--
04:36 - when I used the
ellipse function,
04:38 - and I have this
variable called this.r,
04:42 - I actually assigned
that-- it's poorly
04:43 - named because it's assigned
to the diameter of the circle.
04:48 - A rectangle or a square--
04:51 - which is a rectangle
with equal sides--
04:54 - if I have the xy here,
this is its width
04:57 - and this is its height.
04:58 - The reason why I'm
bringing this up
05:00 - is because the image function--
05:03 - I switched from
ellipse to image,
05:05 - but it would be almost
a better example
05:07 - if I were switching from
rectangle, which requires an x,
05:10 - a y, a width, and a height.
05:12 - If I were switching
from rectangle
05:14 - to image, which also requires an
x, a y, a width, and a height,
05:18 - the only difference is fill
that rectangle with the pixels
05:21 - from some actual
image, like flower.
05:25 - So this is really
what's going on.
05:27 - So I can manipulate the
size and that sort of thing.
05:29 - I'm not going to worry
about that too much.
05:31 - And I'm just going to leave it--
05:33 - I'm going to just
simplify this example.
05:36 - But let's just show it
to you with r in there.
05:38 - You can see now they're
all different sizes.
05:40 - I'll leave that in there.
05:41 - Why not?
05:44 - All right, so now what if what
I want to do is click on these
05:49 - and have them change--
05:50 - transform from a beautiful
flower to a butterfly?
05:56 - Because we all know
butter flowers transform--
05:59 - OK.
05:59 - I have kittens-- to a kitten!
06:01 - All I have are kittens!
06:04 - So I do have this
clicked function.
06:06 - It changes the brightness.
06:08 - Let's just first make this work.
06:10 - Let's back up a second.
06:13 - And what I want to
do now is I want
06:15 - to instead of having each image
be the-- each bubble object
06:21 - be the same image, I want to
pick up an image of a kitten.
06:26 - So I'm now going to add
an array called kittens.
06:30 - And what I'm going to do is
in preload I'm going to say
06:33 - kittens index 0 equals
loadImage kittens/kittens0.jpg.
06:43 - So you can see here
I could do this.
06:46 - And I have five of them.
06:48 - So here's the thing,
this is pretty horrible.
06:50 - What I want to be able
to do is if I have
06:53 - a whole bunch of
images and they're
06:54 - named in some consistent way,
what I actually want to do is,
06:58 - could I write a loop
to load all of these?
07:01 - So instead of
having three images
07:03 - loaded into an array 0, 1,
and 2, could I write a loop?
07:06 - And one thing that's
interesting is
07:08 - I can do this very
easily with something
07:10 - called string concatenation.
07:12 - Nice excuse to bring
that up in here.
07:14 - So as you might know,
2 plus 2 equals 4.
07:19 - However, A plus B equals the
string AB, or cow plus bell
07:31 - equals cowbell.
07:34 - So when you use the
plus operator with text,
07:37 - it joins the text rather
than the plus operator
07:40 - with numbers adding the numbers.
07:41 - And the reason why this is so
useful is what I can do here
07:45 - is I can write a loop for let
I equals 0. i is less than--
07:51 - how many kitten
images do I have?
07:53 - I think I had five.
07:55 - I can see them here.
07:57 - 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
07:58 - I had 5-- 5 i plus plus.
08:01 - Then I can just take this
line of code, put it here,
08:04 - and I can say kittens index
i equals loadImage kitten.
08:10 - Now I don't want to load
the 0 kitten into each one.
08:13 - Although I could do that
now for just testing.
08:15 - But I'm going to keep moving on.
08:16 - I want to load this
plus-- oh, and there's
08:19 - a new way to do this.
08:21 - [LAUGHS] There's a new
way to do this ES6.
08:22 - I'll come back to that
at the end of this video
08:24 - if you're interested.
08:25 - This is a bold way that I--
08:27 - I could add the i in between.
08:29 - I can say take this
string, kittens/kitten,
08:32 - join it with the value of
i, which is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,
08:35 - and then add .jpg to the end.
08:38 - And that will load all of
those image files into kittens.
08:42 - Now let's just make
sure this works
08:45 - by going down here and saying
something like kittens index 0.
08:51 - That's kittens0.
08:55 - Let's take a look
at kittens index 3.
09:00 - That's kittens index 3.
09:01 - Look at that little kitten.
09:02 - That little kitten.
09:03 - OK, so now how do
I have each object
09:07 - have a reference to
a different kitten?
09:10 - Very important.
09:11 - So one thing that I think
that I want to have--
09:13 - I'm going to get rid of
this brightness thing.
09:15 - This brightness was
from a previous example.
09:18 - What I want to do is
have an image associated
09:20 - with each bubble object.
09:22 - So why not say this.img equals--
09:26 - or this.kitten
equals what-- img.
09:30 - So when I make a bubble, I
want to say I want a bubble
09:35 - to be at this x location and
this y location with this size,
09:39 - and I want it to use
this particular image.
09:42 - So what that means is
I need to now up here--
09:47 - I need to pick one
of these images.
09:49 - Now let's say I want
to pick a random one.
09:52 - The nice thing is if
you have an array in p5,
09:57 - I can just say kitten
equals random kittens.
10:02 - This random function-- if I
give the random function array,
10:05 - it will pull out
a random element
10:07 - from that array, which is one
of those random kitten images,
10:10 - and put it in this variable.
10:12 - And then I can pass that in.
10:15 - So this is me picking
a random image,
10:19 - then passing it into the
object, and then the object
10:23 - receiving it and putting
it in as a property.
10:26 - And then what's the last step?
10:28 - I need to make sure I draw
that particular kitten image.
10:33 - All right, let's see
what we got here.
10:35 - Yay, look!
10:36 - Lots of random-- now
it's hard to see them
10:38 - because they're so small.
10:39 - So let's make these
kittens bigger.
10:47 - There we go.
10:48 - So you can see you have a
bunch of kitten objects.
10:50 - And I could-- I do the
thing where I click,
10:52 - and I add new ones
or I delete them.
10:54 - But let's have all of
these kittens every time
10:56 - I click change to a new kitten.
11:01 - [LAUGHS]
11:03 - So we already had this
whole clicked function.
11:08 - And I'm saying if d
is less than this.r,
11:13 - why not just say
this dot image--
11:16 - this.kitten is a
new random kitten?
11:22 - So we can see I could
always at any moment
11:24 - pick a new image to store into
that bubble object's image
11:27 - variable.
11:28 - And so now-- oh, and
this is bad though.
11:32 - This is for checking--
11:35 - this is math that I had
leftover from before is
11:38 - checking to see if the mouse
clicks inside of a circle.
11:42 - And since the image is actually
a rectangle, why don't we
11:49 - make those back to flowers?
11:51 - Because the nice thing
about the flower is it
11:53 - was kind of like
circular thing inside.
11:55 - Whatever.
11:56 - But I could change this code.
11:58 - I could change this code to say
if px is greater than this.x.
12:10 - And px is less than
this.x plus this.r.
12:15 - And py is greater than this.y.
12:19 - And py is less than
this.y plus this.r.
12:25 - What is all this crazy mumbo
jumbo that I just put in there?
12:30 - What I'm trying to do
is I'm trying to say,
12:32 - hey, there is a point.
12:33 - It's clicked.
12:34 - Is it in between this x?
12:37 - Well, you can't
see that-- this x.
12:40 - And this location is x plus r,
and the y is between this y,
12:45 - and this location is y plus r.
12:46 - So I'm checking to see if
the x and y of the mouse
12:49 - is within those boundaries.
12:53 - And once I've done
that, we should--
12:58 - yay, look!
12:59 - I can just keep making
different kittens.
13:04 - Yay!
13:05 - It's not a square.
13:06 - It is a square.
13:07 - It is a square.
13:08 - It's not a square.
13:09 - I don't know.
13:10 - So I've done something
goofy here where I'm just--
13:12 - you can clean this up and
try it different ways.
13:14 - And what if I make it a flower?
13:16 - And is a circle better to check?
13:18 - Maybe I could just change
it when I click to flower.
13:22 - So these kittens are
changing into flowers
13:25 - when I click on them.
13:26 - And then if I click
on them again,
13:28 - oh, they still are a flower.
13:29 - So you can see the
range of possibilities.
13:30 - You can also make
the argument here
13:32 - that maybe this whole picking
the random kitten here
13:36 - and passing it in was
kind of unnecessary.
13:38 - Because what I could have just
done is right down in here
13:42 - I could just picked the random
thing in the constructor,
13:47 - and that's also the same thing.
13:49 - So there's lots
of different ways
13:50 - of organizing the code depending
on what you're trying to do.
13:53 - And generally speaking,
I don't love the fact
13:55 - that I'm using flower
here or kittens here,
13:58 - because these are
variables that exist
14:00 - outside the scope of the class.
14:01 - And the class, if it's going
to know about things outside
14:04 - of its scope, should
probably receive them
14:06 - as parameters to a function.
14:08 - But that's neither
here or there.
14:09 - It's worked.
14:10 - Wait, there's a bonus here
at the end of this video!
14:13 - I don't know why I'm
looking around as
14:15 - if someone's going to catch me.
14:17 - I forgot, I should probably
make a video just about this.
14:20 - But while we're here,
there's also a new way.
14:22 - Look at this.
14:23 - And I was told, by the way--
14:24 - I was just given some nice
advice about I shouldn't really
14:26 - be using the word join because
that's kind of using another--
14:29 - but this is string
concatenation.
14:31 - kittens/kitten plus concatenate
with the value of i plus
14:35 - the concatenate with .jpg.
14:37 - But there's a new way to create
strings from actual characters
14:43 - and variables in JavaScript,
and it's something
14:46 - called template literals.
14:47 - And this is in lots
of other languages,
14:49 - but this is a new way
to do it in JavaScript.
14:51 - And it involves the
use of the back-tick.
14:53 - So if I put back-tick
here and back-tick here,
14:57 - get rid of this,
get rid of this--
15:00 - now I don't want
the pluses anymore,
15:02 - so this is just like a string.
15:06 - It's a literal string.
15:07 - Ah, it's literal!
15:08 - This is a literal string,
kittens/kitten.jpg.
15:11 - But if I want to use
a variable in there--
15:14 - well, we're calling this
the template literal,
15:16 - I can put a variable in there
with curly brackets and dollar
15:20 - sign and then the
name of that variable.
15:23 - Hopefully, I'm
getting this right.
15:24 - So this is a way
of saying, hey, I
15:26 - want to have this
string instead of having
15:28 - to use plus for joining-- and
the nice thing about this,
15:30 - I'm pretty sure it lets you
do this over multiple lines
15:33 - too, which is
really, really nice.
15:35 - Because with regular quotes,
you can't have multiple lines--
15:37 - line breaks.
15:38 - So this should work
exactly the same way--
15:41 - template literal.
15:42 - Ahh!
15:45 - So close!
15:47 - What did I get wrong?
15:48 - [SAD TROMBONE SOUND]
15:50 - I made a mistake.
15:51 - Because, by the way, I
don't actually know what
15:53 - I'm doing at all.
15:54 - It looks like this.
15:56 - The dollar sign-- ah, I knew I
should have syntax highlighted
15:59 - that in some way!
15:59 - The dollar sign is an indication
like, hold on a second,
16:03 - I'm going to use a
template literal.
16:06 - And so now I'm
saying what's inside
16:08 - of here is the variable name.
16:09 - And we can see the
syntax highlighting
16:11 - fixed, which is good.
16:13 - There we go.
16:13 - Now this is working, and
it's the same exact program.
16:16 - I should mention, well, what
if I really wanted to have--
16:21 - so one thing, if I just had
dollar sign in the string,
16:25 - it's not going to
think it's part of this
16:27 - unless the curly
brackets are there.
16:29 - And so if I really
wanted it to be this,
16:31 - I could probably use an
escape sequence or something.
16:34 - But it's pretty rare
that you're actually
16:36 - going to want to have this
sequence of characters
16:38 - in your string.
16:40 - OK, so that's a
little extra bonus
16:41 - piece at the end of this video.
16:42 - Maybe I'll make a
special video just
16:44 - all about the wonder
of template literals,
16:46 - because that's what I'm sure
everybody on the internet
16:48 - wants to watch.
16:49 - And I'll see you in the future.

Cleaned transcript:

[BELL RINGING] Hello, I think at this point until I make some more, this is the last video in this section about arrays of objects. And one of the things that comes up a lot, especially when you're first learning to code, is with p5 and doing graphics animations everything I've been doing pretty much in all of these videos has just been with shapes. And so, as you can see here, here is one of the examples arrays of objects where, when I click on them, they change color. This was one of my previous videos. What I want to look at is what would it take to have each one of these circles each one of these objects display instead of a shape an image a JPEG or a PNG that I load a file that I load. And how could I have the same object? So, how could I make a bubble class where each bubble displays an image, but each bubble displays a different image? So, the first thing I'm going to do is just change all of these into flowers. OK? So, I have a directory of images associated with this project. I'm going to go over to my code. And it looks like this. It has a bunch it has one image in it called flower.png. And it has a bunch of other images called kitten.jpg. The reason why I'm making this distinction is PNG is a format for images that allows for transparent pixels. And that's something that you're probably going to find very useful when designing and using images in your code that you can have an image not just be that sort of like rectangular thing, but rather have part of the image be transparent. So, OK. So let's first I'm going to one of the things if I want to load an image into p5, there are a variety of ways to do it, and I'm sure I have other videos in the future even though I'm in the future, but I made in the past that are further ahead in this playlist where I look at this more specifically. But a quick way to load media it seems a little bit silly. Like, oh, there's a preload function? Setup is the function where all the code at the beginning runs. Well, I want to load images at the beginning to use. I should use those in Setup. But there's a funny way about JavaScript the way that it loads media files and large data files is that it can totally take a while for those things to load. So, the preload function is a way of saying, I'm going to have a variable I'm going to call it flower and in preload I'm going to say flower equals loadImage flower.png. And this could be double quotes or single quotes. They mean the same thing. I'm kind of like I like single quotes these days. So, this right here is saying, hey, I know you're about to set up a p5 sketch. Before you do that, I want to have a presetup to the setup where I want to load this image. So, this will guarantee that the flower image is ready to be used by the time you get to setup. Now the rest of our work is really as simple as if I have this image that data from that PNG file stored in this variable flower, I can just go all the way down to my bubble object and look here. This is where I draw the bubble as a circle. So, I can just get rid of all of this code, and I can just change and use this function called image. So, there's a function in p5 called image which says, hey, I want to draw an image to the screen. Just like I want to draw an ellipse at this.x, this.y, now I want to draw an image at this.x, this.y. So, now all I've done is load that image in preload in a global variable and then draw that image here in the show function. So, let's refresh. [LAUGHS] OK. So, what is this error file not found? I forgot that I put the images in this directory called kittens. So, I need to make sure I reference that directory. Now note I also need this directory to be part of the same directory where my index.html and sketch.js stuff is. So, there could be some nuance here into where you store your image files. But in this case, I just need to make sure I include the folder name kittens/flower.png. And now if I do this, you can say look, there my bubbles are flowers! Yay! Now, they aren't different sizes. And so if I wanted to, I could kind of go a little farther with this. And I could use this variable r, and I could make that the width and height of the image. Now, one thing to realize here I'm looking over there to see if I can use my whiteboard, which I'm about to. But I have to go erase it first. So, when I drew a circle when I used the ellipse function, and I have this variable called this.r, I actually assigned that it's poorly named because it's assigned to the diameter of the circle. A rectangle or a square which is a rectangle with equal sides if I have the xy here, this is its width and this is its height. The reason why I'm bringing this up is because the image function I switched from ellipse to image, but it would be almost a better example if I were switching from rectangle, which requires an x, a y, a width, and a height. If I were switching from rectangle to image, which also requires an x, a y, a width, and a height, the only difference is fill that rectangle with the pixels from some actual image, like flower. So this is really what's going on. So I can manipulate the size and that sort of thing. I'm not going to worry about that too much. And I'm just going to leave it I'm going to just simplify this example. But let's just show it to you with r in there. You can see now they're all different sizes. I'll leave that in there. Why not? All right, so now what if what I want to do is click on these and have them change transform from a beautiful flower to a butterfly? Because we all know butter flowers transform OK. I have kittens to a kitten! All I have are kittens! So I do have this clicked function. It changes the brightness. Let's just first make this work. Let's back up a second. And what I want to do now is I want to instead of having each image be the each bubble object be the same image, I want to pick up an image of a kitten. So I'm now going to add an array called kittens. And what I'm going to do is in preload I'm going to say kittens index 0 equals loadImage kittens/kittens0.jpg. So you can see here I could do this. And I have five of them. So here's the thing, this is pretty horrible. What I want to be able to do is if I have a whole bunch of images and they're named in some consistent way, what I actually want to do is, could I write a loop to load all of these? So instead of having three images loaded into an array 0, 1, and 2, could I write a loop? And one thing that's interesting is I can do this very easily with something called string concatenation. Nice excuse to bring that up in here. So as you might know, 2 plus 2 equals 4. However, A plus B equals the string AB, or cow plus bell equals cowbell. So when you use the plus operator with text, it joins the text rather than the plus operator with numbers adding the numbers. And the reason why this is so useful is what I can do here is I can write a loop for let I equals 0. i is less than how many kitten images do I have? I think I had five. I can see them here. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. I had 5 5 i plus plus. Then I can just take this line of code, put it here, and I can say kittens index i equals loadImage kitten. Now I don't want to load the 0 kitten into each one. Although I could do that now for just testing. But I'm going to keep moving on. I want to load this plus oh, and there's a new way to do this. [LAUGHS] There's a new way to do this ES6. I'll come back to that at the end of this video if you're interested. This is a bold way that I I could add the i in between. I can say take this string, kittens/kitten, join it with the value of i, which is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and then add .jpg to the end. And that will load all of those image files into kittens. Now let's just make sure this works by going down here and saying something like kittens index 0. That's kittens0. Let's take a look at kittens index 3. That's kittens index 3. Look at that little kitten. That little kitten. OK, so now how do I have each object have a reference to a different kitten? Very important. So one thing that I think that I want to have I'm going to get rid of this brightness thing. This brightness was from a previous example. What I want to do is have an image associated with each bubble object. So why not say this.img equals or this.kitten equals what img. So when I make a bubble, I want to say I want a bubble to be at this x location and this y location with this size, and I want it to use this particular image. So what that means is I need to now up here I need to pick one of these images. Now let's say I want to pick a random one. The nice thing is if you have an array in p5, I can just say kitten equals random kittens. This random function if I give the random function array, it will pull out a random element from that array, which is one of those random kitten images, and put it in this variable. And then I can pass that in. So this is me picking a random image, then passing it into the object, and then the object receiving it and putting it in as a property. And then what's the last step? I need to make sure I draw that particular kitten image. All right, let's see what we got here. Yay, look! Lots of random now it's hard to see them because they're so small. So let's make these kittens bigger. There we go. So you can see you have a bunch of kitten objects. And I could I do the thing where I click, and I add new ones or I delete them. But let's have all of these kittens every time I click change to a new kitten. [LAUGHS] So we already had this whole clicked function. And I'm saying if d is less than this.r, why not just say this dot image this.kitten is a new random kitten? So we can see I could always at any moment pick a new image to store into that bubble object's image variable. And so now oh, and this is bad though. This is for checking this is math that I had leftover from before is checking to see if the mouse clicks inside of a circle. And since the image is actually a rectangle, why don't we make those back to flowers? Because the nice thing about the flower is it was kind of like circular thing inside. Whatever. But I could change this code. I could change this code to say if px is greater than this.x. And px is less than this.x plus this.r. And py is greater than this.y. And py is less than this.y plus this.r. What is all this crazy mumbo jumbo that I just put in there? What I'm trying to do is I'm trying to say, hey, there is a point. It's clicked. Is it in between this x? Well, you can't see that this x. And this location is x plus r, and the y is between this y, and this location is y plus r. So I'm checking to see if the x and y of the mouse is within those boundaries. And once I've done that, we should yay, look! I can just keep making different kittens. Yay! It's not a square. It is a square. It is a square. It's not a square. I don't know. So I've done something goofy here where I'm just you can clean this up and try it different ways. And what if I make it a flower? And is a circle better to check? Maybe I could just change it when I click to flower. So these kittens are changing into flowers when I click on them. And then if I click on them again, oh, they still are a flower. So you can see the range of possibilities. You can also make the argument here that maybe this whole picking the random kitten here and passing it in was kind of unnecessary. Because what I could have just done is right down in here I could just picked the random thing in the constructor, and that's also the same thing. So there's lots of different ways of organizing the code depending on what you're trying to do. And generally speaking, I don't love the fact that I'm using flower here or kittens here, because these are variables that exist outside the scope of the class. And the class, if it's going to know about things outside of its scope, should probably receive them as parameters to a function. But that's neither here or there. It's worked. Wait, there's a bonus here at the end of this video! I don't know why I'm looking around as if someone's going to catch me. I forgot, I should probably make a video just about this. But while we're here, there's also a new way. Look at this. And I was told, by the way I was just given some nice advice about I shouldn't really be using the word join because that's kind of using another but this is string concatenation. kittens/kitten plus concatenate with the value of i plus the concatenate with .jpg. But there's a new way to create strings from actual characters and variables in JavaScript, and it's something called template literals. And this is in lots of other languages, but this is a new way to do it in JavaScript. And it involves the use of the backtick. So if I put backtick here and backtick here, get rid of this, get rid of this now I don't want the pluses anymore, so this is just like a string. It's a literal string. Ah, it's literal! This is a literal string, kittens/kitten.jpg. But if I want to use a variable in there well, we're calling this the template literal, I can put a variable in there with curly brackets and dollar sign and then the name of that variable. Hopefully, I'm getting this right. So this is a way of saying, hey, I want to have this string instead of having to use plus for joining and the nice thing about this, I'm pretty sure it lets you do this over multiple lines too, which is really, really nice. Because with regular quotes, you can't have multiple lines line breaks. So this should work exactly the same way template literal. Ahh! So close! What did I get wrong? [SAD TROMBONE SOUND] I made a mistake. Because, by the way, I don't actually know what I'm doing at all. It looks like this. The dollar sign ah, I knew I should have syntax highlighted that in some way! The dollar sign is an indication like, hold on a second, I'm going to use a template literal. And so now I'm saying what's inside of here is the variable name. And we can see the syntax highlighting fixed, which is good. There we go. Now this is working, and it's the same exact program. I should mention, well, what if I really wanted to have so one thing, if I just had dollar sign in the string, it's not going to think it's part of this unless the curly brackets are there. And so if I really wanted it to be this, I could probably use an escape sequence or something. But it's pretty rare that you're actually going to want to have this sequence of characters in your string. OK, so that's a little extra bonus piece at the end of this video. Maybe I'll make a special video just all about the wonder of template literals, because that's what I'm sure everybody on the internet wants to watch. And I'll see you in the future.
