04:19 - let's do it
04:20 - [Music]
04:36 - [Music]
04:53 - foreign
05:03 - still checking my audio here I'm gonna
05:05 - try one more thing and I'm just going to
05:06 - leave it as is
05:08 - [Music]
05:25 - okay here we go
05:30 - [Music]
05:36 - hi I'm still here the train is departing
05:39 - I'm not ready I'm gonna switch the
05:41 - camera to being on me though
05:43 - uh
05:46 - what was loud
05:50 - um
05:55 - who is in the chat let's see uh oh boy
05:59 - uh
06:03 - let's see okay okay okay
06:07 - hi everybody oh this was a mistake
06:12 - My Life currently hi hi by the way I'm
06:15 - Dan uh you're watching a live stream of
06:17 - the coding train you're watching a
06:19 - completely unhinged unready person on
06:22 - the internet who just happened to turn
06:25 - on this whole streaming setup but is not
06:29 - at all uh ready the train whistle was
06:33 - loud I don't know what you were even
06:34 - hearing
06:36 - where did that come from so I don't
06:40 - something is wrong with the audio setup
06:42 - I
06:44 - let's just let's just set the stage for
06:46 - a second why am I here I don't know why
06:49 - you're here to be perfectly honest
06:52 - as my phone is beeping
06:56 - now turn that off
06:59 - um you should probably turn this off
07:01 - right now because
07:03 - I really wanted to live stream because I
07:06 - wanted to make sure I got a live stream
07:07 - in before the end of September and this
07:09 - was the last day that I could possibly
07:11 - do it and I was busy with all sorts of
07:13 - things all day today and I didn't get
07:15 - into this room until about 10 minutes
07:18 - ago and I'm completely not ready from a
07:21 - technical setup standpoint from a mental
07:24 - and emotional standpoint but I'm here
07:27 - nonetheless
07:28 - um the main thing here and I'm glad that
07:31 - Daniel teffra is saying that I'm excited
07:33 - for the stream and that hexagon has a
07:36 - curiosity I've got at least I've got
07:38 - this extra laptop here with me with some
07:40 - different new stickers on it that uh I
07:43 - can watch the Youtube chat uh go by here
07:46 - so thanks for bearing with me
07:49 - um I've got a short list of things I
07:51 - want to cover you'll you might notice
07:53 - that the title of this stream was just
07:55 - choo choo because I have no idea what
07:57 - it's supposed to happen during it but
08:00 - um
08:01 - if you could just give me a minute here
08:03 - to get organized
08:05 - uh I think everything's going to be okay
08:08 - so I have a question
08:10 - uh in terms of the audio and
08:12 - uh hello from Norway I was about to go
08:15 - to bed but I guess it will wait no no go
08:17 - to bed go to bed sleep sleep is
08:19 - important and the recording of This will
08:21 - be in the morning what are you really
08:23 - missing I mean yeah
08:26 - you you do you decide but you know just
08:29 - just if you want my advice sleep is good
08:32 - um question is my audio
08:37 - good enough
08:39 - do you hear a very substantial Echo I'm
08:42 - wondering
08:43 - I'm streaming from a cathedral audio is
08:47 - five by five I don't know what that
08:49 - audio is good so um so all right so I
08:51 - think it's fine I so in this room where
08:54 - I am it's a pretty open space in a
08:56 - garage and I have all these sound
08:58 - blankets I never sound treated this room
09:00 - but I have these like sound blankets
09:02 - that I was hanging for a while to try to
09:04 - keep the echo down and then I started
09:06 - using this piece of software called uh
09:09 - Nvidia broadcast which has like
09:12 - in real time uh remove the echo from it
09:16 - uh and
09:19 - it doesn't seem to be working right now
09:20 - but everybody's saying the audio is fine
09:22 - some of an echo okay slight Echo
09:24 - slightly muffled
09:26 - it's definitely this microphone I'm
09:28 - tapping on it we're just gonna go with
09:31 - what it is
09:33 - I don't understand there was a different
09:35 - time on my life
09:38 - and I know I said this probably the last
09:39 - time I live streamed more I was able to
09:41 - manage all the different kinds of things
09:43 - that I'm working on in uh in a healthy
09:46 - and productive way
09:49 - now is not that time
09:52 - uh
09:54 - uh uh and um I I can't seem to get it
09:57 - together and I think a lot of the reason
09:58 - is because I have been working on and
10:01 - you have to bear with me for a second
10:02 - I'm just downloading some stuff here
10:04 - that I want to show you I have been
10:06 - working on a couple projects
10:10 - I just noticed I haven't been in this
10:12 - room because I haven't been live
10:14 - streaming or recording videos and the
10:16 - spiders have spun webs that are now
10:19 - around me that's so sad uh hold on I'm
10:22 - downloading some things that I want to
10:24 - hopefully show you
10:27 - um let's see if I got them
10:30 - um I have been working on a couple big
10:31 - projects
10:33 - one is actually complete and the other
10:36 - is on its way to being complete
10:38 - so I feel like I need to get those
10:40 - projects behind me and then I can return
10:42 - maybe back to more of the rhythm again
10:45 - of
10:46 - small coding Challenge videos and other
10:48 - tutorials I don't know I haven't been
10:50 - able to keep up but I thank you I I
10:52 - wanted to live stream because I need to
10:55 - talk about these projects that I'm
10:56 - working on check in with you folks and
10:58 - say hello to the YouTube community
11:01 - and that kind of stuff so
11:05 - um
11:06 - when my hand covered the mic
11:08 - the echo went with it ah Keith signed up
11:12 - as a lifetime nebula member well thank
11:15 - you for that support that's actually the
11:17 - first item on my agenda so let's talk
11:19 - about something that is coming out now
11:21 - that is out right now
11:24 - that you can watch on the stream
11:25 - platform called nebula but we'll be
11:28 - coming out in a week so let's see if
11:30 - these downloaded
11:31 - uh
11:34 - uh let's see if this works all right I'm
11:37 - gonna go over to here
11:40 - and
11:44 - oh my God he's gonna eat me
11:48 - uh this is a little teaser of a project
11:50 - I've been working on
11:53 - let's see uh now let's just see if the
11:55 - audio goes through so I'm going to mute
11:57 - my microphone
12:03 - the audio does not go through so here in
12:06 - real time let's I use this piece of
12:08 - software called loopback uh which this
12:10 - should do it if I turn that on I believe
12:13 - now
12:14 - to learn program yes okay
12:17 - here's a great thing that's going to
12:19 - happen right now because I'm a complete
12:20 - mess and disorganized I'm going to play
12:22 - you a little teaser video about my next
12:27 - YouTube video that's coming out that is
12:29 - over five hours long
12:31 - and I'm gonna talk about how you can
12:32 - watch it today right now if you want or
12:34 - you can wait till October 1st when we'll
12:36 - be on YouTube let's see all right so I
12:38 - need to get rid of myself although it'll
12:39 - be funny for me to uh so let's see I
12:42 - think if I uh get rid of myself over
12:44 - here
12:46 - I have a button for that don't I uh
12:49 - should say laptop here there I did it
12:51 - okay oh you can still hear me uh I saw
12:54 - this big like red thing happen hold on
12:58 - all right everything seems fine okay so
13:00 - let's see let's see if I can make this
13:02 - happen
13:10 - this is a disaster
13:13 - wait I don't want to be playing picture
13:15 - in picture what is going on okay
13:17 - full screen view I can't use a computer
13:20 - here we go
13:23 - you have no idea what it means to
13:26 - program
13:27 - have you ever wanted to learn
13:30 - programming do you have no idea what it
13:33 - means to program do you want to break
13:36 - free from the bonds of the tools that
13:38 - other people have made for you and learn
13:40 - to build your own software to make
13:43 - things with code one way that you can
13:45 - learn how to program not the only way
13:47 - not the only way you can or should but
13:49 - it's my favorite way and that's with
13:50 - something called processing I've divided
13:53 - it into different chapters organized
13:55 - with a table of contents it's a bunch of
13:58 - lessons all sequenced teaching you the
14:00 - fundamentals of computer science and
14:02 - programming with processing and at the
14:04 - end everything culminates with the mini
14:06 - project that I'll show you how to build
14:08 - that synthesizes all of the concepts
14:10 - from the series I can't wait to see what
14:13 - you learn what you make and what you
14:14 - think of this series
14:17 - um
14:38 - this is all going wrong
14:41 - okay
14:45 - okay let's try it let's so all right so
14:48 - what was that
14:49 - was a little teaser video about my new
14:52 - processing course so one of the things
14:54 - that I have always done for many years
14:55 - is uh teach beginners how to code so
14:58 - I've done that in all sorts of contexts
15:01 - um and I have a lot of video tutorials
15:04 - on this channel that start from no
15:06 - experience and hopefully build up so the
15:09 - original first videos I made and I'm
15:11 - going to show you some clips of them in
15:13 - from um that I made them I think in like
15:16 - 2012 or with a piece of software called
15:18 - processing and I have redone them all
15:21 - and let me show you a little clip about
15:24 - uh showing you a little difference
15:26 - between then and now
15:29 - wish I planned this better okay uh here
15:32 - let's see let's see if this works
15:44 - so I really was just asking myself the
15:46 - question should I remake those videos
15:48 - the quality wasn't so great although I
15:50 - did look much younger over 10 years ago
15:53 - but enough time has passed a lot has
15:56 - changed in the landscape of tools for
15:58 - learning to code processing most
16:00 - recently came out with version 4 which
16:03 - has many new and exciting features so I
16:05 - figure why not let's just do it all
16:08 - again
16:14 - okay so
16:17 - um you can see this is basically these
16:19 - are oh don't don't I don't want to hear
16:21 - the volume the the I want to scrub
16:22 - through this now just so I can talk
16:24 - about it let's turn the sound off
16:27 - so I can't believe this this is nuts
16:30 - this is me and I I don't actually know
16:32 - the exact date of this I'm pretty sure
16:33 - it was around 2012 drawing our Cartesian
16:37 - plane and explaining the x and y axis
16:41 - and how to draw shapes in a canvas in
16:45 - processing and now here I am doing it
16:47 - again and so I'm hoping that this new
16:51 - version of these tutorials I've learned
16:54 - a lot in the years since
16:56 - um it's a bit more streamlined it has a
16:57 - whole set of new examples and you might
16:59 - be wondering how can you watch it now
17:01 - how can you support this work that I'm
17:03 - doing
17:04 - um
17:05 - and I don't know if anybody who's
17:07 - actually watching this live stream
17:08 - happens to be a beginner or haven't
17:10 - learned to code before doesn't know what
17:12 - processing is is the actual target
17:14 - audience of this thing that I've made
17:16 - unlikely I would say but you might be
17:19 - people who know somebody who might want
17:21 - to learn to code that you might be able
17:22 - to recommend it to so let me talk about
17:24 - how you're going to find out more about
17:26 - this right now yeah okay I've got to go
17:29 - to a web browser here computer is not at
17:32 - all set up for this
17:36 - uh
17:38 - and let me
17:40 - make this chat window a little bit
17:42 - bigger so I can see I don't know if
17:43 - anybody is in the members Discord chat
17:46 - well I got it I got it I got it Chrome I
17:48 - understand what's going on here so let's
17:50 - go to uh github.com codingtrain
17:54 - um and let's take a look to see if we
17:56 - can find what I'm looking for
17:59 - uh all right so let's look for oh I
18:03 - should pin this one but I'm just going
18:05 - to go to it here so this is the GitHub
18:09 - repo for the creative coding processing
18:12 - full course and I have to give a big
18:13 - shout out to Melissa Rodriguez who did I
18:17 - call her uh producer researcher
18:21 - organizer reminder amazing amazing
18:25 - person uh creative coding uh artist who
18:28 - helped me organize and create a lot of
18:30 - these code examples and a lot of the
18:32 - materials that are in the course itself
18:34 - you can see the outline uh here in this
18:37 - page of the full thing with some time
18:39 - codes so uh there's a there's a
18:42 - introduction that I start with where I
18:44 - talk a bit about my history and the
18:45 - history of processing and you can see
18:47 - all the various things that I'm showing
18:50 - are all linked here on this page as well
18:53 - um then the uh video opens with teaching
18:57 - about how to learn to draw with code and
19:01 - the various reference Pages the
19:03 - different examples I'm going to run
19:05 - through a bunch of these right now I
19:06 - look at program flow I look at variables
19:10 - conditionals Loops arrays functions
19:15 - classes and objects at the four hour
19:17 - mark
19:18 - and then at the end I essentially do a
19:22 - little mini coding challenge at the end
19:23 - to build this confetti project a little
19:26 - bit of a conclusion with other resources
19:28 - and references for things that you might
19:31 - go further and node head in the chat
19:33 - appropriately says ew Java and I say
19:39 - Java I actually I I I don't know how
19:42 - strange this is but I do really enjoy
19:44 - the Java programming language
19:46 - um one of the one of the things about
19:48 - processing though is even with all the
19:50 - quirks and difficulties of the Java
19:52 - programming language itself processing
19:54 - is this wonderful environment and
19:56 - ecosystem that hides obscures a lot of
19:59 - the painful parts of java and allows you
20:01 - really to creatively make stuff with
20:04 - code so I'm gonna I'm gonna pull up a
20:06 - bunch of these examples but um what I'll
20:09 - mention here right now is uh so one hey
20:13 - this is coming it will be out on October
20:16 - 1st on the channel the YouTube channel
20:18 - it um but and you can see here's Melissa
20:21 - who's uh just a shout out Melissa who
20:23 - did all this work
20:24 - um but uh one of the ways that I am
20:27 - funding this project and this work is
20:30 - through
20:31 - um uh releasing it early on nebula so
20:35 - there uh last time I did a live stream I
20:37 - talked about different ways that people
20:38 - can support the coding train through
20:39 - YouTube memberships and GitHub
20:40 - sponsorship and that and the like but um
20:43 - uh currently I am part of this wonderful
20:47 - streaming service called nebula if you
20:49 - go to
20:50 - go.nebula.tv codingtrain
20:55 - um this uh oh look and my new header
20:57 - image which is something I'm going to
20:58 - talk about here the new logo
21:00 - um this is a uh this is the link that
21:04 - you want to look for
21:06 - um and the video is currently on the
21:09 - processing course is currently on nebula
21:11 - right now uh if you click here you're
21:13 - gonna it's gonna take me to what the
21:15 - different options are so this is a
21:17 - little bit of an odd thing this is a
21:19 - special promotion only for September
21:22 - so you can actually buy a lifetime
21:25 - membership to nebula you might be
21:26 - wondering like what the heck what so a
21:28 - couple people left this comment for me
21:30 - which was oh I don't want another
21:32 - service I have to subscribe to I just
21:34 - want to buy the class well guess what
21:36 - essentially this is your way of buying
21:39 - the class uh I mean you can also watch
21:41 - it for free when it comes out on YouTube
21:42 - but um what um this is uh this is this
21:47 - is a one-time only payment you never
21:48 - have to think about the subscription
21:49 - service again you just have it forever
21:51 - one of the reasons why I really love
21:53 - nebula is because it is a incredibly
21:57 - incredible curated collection of
22:00 - YouTubers that I regularly watch and a
22:03 - lot of them have exclusive and original
22:05 - content that is on nebula itself let me
22:08 - see if I can pull up the
22:12 - um
22:13 - some of the originals here so if I go to
22:16 - nebula.tv just go to here and if I go to
22:19 - videos ah yes so and then I go to
22:22 - Originals let's take a look so this is
22:24 - what I'm most impressed with about
22:26 - nebula
22:28 - um these original projects
22:30 - um for example I mean video SAS like
22:33 - Lindsay Ellis or on you on our nebula
22:36 - I'm trying to look there was this
22:37 - project called the prince that was
22:38 - amazing oh I love these uh City
22:42 - beautiful videos
22:44 - are really fantastic so if you like
22:47 - eposvox has an original I really would
22:50 - like to make one of these I don't know
22:52 - what it should be I'm open to your ideas
22:55 - but um there are also uh these wonderful
22:59 - classes that are on nebula that are
23:01 - exclusive to the platform we can kind of
23:04 - like scroll through oh turn data into
23:07 - stories I need to watch that one I have
23:09 - one of these I don't think I'll pop out
23:10 - up here if you're interested in music
23:13 - in all sorts of other kinds of topics
23:16 - especially about video production and
23:18 - animation there's a lot of really great
23:20 - stuff on here
23:21 - uh Patrick Williams I'm a big fan of has
23:25 - a wonderful course how to make a movie I
23:27 - need to wear a beret more in mind so
23:30 - anyway so nebula is this great platform
23:32 - um the uh the you can read about I would
23:36 - suggest you read this post from the CEO
23:39 - about uh lifetime memberships
23:43 - um the sort of reason for this program
23:45 - it is a way for the platform to increase
23:50 - the budget of nebula originals and it is
23:54 - also so um by the way you know it's all
23:57 - explicitly outlined here about one-third
23:59 - of the money goes to the Creator whose
24:00 - code you used
24:02 - um and more about
24:04 - um the the originals and different
24:05 - things that the streaming platform is
24:07 - trying to work on improving so all of
24:10 - that is to say that uh if you are
24:13 - interested in supporting the coding
24:15 - train if you want to watch my new course
24:17 - right now before it comes to YouTube you
24:20 - can go to this URL I pin I I don't think
24:23 - I pinned it but go.net I'll pin it in
24:25 - the chat
24:27 - go.nebula.tv codingtrain you can sign up
24:30 - for a monthly subscription an annual
24:31 - subscription or a lifetime one to be
24:34 - clear the lifetime subscription is not
24:37 - your best value right if you're looking
24:40 - for the best value that would be just
24:42 - buying an annual subscription and of
24:44 - course a monthly one is a nice thing to
24:46 - do if you just want to sort of try it
24:47 - for a month and see but the lifetime
24:49 - subscription is the best way to support
24:52 - the nebula platform and independent
24:54 - create outside of you know the ad
24:57 - supported model that is YouTube and me
25:00 - in particular so anyway I didn't mean to
25:02 - belabor that so much that's kind of one
25:04 - of the main reasons I'm doing a live
25:06 - stream today I'm starting to make turn
25:07 - this into what is essentially an ad but
25:09 - I've worked well I I think I started
25:12 - this new processing course
25:14 - uh in January of 2023 so I think I'm
25:18 - about eight months it took me about
25:19 - eight months to finish it in terms of
25:20 - all the recording compiling all the
25:22 - examples all the post-production so I'm
25:25 - very excited for it to finally be on
25:27 - YouTube and see how uh what new audience
25:31 - might find it what people might create
25:32 - through code with it
25:34 - um but I wanted to make sure I took the
25:36 - time to tell the core audience here in
25:38 - the live stream about how it is
25:40 - available right now on nebula and how
25:43 - you can sign up today and go and watch
25:46 - it great if you have questions about
25:48 - that I'm happy to take them into the
25:50 - chat I think I will move from
25:53 - uh focusing on the this to show you a
25:56 - little bit more about what's in the
25:58 - course
25:59 - all right so couple things that let's
26:01 - let's take a look at so one is let's
26:03 - download uh let's clone this repo
26:06 - let's see here again I have no idea I
26:09 - haven't like used this computer anytime
26:11 - recently it's like remind me later for
26:13 - all these updates let's just clone this
26:16 - to the desktop
26:18 - um
26:19 - if you're if you're a new uh to get and
26:23 - GitHub and all these things I might
26:24 - suggest just if you want to try out all
26:26 - these examples just downloading the zip
26:28 - file
26:30 - uh
26:31 - uh and but I'm gonna do it this way and
26:34 - now I can uh find the folder hopefully
26:36 - on my desktop
26:39 - and go here whoops that's not the right
26:41 - place I want to go to I'm going to go
26:43 - here okay so this by the way for if and
26:47 - when you decide you want to watch the
26:50 - course and code along with it every
26:53 - there there's essentially 10 chapters I
26:54 - wish I had my learning processing book
26:56 - but
26:58 - just to tell you just to complete the
27:01 - full story about this
27:03 - I have this book whoa 9.99 look at that
27:07 - what a deal
27:08 - um so uh it the second edition which is
27:12 - uh published by elsevier I'm sure you
27:13 - could find this on wherever books are
27:15 - sold
27:16 - um but this is a book that the second
27:19 - edition came out in 2015 I believe the
27:23 - first edition was
27:25 - I want to say like 2008 so that's the
27:28 - first time I ever tried to tell the full
27:31 - story of learning the code with
27:32 - processing was through this book I did
27:35 - an updated version of it in 2015. I
27:38 - don't I never I don't think it makes
27:40 - sense right now to do another updated
27:42 - version of the print book but the video
27:44 - course the five hour video course is
27:46 - essentially this or at least maybe most
27:49 - of the book itself
27:50 - um so I'm mostly moving towards
27:52 - producing my educational content through
27:55 - video right now than writing although my
27:57 - other project I'm going to talk about
27:58 - nature of code is not that so that's
28:00 - kind of where a lot of this stems from
28:03 - so and you can essentially this outline
28:06 - with all these examples are the newest
28:09 - version of those learn to code examples
28:10 - with processing that I've made let's
28:12 - open up some of them to take a look so I
28:14 - don't know what what interests people
28:16 - uh Barney codes is in the chat everybody
28:20 - should check out Barney's YouTube
28:21 - channel 30 minute course on shaders
28:25 - yeah can't imagine how long it took a
28:27 - five hour course yeah well the funny
28:29 - thing is the original videos I made were
28:32 - just recorded extemporaneously like I
28:34 - just
28:35 - turned on the recording and talked and
28:38 - made some examples and hit stop and then
28:40 - uploaded them they took me the amount of
28:42 - time it took me to make the original
28:43 - videos was the amount of time it takes
28:45 - you to watch them I mean I'm not
28:47 - factoring in the mental preparation in
28:50 - years of learning this stuff before I
28:51 - just turned on the recording but this
28:54 - for better or worse this five hour
28:56 - course has is more somewhat more
29:00 - thoughtfully made it's still kind of me
29:02 - just talking but it's edited so it moves
29:05 - a bit faster there's uh some
29:07 - post-production so additional examples
29:08 - and reference materials are just kind of
29:11 - shown next to me that I didn't have at
29:13 - the moment of recording so I'd be
29:15 - curious I don't know how to a B test
29:17 - this properly but have somebody watch
29:19 - the original ones have somebody watch
29:21 - the new ones what's their experience uh
29:23 - which one's better which one's worse
29:25 - okay
29:26 - um
29:27 - so let's just look I don't know let's
29:29 - look at some of these examples here
29:31 - let's see what's in there let's look at
29:32 - drawing and let's look at a spaceship
29:36 - color
29:37 - I don't know what this one is whoa that
29:39 - is some big oh that's just because I
29:40 - zoomed in so you can see by the way one
29:42 - of the things is I just noticed I
29:44 - remembered I should probably take these
29:45 - out a lot of the examples will have this
29:47 - line of code that says pixel density 2
29:50 - in it that is a way of rendering what is
29:53 - essentially double
29:55 - quadruple it's four pixels for every one
29:58 - because it's a anyway for like high for
30:01 - high density displays like a Mac retina
30:05 - or other high density uh uh displays the
30:09 - actual pixel dimensions versus the
30:11 - number of pixels that are being shoved
30:12 - into your eyes it's different and I for
30:15 - capturing them I wanted to have the
30:17 - extra density of pixels the extra
30:19 - resolution but for right now that
30:20 - actually shouldn't be in there let's
30:21 - take a look at this spaceship
30:23 - so yes
30:25 - there it is if you want to learn to make
30:27 - spaceships like this
30:28 - that is though that's where the course
30:30 - starts in terms of drawing stuff with
30:33 - code
30:34 - moving along
30:36 - um it moves from there to looking at
30:38 - animation animation oh you know what I
30:41 - just realized
30:44 - I think I don't know if this is true no
30:48 - this can't be true is it true that it's
30:50 - the extra examples that are in here but
30:52 - the actual examples are not I have to
30:54 - double check to make sure I have all the
30:56 - materials here so but you can start you
30:59 - could see these are all these I'm just
31:00 - going to skip ahead and the and go to
31:01 - the end and look at the very last
31:04 - example
31:06 - that you learn if you want to learn like
31:08 - what brings everything together at the
31:10 - very very end of the video uh it is
31:13 - making amazing uh confetti explode with
31:17 - color and rotate and spin in beautiful
31:20 - ways I actually don't cover translate
31:22 - and rotate specifically in the course
31:24 - but that's a add-on towards the end
31:27 - there but sort of building up to this
31:30 - idea of object-oriented programming and
31:32 - how to create a system out of code so
31:35 - that's the full course I encourage you
31:38 - to take a look at the examples I'm going
31:40 - to double check to make sure everything
31:41 - is there
31:43 - and check out the GitHub repo which has
31:48 - all of the information if you want to
31:50 - watch it now you can
31:53 - um
31:54 - find the link here to nebula now
31:57 - uh one thing that I do want to say is
32:00 - also in addition I have at the moment
32:03 - this
32:04 - um Reddit post so if you want to add you
32:07 - could obviously join the coding trade
32:09 - Discord
32:10 - um but if you want to uh chat or ask
32:12 - questions
32:14 - um this Reddit thread uh as part of the
32:17 - um nebulous subreddit is where you can
32:19 - do that I would encourage you to come
32:21 - and say hello in there because it's
32:23 - another place to say hello I'm following
32:25 - this very closely because oh I forgot
32:28 - why the most important thing this is
32:30 - here's an important reason why I need
32:32 - some people to watch the thing on nebula
32:34 - so one of the wonderful things about the
32:38 - nebula platform being owned and operated
32:40 - essentially by a collect a group of
32:43 - creators is they have a lot of agency in
32:45 - terms of the platform and if there's a
32:47 - mistake in a video I can correct it and
32:48 - re-upload the file but that is not
32:50 - something that I can easily do on
32:52 - YouTube well it's not something you can
32:53 - do it all on YouTube so one of the
32:55 - reasons also for having this pre-release
32:58 - on the nebula platform is that I could
33:01 - get a little feedback if there are any
33:02 - mistakes or things that I want to tweak
33:03 - or fix before the final version comes
33:07 - out
33:08 - um I would love to hear so to be honest
33:10 - now I haven't gotten one single which
33:13 - correction which could mean that the
33:15 - whole thing is just perfect but I'm
33:16 - guessing
33:18 - um maybe people just don't know that
33:19 - they could tell me or that not that many
33:21 - people have seen it yet but I've got
33:22 - about a week left before I plan to
33:26 - release it on YouTube and that is kind
33:28 - of you know once once I have errors or
33:30 - things I need to fix they just will
33:31 - essentially go in the description so if
33:33 - you are interested and able to and end
33:37 - up watching this on nebula and you
33:40 - notice anything please reach out to me
33:42 - the Reddit post uh social media
33:46 - the coding train Discord all of those
33:48 - places you can go to speaking of which
33:50 - let me just make sure
33:53 - I'm just going to take a peek into the
33:55 - coding train Discord here to see if
33:57 - there are any important messages I am
34:00 - now
34:00 - monitoring the chat that has Simon in it
34:03 - the sound is found oh the train
34:05 - whistle's in the intro that's what's
34:07 - loud
34:08 - and uh yeah I'm monitoring the Discord
34:11 - chat now uh to uh to for the members who
34:14 - are there in that as well okay so let me
34:17 - see if I can keep that open and the
34:20 - YouTube chat
34:22 - um have both of them
34:24 - oh it's so hard to manage so many
34:27 - screens
34:29 - uh minimizing some things don't worry
34:31 - any minute now oh my God are you serious
34:34 - okay great okay this is good this is
34:36 - good I'm good now I'm good now
34:41 - all right what else ah one more thing
34:44 - about this
34:46 - let's go to thecodingtrain.com
34:51 - let's take a look at oh well actually
34:53 - let's go to the GitHub so
34:56 - this is the coding Train website if you
34:58 - haven't seen it before now you see it
35:02 - I'm gonna go over to
35:05 - uh the coding train GitHub I'm gonna and
35:08 - this is I'm gonna look at the pull
35:10 - requests and boy there's a lot of
35:12 - submissions here that I need to take a
35:13 - look at and merge
35:15 - um which maybe I could do some of that
35:16 - today but let's look at this one for a
35:19 - second let's see if the preview is still
35:20 - built great
35:22 - so when the video is on YouTube
35:27 - um
35:29 - here on this page you will also find it
35:33 - here so every
35:36 - um video well not everybody most of the
35:38 - videos that are on the channel have an
35:40 - Associated page on the codingtrain
35:43 - website with all of the relevant
35:45 - metadata for that video looking for a
35:47 - code example looking for a link to
35:49 - something I reference in the video it's
35:51 - all here did you make a project that
35:53 - you're excited about related to a video
35:55 - I made there's a passenger showcase a
35:57 - place for you to submit that I have
35:59 - talked about that many times on many
36:02 - streams I could again now and maybe I
36:04 - will but that's not why I'm here
36:06 - one of the things that I also that I
36:08 - have on the site are what's known as
36:11 - tracks a track is essentially a sequence
36:13 - course probably what I had typically
36:16 - Point people towards when they are first
36:19 - learning creative coding would be this
36:21 - track code programming with p5.js you'll
36:24 - notice it has track stops those are the
36:27 - individual videos
36:30 - um that some of these are really quite
36:32 - old for each of the different concepts
36:34 - that then have you know the code in them
36:37 - a description maybe a um a showcase
36:40 - project
36:41 - so this particular processing course
36:44 - this new track
36:46 - if I can get back to the tracks is
36:49 - different
36:50 - in that it is one single video it's not
36:54 - there yet doesn't exist on YouTube yet
36:55 - so this is very much of a placeholder
36:58 - the website was not designed with this
37:01 - in mind the website was designed with
37:03 - the idea of the courses being sequence
37:06 - tutorials and also for those of you who
37:09 - might be more familiar with my
37:10 - challenges uh this sort of collection of
37:12 - these independent specific project
37:15 - videos that you can go and watch and
37:18 - enjoy and create your own versions of
37:19 - whenever you might like to so at the
37:22 - moment thank you to um
37:25 - uh
37:26 - uh uh dipom sen who I know is probably
37:29 - sleeping right now because it is at the
37:31 - middle of the night in their time zone
37:33 - but created a sort of Band-Aid version
37:37 - of a track page for this single video
37:40 - which will just time code the various
37:43 - sections and
37:45 - um and include the metadata here so I
37:47 - haven't figured out the best way to
37:48 - organize that but um
37:51 - when if and when you watch this course
37:54 - and if you make something from watching
37:57 - it you will be able to submit it here to
37:59 - the passenger showcase so I wanted to
38:01 - highlight that I want to encourage
38:02 - anybody to plan to do that
38:07 - um yeah so var19 makes a sort of funny
38:10 - joke there in the chat saying ah yes
38:12 - uh did I pin this already oh I did pin
38:15 - it okay paid beta testing that's great
38:17 - oh wait the testers are the ones paying
38:20 - I know I know I know I know so here's
38:23 - the thing
38:23 - if you really feel like you want to
38:26 - watch it to see if I have any errors and
38:29 - it's not accessible to you because of
38:31 - the way I'm releasing it on nebula just
38:33 - come on to the coding train Discord say
38:35 - at schiffman tag me with this uh request
38:38 - I will think about a way to see if I can
38:41 - figure out a way for you to be able to
38:43 - help watch it and provide any feedback
38:45 - so I by no means am I hoping to lock
38:48 - people out of this process
38:51 - um just it's the way that I'm have set
38:53 - things up to go okay
38:55 - yes Oktoberfest
38:59 - as chat is reminding me all right so I
39:01 - think I have now said everything that I
39:04 - need to say about the new processing
39:07 - course that's come that's already out on
39:10 - nebula pinned chat message you want to
39:12 - watch it right now and we'll be out on
39:15 - YouTube soon enough uh soon so I think
39:19 - I've any other questions about that
39:20 - please uh say them in the chat and maybe
39:23 - I will see them or join the coding train
39:25 - Discord uh which you can just go to
39:27 - thecodingtrade.com Discord it'll take
39:30 - you right into it and you can tag me in
39:32 - there I've been a bit more active in
39:35 - some of the in in the channels there the
39:36 - last couple weeks trying to answer
39:37 - people's questions
39:39 - okay
39:41 - um I fear that I have a new mention
39:42 - already
39:44 - um so I will take a look at that after I
39:47 - finish with this live stream which by
39:49 - the way I'm not going to be here that
39:50 - long this was kind of just like a check
39:52 - in say hello and announce and update you
39:55 - on some projects
39:57 - all right what else do I need to talk
39:59 - about I made an agenda and I put it in
40:02 - the description of this video and
40:04 - nowhere right now do I have the
40:06 - description of this video available for
40:09 - me to look at so I'm gonna just remember
40:11 - things that I want to talk about and
40:13 - then you will look at it maybe and
40:15 - remind me in the chat
40:17 - um it's not about current theme but do
40:18 - you plan to release new coding
40:20 - challenges yes
40:22 - is yes yes yes and yes uh is processing
40:26 - just for learning
40:29 - um processing is not just for learning
40:31 - processing is an incredible platform
40:33 - that you can use for Learning and
40:36 - uh also build uh projects on from a
40:39 - variety of different you know for a
40:41 - variety of different contexts and scales
40:42 - uh and many uh artists use it many
40:46 - creative agencies use it many schools
40:48 - use it and you can also work with its
40:52 - sibling project p5.js which is a
40:57 - creative coding library for JavaScript
40:59 - which would allow you to run things like
41:02 - you might do in processing right in the
41:03 - browser
41:05 - um so in terms of the um
41:08 - uh thanks for the agenda Matthew nature
41:11 - of code updates Oktoberfest new logo
41:13 - great okay
41:15 - um I think I remembered all those things
41:16 - in terms of the challenges I've got to
41:18 - get back into the rhythm of doing them
41:20 - again and I have a list of things to get
41:22 - to I just it's like the walls are
41:24 - closing in on me these days with the
41:26 - various things that I'm working on and
41:28 - the very very busy teaching semester
41:30 - this semester so I'm struggling to find
41:32 - the time to dedicate to the coding train
41:34 - that I have in the past and that I want
41:36 - to but the coding challenge is not the
41:38 - coding challenges is a
41:40 - lifetime project that I hope to get more
41:43 - going with that I have yet to complete
41:45 - so stay tuned all right where should I
41:48 - go next
41:49 - let's talk about
41:52 - uh some quick okay so I'm going to write
41:54 - this list down I want to talk about
41:55 - nature of code
41:57 - where I am with that project I want to
41:59 - talk about hacktoberfest
42:02 - which is coming up
42:04 - and that relates to the showcases and
42:06 - maybe we'll look at some showcase
42:07 - projects and then I want to talk about
42:09 - the coding train logo and ways that you
42:14 - can make your own variations of it
42:17 - okay
42:20 - um
42:23 - I know anybody anybody out there feel
42:25 - like they want to hear about one of
42:26 - those topics first let's go check in on
42:29 - the nature of code
42:31 - um
42:34 - all right so
42:37 - speaking of projects that I've been
42:38 - working on for well over 10 years
42:41 - the nature of code book is one of them
42:44 - and I know that I'm about to repeat some
42:46 - things that I've done on previous live
42:48 - streams but I can really tell from this
42:49 - chat
42:51 - uh that there's a lot of new names here
42:53 - so let's let's let's let's recap in a
42:56 - sort of hopefully a succinct and
42:58 - efficient way
43:00 - if you knew nothing and just happened to
43:02 - search for nature of code this is
43:04 - probably where you would end up
43:06 - this is the website for the version of
43:09 - the book that was published to be using
43:11 - this year a lot in 2012.
43:14 - you could actually click and buy the
43:16 - print version please do not do that you
43:19 - could also uh click here uh you you know
43:22 - you could also slide these down to zero
43:24 - and click here to download uh bundle
43:27 - which includes PDF ePub and Kindle
43:31 - formats the Epub and Kindle formats if
43:33 - I'm being honest I didn't do such a
43:35 - great job with them they're kind of
43:37 - they're kind of so the PDF though I can
43:39 - stand behind but all of this
43:40 - is old and you shouldn't look at it I
43:43 - mean you can look at it I'm sorry
43:44 - there's there's there's something there
43:46 - that's still meaningful because it is a
43:49 - doc it is a thing
43:51 - that came out in the world in 2012
43:53 - that's important to
43:55 - look back on and think about
43:58 - but if you are looking for the latest
44:00 - and most up-to-date
44:02 - version of this the ideas that started
44:05 - in this particular book then this is not
44:08 - the place for you the place for you on
44:11 - some level is this and I'm going to at
44:13 - the moment actually just trigger a quick
44:17 - uh GitHub action
44:23 - where do I run this
44:27 - did the interface change
44:29 - or is it just because it's not there
44:32 - what's going on here where's the button
44:35 - for running the action oh I'm not signed
44:37 - in I'm like what's going on here it's
44:39 - because I'm not signed in okay sorry
44:40 - everybody oh
44:42 - speaking of being unprepared
44:46 - at least the password is kind of saved
44:48 - in there I'm gonna have to two factor in
44:50 - though give me a moment here Talk
44:52 - Amongst yourselves
44:54 - I am reading the comments while I can
44:57 - steal away a moment
44:59 - [Music]
45:01 - I don't really care that you're seeing
45:02 - this right now it will expire before you
45:04 - can hack into my account okay
45:06 - let's go to the actions this takes a
45:09 - little while so that's why I wanted to
45:10 - run this run workflow run workflow okay
45:15 - so this is the repo for the new version
45:19 - of the book now
45:21 - this is actually
45:23 - your
45:25 - um
45:26 - the the sorry the build system for the
45:28 - new version of the book the content of
45:30 - the book is actually in this repo but
45:32 - where the content is being worked on is
45:35 - not in this repo it's actually being
45:37 - worked on in a collection of notion
45:39 - documents and what I just did there very
45:42 - quickly was I ran this GitHub action
45:45 - which connects to the notion API by the
45:48 - way I'd really love to do a whole video
45:51 - it often likes to time out so let's try
45:54 - running it again this is going it's
45:57 - going remarkably well uh it is
46:02 - um it is an action that uses the notion
46:05 - API to go and collect all of the
46:08 - material that I've written
46:10 - reformat repackage it and bring it into
46:13 - this repo so that it can then be built
46:16 - and published to a website
46:21 - I wonder if there's actually uh it often
46:24 - times out but I wonder if there's
46:26 - something else going on no request a
46:28 - notion API failed
46:30 - with status 502 does anybody know what
46:32 - 502 is notion client maybe then is the
46:36 - API just down
46:39 - that's probably rerunning the job
46:42 - I'm gonna try it one more time
46:44 - this is something I will certainly look
46:46 - at later on my own time figure out why
46:48 - this isn't working so
46:50 - that process would bring in all of the
46:55 - written content
46:56 - to these HTML files it brings in all of
47:00 - the code examples to these uh other
47:04 - collections of JavaScript and HTML files
47:08 - and it also brings in
47:11 - all of these images which are all of
47:14 - these uh screenshots and various
47:16 - illustrations and things that are in
47:18 - notion and then all of that goes to
47:23 - if I go back here
47:26 - bad Gateway server error response
47:28 - server-wise get received an invalid
47:30 - response from the Upstream server so to
47:32 - look and see what that is that's what
47:34 - error 502 is someone's telling me in the
47:35 - chat to here
47:37 - uh this does this actually go somewhere
47:40 - it does now excellent okay so here is
47:42 - the most recent version of the book in
47:45 - progress why my desk is really quite
47:46 - high today
47:48 - um
47:49 - and my green screen is all a mess but
47:51 - whatever I'm just I'm doing my best here
47:53 - my best is quite inadequate these days
47:56 - on so many levels just trying all that I
47:59 - can do and uh so this is what you should
48:01 - look at now
48:02 - uh what's exciting about where I am with
48:05 - the project is all of the chapters have
48:07 - been drafted even if I go here into whoa
48:13 - this is a I have a formatting error
48:15 - that's fine though uh even if I go to
48:17 - this very last chapter it is now written
48:19 - the thing about it is there's a lot of
48:21 - placeholder stuff in here uh the
48:23 - illustrations aren't finished this is
48:25 - what they ask you to look for you can
48:27 - see there's some sort of like notes in
48:28 - there like what do you think about
48:29 - having uh what do you think about having
48:31 - a little illustration here so
48:33 - um just be aware this is an in-progress
48:36 - draft but you can read it now if you
48:38 - notice things that are wrong mistakes
48:40 - you can file them as issues in the
48:42 - GitHub repo and if you want to support
48:45 - this project there are a few things you
48:48 - can do
48:49 - one is you could go to this sponsor
48:51 - button right here and you can sponsor uh
48:54 - the coding terrain through uh you know
48:57 - GitHub sponsorship patreon uh YouTube
49:00 - membership and also here's the nebula
49:02 - link
49:03 - and then
49:05 - um you can also
49:09 - um pre-order the physical book
49:11 - so I think right here if I click on this
49:14 - link
49:15 - um again the book will be Creative
49:17 - Commons licensed and available for free
49:19 - online but if you want to have the
49:22 - physical version
49:24 - um I'm I'm thrilled to be working with
49:27 - no starch press who will be work
49:28 - Printing and distributing all of that
49:30 - and you can pre-order it right now can
49:32 - you do the Halloween stream
49:35 - that is such a good idea no flap
49:39 - um I would love to do a Halloween stream
49:41 - I don't know how or when to do that but
49:45 - um I mean I should do it on Halloween
49:48 - I'm never going to remember this right
49:50 - now so let's uh people in the Discord
49:52 - and on the internet on social media just
49:54 - bug me around mid-october actually why
49:57 - don't you wait can you wait till after
49:59 - like October 16th or 17th maybe after
50:02 - October 20th wait till after October
50:04 - 20th and start bugging me about doing a
50:05 - Halloween stream okay good we got it yes
50:08 - okay deal uh you love the costume that
50:11 - was so long ago I used to do such silly
50:13 - things like that every okay so Richard
50:15 - Gill asks everything in P5 and thank you
50:18 - Richard Gill for supporting through
50:19 - membership everything in uh nature of
50:23 - code is it p5.js so correct this version
50:27 - of the book like if I just go to chapter
50:29 - two for example
50:30 - and start scrolling through let's
50:32 - actually go to like chapter seven
50:34 - because it's uh maybe a little more
50:35 - interesting to see something a little
50:36 - further in
50:38 - um there's like a weird bug here where
50:40 - these images are cut off I don't know
50:41 - what's going on there
50:43 - so many things are going wrong today but
50:45 - if I scroll down to where I get to
50:46 - finally one of the examples here it is
50:48 - so when I get to one of the examples
50:50 - this is an example oh this is the next
50:52 - coding challenge I'm going to do too
50:53 - which is the Wolfram Elementary CA what
50:56 - you'll notice in the book I'm obviously
50:58 - writing and describing about the
51:00 - concepts and how I'm writing the code
51:02 - then there is an embedded example that I
51:05 - can reset I can pause reset Etc
51:09 - um got a code snippet here and then I
51:11 - can click right here and it will open a
51:13 - new window and now I've got that code
51:15 - example right here in the P5 web editor
51:18 - if I want to experiment with it so yes
51:20 - the reason why I'm using the main reason
51:22 - I'm using p5.js for this iteration of
51:25 - the book is to be able to have all of
51:27 - the examples easily Run online embedded
51:30 - inside the book
51:31 - it is my intention it is my plan and I
51:34 - love that Robert Richard are just saying
51:36 - hello to each other in the chat what a
51:37 - wonderful thing it is my plan to Port
51:41 - all of the examples to processing as
51:43 - well most of them already are so I will
51:45 - be uh you know I gotta finish a lot of
51:47 - the details I need to get done but the
51:49 - idea like the materials that would be
51:52 - part of the book's materials would
51:53 - include processing and p5.js version of
51:56 - the examples and then I do expect people
51:58 - will report them to a lot of other
51:59 - environments as well I have a GitHub a
52:03 - document that's actually keeping track
52:04 - of a list of ton of ports that people
52:05 - have done over the years of the earlier
52:07 - verses of the examples
52:09 - okay
52:11 - um so
52:12 - um so yeah so that's what's happening
52:14 - with nature of code book uh I welcome
52:17 - your uh participation and enthusiasm and
52:21 - encouragement for this project in any
52:23 - way that you can stay tuned the things
52:26 - that I have left to do before it's
52:28 - really done
52:30 - I need to write the introduction the
52:32 - acknowledgments I'm just doing this is
52:33 - more for me right now uh there's going
52:35 - to be an appendix about how to draw make
52:37 - creatures thank you to Zana marshes
52:39 - doing all the illustrations for this
52:41 - it's gonna be appendix a couple of
52:43 - appendix in the book that I need to
52:45 - finish uh in collaboration with her
52:49 - um there's a lot of illustrations that
52:51 - haven't been finished
52:53 - got to finish the cover or think about
52:56 - the cover
52:57 - some stuff for the interior a lot of
52:59 - things there's a long to-do list
53:02 - uh I need to close all seven 75 of these
53:05 - issues
53:06 - so there's a lot of stuff uh that needs
53:09 - to be done but that's that's kind of
53:11 - where I am uh and and I would say this
53:13 - to me is the biggest roadblock right now
53:17 - to me really working on the coding train
53:21 - because
53:23 - this has to get done it's got a deadline
53:25 - I have commitments to it in terms of
53:28 - with the publisher and every free moment
53:31 - that I have that's not something that I
53:34 - am doing with my family or for my
53:36 - students at NYU usually that's where I
53:39 - would turn to the coding train and these
53:42 - days that's where I turn to the nature
53:43 - of code book
53:44 - so that's the way things are going right
53:46 - now
53:48 - um okay
53:51 - I talked about nature of code
53:53 - let's talk about hacktoberfest and maybe
53:57 - there's even something related to the
53:59 - coding trade logo that we could
54:01 - work into that so hacktoberfest what is
54:05 - it this is no
54:06 - uh let me let me take a look let's see
54:09 - there I I forget who runs it I think
54:11 - it's is it by GitHub itself is it okay
54:14 - so 10th year oh it's presented by
54:16 - digital ocean
54:18 - Ila and app right so I have no official
54:22 - um participation with uh I'm not I'm not
54:27 - a official representative of
54:28 - hacktoberfest
54:30 - uh I have no sponsorship relationship
54:32 - with them nothing like that I mention it
54:34 - because it's a nice initiative to bring
54:37 - people into open source
54:39 - and uh part of my mission with the code
54:42 - and train is to help people have a
54:45 - friendly place to be able to participate
54:48 - in open source as well
54:50 - um and so it's there's a nice alignment
54:52 - there and thank you Eric for your nice
54:54 - comments and I hope your second year of
54:56 - university is going well
54:59 - all right so what is hacktoberfest
55:03 - I don't actually know
55:05 - September is the perfect time to prepare
55:08 - for hectoberfest get a jump start by
55:10 - finding projects contribute to adding
55:11 - the Oktoberfest tag to your projects or
55:14 - familiar exercises yourself let's get
55:15 - okay so first of all
55:17 - step number one
55:18 - I don't have my bell which would be
55:20 - useful I do know where it is
55:23 - I'm walking over to get it right now
55:28 - I'm also going to bring bring my little
55:29 - time since clock by the way since my
55:32 - last live stream
55:35 - do you all want to know how many seconds
55:37 - have passed
55:38 - I know this is probably hard for you to
55:39 - see
55:40 - uh it has been
55:42 - 3 million
55:45 - 700 oh no no no
55:49 - oh no wait this is minutes hours I
55:52 - should know how this Clock Works anyway
55:53 - that's how much time has passed
55:55 - I love this project time since launch
55:57 - you should I I talked a lot about it my
55:59 - last live stream you can you can look
56:01 - that up okay I like to put it here so
56:03 - people can see it
56:06 - but then I have to raise the desk a
56:07 - little bit otherwise it doesn't show up
56:09 - and it's not going to show up anyway
56:12 - back here maybe
56:15 - focus focus shiftman okay
56:18 - get a jump start by finding projects to
56:20 - contribute to
56:22 - you found a project to contribute to the
56:24 - coding trade
56:26 - adding the hacktoberfest tag to your
56:29 - projects all right is that a thing I
56:31 - should do right
56:33 - am I supposed now I know there's some
56:35 - complicated discussion about this that
56:36 - we've had internally
56:38 - amongst the coding train team
56:43 - um
56:44 - Jennifer Nesbitt I do I do have a
56:47 - designer helping me on the cover but I'd
56:49 - love to hear from you about what ideas
56:51 - you might have and I'm open to
56:55 - um hearing more so please uh best way is
56:58 - to join the Discord you can send me a
57:00 - message there
57:02 - um
57:02 - [Applause]
57:03 - uh all right so first of all I'm just
57:05 - curious which is a quick peek and see
57:10 - if I go back to the nature of code repo
57:13 - did that thing go just curious if that
57:15 - action completed
57:19 - no so I'll have to investigate why the
57:22 - actions aren't working later but back to
57:24 - hacktoberfest
57:26 - so let's say
57:28 - let's take a look let's so so let's look
57:31 - at the coding train
57:34 - uh repos
57:37 - let's start let's start by making a new
57:44 - well I I'm trying I have about a half an
57:46 - hour I'm trying to think of what I want
57:48 - to do but
57:50 - these are this is the kind of all right
57:54 - can I please finish the sentence
57:55 - apparently not
58:00 - okay oh let me just check
58:04 - ah oh oh I'm getting act uh start
58:07 - bugging you my mailing okay okay okay
58:08 - all right by the way there's a wonderful
58:10 - question that I forgot to address
58:13 - uh by interoctave all in the Discord
58:16 - member chat so first of all members any
58:18 - disc any members people who have signed
58:20 - up through YouTube membership or patreon
58:22 - or GitHub sponsorship
58:25 - the stickers have all come in I have a
58:28 - whole new batch of coding train stickers
58:31 - with the new logo and some new stickers
58:33 - and there's a glow-in-the-dark sticker
58:35 - there's a holographic sticker the
58:37 - mailing for that is going to be going
58:38 - out
58:40 - beginning of October so stay tuned you
58:44 - you make sure you're in the Discord and
58:46 - you have the supporter role that way
58:49 - you'll get the message for how to get
58:50 - your stickers and if anybody's really
58:52 - interested in the stickers you know
58:54 - now's your time because I'm gonna be
58:55 - sending them out very soon once a year
58:57 - mailing it's our new thing okay now
59:02 - Oktoberfest oh the translation I want to
59:05 - address this because it's a wonderful
59:06 - question from interactive all
59:09 - I would very much like to have
59:10 - translations of the nature of code book
59:13 - I have to finish everything I have to do
59:15 - with it before that can start but I'm
59:18 - we're getting very close to there
59:20 - uh I don't remember what date I said to
59:22 - bothered me about a Halloween after
59:24 - October 20th that would be also a good
59:27 - time to bother me about the translations
59:29 - uh
59:30 - I got it I would think November 1st
59:33 - let's put it on November 1st start
59:35 - messaging me if you're interested in
59:37 - doing a translation in the nature of
59:39 - code book and
59:41 - um
59:42 - I what I will probably do is put you in
59:45 - touch with the publisher there's really
59:47 - two questions there uh one is can I get
59:50 - the website translated and have like a a
59:53 - a really easy system of doing that a
59:56 - night so that maybe you know in a
59:58 - fantasy world uh you know there might be
60:01 - a language button on this page here
60:03 - where I could just change it to for
60:06 - example Spanish and the website which
60:07 - only be in Spanish so that's a that's
60:09 - one aspect of this that is something
60:10 - that I have a lot of agency over in
60:14 - terms of translating for a print version
60:16 - of the book that will be something that
60:19 - um that no starch will uh the no search
60:21 - press will lead the process of and I
60:23 - know they're excited to do that so um in
60:25 - terms of partnering with translators and
60:27 - other Publishers and other countries
60:30 - um all of that I'm excited to work on
60:32 - but that will
60:34 - um that way so the stickers are not
60:36 - there's no really there is one place
60:39 - where you can buy some stickers for the
60:40 - coding train which is in the nebulous
60:43 - store I have a coding train page which
60:45 - has a sticker sheet there
60:47 - um but none of the new stickers are
60:49 - there the stickers are really something
60:50 - I send out as gifts for people who
60:52 - subscribe to some of the crowdfunding
60:55 - options for the site or I give to people
60:57 - in person when I go to an event or see
60:58 - them so if I happen to have them on the
61:00 - street with me
61:01 - on the street I can get I mean I often
61:03 - have stickers just my backpack so if I
61:05 - run into somebody else the hand of a
61:06 - sticker
61:07 - uh all right now so that was the that
61:11 - was about the translation oh did you see
61:13 - that
61:14 - my reflexes I still got it still got it
61:16 - okay
61:17 - uh all right now hacktoberfest
61:22 - so
61:24 - back to the coding train
61:26 - so any of these repos in my mind are
61:30 - fair game for Oktoberfest and they're
61:33 - all have varying degrees of being active
61:37 - actively being worked on versus an old
61:40 - thing that's just kind of languishing
61:42 - there and also you're you know in terms
61:45 - of documentation and request for actual
61:48 - help so if anybody sees a repo here that
61:51 - they want to ask about
61:53 - um let me know I've been doing some some
61:55 - new things I just started like for
61:57 - example
61:59 - um I you know this is brand new as of a
62:01 - few days ago I started like working with
62:03 - some experiments with the YouTube API
62:05 - um you can see some other things on here
62:08 - all everything's fair game as far as I'm
62:09 - concerned but I think probably the most
62:13 - important place
62:16 - for you to think about contributing
62:19 - would be here at the codenttrain.com
62:21 - website so
62:23 - uh hopefully there's a lot of wonderful
62:26 - people in the community who help to
62:28 - maintain the website
62:30 - um
62:31 - and you can and and maybe if we can uh
62:36 - do some work on this I'll try to add
62:39 - maybe some issues or some information as
62:42 - a guide somewhere to some suggested
62:44 - things you can work on but
62:47 - one of the nicest ways that you could if
62:50 - you're a total beginner to this world
62:52 - that you could do a pull request that's
62:55 - part of hacktoberfest would be by adding
62:58 - a project that you've made
63:01 - related to one of the videos that I've
63:03 - put out to the passenger showcase
63:07 - the passenger showcase
63:09 - as I may have mentioned is here
63:12 - this is part of the website where it's
63:15 - just essentially an infinite scroll of
63:18 - sorted by uh chronologically of projects
63:21 - people have contributed so number one
63:23 - this is a wonderful place for you to
63:25 - look for inspiration and see what other
63:27 - fellow Travelers in the coding train
63:29 - Community are making
63:31 - you can also do things like I noticed
63:34 - Kathy has made many many so uh oops that
63:37 - goes to
63:38 - how do I oh no I I thought we were gonna
63:40 - that's a feature we were going to add
63:42 - where you click on somebody's name and
63:43 - it takes you to all of their showcase
63:46 - projects but right now I can filter by
63:48 - somebody so if I filter by Kathy I can
63:51 - see all of Kathy's showpace projects on
63:54 - this page and essentially it is a you
63:57 - know portfolio page for any given if you
64:00 - want to have a little portfolio page of
64:01 - your peop your sketches and projects you
64:04 - could kind of use the coding trade
64:05 - website for that it's not really well
64:08 - suited for that there's other tools like
64:10 - open processing and all sorts of other
64:12 - you know build your own website things
64:13 - but on some level you can collect all of
64:15 - the things you've made related to coding
64:17 - trade videos onto one page
64:19 - so how do you do that
64:21 - the main way that people do that
64:23 - under the guides here you can find this
64:26 - passenger showcase guide so if I click
64:29 - on that
64:31 - um
64:32 - then here is a form so this forum allows
64:35 - you to first pick like oh what
64:38 - collection of videos did you just watch
64:40 - was it a coding challenge you never just
64:43 - watch it it's basically the way that the
64:45 - the system works is every project is
64:48 - associated with a video and I know it's
64:50 - sometimes tricky to figure out like does
64:52 - it make sense for this video or that
64:53 - video but you know we we just all use
64:55 - our best judgment and try to make it
64:56 - work the best we can so for example if
64:58 - you were watching a beginner's guide to
65:00 - machine learning you would find like oh
65:02 - here's all the videos here maybe I made
65:03 - a video that was used
65:06 - um
65:08 - you know object detection and so I'm
65:10 - gonna click on that and I'm gonna submit
65:12 - my project to there now most commonly
65:15 - people are making projects related to
65:17 - the coding challenges for example I
65:19 - think it's the 10 print I got 178 of
65:22 - them really slowed down
65:24 - uh the 10 print I don't know I don't
65:26 - know I think was it like 82 no that's a
65:29 - Chrome extension does anybody see it
65:30 - here
65:31 - and it doesn't matter I don't have to
65:32 - pick it here um I could just pick
65:34 - anything like double pendulum and then
65:36 - you can enter all your information so
65:38 - what this form does I'm getting the
65:40 - point here
65:42 - this form
65:44 - generates a pull request
65:47 - to
65:49 - the GitHub repository for the website
65:51 - however
65:53 - if you want to so if you want to get
65:56 - your project on the website this is your
65:58 - easiest path to doing it however if you
66:00 - want to participate in hacktoberfest you
66:04 - can actually do you can submit your
66:06 - project without this form through GitHub
66:10 - itself I want to show you a little bit
66:12 - about how to do that right now and that
66:15 - will then give you a hacktoberfest uh
66:18 - accepted pull request
66:19 - so let me see if I can walk you through
66:24 - a little bit about that right now so a
66:25 - couple things one is ah one is on this
66:28 - passenger showcase guide and this is a
66:30 - mental note to myself in the community
66:31 - we could probably improve this
66:34 - um
66:34 - you can also we have some instructions
66:37 - here for how to do that so the form will
66:39 - do this automatically but the manual way
66:42 - of creating the pull request for
66:43 - Oktoberfest is here below these
66:46 - instructions might need a little
66:48 - updating I'm not sure I'll have to take
66:49 - a look at that
66:51 - but let me show you a little bit about
66:53 - that right now
66:55 - and I'm just checking the
66:58 - uh checking the chat okay
67:01 - um all right so uh coming back to here
67:03 - so let's say the first thing so let's go
67:06 - let's pretend we're going to do 10 print
67:07 - and I'm looking at the time so I'm going
67:10 - to uh 10 print
67:14 - is I believe the coding challenge that
67:17 - has the most passenger showcase projects
67:20 - you can see them all here on this page
67:23 - that includes the video the code example
67:26 - other references an archive of the live
67:29 - stream where I actually originally did
67:30 - the challenge and things like that so
67:33 - you know if you're new to the coding
67:35 - train and you're wondering
67:37 - is there a lot of stuff I can go back
67:38 - and look at there's a lot there's a lot
67:40 - personally
67:40 - okay
67:42 - so if you wanted to submit to this of
67:44 - course you could use the form but if
67:46 - you're not using the form and you're
67:48 - participating in hacktoberfest what you
67:50 - would do is you need to find the video
67:51 - first so content
67:54 - is the place where all of the individual
67:58 - files directories for the videos and
68:01 - their Associated passenger showcases
68:02 - live so I'm going to click on content
68:05 - then I need to find ah then under videos
68:09 - is where I'm looking there's other in
68:11 - stuff here that's useful but videos is
68:13 - what we're looking for and here now is
68:16 - this becomes a little bit of detective
68:18 - work but it's pretty easy if you're
68:19 - doing a challenge so that the folder
68:21 - naming is a little wonky all the videos
68:23 - that are everywhere on the site but for
68:26 - the challenges it's not too hard I can
68:28 - just go here and I can see ah there is a
68:30 - directory for every single one so what
68:33 - was 10 print what number was 10 print
68:36 - 10 print was number 76.
68:40 - so back to here I'm going to go and find
68:43 - number 76
68:47 - scrolling around I've got it and we can
68:50 - see here okay so what is here on GitHub
68:53 - first and foremost just so you are aware
68:56 - there is the JS this individual Json
68:59 - page this is the metadata for the videos
69:01 - and by the way one of the things about
69:03 - the system that I have built with I I
69:06 - barely did any of this work
69:08 - so I know that depong in particular has
69:11 - a ton of work on this this Json file
69:14 - there's a script that's part of the repo
69:16 - that will generate the YouTube
69:17 - description for it so this is all the
69:19 - metadata for this particular video and
69:22 - this is another thing you could
69:23 - contribute to for hacktoberfest some of
69:26 - them could might have typos uh in the
69:29 - time codes maybe the the they're missing
69:31 - a link it could be improved there's all
69:34 - sorts of things you could think about to
69:35 - improve and and
69:38 - I was gonna say punch up these pages to
69:40 - give them a bit more but what you're
69:42 - looking for is here showcase notice now
69:46 - here that there are all these files
69:49 - contribution number.json
69:53 - contributionnumber.png some of them have
69:55 - what like a much larger number some of
69:57 - them have a smaller number
69:58 - all you need to create to submit your
70:03 - project to the coding Train website is
70:06 - to add to this directory and most of the
70:09 - directors won't be this full and if you
70:12 - find a video that doesn't have any
70:14 - showcase projects you have to create the
70:16 - directory but most of them do at this
70:17 - point you need to add to this directory
70:20 - two files
70:22 - a Json file and a PNG let's just look at
70:26 - what these look like let's look at
70:27 - contribution 12.
70:29 - and your Json file just needs to have a
70:33 - few things in it needs to have a title
70:35 - of your project an author name a URL of
70:39 - the project and a time stamp for when it
70:42 - was submitted using this particular
70:44 - format and the coding train Discord the
70:47 - GitHub issues these are places where you
70:49 - can post and ask about to get help doing
70:51 - this if it's confusing
70:53 - cough is asking if I do a coding
70:56 - challenge but use Unity would it be
70:58 - valid Not only would it be valid that's
71:01 - what I'm hoping for the whole point of
71:04 - this is not about using the tools that
71:07 - I'm using and
71:09 - following the way that I do things but
71:12 - sharing the way that you do things and
71:14 - the tools that you use with the
71:16 - community the fact that the Showcase
71:18 - projects are linked to their videos is
71:20 - just a way of organizing them by theme
71:22 - and I don't have a great way for people
71:24 - like I made something I want to share it
71:26 - but I don't it's not associated with a
71:28 - video there's no place for that right
71:30 - now on the website but
71:32 - um but yes absolutely
71:35 - um okay so um so this is the format for
71:39 - the Json file by the way the author name
71:41 - can also have a URL so you can have a
71:43 - separate URL which is of your own social
71:45 - media or website in addition to just
71:48 - this URL we looked at other ones we
71:49 - might see that
71:51 - um and then uh oops which which one was
71:54 - that was that number 17 I don't even
71:56 - remember now which one
71:58 - 12 not 17. then if I look at
72:01 - contribution so you need a file called
72:03 - actually it doesn't even have to have
72:05 - the word contribution in it I don't
72:07 - remember somebody might know this in the
72:10 - chat
72:12 - uh the instructions are good for the
72:14 - challenges still okay yeah
72:15 - um
72:17 - so
72:18 - um
72:19 - I don't remember whether it actually has
72:21 - to be called contribution but it just
72:23 - needs to have a unique name uh with a
72:26 - number so the um the form uh has a I
72:29 - don't know if I forgot what it uses a
72:31 - time stamp or something for naming the
72:33 - file but if you create your own through
72:36 - a manual process for hacktoberfest you
72:38 - just need to say contribution some
72:40 - number that isn't already listed so and
72:43 - then you need to both name your Json
72:44 - file and the PNG the same name
72:48 - so now you can see this is the thumbnail
72:51 - image and if I were to go to the uh that
72:53 - page
72:55 - I've already lost it oh this is the
72:57 - deploy preview do I have the I'll just
73:00 - find it again 10 print
73:04 - go to this page you can see here that by
73:08 - the way this the order of the projects
73:10 - on this page is random and different
73:13 - every time I load it if you're wondering
73:14 - like well how do I get to be first
73:17 - refresh depending on the number of
73:19 - challenges eventually you'll be first so
73:22 - if I go through at some point we're
73:24 - going to see that one
73:26 - um I saw the name but it looks like a
73:28 - different thumbnail so yeah here it is
73:30 - so we can see this is the one we were
73:31 - looking at
73:33 - um and it shows up here and by the way
73:34 - if I were to click on it it's going to
73:36 - take me to the page for the actual
73:37 - project the wonderful uh I love these
73:39 - colors I love the ones and zeros what a
73:41 - wonderful job from hater Ali Punjabi
73:44 - so um so that's the process
73:48 - I'm not uh you know as you might uh be
73:52 - realizing I'm not and I would love to to
73:55 - find a different time to maybe do this
73:56 - if that would be helpful but if you've
73:58 - never used GitHub before I kind of told
74:01 - you about how it works and I showed you
74:03 - where some instructions are but you're
74:05 - going to have some trouble probably
74:06 - you're going to want you to ask
74:07 - questions so you could get help
74:10 - the places where you can get help is you
74:13 - can file an issue so you can type new
74:15 - issue title it I need help submitting my
74:17 - passenger showcase project
74:19 - write about what you need help with what
74:21 - your questions are and someone hopefully
74:24 - hopefully I or somebody else from the
74:26 - community will be able to answer your
74:27 - questions and help you out there
74:29 - the other place is the coding train
74:31 - Discord where there are help channels uh
74:35 - and lots of other people there who are
74:36 - available to answer questions and help
74:38 - you get your project into the passenger
74:40 - showcase so to summarize
74:43 - the easiest way to get your project into
74:45 - the passenger showcase is with
74:49 - this form
74:52 - if you want to participate in
74:54 - hacktoberfest
74:55 - you can follow these instructions for
74:58 - how to do it manually through a pull
74:59 - request
75:02 - but if you're new to all this that's not
75:04 - going to be the easiest thing in the
75:05 - world for you to do so raise your hand
75:07 - ask for help
75:09 - the coding train Community is here to
75:11 - help you figure that out I would like
75:13 - very much for it to be a welcoming and
75:14 - friendly place for you to make your
75:16 - first attempt at a pull request
75:18 - regardless of how many times you fail or
75:20 - how many mistakes you made that is the
75:23 - point
75:26 - um okay
75:27 - now
75:30 - what else do I want to say so I'm I'm
75:33 - closing in on the end of this live
75:35 - stream
75:36 - and I want to talk about
75:40 - something
75:41 - new
75:43 - which is and I'm going to minimize some
75:45 - things which is this
75:48 - so this is I can't remember if I how
75:50 - much I showed this the last time I was
75:51 - live streaming I think I did now that I
75:53 - think about it but anyway
75:55 - uh this is a new logo for the coding
75:58 - train
76:00 - um with this wonderful little uh ASCII
76:03 - art like illustration of a train it is
76:07 - made with simple shapes lines and
76:09 - circles
76:10 - um also a little a catchphrase traveling
76:12 - the wonderful world of code another idea
76:14 - for the catchphrases artisanal
76:17 - handcrafted code
76:20 - but um anyway this is what it had so far
76:23 - um and you can see that inside this
76:25 - scene in this wallpaper the reason why
76:27 - I'm bringing this up and one of the
76:28 - reasons for this new logo was to have
76:34 - something that could connect more
76:36 - directly with p5.js
76:41 - and processing and so for example if you
76:44 - go to the processing website you'll
76:46 - notice here this is the processing logo
76:49 - and if you click on open editor you'll
76:52 - see this is code to draw this particular
76:57 - logo and you can do things like you know
76:59 - change the color I could change a number
77:01 - actually
77:03 - and it's going to like change how it
77:05 - looks the design all of that so
77:08 - I am now going to go to the p5.js
77:12 - web editor
77:15 - and by the way the new stickers have the
77:18 - logo and all sorts of other stuff which
77:20 - is very exciting the other thing I'm
77:22 - doing with the stickers is a lot of the
77:23 - stickers the new stickers are just
77:25 - literal visualizations of some of the
77:27 - examples so there's like a whirly noise
77:28 - sticker like end body simulation sticker
77:32 - but let's see if I can log in here
77:36 - uh and do open and look for maybe logo
77:43 - copy copy
77:45 - I don't know why there's a copy copy in
77:46 - this one but let's
77:48 - let's try this
77:51 - and here it is okay
77:53 - so here is now the P5 sketch and by the
77:56 - way as much as I said artisanal
77:58 - handcrafted code
78:00 - the way I actually generated this is the
78:03 - design was made with uh I don't know
78:05 - whether Jason actually used illustrator
78:07 - or what tool he used but I have an SVG
78:10 - formatted file of the design and I used
78:12 - a large language model to convert that
78:15 - into uh the code with just drawing every
78:18 - line individually so it is a little bit
78:20 - ridiculous like probably the example for
78:23 - this doesn't need this level of
78:25 - precision for all the pixel values
78:28 - but this is my ask for you and I think
78:31 - this is a good place
78:33 - for us to for me to start a new repo
78:35 - that could also be part of hacktoberfest
78:37 - so let's think about this
78:40 - I would love for people to remix this
78:42 - logo maybe I should do like a video
78:44 - about it giving some ideas and some
78:46 - techniques or like demonstrating it but
78:48 - right now all I have is the literal
78:50 - a hard-coded values of the design but
78:53 - what would it mean for it to animate
78:55 - what would it mean for it to break apart
78:57 - come back together what kind of creative
78:59 - things make it sound responsive change
79:02 - the colors I would love to see what
79:04 - people who from the community could do
79:06 - remixing this logo and playing with it
79:08 - and I think there could be a lot of fun
79:10 - stuff and and I just want to say
79:13 - um Jeff Wagner who I know has been
79:14 - posting a ton of stuff in the chat uh
79:16 - thank you for all of your kind comments
79:17 - okay and gisha thanks for asking how I'm
79:20 - feeling
79:22 - honestly like I know I'm feeling good
79:23 - but I I'm I'm
79:26 - I feel like I'm really struggling to
79:28 - keep up with
79:30 - work
79:32 - and by work I mean teaching and the
79:35 - nature of code book and the YouTube
79:36 - channel and all these emails that I have
79:39 - to respond to so I feel very out of
79:41 - sorts and disorganized like my
79:44 - um
79:46 - they just I feel off and some of that
79:49 - might just be
79:51 - getting older
79:53 - can't do as much some of it might be
79:56 - just the last few years of everything
79:58 - that sort of changed in the world some
80:00 - of it might just be this fall semester
80:01 - is particularly busy but I think it's
80:03 - mostly just that I'm trying to really
80:04 - finish the nature of code book project
80:06 - so anyway but thanks for asking okay uh
80:11 - now
80:15 - um all right so what do I want to so I
80:17 - think maybe what I'm going to do this is
80:18 - a spur of the moment idea
80:21 - uh let's create very quickly a GitHub
80:25 - repo for this for the logo
80:29 - and I don't know what
80:32 - should actually go in it
80:34 - but let's give this a start okay
80:37 - so I'm going to call this I'm going to
80:38 - put it in coding drain
80:41 - what should I call it a coding
80:45 - train logo unfortunately there's another
80:49 - name like anyway I'll just call it that
80:51 - it's going to be public it's going to
80:53 - have a readme file
80:55 - it's going to be for lack of a different
80:59 - option right now that I MIT license
81:03 - I mean the design I would say is maybe
81:06 - Creative Commons non-commercial but I'm
81:08 - not going to worry about that right now
81:10 - and
81:14 - now ordinarily what I would do
81:19 - which I think makes sense maybe I should
81:21 - do what I would ordinarily do so order
81:23 - there's so many different ways to create
81:25 - a repository on GitHub what you saw me
81:28 - do just now is manually create one
81:30 - during using the interface and honestly
81:32 - what I was thinking is like oh let me
81:33 - just add some new files to it like I
81:35 - could actually add that let's just do
81:37 - this this is kind of wacky but let's add
81:40 - index.html and we're just going to go
81:42 - here
81:43 - and we're going to uh paste this in
81:46 - there
81:47 - yeah yeah why not I don't need the sound
81:50 - library right now and I feel like it
81:53 - should but you know the whole point is
81:55 - that people can improve this so I'm not
81:56 - even going to worry about it and I'm
81:57 - going to say uh creating index.html
82:00 - that's perfectly I'm committing to the
82:01 - main branch just just going with it
82:03 - then
82:05 - add another file
82:08 - I'm going to add a file called sketch.js
82:12 - and
82:15 - uh
82:16 - I'm going to put that in here
82:20 - beautiful I'm gonna commit that
82:23 - and say create sketch.js
82:25 - I'm going to go into this file I'm going
82:28 - to you know what I'm going to do is I'm
82:30 - going to make an empty style.css file
82:33 - I'm going to create add a file
82:38 - called uh
82:40 - style.css but I'm not going to worry
82:42 - about what goes in it just yet
82:47 - somebody's asking about quaternions in
82:49 - the chat hilarious okay so now
82:53 - I have this repo
82:57 - if I add do I add to the topics is that
83:00 - where the thing that yapa put
83:02 - hacktoberfest
83:03 - topics
83:06 - is this where the hacktoberfest thing
83:07 - goes
83:11 - is that what I'm supposed to do let's
83:12 - just put it in there and see okay so now
83:15 - this is a hacktoberfest repo I'm making
83:16 - this repo specifically for Oktoberfest
83:18 - as well
83:20 - I might regret this later we'll see what
83:22 - happens
83:24 - um and now
83:26 - what I want to do and I'm going to just
83:27 - I so I have my GitHub linked to netlify
83:31 - and I like to build so I could use
83:34 - GitHub pages to host this sort of main
83:38 - page that
83:40 - um
83:41 - has the logo thing I mean I should just
83:42 - use GitHub pages right now and I'll
83:44 - switch it later but I just don't know
83:45 - what this is going to reveal if I go
83:46 - into my settings
83:48 - so
83:50 - um let me I'm doing this without you
83:52 - being able to look at it
83:55 - um
83:56 - and where is I'm just going to go down
83:58 - to GitHub pages
84:02 - um and I'm going to do it from the main
84:04 - branch
84:05 - employee from a branch I might switch
84:07 - this over to like a netlify build or
84:09 - something later
84:10 - but right now
84:13 - I just
84:15 - uh oh you can't see this hold on let me
84:17 - just finish what I was doing
84:18 - and then you'll be able to see it
84:24 - I lost we're okay uh where is the pages
84:27 - GitHub Pages ah
84:29 - Pages there it is
84:32 - sorry sorry sorry sorry
84:42 - I don't understand I
84:44 - uh
84:47 - all right I'm just gonna assume
84:51 - that this is working now
84:54 - I'm going to come back to here
84:57 - usually okay so now
85:00 - let's see if I go to
85:03 - codingtrain.github.io coding train dash
85:05 - logo
85:08 - did I get that wrong
85:10 - or maybe just hasn't built yet so I
85:14 - once I get this working the sketch would
85:17 - appear here
85:18 - so what do I think this repo is for now
85:21 - here's what I think couple things one is
85:24 - so you know uh just I'm gonna I'll make
85:28 - like a uh
85:29 - live stream
85:33 - brainstorming list
85:37 - uh these are things
85:41 - I'm looking for help with for
85:44 - hacktoberfest
85:47 - later
85:49 - I should break these into separate
85:52 - issues so first of all what are things
85:55 - that might improve this repo
85:58 - um that you might like to suggest in the
86:00 - chat I'm keeping an eye on it
86:03 - um
86:04 - all right so first of all uh read me
86:07 - that explains what the coding train is
86:11 - an image of the logo and what this repo
86:15 - is all about so you could work on the
86:17 - readme
86:19 - um
86:22 - create the the best uh or like any
86:28 - changes that improve
86:32 - how the code
86:35 - reads for beginners and makes it easier
86:39 - to build upon
86:45 - maybe a system for people to add their
86:51 - own variations of the logo this is a
86:54 - bigger project
86:58 - um what else uh ports of the logo to
87:03 - other
87:04 - languages
87:08 - what else
87:11 - so this is the idea I'm trying to think
87:13 - of a list of things that people could
87:16 - work on for this particular repo
87:19 - so I'm going to submit this issue
87:22 - and there we go
87:24 - so this is a repo that I am setting up
87:28 - without much of a plan if I'm being
87:30 - honest which share and and also let's
87:33 - put this in
87:35 - at least in the in the readme
87:38 - let me
87:40 - um just put this here so it's there
87:44 - um
87:46 - this the idea for this repo is maybe I
87:49 - can maybe it can be a friendly place a
87:53 - sort of small low stakes project
87:57 - that people could kind of practice using
87:59 - git and GitHub with like you could pull
88:01 - requests all sorts of stuff here and we
88:03 - can sort of play around with it
88:04 - similarly to my uh that rainbow the poem
88:08 - repo that goes along with my git and
88:10 - GitHub video tutorials so that's the
88:13 - last thing on my agenda for today
88:16 - um besides so I want to talk about the
88:18 - new processing course out now on nebula
88:20 - pinned comment if you want access to
88:22 - that I wanted to talk about the nature
88:26 - of code book which is coming along you
88:28 - can read it online you can pre-order it
88:30 - and I wanted to talk about how I intend
88:33 - to hopefully participate in
88:35 - hacktoberfest and how you can submit to
88:38 - the passenger showcase
88:40 - and start this new repo maybe to help
88:43 - people play around with their own
88:45 - variations of the coding train logo
88:48 - did my um now before I go
88:52 - it did just happen to notice here
88:54 - that there are a lot
88:59 - of
89:01 - pull requests right now in the actual
89:04 - coding train repo itself
89:06 - so one is from me that I forgot that I
89:10 - did so one thing I did by the way here's
89:11 - something that you could do uh also with
89:14 - the website
89:16 - all of the videos are associated with
89:19 - topics and languages and I was noticing
89:22 - when I was searching for some Pi Day
89:24 - videos like I have a video about the
89:27 - leibniz
89:28 - um
89:30 - uh formula for approximating pi the uh
89:33 - how Pi in the mandelbrot set are related
89:36 - buffon's needle all these videos related
89:39 - to Pi approximation and Pi Day but the
89:42 - uh topics list was not consistent
89:44 - between them so I was updating that so
89:46 - that's the one thing that I am that
89:48 - people can contribute to if you're
89:50 - looking for a non-showcase way to
89:51 - contribute to the website is to look at
89:55 - um you know if I go to the challenges
89:57 - for example and I search by like fractal
90:00 - I wouldn't be surprised if there's a
90:02 - coding challenge that deals with
90:03 - fractals that maybe I missed or that
90:06 - some topic or tag is sort of
90:07 - inconsistently Applied so that's
90:09 - something that um people can help with
90:11 - I'm going to go ahead and merge this one
90:13 - I think I was waiting for the tests to
90:15 - pass and I forgot so I'm going to merge
90:17 - this pull request that I made
90:20 - um then you'll see all of these shows oh
90:22 - Kathy who does a wonderful job curating
90:24 - uh the featured showcases and challenges
90:27 - that are on the home page uh apologies
90:29 - for missing this
90:31 - um this is from a couple weeks ago let's
90:33 - let these update I'm going to merge
90:35 - Kathy's work here
90:39 - um
90:41 - and let's look now and then oh updating
90:44 - ah so this is uh Depot Sam who is
90:46 - working on updating some of the
90:48 - contributing guides so hopefully this
90:50 - will as this gets updated it'll help
90:52 - with more instructions information for
90:53 - Oktoberfest but let's look at these
90:56 - showcase submissions right now there are
90:58 - five of them and let's see if I can get
91:00 - through them
91:02 - so I just clicked on one and I don't
91:04 - know what happened
91:06 - where am I I've lost
91:09 - I have too many tabs open let me close
91:12 - all these tabs
91:15 - here we are
91:18 - so this is rampana who has created quite
91:21 - a few contributions as of late let's
91:23 - take a look at this so one uh let's take
91:25 - a look at their work here
91:27 - um
91:28 - oh look at that what a fun spiral with
91:31 - rotating rainbow colors great work Pana
91:34 - so I since I'm doing this live I'm just
91:37 - going to merge it often I try to write a
91:38 - little nice comment an encouraging
91:40 - friendly supportive comment it's going
91:42 - to go ahead and merge this one
91:44 - and we'll see hopefully these appear as
91:46 - I merge them the website will rebuild
91:47 - takes a little time let's look at this
91:49 - heart curve one hey wait a second it's
91:52 - Panna again welcome to the coding train
91:55 - Pana hour uh let's look at this
91:59 - uh and
92:01 - oh that is a very cute little bear bear
92:05 - with a heart pulsing and a bone or is it
92:08 - a puppy I'm not really sure but I love
92:10 - it I love all the variables
92:12 - I guess that's meat
92:15 - I don't know that I've seen a variable
92:17 - called meat before but I quite enjoy
92:18 - that
92:20 - um and let's go ahead and merge this
92:22 - wonderful project
92:26 - and now let's go to ah wave function
92:30 - collapse what are we gonna get here oh
92:32 - interesting Dorian makza and Apologies
92:36 - by mispronouncing name created a PHP
92:39 - tiled wave function collapse so let's
92:42 - take a look at this
92:43 - so here as you can see very legitimate
92:47 - and encouraged to use
92:51 - um
92:52 - to use non-up to use other platforms
92:55 - besides P5 and processing the PHP is
92:58 - quite shocking like at least on made way
93:01 - function collapse with PHP that's
93:04 - incredible let's go to their website to
93:07 - see
93:08 - oh this is incredible
93:10 - wow circuit board oh this is so cool
93:15 - simple demo
93:17 - oh wow this is incredible let me try
93:20 - doing 50 space station that's oh 15 is
93:24 - the max okay amazing wow I love this um
93:27 - so if you're not familiar with wave
93:29 - function collapse there's another
93:31 - algorithm also that from many years ago
93:33 - called Model synthesis which is uh very
93:35 - very similar in terms of the tiled model
93:38 - um
93:39 - you can watch my video on it
93:42 - I don't know I don't know what you'll
93:43 - think of it but certainly there
93:46 - um and you can see that this I this is a
93:48 - really incredible documentation and
93:50 - really incredible work so
93:52 - um now let's see here I am going to yes
93:56 - and this is linked to Dorian so I'm
93:58 - going to make sure I leave a comment
94:00 - here this is incredible
94:03 - emerging
94:05 - live okay I don't know if that will make
94:08 - any sense to anybody but um
94:10 - maybe later I can time code when I
94:12 - looked at this um for Dorian to see if
94:15 - they're not watching live right now okay
94:16 - so now there's two fluid simulations
94:19 - sometimes we get redundant ones let me
94:21 - just sort of check
94:24 - so I I didn't finish my thought wave
94:27 - function collapse is an algorithm that
94:30 - looks at a grid and essentially fills
94:33 - each spot of the Grid in with one of
94:36 - some number of options of tiles And Then
94:38 - There are rules for what tiles
94:40 - are allowed to P appear next to each
94:43 - other and with those rules you can
94:45 - generate all sorts of different kinds of
94:46 - patterns
94:47 - so this is from
94:49 - EG back by Rockstar
94:52 - based on the fluid simulation
94:55 - which is one of
94:57 - which is wild uh to see that someone
94:59 - actually was actually able to make
95:00 - something maybe from watching that video
95:02 - this looks like oh there's a nice MP4
95:04 - this is made in processing hey let's
95:07 - download this
95:10 - I want to just download this because
95:11 - it's the processing why not open it up
95:15 - uh download
95:19 - and we can look at the sketch so first
95:21 - of all there's a nice MP4 in here
95:24 - that's pretty cool
95:26 - that is pretty lovely so my guess is
95:30 - maybe so one of the in my fluid
95:32 - simulation video I create perhaps what
95:35 - is the least optimized slowest version
95:38 - ever of fluid of fluid simulation so I
95:42 - don't know and we I'm guessing when we
95:44 - run the processing sketch if it's based
95:45 - on my code it will render every frame
95:48 - very very slowly which then makes sense
95:50 - to render out a video so you can watch
95:52 - it more quickly that said this person
95:54 - might have improved the code greatly and
95:56 - optimized it because it is possible to
95:58 - do fluid simulation with all sorts of uh
96:01 - Excel Hardware accelerated and other
96:03 - techniques to make it work better hello
96:05 - Elkin in the chat
96:09 - uh thank you for your support Elkin are
96:12 - you in the Discord with the supporter
96:14 - tag because the stickers are going to be
96:16 - going out very soon to supporters
96:18 - so check and message if you're not okay
96:21 - let's open this up in processing
96:26 - and see what we've got
96:28 - uh keep it keep it keep it
96:33 - not not right now I do want to get the
96:35 - so I think I messed something up
96:37 - probably let me
96:38 - sometimes processing it's in it it's
96:42 - able to handle this more elegantly now
96:44 - but it's probably my fault sometimes
96:46 - having the um
96:48 - it works better if the pde name is the
96:51 - same as the no and still
96:54 - so I'm not sure what I I wouldn't be
96:56 - surprised if I'm doing something wrong
96:57 - here but I'm not able to get this to run
97:00 - right now maybe somebody can help me
97:02 - figure that out later but this is
97:04 - excellent documentation and we were able
97:06 - to see the video
97:08 - um oh and this is also combined with the
97:11 - purlin noise flow field coding challenge
97:13 - so it could go with that coding
97:16 - challenge as well I don't have a way for
97:18 - showcase projects to be tagged for
97:20 - multiple videos right now so you just
97:22 - have to pick one but this is incredible
97:25 - a minute let's see if they're uh yeah
97:29 - this is incredible
97:32 - I'm reviewing it now during a live
97:35 - stream but I had trouble getting the
97:39 - processing
97:41 - code to run
97:44 - the video is perfect
97:48 - the video is perfect
97:52 - um did I miss something
97:54 - I'm just going to put a little
97:55 - screenshot now
97:57 - of this
97:59 - and
98:02 - attach that
98:05 - to
98:08 - here and one little another little trick
98:12 - I'm going to show you is when you upload
98:15 - an image to like a GitHub issue it's
98:18 - going to do a lot of nice things for you
98:19 - automatically and that image is right
98:22 - here in the issue but one thing it will
98:24 - not do is generate an ALT tag that has
98:28 - any meaning it's just using the name of
98:30 - the file so screen so I like to adjust
98:33 - that when I can for accessibility
98:35 - screenshot of processing IDE with error
98:39 - message and then what was the error
98:41 - message so this is a good fluid cannot
98:45 - hide in closing type
98:47 - fluid cannot hide
98:51 - enclosing type so I'm going to add that
98:53 - in there and now um anybody who's
98:57 - reading this issue with a screen reader
98:59 - will have a description of this image of
99:01 - course my description was not
99:03 - comprehensive I didn't list all the code
99:05 - but I edited down to what I felt was
99:07 - like made the most sense for this
99:08 - context I suppose I'm inadvertently
99:11 - training somebody's large image
99:13 - generator model by labeling images for
99:16 - them but it's worth it for
99:18 - um
99:20 - accessibility and James Haskin
99:23 - uh five years ago wow that's amazing
99:25 - thank you so much for watching and
99:27 - tuning in and supporting the channel
99:28 - okay
99:29 - now uh let's merge this pull request
99:35 - I'm gonna merge it
99:37 - I am going to get back to the pull
99:40 - requests
99:41 - I'm going to look at this one which
99:43 - looks like this was a duplicate so I'm
99:45 - I'm going to say I merged this happened
99:48 - sometimes with the form
99:50 - uh this is one two
99:52 - one two two nine so one two two eight uh
99:57 - closing this one so let's do that
100:00 - excellent just doing a little
100:01 - maintenance here a little cleanup of the
100:04 - old coding Train website
100:07 - um and I'm gonna go here
100:10 - and
100:12 - yeah there's a few so now now we're now
100:15 - we're in good shape there's only six
100:16 - open pull requests this is
100:19 - um for the new logging processing video
100:21 - won't be in it it finished till that is
100:23 - on YouTube
100:24 - um this is something the tpom is working
100:26 - on this is somebody who really gave a
100:28 - heroic effort to try to manually add a
100:30 - showcase project but
100:31 - um we need to fix it up still and then I
100:33 - forget what these are I think there's
100:34 - some open questions about which videos
100:36 - those go with but I'll have to deal with
100:38 - those another time okay
100:40 - um so uh thank you all for tuning in
100:44 - today to this live stream I
100:47 - am going to turn this a little this
100:49 - little song I'm Gonna Play in the
100:50 - background down
100:52 - um I'm sorry that this was kind of short
100:54 - on structured disorganized messy
100:57 - unhelpful boring I don't know whatever
101:00 - criticism you want to lob at it I'm
101:02 - sorry for that
101:04 - um I wanted to at least turn on the
101:06 - equipment fire up the old
101:09 - camera machine to
101:12 - take pictures of me and beam them out to
101:14 - you on the internet live just to update
101:16 - you on what's going on at a minimum I
101:20 - always want to have a live stream at
101:21 - least once a month on the coding train
101:23 - and
101:25 - I'm excited to see what happens when the
101:27 - new beginner processing video comes out
101:29 - on YouTube if it brings more people back
101:30 - to the channel
101:34 - My Views are declining at a rather
101:39 - extreme Pace but it kind of makes sense
101:42 - because I haven't published anything new
101:43 - in quite some time it's fine I don't
101:45 - it's no problem
101:47 - we're gonna get back to it gonna make
101:49 - some more challenges get the get the old
101:52 - grind the gears of the code machine make
101:56 - it happen write some artisanal
101:58 - handcrafted code it's coming
102:01 - uh Daniel Rubio says thank you for the
102:03 - channel uh Barney says no need to
102:05 - apologize and cough says it was an
102:07 - amazing live stream I love your energy
102:09 - oh you're all saying such nice things to
102:11 - me it's so nice also
102:14 - I I don't know if any of you notice but
102:16 - the Baltimore Orioles are in first place
102:20 - in the American League East they're
102:21 - leaving Tampa Bay hoping to go to one of
102:24 - their last games of the Season got to
102:25 - make the trip down to Baltimore to catch
102:27 - them it has been there I think it was
102:29 - was it 86 when I was a kid and they won
102:31 - the World Series or made it to the World
102:32 - Series I was a young lad
102:34 - back then in the 19 the 1900s
102:39 - I have like this new hip pain thing I
102:41 - gotta go to physical therapy for that
102:44 - I look so young
102:46 - people always you know I don't know
102:48 - what's happened
102:50 - let's can I show you this I find this a
102:52 - little distressing
102:53 - [Music]
102:56 - like I don't uh let's just turn off the
102:59 - sound here we don't need the sound
103:03 - but you know this is me now I look
103:06 - energetic healthy I look all right
103:10 - look at that young whippersnapper with
103:12 - no gray hair and
103:15 - Perfect Skin
103:19 - no bald spots
103:21 - no back pain
103:24 - you know what happened to that guy oh
103:26 - that's that's more like it there you go
103:28 - I do have new glasses do you like that
103:30 - but go go Orioles come on all you tell
103:33 - you don't care about baseball nobody
103:34 - cares about as well you might as well
103:36 - root for the Orioles
103:39 - oh the song ran out
103:42 - um
103:42 - okay I'm gonna answer this question I
103:45 - think I've seen in the chat maybe a
103:46 - thousand times has there been a
103:48 - challenge about make your own Gan uh no
103:50 - but I did a bunch of live streams with
103:52 - an auto making an auto encoder with
103:54 - tensorflow.js so you might go back and
103:56 - find those uh can I make Super Mario
103:59 - Brothers Olivia am asks I would really
104:01 - like to get back to oh in suik thank you
104:04 - for that very kind uh Super Chat there
104:06 - it's very kind of you
104:09 - um
104:12 - and uh they're moving to Vegas the A's
104:15 - are moving to Vegas not the Orioles I
104:17 - hope that's what you're talking about
104:18 - but
104:20 - um
104:21 - I already forgot what I was saying but
104:23 - oh yeah if you're interested in that go
104:25 - look at the auto encoder videos oh so
104:28 - what's coming up next
104:30 - I am teaching in my class in just a
104:32 - couple weeks how to make a Discord bot
104:34 - so um next time I'm back in the studio
104:36 - I'm going to be recording new Discord
104:38 - bot tutorials if you have ideas and
104:40 - thoughts about that come into the
104:42 - Discord the Cody frame Discord and chat
104:45 - about that
104:47 - um I guess there was another there were
104:48 - two there was suik and there's another
104:50 - like I can't really understand there's
104:52 - like a couple different
104:54 - people's profile things I don't
104:56 - understand how this YouTube thing works
104:59 - um this is this is all too much for me
105:01 - okay
105:04 - let's just go back to here if we could
105:07 - all look so please try something with
105:09 - that coding train logo and share it with
105:10 - me on social media I would love that uh
105:13 - if we can remember Kathy if you want to
105:14 - help with this you're welcome to but you
105:15 - don't have to you can try to like time
105:17 - code and
105:20 - um put
105:21 - um time code and put like various links
105:24 - and things that I've talked about in the
105:25 - video description I'll have that up uh
105:26 - if I can get my act together pretty soon
105:29 - um and the next live stream will maybe
105:31 - be a Halloween one what should I wear
105:33 - what costume should I have what should
105:34 - we code let's do a spooky Halloween okay
105:37 - thanks everybody I'm gonna head out of
105:39 - here now and see you all oh what's a
105:43 - catchphrase okay uh All Aboard no that's
105:46 - not a good one that's that's at the
105:47 - beginning All Aboard oh uh what do you
105:50 - say when people get off the train
105:52 - have a great trip no thanks for riding

Cleaned transcript:

thank you foreign foreign thank you foreign foreign let's do it foreign still checking my audio here I'm gonna try one more thing and I'm just going to leave it as is okay here we go hi I'm still here the train is departing I'm not ready I'm gonna switch the camera to being on me though uh what was loud um who is in the chat let's see uh oh boy uh let's see okay okay okay hi everybody oh this was a mistake My Life currently hi hi by the way I'm Dan uh you're watching a live stream of the coding train you're watching a completely unhinged unready person on the internet who just happened to turn on this whole streaming setup but is not at all uh ready the train whistle was loud I don't know what you were even hearing where did that come from so I don't something is wrong with the audio setup I let's just let's just set the stage for a second why am I here I don't know why you're here to be perfectly honest as my phone is beeping now turn that off um you should probably turn this off right now because I really wanted to live stream because I wanted to make sure I got a live stream in before the end of September and this was the last day that I could possibly do it and I was busy with all sorts of things all day today and I didn't get into this room until about 10 minutes ago and I'm completely not ready from a technical setup standpoint from a mental and emotional standpoint but I'm here nonetheless um the main thing here and I'm glad that Daniel teffra is saying that I'm excited for the stream and that hexagon has a curiosity I've got at least I've got this extra laptop here with me with some different new stickers on it that uh I can watch the Youtube chat uh go by here so thanks for bearing with me um I've got a short list of things I want to cover you'll you might notice that the title of this stream was just choo choo because I have no idea what it's supposed to happen during it but um if you could just give me a minute here to get organized uh I think everything's going to be okay so I have a question uh in terms of the audio and uh hello from Norway I was about to go to bed but I guess it will wait no no go to bed go to bed sleep sleep is important and the recording of This will be in the morning what are you really missing I mean yeah you you do you decide but you know just just if you want my advice sleep is good um question is my audio good enough do you hear a very substantial Echo I'm wondering I'm streaming from a cathedral audio is five by five I don't know what that audio is good so um so all right so I think it's fine I so in this room where I am it's a pretty open space in a garage and I have all these sound blankets I never sound treated this room but I have these like sound blankets that I was hanging for a while to try to keep the echo down and then I started using this piece of software called uh Nvidia broadcast which has like in real time uh remove the echo from it uh and it doesn't seem to be working right now but everybody's saying the audio is fine some of an echo okay slight Echo slightly muffled it's definitely this microphone I'm tapping on it we're just gonna go with what it is I don't understand there was a different time on my life and I know I said this probably the last time I live streamed more I was able to manage all the different kinds of things that I'm working on in uh in a healthy and productive way now is not that time uh uh uh and um I I can't seem to get it together and I think a lot of the reason is because I have been working on and you have to bear with me for a second I'm just downloading some stuff here that I want to show you I have been working on a couple projects I just noticed I haven't been in this room because I haven't been live streaming or recording videos and the spiders have spun webs that are now around me that's so sad uh hold on I'm downloading some things that I want to hopefully show you um let's see if I got them um I have been working on a couple big projects one is actually complete and the other is on its way to being complete so I feel like I need to get those projects behind me and then I can return maybe back to more of the rhythm again of small coding Challenge videos and other tutorials I don't know I haven't been able to keep up but I thank you I I wanted to live stream because I need to talk about these projects that I'm working on check in with you folks and say hello to the YouTube community and that kind of stuff so um when my hand covered the mic the echo went with it ah Keith signed up as a lifetime nebula member well thank you for that support that's actually the first item on my agenda so let's talk about something that is coming out now that is out right now that you can watch on the stream platform called nebula but we'll be coming out in a week so let's see if these downloaded uh uh let's see if this works all right I'm gonna go over to here and oh my God he's gonna eat me uh this is a little teaser of a project I've been working on let's see uh now let's just see if the audio goes through so I'm going to mute my microphone the audio does not go through so here in real time let's I use this piece of software called loopback uh which this should do it if I turn that on I believe now to learn program yes okay here's a great thing that's going to happen right now because I'm a complete mess and disorganized I'm going to play you a little teaser video about my next YouTube video that's coming out that is over five hours long and I'm gonna talk about how you can watch it today right now if you want or you can wait till October 1st when we'll be on YouTube let's see all right so I need to get rid of myself although it'll be funny for me to uh so let's see I think if I uh get rid of myself over here I have a button for that don't I uh should say laptop here there I did it okay oh you can still hear me uh I saw this big like red thing happen hold on all right everything seems fine okay so let's see let's see if I can make this happen this is a disaster wait I don't want to be playing picture in picture what is going on okay full screen view I can't use a computer here we go you have no idea what it means to program have you ever wanted to learn programming do you have no idea what it means to program do you want to break free from the bonds of the tools that other people have made for you and learn to build your own software to make things with code one way that you can learn how to program not the only way not the only way you can or should but it's my favorite way and that's with something called processing I've divided it into different chapters organized with a table of contents it's a bunch of lessons all sequenced teaching you the fundamentals of computer science and programming with processing and at the end everything culminates with the mini project that I'll show you how to build that synthesizes all of the concepts from the series I can't wait to see what you learn what you make and what you think of this series um this is all going wrong okay okay let's try it let's so all right so what was that was a little teaser video about my new processing course so one of the things that I have always done for many years is uh teach beginners how to code so I've done that in all sorts of contexts um and I have a lot of video tutorials on this channel that start from no experience and hopefully build up so the original first videos I made and I'm going to show you some clips of them in from um that I made them I think in like 2012 or with a piece of software called processing and I have redone them all and let me show you a little clip about uh showing you a little difference between then and now wish I planned this better okay uh here let's see let's see if this works so I really was just asking myself the question should I remake those videos the quality wasn't so great although I did look much younger over 10 years ago but enough time has passed a lot has changed in the landscape of tools for learning to code processing most recently came out with version 4 which has many new and exciting features so I figure why not let's just do it all again okay so um you can see this is basically these are oh don't don't I don't want to hear the volume the the I want to scrub through this now just so I can talk about it let's turn the sound off so I can't believe this this is nuts this is me and I I don't actually know the exact date of this I'm pretty sure it was around 2012 drawing our Cartesian plane and explaining the x and y axis and how to draw shapes in a canvas in processing and now here I am doing it again and so I'm hoping that this new version of these tutorials I've learned a lot in the years since um it's a bit more streamlined it has a whole set of new examples and you might be wondering how can you watch it now how can you support this work that I'm doing um and I don't know if anybody who's actually watching this live stream happens to be a beginner or haven't learned to code before doesn't know what processing is is the actual target audience of this thing that I've made unlikely I would say but you might be people who know somebody who might want to learn to code that you might be able to recommend it to so let me talk about how you're going to find out more about this right now yeah okay I've got to go to a web browser here computer is not at all set up for this uh and let me make this chat window a little bit bigger so I can see I don't know if anybody is in the members Discord chat well I got it I got it I got it Chrome I understand what's going on here so let's go to uh github.com codingtrain um and let's take a look to see if we can find what I'm looking for uh all right so let's look for oh I should pin this one but I'm just going to go to it here so this is the GitHub repo for the creative coding processing full course and I have to give a big shout out to Melissa Rodriguez who did I call her uh producer researcher organizer reminder amazing amazing person uh creative coding uh artist who helped me organize and create a lot of these code examples and a lot of the materials that are in the course itself you can see the outline uh here in this page of the full thing with some time codes so uh there's a there's a introduction that I start with where I talk a bit about my history and the history of processing and you can see all the various things that I'm showing are all linked here on this page as well um then the uh video opens with teaching about how to learn to draw with code and the various reference Pages the different examples I'm going to run through a bunch of these right now I look at program flow I look at variables conditionals Loops arrays functions classes and objects at the four hour mark and then at the end I essentially do a little mini coding challenge at the end to build this confetti project a little bit of a conclusion with other resources and references for things that you might go further and node head in the chat appropriately says ew Java and I say Java I actually I I I don't know how strange this is but I do really enjoy the Java programming language um one of the one of the things about processing though is even with all the quirks and difficulties of the Java programming language itself processing is this wonderful environment and ecosystem that hides obscures a lot of the painful parts of java and allows you really to creatively make stuff with code so I'm gonna I'm gonna pull up a bunch of these examples but um what I'll mention here right now is uh so one hey this is coming it will be out on October 1st on the channel the YouTube channel it um but and you can see here's Melissa who's uh just a shout out Melissa who did all this work um but uh one of the ways that I am funding this project and this work is through um uh releasing it early on nebula so there uh last time I did a live stream I talked about different ways that people can support the coding train through YouTube memberships and GitHub sponsorship and that and the like but um uh currently I am part of this wonderful streaming service called nebula if you go to go.nebula.tv codingtrain um this uh oh look and my new header image which is something I'm going to talk about here the new logo um this is a uh this is the link that you want to look for um and the video is currently on the processing course is currently on nebula right now uh if you click here you're gonna it's gonna take me to what the different options are so this is a little bit of an odd thing this is a special promotion only for September so you can actually buy a lifetime membership to nebula you might be wondering like what the heck what so a couple people left this comment for me which was oh I don't want another service I have to subscribe to I just want to buy the class well guess what essentially this is your way of buying the class uh I mean you can also watch it for free when it comes out on YouTube but um what um this is uh this is this is a onetime only payment you never have to think about the subscription service again you just have it forever one of the reasons why I really love nebula is because it is a incredibly incredible curated collection of YouTubers that I regularly watch and a lot of them have exclusive and original content that is on nebula itself let me see if I can pull up the um some of the originals here so if I go to nebula.tv just go to here and if I go to videos ah yes so and then I go to Originals let's take a look so this is what I'm most impressed with about nebula um these original projects um for example I mean video SAS like Lindsay Ellis or on you on our nebula I'm trying to look there was this project called the prince that was amazing oh I love these uh City beautiful videos are really fantastic so if you like eposvox has an original I really would like to make one of these I don't know what it should be I'm open to your ideas but um there are also uh these wonderful classes that are on nebula that are exclusive to the platform we can kind of like scroll through oh turn data into stories I need to watch that one I have one of these I don't think I'll pop out up here if you're interested in music in all sorts of other kinds of topics especially about video production and animation there's a lot of really great stuff on here uh Patrick Williams I'm a big fan of has a wonderful course how to make a movie I need to wear a beret more in mind so anyway so nebula is this great platform um the uh the you can read about I would suggest you read this post from the CEO about uh lifetime memberships um the sort of reason for this program it is a way for the platform to increase the budget of nebula originals and it is also so um by the way you know it's all explicitly outlined here about onethird of the money goes to the Creator whose code you used um and more about um the the originals and different things that the streaming platform is trying to work on improving so all of that is to say that uh if you are interested in supporting the coding train if you want to watch my new course right now before it comes to YouTube you can go to this URL I pin I I don't think I pinned it but go.net I'll pin it in the chat go.nebula.tv codingtrain you can sign up for a monthly subscription an annual subscription or a lifetime one to be clear the lifetime subscription is not your best value right if you're looking for the best value that would be just buying an annual subscription and of course a monthly one is a nice thing to do if you just want to sort of try it for a month and see but the lifetime subscription is the best way to support the nebula platform and independent create outside of you know the ad supported model that is YouTube and me in particular so anyway I didn't mean to belabor that so much that's kind of one of the main reasons I'm doing a live stream today I'm starting to make turn this into what is essentially an ad but I've worked well I I think I started this new processing course uh in January of 2023 so I think I'm about eight months it took me about eight months to finish it in terms of all the recording compiling all the examples all the postproduction so I'm very excited for it to finally be on YouTube and see how uh what new audience might find it what people might create through code with it um but I wanted to make sure I took the time to tell the core audience here in the live stream about how it is available right now on nebula and how you can sign up today and go and watch it great if you have questions about that I'm happy to take them into the chat I think I will move from uh focusing on the this to show you a little bit more about what's in the course all right so couple things that let's let's take a look at so one is let's download uh let's clone this repo let's see here again I have no idea I haven't like used this computer anytime recently it's like remind me later for all these updates let's just clone this to the desktop um if you're if you're a new uh to get and GitHub and all these things I might suggest just if you want to try out all these examples just downloading the zip file uh uh and but I'm gonna do it this way and now I can uh find the folder hopefully on my desktop and go here whoops that's not the right place I want to go to I'm going to go here okay so this by the way for if and when you decide you want to watch the course and code along with it every there there's essentially 10 chapters I wish I had my learning processing book but just to tell you just to complete the full story about this I have this book whoa 9.99 look at that what a deal um so uh it the second edition which is uh published by elsevier I'm sure you could find this on wherever books are sold um but this is a book that the second edition came out in 2015 I believe the first edition was I want to say like 2008 so that's the first time I ever tried to tell the full story of learning the code with processing was through this book I did an updated version of it in 2015. I don't I never I don't think it makes sense right now to do another updated version of the print book but the video course the five hour video course is essentially this or at least maybe most of the book itself um so I'm mostly moving towards producing my educational content through video right now than writing although my other project I'm going to talk about nature of code is not that so that's kind of where a lot of this stems from so and you can essentially this outline with all these examples are the newest version of those learn to code examples with processing that I've made let's open up some of them to take a look so I don't know what what interests people uh Barney codes is in the chat everybody should check out Barney's YouTube channel 30 minute course on shaders yeah can't imagine how long it took a five hour course yeah well the funny thing is the original videos I made were just recorded extemporaneously like I just turned on the recording and talked and made some examples and hit stop and then uploaded them they took me the amount of time it took me to make the original videos was the amount of time it takes you to watch them I mean I'm not factoring in the mental preparation in years of learning this stuff before I just turned on the recording but this for better or worse this five hour course has is more somewhat more thoughtfully made it's still kind of me just talking but it's edited so it moves a bit faster there's uh some postproduction so additional examples and reference materials are just kind of shown next to me that I didn't have at the moment of recording so I'd be curious I don't know how to a B test this properly but have somebody watch the original ones have somebody watch the new ones what's their experience uh which one's better which one's worse okay um so let's just look I don't know let's look at some of these examples here let's see what's in there let's look at drawing and let's look at a spaceship color I don't know what this one is whoa that is some big oh that's just because I zoomed in so you can see by the way one of the things is I just noticed I remembered I should probably take these out a lot of the examples will have this line of code that says pixel density 2 in it that is a way of rendering what is essentially double quadruple it's four pixels for every one because it's a anyway for like high for high density displays like a Mac retina or other high density uh uh displays the actual pixel dimensions versus the number of pixels that are being shoved into your eyes it's different and I for capturing them I wanted to have the extra density of pixels the extra resolution but for right now that actually shouldn't be in there let's take a look at this spaceship so yes there it is if you want to learn to make spaceships like this that is though that's where the course starts in terms of drawing stuff with code moving along um it moves from there to looking at animation animation oh you know what I just realized I think I don't know if this is true no this can't be true is it true that it's the extra examples that are in here but the actual examples are not I have to double check to make sure I have all the materials here so but you can start you could see these are all these I'm just going to skip ahead and the and go to the end and look at the very last example that you learn if you want to learn like what brings everything together at the very very end of the video uh it is making amazing uh confetti explode with color and rotate and spin in beautiful ways I actually don't cover translate and rotate specifically in the course but that's a addon towards the end there but sort of building up to this idea of objectoriented programming and how to create a system out of code so that's the full course I encourage you to take a look at the examples I'm going to double check to make sure everything is there and check out the GitHub repo which has all of the information if you want to watch it now you can um find the link here to nebula now uh one thing that I do want to say is also in addition I have at the moment this um Reddit post so if you want to add you could obviously join the coding trade Discord um but if you want to uh chat or ask questions um this Reddit thread uh as part of the um nebulous subreddit is where you can do that I would encourage you to come and say hello in there because it's another place to say hello I'm following this very closely because oh I forgot why the most important thing this is here's an important reason why I need some people to watch the thing on nebula so one of the wonderful things about the nebula platform being owned and operated essentially by a collect a group of creators is they have a lot of agency in terms of the platform and if there's a mistake in a video I can correct it and reupload the file but that is not something that I can easily do on YouTube well it's not something you can do it all on YouTube so one of the reasons also for having this prerelease on the nebula platform is that I could get a little feedback if there are any mistakes or things that I want to tweak or fix before the final version comes out um I would love to hear so to be honest now I haven't gotten one single which correction which could mean that the whole thing is just perfect but I'm guessing um maybe people just don't know that they could tell me or that not that many people have seen it yet but I've got about a week left before I plan to release it on YouTube and that is kind of you know once once I have errors or things I need to fix they just will essentially go in the description so if you are interested and able to and end up watching this on nebula and you notice anything please reach out to me the Reddit post uh social media the coding train Discord all of those places you can go to speaking of which let me just make sure I'm just going to take a peek into the coding train Discord here to see if there are any important messages I am now monitoring the chat that has Simon in it the sound is found oh the train whistle's in the intro that's what's loud and uh yeah I'm monitoring the Discord chat now uh to uh to for the members who are there in that as well okay so let me see if I can keep that open and the YouTube chat um have both of them oh it's so hard to manage so many screens uh minimizing some things don't worry any minute now oh my God are you serious okay great okay this is good this is good I'm good now I'm good now all right what else ah one more thing about this let's go to thecodingtrain.com let's take a look at oh well actually let's go to the GitHub so this is the coding Train website if you haven't seen it before now you see it I'm gonna go over to uh the coding train GitHub I'm gonna and this is I'm gonna look at the pull requests and boy there's a lot of submissions here that I need to take a look at and merge um which maybe I could do some of that today but let's look at this one for a second let's see if the preview is still built great so when the video is on YouTube um here on this page you will also find it here so every um video well not everybody most of the videos that are on the channel have an Associated page on the codingtrain website with all of the relevant metadata for that video looking for a code example looking for a link to something I reference in the video it's all here did you make a project that you're excited about related to a video I made there's a passenger showcase a place for you to submit that I have talked about that many times on many streams I could again now and maybe I will but that's not why I'm here one of the things that I also that I have on the site are what's known as tracks a track is essentially a sequence course probably what I had typically Point people towards when they are first learning creative coding would be this track code programming with p5.js you'll notice it has track stops those are the individual videos um that some of these are really quite old for each of the different concepts that then have you know the code in them a description maybe a um a showcase project so this particular processing course this new track if I can get back to the tracks is different in that it is one single video it's not there yet doesn't exist on YouTube yet so this is very much of a placeholder the website was not designed with this in mind the website was designed with the idea of the courses being sequence tutorials and also for those of you who might be more familiar with my challenges uh this sort of collection of these independent specific project videos that you can go and watch and enjoy and create your own versions of whenever you might like to so at the moment thank you to um uh uh uh dipom sen who I know is probably sleeping right now because it is at the middle of the night in their time zone but created a sort of BandAid version of a track page for this single video which will just time code the various sections and um and include the metadata here so I haven't figured out the best way to organize that but um when if and when you watch this course and if you make something from watching it you will be able to submit it here to the passenger showcase so I wanted to highlight that I want to encourage anybody to plan to do that um yeah so var19 makes a sort of funny joke there in the chat saying ah yes uh did I pin this already oh I did pin it okay paid beta testing that's great oh wait the testers are the ones paying I know I know I know I know so here's the thing if you really feel like you want to watch it to see if I have any errors and it's not accessible to you because of the way I'm releasing it on nebula just come on to the coding train Discord say at schiffman tag me with this uh request I will think about a way to see if I can figure out a way for you to be able to help watch it and provide any feedback so I by no means am I hoping to lock people out of this process um just it's the way that I'm have set things up to go okay yes Oktoberfest as chat is reminding me all right so I think I have now said everything that I need to say about the new processing course that's come that's already out on nebula pinned chat message you want to watch it right now and we'll be out on YouTube soon enough uh soon so I think I've any other questions about that please uh say them in the chat and maybe I will see them or join the coding train Discord uh which you can just go to thecodingtrade.com Discord it'll take you right into it and you can tag me in there I've been a bit more active in some of the in in the channels there the last couple weeks trying to answer people's questions okay um I fear that I have a new mention already um so I will take a look at that after I finish with this live stream which by the way I'm not going to be here that long this was kind of just like a check in say hello and announce and update you on some projects all right what else do I need to talk about I made an agenda and I put it in the description of this video and nowhere right now do I have the description of this video available for me to look at so I'm gonna just remember things that I want to talk about and then you will look at it maybe and remind me in the chat um it's not about current theme but do you plan to release new coding challenges yes is yes yes yes and yes uh is processing just for learning um processing is not just for learning processing is an incredible platform that you can use for Learning and uh also build uh projects on from a variety of different you know for a variety of different contexts and scales uh and many uh artists use it many creative agencies use it many schools use it and you can also work with its sibling project p5.js which is a creative coding library for JavaScript which would allow you to run things like you might do in processing right in the browser um so in terms of the um uh thanks for the agenda Matthew nature of code updates Oktoberfest new logo great okay um I think I remembered all those things in terms of the challenges I've got to get back into the rhythm of doing them again and I have a list of things to get to I just it's like the walls are closing in on me these days with the various things that I'm working on and the very very busy teaching semester this semester so I'm struggling to find the time to dedicate to the coding train that I have in the past and that I want to but the coding challenge is not the coding challenges is a lifetime project that I hope to get more going with that I have yet to complete so stay tuned all right where should I go next let's talk about uh some quick okay so I'm going to write this list down I want to talk about nature of code where I am with that project I want to talk about hacktoberfest which is coming up and that relates to the showcases and maybe we'll look at some showcase projects and then I want to talk about the coding train logo and ways that you can make your own variations of it okay um I know anybody anybody out there feel like they want to hear about one of those topics first let's go check in on the nature of code um all right so speaking of projects that I've been working on for well over 10 years the nature of code book is one of them and I know that I'm about to repeat some things that I've done on previous live streams but I can really tell from this chat uh that there's a lot of new names here so let's let's let's let's recap in a sort of hopefully a succinct and efficient way if you knew nothing and just happened to search for nature of code this is probably where you would end up this is the website for the version of the book that was published to be using this year a lot in 2012. you could actually click and buy the print version please do not do that you could also uh click here uh you you know you could also slide these down to zero and click here to download uh bundle which includes PDF ePub and Kindle formats the Epub and Kindle formats if I'm being honest I didn't do such a great job with them they're kind of they're kind of so the PDF though I can stand behind but all of this is old and you shouldn't look at it I mean you can look at it I'm sorry there's there's there's something there that's still meaningful because it is a doc it is a thing that came out in the world in 2012 that's important to look back on and think about but if you are looking for the latest and most uptodate version of this the ideas that started in this particular book then this is not the place for you the place for you on some level is this and I'm going to at the moment actually just trigger a quick uh GitHub action where do I run this did the interface change or is it just because it's not there what's going on here where's the button for running the action oh I'm not signed in I'm like what's going on here it's because I'm not signed in okay sorry everybody oh speaking of being unprepared at least the password is kind of saved in there I'm gonna have to two factor in though give me a moment here Talk Amongst yourselves I am reading the comments while I can steal away a moment I don't really care that you're seeing this right now it will expire before you can hack into my account okay let's go to the actions this takes a little while so that's why I wanted to run this run workflow run workflow okay so this is the repo for the new version of the book now this is actually your um the the sorry the build system for the new version of the book the content of the book is actually in this repo but where the content is being worked on is not in this repo it's actually being worked on in a collection of notion documents and what I just did there very quickly was I ran this GitHub action which connects to the notion API by the way I'd really love to do a whole video it often likes to time out so let's try running it again this is going it's going remarkably well uh it is um it is an action that uses the notion API to go and collect all of the material that I've written reformat repackage it and bring it into this repo so that it can then be built and published to a website I wonder if there's actually uh it often times out but I wonder if there's something else going on no request a notion API failed with status 502 does anybody know what 502 is notion client maybe then is the API just down that's probably rerunning the job I'm gonna try it one more time this is something I will certainly look at later on my own time figure out why this isn't working so that process would bring in all of the written content to these HTML files it brings in all of the code examples to these uh other collections of JavaScript and HTML files and it also brings in all of these images which are all of these uh screenshots and various illustrations and things that are in notion and then all of that goes to if I go back here bad Gateway server error response serverwise get received an invalid response from the Upstream server so to look and see what that is that's what error 502 is someone's telling me in the chat to here uh this does this actually go somewhere it does now excellent okay so here is the most recent version of the book in progress why my desk is really quite high today um and my green screen is all a mess but whatever I'm just I'm doing my best here my best is quite inadequate these days on so many levels just trying all that I can do and uh so this is what you should look at now uh what's exciting about where I am with the project is all of the chapters have been drafted even if I go here into whoa this is a I have a formatting error that's fine though uh even if I go to this very last chapter it is now written the thing about it is there's a lot of placeholder stuff in here uh the illustrations aren't finished this is what they ask you to look for you can see there's some sort of like notes in there like what do you think about having uh what do you think about having a little illustration here so um just be aware this is an inprogress draft but you can read it now if you notice things that are wrong mistakes you can file them as issues in the GitHub repo and if you want to support this project there are a few things you can do one is you could go to this sponsor button right here and you can sponsor uh the coding terrain through uh you know GitHub sponsorship patreon uh YouTube membership and also here's the nebula link and then um you can also um preorder the physical book so I think right here if I click on this link um again the book will be Creative Commons licensed and available for free online but if you want to have the physical version um I'm I'm thrilled to be working with no starch press who will be work Printing and distributing all of that and you can preorder it right now can you do the Halloween stream that is such a good idea no flap um I would love to do a Halloween stream I don't know how or when to do that but um I mean I should do it on Halloween I'm never going to remember this right now so let's uh people in the Discord and on the internet on social media just bug me around midoctober actually why don't you wait can you wait till after like October 16th or 17th maybe after October 20th wait till after October 20th and start bugging me about doing a Halloween stream okay good we got it yes okay deal uh you love the costume that was so long ago I used to do such silly things like that every okay so Richard Gill asks everything in P5 and thank you Richard Gill for supporting through membership everything in uh nature of code is it p5.js so correct this version of the book like if I just go to chapter two for example and start scrolling through let's actually go to like chapter seven because it's uh maybe a little more interesting to see something a little further in um there's like a weird bug here where these images are cut off I don't know what's going on there so many things are going wrong today but if I scroll down to where I get to finally one of the examples here it is so when I get to one of the examples this is an example oh this is the next coding challenge I'm going to do too which is the Wolfram Elementary CA what you'll notice in the book I'm obviously writing and describing about the concepts and how I'm writing the code then there is an embedded example that I can reset I can pause reset Etc um got a code snippet here and then I can click right here and it will open a new window and now I've got that code example right here in the P5 web editor if I want to experiment with it so yes the reason why I'm using the main reason I'm using p5.js for this iteration of the book is to be able to have all of the examples easily Run online embedded inside the book it is my intention it is my plan and I love that Robert Richard are just saying hello to each other in the chat what a wonderful thing it is my plan to Port all of the examples to processing as well most of them already are so I will be uh you know I gotta finish a lot of the details I need to get done but the idea like the materials that would be part of the book's materials would include processing and p5.js version of the examples and then I do expect people will report them to a lot of other environments as well I have a GitHub a document that's actually keeping track of a list of ton of ports that people have done over the years of the earlier verses of the examples okay um so um so yeah so that's what's happening with nature of code book uh I welcome your uh participation and enthusiasm and encouragement for this project in any way that you can stay tuned the things that I have left to do before it's really done I need to write the introduction the acknowledgments I'm just doing this is more for me right now uh there's going to be an appendix about how to draw make creatures thank you to Zana marshes doing all the illustrations for this it's gonna be appendix a couple of appendix in the book that I need to finish uh in collaboration with her um there's a lot of illustrations that haven't been finished got to finish the cover or think about the cover some stuff for the interior a lot of things there's a long todo list uh I need to close all seven 75 of these issues so there's a lot of stuff uh that needs to be done but that's that's kind of where I am uh and and I would say this to me is the biggest roadblock right now to me really working on the coding train because this has to get done it's got a deadline I have commitments to it in terms of with the publisher and every free moment that I have that's not something that I am doing with my family or for my students at NYU usually that's where I would turn to the coding train and these days that's where I turn to the nature of code book so that's the way things are going right now um okay I talked about nature of code let's talk about hacktoberfest and maybe there's even something related to the coding trade logo that we could work into that so hacktoberfest what is it this is no uh let me let me take a look let's see there I I forget who runs it I think it's is it by GitHub itself is it okay so 10th year oh it's presented by digital ocean Ila and app right so I have no official um participation with uh I'm not I'm not a official representative of hacktoberfest uh I have no sponsorship relationship with them nothing like that I mention it because it's a nice initiative to bring people into open source and uh part of my mission with the code and train is to help people have a friendly place to be able to participate in open source as well um and so it's there's a nice alignment there and thank you Eric for your nice comments and I hope your second year of university is going well all right so what is hacktoberfest I don't actually know September is the perfect time to prepare for hectoberfest get a jump start by finding projects contribute to adding the Oktoberfest tag to your projects or familiar exercises yourself let's get okay so first of all step number one I don't have my bell which would be useful I do know where it is I'm walking over to get it right now I'm also going to bring bring my little time since clock by the way since my last live stream do you all want to know how many seconds have passed I know this is probably hard for you to see uh it has been 3 million 700 oh no no no oh no wait this is minutes hours I should know how this Clock Works anyway that's how much time has passed I love this project time since launch you should I I talked a lot about it my last live stream you can you can look that up okay I like to put it here so people can see it but then I have to raise the desk a little bit otherwise it doesn't show up and it's not going to show up anyway back here maybe focus focus shiftman okay get a jump start by finding projects to contribute to you found a project to contribute to the coding trade adding the hacktoberfest tag to your projects all right is that a thing I should do right am I supposed now I know there's some complicated discussion about this that we've had internally amongst the coding train team um Jennifer Nesbitt I do I do have a designer helping me on the cover but I'd love to hear from you about what ideas you might have and I'm open to um hearing more so please uh best way is to join the Discord you can send me a message there um uh all right so first of all I'm just curious which is a quick peek and see if I go back to the nature of code repo did that thing go just curious if that action completed no so I'll have to investigate why the actions aren't working later but back to hacktoberfest so let's say let's take a look let's so so let's look at the coding train uh repos let's start let's start by making a new well I I'm trying I have about a half an hour I'm trying to think of what I want to do but these are this is the kind of all right can I please finish the sentence apparently not okay oh let me just check ah oh oh I'm getting act uh start bugging you my mailing okay okay okay all right by the way there's a wonderful question that I forgot to address uh by interoctave all in the Discord member chat so first of all members any disc any members people who have signed up through YouTube membership or patreon or GitHub sponsorship the stickers have all come in I have a whole new batch of coding train stickers with the new logo and some new stickers and there's a glowinthedark sticker there's a holographic sticker the mailing for that is going to be going out beginning of October so stay tuned you you make sure you're in the Discord and you have the supporter role that way you'll get the message for how to get your stickers and if anybody's really interested in the stickers you know now's your time because I'm gonna be sending them out very soon once a year mailing it's our new thing okay now Oktoberfest oh the translation I want to address this because it's a wonderful question from interactive all I would very much like to have translations of the nature of code book I have to finish everything I have to do with it before that can start but I'm we're getting very close to there uh I don't remember what date I said to bothered me about a Halloween after October 20th that would be also a good time to bother me about the translations uh I got it I would think November 1st let's put it on November 1st start messaging me if you're interested in doing a translation in the nature of code book and um I what I will probably do is put you in touch with the publisher there's really two questions there uh one is can I get the website translated and have like a a a really easy system of doing that a night so that maybe you know in a fantasy world uh you know there might be a language button on this page here where I could just change it to for example Spanish and the website which only be in Spanish so that's a that's one aspect of this that is something that I have a lot of agency over in terms of translating for a print version of the book that will be something that um that no starch will uh the no search press will lead the process of and I know they're excited to do that so um in terms of partnering with translators and other Publishers and other countries um all of that I'm excited to work on but that will um that way so the stickers are not there's no really there is one place where you can buy some stickers for the coding train which is in the nebulous store I have a coding train page which has a sticker sheet there um but none of the new stickers are there the stickers are really something I send out as gifts for people who subscribe to some of the crowdfunding options for the site or I give to people in person when I go to an event or see them so if I happen to have them on the street with me on the street I can get I mean I often have stickers just my backpack so if I run into somebody else the hand of a sticker uh all right now so that was the that was about the translation oh did you see that my reflexes I still got it still got it okay uh all right now hacktoberfest so back to the coding train so any of these repos in my mind are fair game for Oktoberfest and they're all have varying degrees of being active actively being worked on versus an old thing that's just kind of languishing there and also you're you know in terms of documentation and request for actual help so if anybody sees a repo here that they want to ask about um let me know I've been doing some some new things I just started like for example um I you know this is brand new as of a few days ago I started like working with some experiments with the YouTube API um you can see some other things on here all everything's fair game as far as I'm concerned but I think probably the most important place for you to think about contributing would be here at the codenttrain.com website so uh hopefully there's a lot of wonderful people in the community who help to maintain the website um and you can and and maybe if we can uh do some work on this I'll try to add maybe some issues or some information as a guide somewhere to some suggested things you can work on but one of the nicest ways that you could if you're a total beginner to this world that you could do a pull request that's part of hacktoberfest would be by adding a project that you've made related to one of the videos that I've put out to the passenger showcase the passenger showcase as I may have mentioned is here this is part of the website where it's just essentially an infinite scroll of sorted by uh chronologically of projects people have contributed so number one this is a wonderful place for you to look for inspiration and see what other fellow Travelers in the coding train Community are making you can also do things like I noticed Kathy has made many many so uh oops that goes to how do I oh no I I thought we were gonna that's a feature we were going to add where you click on somebody's name and it takes you to all of their showcase projects but right now I can filter by somebody so if I filter by Kathy I can see all of Kathy's showpace projects on this page and essentially it is a you know portfolio page for any given if you want to have a little portfolio page of your peop your sketches and projects you could kind of use the coding trade website for that it's not really well suited for that there's other tools like open processing and all sorts of other you know build your own website things but on some level you can collect all of the things you've made related to coding trade videos onto one page so how do you do that the main way that people do that under the guides here you can find this passenger showcase guide so if I click on that um then here is a form so this forum allows you to first pick like oh what collection of videos did you just watch was it a coding challenge you never just watch it it's basically the way that the the system works is every project is associated with a video and I know it's sometimes tricky to figure out like does it make sense for this video or that video but you know we we just all use our best judgment and try to make it work the best we can so for example if you were watching a beginner's guide to machine learning you would find like oh here's all the videos here maybe I made a video that was used um you know object detection and so I'm gonna click on that and I'm gonna submit my project to there now most commonly people are making projects related to the coding challenges for example I think it's the 10 print I got 178 of them really slowed down uh the 10 print I don't know I don't know I think was it like 82 no that's a Chrome extension does anybody see it here and it doesn't matter I don't have to pick it here um I could just pick anything like double pendulum and then you can enter all your information so what this form does I'm getting the point here this form generates a pull request to the GitHub repository for the website however if you want to so if you want to get your project on the website this is your easiest path to doing it however if you want to participate in hacktoberfest you can actually do you can submit your project without this form through GitHub itself I want to show you a little bit about how to do that right now and that will then give you a hacktoberfest uh accepted pull request so let me see if I can walk you through a little bit about that right now so a couple things one is ah one is on this passenger showcase guide and this is a mental note to myself in the community we could probably improve this um you can also we have some instructions here for how to do that so the form will do this automatically but the manual way of creating the pull request for Oktoberfest is here below these instructions might need a little updating I'm not sure I'll have to take a look at that but let me show you a little bit about that right now and I'm just checking the uh checking the chat okay um all right so uh coming back to here so let's say the first thing so let's go let's pretend we're going to do 10 print and I'm looking at the time so I'm going to uh 10 print is I believe the coding challenge that has the most passenger showcase projects you can see them all here on this page that includes the video the code example other references an archive of the live stream where I actually originally did the challenge and things like that so you know if you're new to the coding train and you're wondering is there a lot of stuff I can go back and look at there's a lot there's a lot personally okay so if you wanted to submit to this of course you could use the form but if you're not using the form and you're participating in hacktoberfest what you would do is you need to find the video first so content is the place where all of the individual files directories for the videos and their Associated passenger showcases live so I'm going to click on content then I need to find ah then under videos is where I'm looking there's other in stuff here that's useful but videos is what we're looking for and here now is this becomes a little bit of detective work but it's pretty easy if you're doing a challenge so that the folder naming is a little wonky all the videos that are everywhere on the site but for the challenges it's not too hard I can just go here and I can see ah there is a directory for every single one so what was 10 print what number was 10 print 10 print was number 76. so back to here I'm going to go and find number 76 scrolling around I've got it and we can see here okay so what is here on GitHub first and foremost just so you are aware there is the JS this individual Json page this is the metadata for the videos and by the way one of the things about the system that I have built with I I barely did any of this work so I know that depong in particular has a ton of work on this this Json file there's a script that's part of the repo that will generate the YouTube description for it so this is all the metadata for this particular video and this is another thing you could contribute to for hacktoberfest some of them could might have typos uh in the time codes maybe the the they're missing a link it could be improved there's all sorts of things you could think about to improve and and I was gonna say punch up these pages to give them a bit more but what you're looking for is here showcase notice now here that there are all these files contribution number.json contributionnumber.png some of them have what like a much larger number some of them have a smaller number all you need to create to submit your project to the coding Train website is to add to this directory and most of the directors won't be this full and if you find a video that doesn't have any showcase projects you have to create the directory but most of them do at this point you need to add to this directory two files a Json file and a PNG let's just look at what these look like let's look at contribution 12. and your Json file just needs to have a few things in it needs to have a title of your project an author name a URL of the project and a time stamp for when it was submitted using this particular format and the coding train Discord the GitHub issues these are places where you can post and ask about to get help doing this if it's confusing cough is asking if I do a coding challenge but use Unity would it be valid Not only would it be valid that's what I'm hoping for the whole point of this is not about using the tools that I'm using and following the way that I do things but sharing the way that you do things and the tools that you use with the community the fact that the Showcase projects are linked to their videos is just a way of organizing them by theme and I don't have a great way for people like I made something I want to share it but I don't it's not associated with a video there's no place for that right now on the website but um but yes absolutely um okay so um so this is the format for the Json file by the way the author name can also have a URL so you can have a separate URL which is of your own social media or website in addition to just this URL we looked at other ones we might see that um and then uh oops which which one was that was that number 17 I don't even remember now which one 12 not 17. then if I look at contribution so you need a file called actually it doesn't even have to have the word contribution in it I don't remember somebody might know this in the chat uh the instructions are good for the challenges still okay yeah um so um I don't remember whether it actually has to be called contribution but it just needs to have a unique name uh with a number so the um the form uh has a I don't know if I forgot what it uses a time stamp or something for naming the file but if you create your own through a manual process for hacktoberfest you just need to say contribution some number that isn't already listed so and then you need to both name your Json file and the PNG the same name so now you can see this is the thumbnail image and if I were to go to the uh that page I've already lost it oh this is the deploy preview do I have the I'll just find it again 10 print go to this page you can see here that by the way this the order of the projects on this page is random and different every time I load it if you're wondering like well how do I get to be first refresh depending on the number of challenges eventually you'll be first so if I go through at some point we're going to see that one um I saw the name but it looks like a different thumbnail so yeah here it is so we can see this is the one we were looking at um and it shows up here and by the way if I were to click on it it's going to take me to the page for the actual project the wonderful uh I love these colors I love the ones and zeros what a wonderful job from hater Ali Punjabi so um so that's the process I'm not uh you know as you might uh be realizing I'm not and I would love to to find a different time to maybe do this if that would be helpful but if you've never used GitHub before I kind of told you about how it works and I showed you where some instructions are but you're going to have some trouble probably you're going to want you to ask questions so you could get help the places where you can get help is you can file an issue so you can type new issue title it I need help submitting my passenger showcase project write about what you need help with what your questions are and someone hopefully hopefully I or somebody else from the community will be able to answer your questions and help you out there the other place is the coding train Discord where there are help channels uh and lots of other people there who are available to answer questions and help you get your project into the passenger showcase so to summarize the easiest way to get your project into the passenger showcase is with this form if you want to participate in hacktoberfest you can follow these instructions for how to do it manually through a pull request but if you're new to all this that's not going to be the easiest thing in the world for you to do so raise your hand ask for help the coding train Community is here to help you figure that out I would like very much for it to be a welcoming and friendly place for you to make your first attempt at a pull request regardless of how many times you fail or how many mistakes you made that is the point um okay now what else do I want to say so I'm I'm closing in on the end of this live stream and I want to talk about something new which is and I'm going to minimize some things which is this so this is I can't remember if I how much I showed this the last time I was live streaming I think I did now that I think about it but anyway uh this is a new logo for the coding train um with this wonderful little uh ASCII art like illustration of a train it is made with simple shapes lines and circles um also a little a catchphrase traveling the wonderful world of code another idea for the catchphrases artisanal handcrafted code but um anyway this is what it had so far um and you can see that inside this scene in this wallpaper the reason why I'm bringing this up and one of the reasons for this new logo was to have something that could connect more directly with p5.js and processing and so for example if you go to the processing website you'll notice here this is the processing logo and if you click on open editor you'll see this is code to draw this particular logo and you can do things like you know change the color I could change a number actually and it's going to like change how it looks the design all of that so I am now going to go to the p5.js web editor and by the way the new stickers have the logo and all sorts of other stuff which is very exciting the other thing I'm doing with the stickers is a lot of the stickers the new stickers are just literal visualizations of some of the examples so there's like a whirly noise sticker like end body simulation sticker but let's see if I can log in here uh and do open and look for maybe logo copy copy I don't know why there's a copy copy in this one but let's let's try this and here it is okay so here is now the P5 sketch and by the way as much as I said artisanal handcrafted code the way I actually generated this is the design was made with uh I don't know whether Jason actually used illustrator or what tool he used but I have an SVG formatted file of the design and I used a large language model to convert that into uh the code with just drawing every line individually so it is a little bit ridiculous like probably the example for this doesn't need this level of precision for all the pixel values but this is my ask for you and I think this is a good place for us to for me to start a new repo that could also be part of hacktoberfest so let's think about this I would love for people to remix this logo maybe I should do like a video about it giving some ideas and some techniques or like demonstrating it but right now all I have is the literal a hardcoded values of the design but what would it mean for it to animate what would it mean for it to break apart come back together what kind of creative things make it sound responsive change the colors I would love to see what people who from the community could do remixing this logo and playing with it and I think there could be a lot of fun stuff and and I just want to say um Jeff Wagner who I know has been posting a ton of stuff in the chat uh thank you for all of your kind comments okay and gisha thanks for asking how I'm feeling honestly like I know I'm feeling good but I I'm I'm I feel like I'm really struggling to keep up with work and by work I mean teaching and the nature of code book and the YouTube channel and all these emails that I have to respond to so I feel very out of sorts and disorganized like my um they just I feel off and some of that might just be getting older can't do as much some of it might be just the last few years of everything that sort of changed in the world some of it might just be this fall semester is particularly busy but I think it's mostly just that I'm trying to really finish the nature of code book project so anyway but thanks for asking okay uh now um all right so what do I want to so I think maybe what I'm going to do this is a spur of the moment idea uh let's create very quickly a GitHub repo for this for the logo and I don't know what should actually go in it but let's give this a start okay so I'm going to call this I'm going to put it in coding drain what should I call it a coding train logo unfortunately there's another name like anyway I'll just call it that it's going to be public it's going to have a readme file it's going to be for lack of a different option right now that I MIT license I mean the design I would say is maybe Creative Commons noncommercial but I'm not going to worry about that right now and now ordinarily what I would do which I think makes sense maybe I should do what I would ordinarily do so order there's so many different ways to create a repository on GitHub what you saw me do just now is manually create one during using the interface and honestly what I was thinking is like oh let me just add some new files to it like I could actually add that let's just do this this is kind of wacky but let's add index.html and we're just going to go here and we're going to uh paste this in there yeah yeah why not I don't need the sound library right now and I feel like it should but you know the whole point is that people can improve this so I'm not even going to worry about it and I'm going to say uh creating index.html that's perfectly I'm committing to the main branch just just going with it then add another file I'm going to add a file called sketch.js and uh I'm going to put that in here beautiful I'm gonna commit that and say create sketch.js I'm going to go into this file I'm going to you know what I'm going to do is I'm going to make an empty style.css file I'm going to create add a file called uh style.css but I'm not going to worry about what goes in it just yet somebody's asking about quaternions in the chat hilarious okay so now I have this repo if I add do I add to the topics is that where the thing that yapa put hacktoberfest topics is this where the hacktoberfest thing goes is that what I'm supposed to do let's just put it in there and see okay so now this is a hacktoberfest repo I'm making this repo specifically for Oktoberfest as well I might regret this later we'll see what happens um and now what I want to do and I'm going to just I so I have my GitHub linked to netlify and I like to build so I could use GitHub pages to host this sort of main page that um has the logo thing I mean I should just use GitHub pages right now and I'll switch it later but I just don't know what this is going to reveal if I go into my settings so um let me I'm doing this without you being able to look at it um and where is I'm just going to go down to GitHub pages um and I'm going to do it from the main branch employee from a branch I might switch this over to like a netlify build or something later but right now I just uh oh you can't see this hold on let me just finish what I was doing and then you'll be able to see it I lost we're okay uh where is the pages GitHub Pages ah Pages there it is sorry sorry sorry sorry I don't understand I uh all right I'm just gonna assume that this is working now I'm going to come back to here usually okay so now let's see if I go to codingtrain.github.io coding train dash logo did I get that wrong or maybe just hasn't built yet so I once I get this working the sketch would appear here so what do I think this repo is for now here's what I think couple things one is so you know uh just I'm gonna I'll make like a uh live stream brainstorming list uh these are things I'm looking for help with for hacktoberfest later I should break these into separate issues so first of all what are things that might improve this repo um that you might like to suggest in the chat I'm keeping an eye on it um all right so first of all uh read me that explains what the coding train is an image of the logo and what this repo is all about so you could work on the readme um create the the best uh or like any changes that improve how the code reads for beginners and makes it easier to build upon maybe a system for people to add their own variations of the logo this is a bigger project um what else uh ports of the logo to other languages what else so this is the idea I'm trying to think of a list of things that people could work on for this particular repo so I'm going to submit this issue and there we go so this is a repo that I am setting up without much of a plan if I'm being honest which share and and also let's put this in at least in the in the readme let me um just put this here so it's there um this the idea for this repo is maybe I can maybe it can be a friendly place a sort of small low stakes project that people could kind of practice using git and GitHub with like you could pull requests all sorts of stuff here and we can sort of play around with it similarly to my uh that rainbow the poem repo that goes along with my git and GitHub video tutorials so that's the last thing on my agenda for today um besides so I want to talk about the new processing course out now on nebula pinned comment if you want access to that I wanted to talk about the nature of code book which is coming along you can read it online you can preorder it and I wanted to talk about how I intend to hopefully participate in hacktoberfest and how you can submit to the passenger showcase and start this new repo maybe to help people play around with their own variations of the coding train logo did my um now before I go it did just happen to notice here that there are a lot of pull requests right now in the actual coding train repo itself so one is from me that I forgot that I did so one thing I did by the way here's something that you could do uh also with the website all of the videos are associated with topics and languages and I was noticing when I was searching for some Pi Day videos like I have a video about the leibniz um uh formula for approximating pi the uh how Pi in the mandelbrot set are related buffon's needle all these videos related to Pi approximation and Pi Day but the uh topics list was not consistent between them so I was updating that so that's the one thing that I am that people can contribute to if you're looking for a nonshowcase way to contribute to the website is to look at um you know if I go to the challenges for example and I search by like fractal I wouldn't be surprised if there's a coding challenge that deals with fractals that maybe I missed or that some topic or tag is sort of inconsistently Applied so that's something that um people can help with I'm going to go ahead and merge this one I think I was waiting for the tests to pass and I forgot so I'm going to merge this pull request that I made um then you'll see all of these shows oh Kathy who does a wonderful job curating uh the featured showcases and challenges that are on the home page uh apologies for missing this um this is from a couple weeks ago let's let these update I'm going to merge Kathy's work here um and let's look now and then oh updating ah so this is uh Depot Sam who is working on updating some of the contributing guides so hopefully this will as this gets updated it'll help with more instructions information for Oktoberfest but let's look at these showcase submissions right now there are five of them and let's see if I can get through them so I just clicked on one and I don't know what happened where am I I've lost I have too many tabs open let me close all these tabs here we are so this is rampana who has created quite a few contributions as of late let's take a look at this so one uh let's take a look at their work here um oh look at that what a fun spiral with rotating rainbow colors great work Pana so I since I'm doing this live I'm just going to merge it often I try to write a little nice comment an encouraging friendly supportive comment it's going to go ahead and merge this one and we'll see hopefully these appear as I merge them the website will rebuild takes a little time let's look at this heart curve one hey wait a second it's Panna again welcome to the coding train Pana hour uh let's look at this uh and oh that is a very cute little bear bear with a heart pulsing and a bone or is it a puppy I'm not really sure but I love it I love all the variables I guess that's meat I don't know that I've seen a variable called meat before but I quite enjoy that um and let's go ahead and merge this wonderful project and now let's go to ah wave function collapse what are we gonna get here oh interesting Dorian makza and Apologies by mispronouncing name created a PHP tiled wave function collapse so let's take a look at this so here as you can see very legitimate and encouraged to use um to use nonup to use other platforms besides P5 and processing the PHP is quite shocking like at least on made way function collapse with PHP that's incredible let's go to their website to see oh this is incredible wow circuit board oh this is so cool simple demo oh wow this is incredible let me try doing 50 space station that's oh 15 is the max okay amazing wow I love this um so if you're not familiar with wave function collapse there's another algorithm also that from many years ago called Model synthesis which is uh very very similar in terms of the tiled model um you can watch my video on it I don't know I don't know what you'll think of it but certainly there um and you can see that this I this is a really incredible documentation and really incredible work so um now let's see here I am going to yes and this is linked to Dorian so I'm going to make sure I leave a comment here this is incredible emerging live okay I don't know if that will make any sense to anybody but um maybe later I can time code when I looked at this um for Dorian to see if they're not watching live right now okay so now there's two fluid simulations sometimes we get redundant ones let me just sort of check so I I didn't finish my thought wave function collapse is an algorithm that looks at a grid and essentially fills each spot of the Grid in with one of some number of options of tiles And Then There are rules for what tiles are allowed to P appear next to each other and with those rules you can generate all sorts of different kinds of patterns so this is from EG back by Rockstar based on the fluid simulation which is one of which is wild uh to see that someone actually was actually able to make something maybe from watching that video this looks like oh there's a nice MP4 this is made in processing hey let's download this I want to just download this because it's the processing why not open it up uh download and we can look at the sketch so first of all there's a nice MP4 in here that's pretty cool that is pretty lovely so my guess is maybe so one of the in my fluid simulation video I create perhaps what is the least optimized slowest version ever of fluid of fluid simulation so I don't know and we I'm guessing when we run the processing sketch if it's based on my code it will render every frame very very slowly which then makes sense to render out a video so you can watch it more quickly that said this person might have improved the code greatly and optimized it because it is possible to do fluid simulation with all sorts of uh Excel Hardware accelerated and other techniques to make it work better hello Elkin in the chat uh thank you for your support Elkin are you in the Discord with the supporter tag because the stickers are going to be going out very soon to supporters so check and message if you're not okay let's open this up in processing and see what we've got uh keep it keep it keep it not not right now I do want to get the so I think I messed something up probably let me sometimes processing it's in it it's able to handle this more elegantly now but it's probably my fault sometimes having the um it works better if the pde name is the same as the no and still so I'm not sure what I I wouldn't be surprised if I'm doing something wrong here but I'm not able to get this to run right now maybe somebody can help me figure that out later but this is excellent documentation and we were able to see the video um oh and this is also combined with the purlin noise flow field coding challenge so it could go with that coding challenge as well I don't have a way for showcase projects to be tagged for multiple videos right now so you just have to pick one but this is incredible a minute let's see if they're uh yeah this is incredible I'm reviewing it now during a live stream but I had trouble getting the processing code to run the video is perfect the video is perfect um did I miss something I'm just going to put a little screenshot now of this and attach that to here and one little another little trick I'm going to show you is when you upload an image to like a GitHub issue it's going to do a lot of nice things for you automatically and that image is right here in the issue but one thing it will not do is generate an ALT tag that has any meaning it's just using the name of the file so screen so I like to adjust that when I can for accessibility screenshot of processing IDE with error message and then what was the error message so this is a good fluid cannot hide in closing type fluid cannot hide enclosing type so I'm going to add that in there and now um anybody who's reading this issue with a screen reader will have a description of this image of course my description was not comprehensive I didn't list all the code but I edited down to what I felt was like made the most sense for this context I suppose I'm inadvertently training somebody's large image generator model by labeling images for them but it's worth it for um accessibility and James Haskin uh five years ago wow that's amazing thank you so much for watching and tuning in and supporting the channel okay now uh let's merge this pull request I'm gonna merge it I am going to get back to the pull requests I'm going to look at this one which looks like this was a duplicate so I'm I'm going to say I merged this happened sometimes with the form uh this is one two one two two nine so one two two eight uh closing this one so let's do that excellent just doing a little maintenance here a little cleanup of the old coding Train website um and I'm gonna go here and yeah there's a few so now now we're now we're in good shape there's only six open pull requests this is um for the new logging processing video won't be in it it finished till that is on YouTube um this is something the tpom is working on this is somebody who really gave a heroic effort to try to manually add a showcase project but um we need to fix it up still and then I forget what these are I think there's some open questions about which videos those go with but I'll have to deal with those another time okay um so uh thank you all for tuning in today to this live stream I am going to turn this a little this little song I'm Gonna Play in the background down um I'm sorry that this was kind of short on structured disorganized messy unhelpful boring I don't know whatever criticism you want to lob at it I'm sorry for that um I wanted to at least turn on the equipment fire up the old camera machine to take pictures of me and beam them out to you on the internet live just to update you on what's going on at a minimum I always want to have a live stream at least once a month on the coding train and I'm excited to see what happens when the new beginner processing video comes out on YouTube if it brings more people back to the channel My Views are declining at a rather extreme Pace but it kind of makes sense because I haven't published anything new in quite some time it's fine I don't it's no problem we're gonna get back to it gonna make some more challenges get the get the old grind the gears of the code machine make it happen write some artisanal handcrafted code it's coming uh Daniel Rubio says thank you for the channel uh Barney says no need to apologize and cough says it was an amazing live stream I love your energy oh you're all saying such nice things to me it's so nice also I I don't know if any of you notice but the Baltimore Orioles are in first place in the American League East they're leaving Tampa Bay hoping to go to one of their last games of the Season got to make the trip down to Baltimore to catch them it has been there I think it was was it 86 when I was a kid and they won the World Series or made it to the World Series I was a young lad back then in the 19 the 1900s I have like this new hip pain thing I gotta go to physical therapy for that I look so young people always you know I don't know what's happened let's can I show you this I find this a little distressing like I don't uh let's just turn off the sound here we don't need the sound but you know this is me now I look energetic healthy I look all right look at that young whippersnapper with no gray hair and Perfect Skin no bald spots no back pain you know what happened to that guy oh that's that's more like it there you go I do have new glasses do you like that but go go Orioles come on all you tell you don't care about baseball nobody cares about as well you might as well root for the Orioles oh the song ran out um okay I'm gonna answer this question I think I've seen in the chat maybe a thousand times has there been a challenge about make your own Gan uh no but I did a bunch of live streams with an auto making an auto encoder with tensorflow.js so you might go back and find those uh can I make Super Mario Brothers Olivia am asks I would really like to get back to oh in suik thank you for that very kind uh Super Chat there it's very kind of you um and uh they're moving to Vegas the A's are moving to Vegas not the Orioles I hope that's what you're talking about but um I already forgot what I was saying but oh yeah if you're interested in that go look at the auto encoder videos oh so what's coming up next I am teaching in my class in just a couple weeks how to make a Discord bot so um next time I'm back in the studio I'm going to be recording new Discord bot tutorials if you have ideas and thoughts about that come into the Discord the Cody frame Discord and chat about that um I guess there was another there were two there was suik and there's another like I can't really understand there's like a couple different people's profile things I don't understand how this YouTube thing works um this is this is all too much for me okay let's just go back to here if we could all look so please try something with that coding train logo and share it with me on social media I would love that uh if we can remember Kathy if you want to help with this you're welcome to but you don't have to you can try to like time code and um put um time code and put like various links and things that I've talked about in the video description I'll have that up uh if I can get my act together pretty soon um and the next live stream will maybe be a Halloween one what should I wear what costume should I have what should we code let's do a spooky Halloween okay thanks everybody I'm gonna head out of here now and see you all oh what's a catchphrase okay uh All Aboard no that's not a good one that's that's at the beginning All Aboard oh uh what do you say when people get off the train have a great trip no thanks for riding I don't know don't never forget that this Dot s .com let's do this dot this stock this stock s never forget this stuff I'm going to do this stuff this dot this dot this dot this Dot Song never forget this Dot somebody compose that song for me I'm gonna say once again Here We Go sing it with me coordinates thank you autotune and the internet will fix that for me sing it with me Cartesian coordinates let's look forward to Cartesian coordinates unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what else is there yes kittens thank you very much kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice that look what I get I'm really losing my mind okay let's do it again the kittens again kittens and kittens I feel just sort of like a nice feeling of relaxation everything's gonna be okay today dream is not broken it has not frozen this isn't this is a wonderful thing okay we're gonna do it I'm really getting to something I need my sound effect foreign that I will use continuously over and over again all sorts of text generation analysis things that I will use continuously over and over again first thing I need to do is yes okay we're gonna do it kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens at dasada
