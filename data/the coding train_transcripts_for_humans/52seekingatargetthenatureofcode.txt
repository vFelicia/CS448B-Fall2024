00:00 - Welcome back.
00:00 - If you made it through the
previous video, oh, mwah.
00:03 - Thank you so much.
00:04 - In this one, I'm just
going to get right down
00:06 - into writing the code.
00:07 - What am I talking about?
00:08 - "Steering Behaviors for
Autonomous Characters."
00:11 - All of the examples I'm
going to code and show you
00:14 - are based on the 1999
paper by Craig Reynolds.
00:18 - I talk a lot more about
that in the previous video.
00:20 - You could go back
and watch that.
00:21 - Here, I need to start somewhere.
00:23 - And the canonical example to
demonstrate a steering force
00:28 - is the steering behavior seek
or pursuit of a static target.
00:33 - Now, I'm about to go
diagram this myself,
00:35 - but I just want to point
something out here.
00:37 - Steering equals desired
velocity minus velocity.
00:41 - That's all there is to it.
00:43 - It's a very simple formula.
00:45 - Now, what the desired
velocity actually is--
00:49 - that's the tricky question.
00:51 - The good news for seek--
00:53 - it's pretty easy to come up
with the desired velocity.
00:55 - But as we get to more
and more examples,
00:58 - and as you make
your own behaviors,
01:01 - thinking about what is
the objects, the entities,
01:04 - the creature, the particle,
the vehicle's desire
01:08 - is incredibly important.
01:09 - So let's map out a
scenario in p5.js.
01:18 - So what do I have?
01:19 - I have a vehicle that's
my particle or mover
01:21 - object essentially.
01:22 - I'm going to draw
it as a triangle.
01:24 - It's got a current velocity.
01:25 - And then I've also got a target.
01:26 - So the first question
that needs to be asked
01:29 - is, what is the
desired velocity?
01:35 - Going back to Reynolds'
paper, this is where we are.
01:37 - We're on the action
selection step.
01:39 - What are the goals for
this particular vehicle?
01:42 - Maybe it's hungry.
01:44 - This is food.
01:45 - And its goal is to get
there to eat the food.
01:48 - Now, you might have
your own interpretation
01:50 - of this scenario, but I'm
going to put this out there.
01:52 - I think that the
vehicle's desired velocity
01:55 - is to move as fast as
it possibly can directly
01:59 - towards the target.
02:00 - For example, if it could
have this velocity,
02:04 - if that were its
velocity vector,
02:05 - it would instantly
teleport to the target.
02:08 - But we have to
remember that this is
02:10 - a world that we're designing.
02:11 - And we need to put
some constraints on it.
02:13 - Returning back to the simple
vehicle model in the paper,
02:16 - you'll notice there's a
property there called max_speed.
02:20 - This is not something that I
have necessarily introduced
02:23 - in previous examples.
02:24 - The vehicle, in addition to
having a position, a velocity,
02:28 - an acceleration, all
those types of things,
02:31 - now has a maximum speed.
02:35 - And I'm going to define
then its desired velocity
02:38 - as a vector that points
directly to the target
02:42 - with a length of maximum speed.
02:46 - Step two-- steering.
02:48 - And that is that wonderful,
beautiful, simple formula.
02:55 - The steering force is
the desired velocity
02:59 - minus its current velocity.
03:01 - Think about this for a moment.
03:02 - It actually makes
total sense, right?
03:04 - If I'm going in this
direction, but I
03:06 - want to be going
in this direction,
03:07 - the way I should steer
is the difference
03:09 - between those two things.
03:10 - It's like almost an error.
03:11 - If I'm moving in exactly the
same direction as my desired
03:14 - velocity, the difference between
all those things is zero.
03:16 - I don't need to
change my velocity.
03:18 - Now, you might be thinking,
didn't we do this already?
03:21 - Isn't this just
gravitational attraction?
03:24 - Like this particle is
attracted to this attractor?
03:27 - Well, it's very similar,
but it's quite different.
03:30 - In the gravitational
attraction example,
03:33 - the particle body had no ability
to perceive its environment.
03:38 - It didn't understand if I'm
going in this direction,
03:42 - maybe I need to compensate
for that to get to the target
03:45 - more quickly.
03:46 - It was just being pulled.
03:47 - So the force being
applied was just
03:50 - a force that points
directly from the object
03:52 - to the target in the
gravitational attraction
03:55 - example.
03:56 - Let's now look at if I were to
actually work out desired minus
03:59 - velocity, what would I see?
04:02 - This is that desired vector.
04:04 - If I take the
velocity vector, if I
04:06 - were to add desired
plus velocity,
04:09 - I would put the velocity here.
04:12 - But to subtract
desired minus velocity,
04:15 - I just take the
velocity, turn it around,
04:19 - and now I have this vector.
04:21 - This is my steering force.
04:24 - If I take this and
kind of put it up here,
04:28 - you could see how there's
an intelligence to pushing
04:31 - this vehicle further in the
direction of the target itself
04:34 - based on the fact that it's
moving in this direction.
04:37 - If you want, pause the video.
04:38 - Have this vehicle moving
in this direction,
04:40 - and then work out what's
the steering force.
04:42 - You'll see that it's different.
04:43 - And here this autonomous agent
is perceiving its environment
04:47 - by understanding where the
target is and its own velocity
04:52 - and how that plays a role
into what force it could use
04:55 - to steer towards that target.
04:56 - And this is it.
04:57 - We're ready to go to the
code because all I need to do
04:59 - is figure out, how do I
calculate this desired
05:01 - velocity?
05:02 - Then do the vector math to get
the steering force, and then
05:05 - what?
05:07 - Apply force.
05:09 - Everything else is
just all the same stuff
05:11 - that I've done in
previous videos.
05:13 - Step three-- locomotion.
05:15 - Apply force.
05:16 - Force goes into acceleration.
05:17 - Acceleration goes into velocity.
05:19 - Velocity goes into the position.
05:20 - All that stuff is all stuff
that I've done before.
05:23 - I'm going to begin with the
particle class from chapter 4
05:25 - and just change that particle
to now be called a vehicle.
05:28 - I'm going to just give it an
empty velocity to start with.
05:33 - It doesn't need the
lifetime variable anymore.
05:35 - I mean, I might
want that someday,
05:36 - but I'm going to remove that.
05:39 - And I want to add an
additional function.
05:41 - I want to add a
function called seek
05:45 - that presumably will receive
a vector, which is the target.
05:51 - Calculate the steering
force within that function.
05:54 - But before I write
the code in there,
05:56 - let's go to Setup and
Draw and create a vehicle.
06:03 - There we go.
06:04 - Now, my vehicle is
a tiny, little dot.
06:06 - Let's change that
into a triangle
06:07 - so I can see it point in the
direction that it's moving.
06:17 - There's my little triangle.
06:20 - Let's make that
quite a bit bigger.
06:23 - And there we go.
06:24 - Now I need a target.
06:31 - I'll make a vector to define
the position of the target
06:34 - at the mouse location, and
then just draw a circle there.
06:37 - And, certainly, the
target could be something
06:40 - more sophisticated, but I think
this is a quick way for me
06:42 - to demonstrate the idea.
06:45 - Vehicle.seek(target).
06:47 - Step one-- what is the desired
velocity of vector that
06:51 - points from the
vehicle's position
06:54 - to the target with a length
of magnitude of maximum speed?
07:02 - Using vector subtraction,
I now have a vector
07:04 - called desired that points
all the way from the position
07:08 - to the target.
07:09 - I need to set its
magnitude to maximum speed.
07:13 - Oh, I don't have a
maximum speed variable.
07:15 - So now I need to make one up.
07:19 - I'm going to just pick four.
07:21 - This is obviously
a major parameter
07:24 - that will really affect the
way your system behaves.
07:26 - And it might be something that
you make different vehicles
07:28 - with different maximum
speeds or initialize them
07:30 - based on some
algorithm, but I'm just
07:32 - going to hard code the
number in four right there.
07:36 - Next step-- the steering
force is the desired
07:39 - velocity minus the
actual velocity,
07:42 - the current velocity itself.
07:46 - Take that desired velocity.
07:48 - Subtract the velocity.
07:49 - And we now have it in a
force vector called steering.
07:53 - Applied force-- oh, we're
going to be going so fast.
07:57 - Well, look at that.
07:58 - It's seeking the target.
08:00 - I should probably rotate it
according to its velocity.
08:04 - Remember in chapter
3, I show that you
08:06 - could call the heading function
to get the angle associated
08:09 - with that velocity vector and
then rotate by that angle.
08:13 - And look at that.
08:13 - Look how perfectly it
steers towards that target,
08:16 - almost too perfectly.
08:18 - What am I missing?
08:19 - Well, in a way, I'm
not missing anything.
08:21 - This example is complete.
08:23 - This is the algorithm for
calculating a steering
08:25 - force based on a desired
velocity for seeking a target.
08:29 - But going back to
Reynolds' paper,
08:30 - it's important to remember
that, what is the goal here?
08:34 - The goal isn't necessarily
for the vehicle
08:37 - to reach the target
as fast as possible.
08:39 - I mean, it might be.
08:41 - But if that's
really the case, we
08:42 - have the power to
just set its location
08:45 - to the target's location.
08:46 - The goal is to simulate
motion behaviors
08:50 - in a lifelike and
improvisational manner.
08:52 - And the way that we can
really tune our system now
08:56 - is not just based on
that maximum speed.
08:59 - There's another property
here-- maximum force.
09:03 - What is this vehicle's
ability to steer?
09:06 - Is it able to turn on a dime and
instantly get to that target?
09:10 - Or does it take a lot of work
for it to change its direction
09:13 - and speed up and slow down?
09:16 - I'm going to add a
maximum force property
09:18 - and set it to
something quite low.
09:22 - The idea is that this
maximum force property
09:26 - is something that limits the
magnitude of that steering
09:30 - force.
09:30 - If the steering
force magnitude is
09:32 - less than that maximum
force, it doesn't need
09:34 - to make it that maximum force.
09:36 - That's just a maximum.
09:37 - So rather than setting
the magnitude directly
09:40 - like I did with desired, I
want to use the limit function.
09:45 - Now let's run this sketch again.
09:47 - Now, it's moving really slowly.
09:49 - Because, remember, steering
isn't just changing direction.
09:52 - It's any kind of change
in the velocity vector.
09:55 - So it starts with a
velocity vector of zero.
09:58 - It takes a while for it to
ramp up and get some speed.
10:01 - But we can quickly
see now if I were
10:03 - to change the maximum
force from 0.01 to 1,
10:10 - now we're back in that
turning on a dime.
10:12 - What happens if I make the
maximum speed even higher?
10:16 - Now you could see it's able
to steer quite effectively
10:20 - but also go much faster.
10:22 - So those properties
play a huge role
10:24 - in the behavior of the
agent in the system.
10:27 - Before I move on, I want to make
one organizational change here.
10:30 - I actually don't need separate
desired velocity and steering
10:34 - force vectors.
10:36 - Ultimately, I don't need to
save that desired velocity
10:39 - its own variable.
10:40 - So I'm actually just going to
change this to be called force,
10:44 - set its magnitude
to maximum speed,
10:46 - and then just say force
subtract this dot velocity.
10:52 - Rather than create
a new vector that
10:55 - is the result of
desired minus velocity,
10:58 - I could just
calculate the desired
11:00 - and then subtract the
velocity out of it
11:02 - and call it force the
whole way through.
11:04 - I've got a lot more
things to demonstrate.
11:06 - Namely, I want to change
this into an arrive behavior.
11:09 - So right now, you
see that the vehicle
11:11 - is shooting past the target
and has to turn back around.
11:14 - How could it have as a
goal to slow down and stop
11:16 - when it reaches the target?
11:17 - Maybe you want to
try that on your own.
11:19 - Stop.
11:20 - I'm about to say goodbye,
and I'll let it say goodbye.
11:22 - But before I say goodbye,
since I have this maximum speed
11:26 - variable, I'm really
using it in this video
11:28 - to demonstrate the idea
of setting the magnitude
11:31 - of the desired velocity.
11:32 - But if that's the
vehicle's maximum speed,
11:35 - I should also limit its
actual velocity by that.
11:40 - Ultimately, I'm not sure
how much difference that's
11:42 - going to make in the
actual end result,
11:44 - but it is an important note for
me to add that property in here
11:47 - as well.
11:47 - OK, back to me saying goodbye.
11:49 - But here's two
exercises that you
11:50 - could try if you're looking for
something to expand on this.
11:52 - One is, what happens if you
attach sliders to maximum speed
11:56 - and maximum force?
11:57 - How does that
affect the behavior
11:59 - of the vehicle in
real time as you're
12:00 - tweaking those parameters?
12:02 - Also, Reynolds
describes in his paper
12:04 - a behavior known as pursuit.
12:06 - So what if the target is moving?
12:09 - On the one hand, it could be
exactly the same algorithm
12:12 - that you just seek wherever the
current location of the target
12:14 - is.
12:15 - That's ultimately
what's happening here
12:17 - as I move it with the mouse.
12:18 - But if the vehicle is able
to perceive its environment
12:21 - and see which direction
the target is moving,
12:24 - couldn't it make a
prediction as to where
12:26 - it's going to be a
little bit in the future
12:28 - and seek that
location rather than
12:31 - the exact position of the target
itself right at this moment?
12:35 - So that's another
thing you could try.
12:37 - Take a look at how
this is explained
12:38 - in Reynolds' paper,
which I've linked
12:40 - to in the video description.
12:41 - All right.
12:42 - Next up, the arrive force and
then more and more and more.
12:46 - I don't know how many of
these I'm going to do.
12:48 - But, eventually, I'll get to--
12:49 - I would love to get to all
of them in future videos.
12:52 - Thanks for sticking with me.
12:53 - We'll look forward to
hearing what you think
12:54 - and what questions you
have in the comments.
12:56 - And I will see you
in the next video.
12:58 - [MUSIC PLAYING]

Cleaned transcript:

Welcome back. If you made it through the previous video, oh, mwah. Thank you so much. In this one, I'm just going to get right down into writing the code. What am I talking about? "Steering Behaviors for Autonomous Characters." All of the examples I'm going to code and show you are based on the 1999 paper by Craig Reynolds. I talk a lot more about that in the previous video. You could go back and watch that. Here, I need to start somewhere. And the canonical example to demonstrate a steering force is the steering behavior seek or pursuit of a static target. Now, I'm about to go diagram this myself, but I just want to point something out here. Steering equals desired velocity minus velocity. That's all there is to it. It's a very simple formula. Now, what the desired velocity actually is that's the tricky question. The good news for seek it's pretty easy to come up with the desired velocity. But as we get to more and more examples, and as you make your own behaviors, thinking about what is the objects, the entities, the creature, the particle, the vehicle's desire is incredibly important. So let's map out a scenario in p5.js. So what do I have? I have a vehicle that's my particle or mover object essentially. I'm going to draw it as a triangle. It's got a current velocity. And then I've also got a target. So the first question that needs to be asked is, what is the desired velocity? Going back to Reynolds' paper, this is where we are. We're on the action selection step. What are the goals for this particular vehicle? Maybe it's hungry. This is food. And its goal is to get there to eat the food. Now, you might have your own interpretation of this scenario, but I'm going to put this out there. I think that the vehicle's desired velocity is to move as fast as it possibly can directly towards the target. For example, if it could have this velocity, if that were its velocity vector, it would instantly teleport to the target. But we have to remember that this is a world that we're designing. And we need to put some constraints on it. Returning back to the simple vehicle model in the paper, you'll notice there's a property there called max_speed. This is not something that I have necessarily introduced in previous examples. The vehicle, in addition to having a position, a velocity, an acceleration, all those types of things, now has a maximum speed. And I'm going to define then its desired velocity as a vector that points directly to the target with a length of maximum speed. Step two steering. And that is that wonderful, beautiful, simple formula. The steering force is the desired velocity minus its current velocity. Think about this for a moment. It actually makes total sense, right? If I'm going in this direction, but I want to be going in this direction, the way I should steer is the difference between those two things. It's like almost an error. If I'm moving in exactly the same direction as my desired velocity, the difference between all those things is zero. I don't need to change my velocity. Now, you might be thinking, didn't we do this already? Isn't this just gravitational attraction? Like this particle is attracted to this attractor? Well, it's very similar, but it's quite different. In the gravitational attraction example, the particle body had no ability to perceive its environment. It didn't understand if I'm going in this direction, maybe I need to compensate for that to get to the target more quickly. It was just being pulled. So the force being applied was just a force that points directly from the object to the target in the gravitational attraction example. Let's now look at if I were to actually work out desired minus velocity, what would I see? This is that desired vector. If I take the velocity vector, if I were to add desired plus velocity, I would put the velocity here. But to subtract desired minus velocity, I just take the velocity, turn it around, and now I have this vector. This is my steering force. If I take this and kind of put it up here, you could see how there's an intelligence to pushing this vehicle further in the direction of the target itself based on the fact that it's moving in this direction. If you want, pause the video. Have this vehicle moving in this direction, and then work out what's the steering force. You'll see that it's different. And here this autonomous agent is perceiving its environment by understanding where the target is and its own velocity and how that plays a role into what force it could use to steer towards that target. And this is it. We're ready to go to the code because all I need to do is figure out, how do I calculate this desired velocity? Then do the vector math to get the steering force, and then what?

So I'm actually just going to change this to be called force, set its magnitude to maximum speed, and then just say force subtract this dot velocity. Rather than create a new vector that is the result of desired minus velocity, I could just calculate the desired and then subtract the velocity out of it and call it force the whole way through. I've got a lot more things to demonstrate. Namely, I want to change this into an arrive behavior. So right now, you see that the vehicle is shooting past the target and has to turn back around. How could it have as a goal to slow down and stop when it reaches the target? Maybe you want to try that on your own. Stop. I'm about to say goodbye, and I'll let it say goodbye. But before I say goodbye, since I have this maximum speed variable, I'm really using it in this video to demonstrate the idea of setting the magnitude of the desired velocity. But if that's the vehicle's maximum speed, I should also limit its actual velocity by that. Ultimately, I'm not sure how much difference that's going to make in the actual end result, but it is an important note for me to add that property in here as well. OK, back to me saying goodbye. But here's two exercises that you could try if you're looking for something to expand on this. One is, what happens if you attach sliders to maximum speed and maximum force? How does that affect the behavior of the vehicle in real time as you're tweaking those parameters? Also, Reynolds describes in his paper a behavior known as pursuit. So what if the target is moving? On the one hand, it could be exactly the same algorithm that you just seek wherever the current location of the target is. That's ultimately what's happening here as I move it with the mouse. But if the vehicle is able to perceive its environment and see which direction the target is moving, couldn't it make a prediction as to where it's going to be a little bit in the future and seek that location rather than the exact position of the target itself right at this moment? So that's another thing you could try. Take a look at how this is explained in Reynolds' paper, which I've linked to in the video description. All right. Next up, the arrive force and then more and more and more. I don't know how many of these I'm going to do. But, eventually, I'll get to I would love to get to all of them in future videos. Thanks for sticking with me. We'll look forward to hearing what you think and what questions you have in the comments. And I will see you in the next video. [MUSIC PLAYING]
