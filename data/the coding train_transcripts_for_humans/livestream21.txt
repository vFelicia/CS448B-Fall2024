00:00 - Dan and I am broadcasting live from the
00:03 - school for poetic computation
00:06 - on uh Tuesday March
00:09 - 22nd it's not really the morning anymore
00:11 - it's about 11:20 a.m. I'm here um
00:15 - hopefully you can hear me hopefully you
00:16 - can see me I've got some new lights set
00:18 - up so I think the picture quality should
00:20 - be a bit better the keying from the
00:22 - green screen should be a bit better
00:23 - please let me know in the chat how it
00:25 - looks how it sounds um I'm still kind of
00:28 - in a phase of kind of testing this setup
00:31 - and getting it configured so I like not
00:33 - really prepared which is why I'm kind of
00:35 - stream of conscious rambling here but I
00:37 - do have some stuff I want to do today uh
00:39 - in addition to just kind of talk and
00:42 - answer any questions but on my list is
00:45 - I've been meeting for a long time I made
00:47 - a whole set of video tutorials about
00:48 - making a Twitter pot Twitter pot a
00:51 - Twitter bot using node.js so I finally
00:54 - want to look at some strategies for
00:55 - deploying that bot to a server we can
00:58 - look at how you can deploy it to Heroku
00:59 - or an Amazon ec2 instance or discuss
01:02 - other possibilities oh Cloud9 is another
01:04 - one you can use I think for free I
01:06 - should maybe look at that um as well as
01:08 - actually just running your Bot on a
01:09 - Raspberry Pi so I want to not really I'm
01:12 - going to pull out a Raspberry Pi and see
01:13 - if I can even hook it up into the system
01:15 - and have it behind me and see what we
01:17 - can kind of like FS futs with it Fitz
01:19 - with it fuddle with it I don't know what
01:22 - you do with a Raspberry Pi
01:25 - you program it you make it do stuff um
01:29 - but um so I don't know I'm going to hang
01:30 - out here for an hour or two and kind of
01:32 - do this stuff if I get a good if I have
01:35 - a good like chunk of something I'm going
01:36 - to record that separately as a video
01:38 - tutorial that will get all this will get
01:40 - saved but I'm looking to make in the
01:42 - next hour or two while I'm fussing
01:44 - around also make some video tutorials so
01:47 - I'm looking in the chat um do I look I
01:51 - don't know if I I noticed the way I had
01:53 - the white balance on the camera I was
01:55 - very like pale the other day now I look
01:57 - a little bit orange but um
02:00 - if uh if you wouldn't mind letting me
02:02 - know how the picture quality is and how
02:03 - the sound is that would be helpful to me
02:05 - before I get kind of started
02:07 - here um okay so let's
02:13 - see
02:16 - uh yeah I got some folders on the
02:18 - desktop here all right
02:22 - um does that make a weird noise like a
02:25 - slurping
02:26 - noise um okay so picture and sound are
02:29 - good seems perfect perfect great okay
02:31 - thanks for the feedback so I'm going to
02:33 - get started then um let's see what we
02:36 - can do first here let me
02:38 - revisit um and try to get so here's the
02:42 - thing I'm kind of doing my strategy for
02:45 - today is rather than like prepare and
02:48 - then turn on the stream and be prepared
02:50 - I'm just gonna prepare while I'm
02:52 - streaming so I think the first thing I'm
02:54 - going to do is kind of get myself back
02:56 - to um some of those bot examples um so
03:00 - I'm going to open up
03:02 - Sublime uh and I'm going to go here to
03:07 - the
03:08 - finder uh and see if I can figure out
03:11 - where where are all the where are all
03:13 - those oh documents yeah uh data
03:17 - apis
03:19 - arrays other R of code video notes where
03:22 - are all the bot examples other
03:26 - documents this is not going well so far
03:29 - uh uh hold on let's look let's try this
03:32 - bot.
03:33 - JS okay ah they're definitely
03:36 - somewhere um let me see these things in
03:39 - the finder uh old desktop old YouTube
03:42 - code Old this is brilliant brilliant
03:46 - file naming here documents old desktop
03:48 - old YouTube code but that's what I'm
03:50 - looking for so I'm going to grab those
03:51 - things old desktop old YouTube code uh
03:56 - so let's grab I'm going to move this
03:57 - stuff to the desktop here and and drag
04:00 - this into here uh so this was a bunch of
04:04 - my old bot
04:06 - examples um oh unregistered Sublime Text
04:10 - I have purchased Sublime Text but I
04:12 - guess because I made a different user
04:14 - account on this
04:15 - machine uh
04:18 - um I see somebody wrote in the comment
04:21 - image could be sharper I'm assuming
04:24 - that's just the sort of compression of
04:26 - the internet speed um it is I am I am
04:30 - streaming this out in 720p I was
04:32 - reluctant to try to do it higher but
04:34 - anybody else let me know if it seems
04:36 - like you have trouble um seeing anything
04:38 - um okay uh let's see here let's just
04:42 - find a very simple
04:44 - example which just uh let's look for the
04:48 - like this one I think maybe uh this one
04:51 - does a random number uh every what's 20
04:55 - times a th000 every 20 seconds
05:01 - um
05:03 - and um somebody asks why not use adom IO
05:07 - text editor no reason I just happened to
05:10 - using Sublime here um that would be that
05:13 - would also be a good one for me to use
05:15 - um so I think this will work here as a
05:18 - demonstration to start with um let me
05:23 - open up terminal
05:25 - now
05:28 - uh
05:30 - uh well where am I here in terminal here
05:33 - oh my
05:34 - goodness
05:38 - uh and I'm in this
05:42 - one I have no idea and I think the the
05:46 - good question another question here is
05:48 - what is this example hooked up
05:51 - to Twitter am I logged in to uh no I'm
05:55 - logged into to who myself let's let's
05:59 - log out
06:00 - out that now you all saw my Twitter
06:04 - page let's log into ITP
06:08 - A2Z I try to remember the password which
06:11 - is my test Twitter account no oh wait
06:15 - first of all let's even see if that's
06:17 - the right account name ITP A2Z
06:20 - no A2Z
06:23 - ITP yes okay log
06:27 - in uh what did I say it was A2 Z ITP uh
06:31 - interact oops I just said the password
06:34 - out
06:34 - loud uh I don't know should I save it
06:37 - what do you guys think oh I feel so
06:38 - stressed out when I get these queries
06:40 - let's not save it let's not save it bad
06:42 - idea bad idea okay um so now let's run
06:45 - this
06:46 - bot
06:49 - uh bot is starting it
06:52 - worked yeah there we go this is a tweet
06:55 - we just made 3 seconds ago random number
06:58 - 39 the number of the day isn't that
07:01 - that's a Sesame Street thing right the
07:03 - number of today is
07:04 - 39 uh okay and we've got our random
07:08 - number bot and so I think I have all the
07:12 - pieces here now I have a browser Page
07:16 - open to the
07:18 - twitterbot I have Sublime Text open to
07:23 - the code for the
07:25 - twitterbot there it is and I have also
07:28 - terminal now
07:30 - uh in the directory for that Twitter bot
07:33 - so I can run things and I don't need the
07:36 - activity monitor and Etc I don't need
07:39 - this oh I I am going to need this ah
07:41 - yeah when we get to the Amazon thing
07:43 - okay do I have cyberduck here somewhere
07:46 - yep okay we're going to use that for
07:48 - ftping files uh am I logged into some
07:52 - sort of get something like that okay um
07:57 - so let's see here let me look um
08:00 - there are 28 people watching hello so a
08:02 - lot of people seem to have just joined
08:03 - I'm just getting set up here the things
08:06 - that I wanted to talk about today are
08:08 - how to deploy your twitterbot uh and as
08:11 - well as look at a Raspberry Pi let's
08:13 - should we try should I try let me get my
08:16 - res I got to leave for a second not
08:18 - really leave not really I'm in a place
08:20 - I'm in this like kind of underground
08:21 - bunker it's not underground at all it's
08:23 - like a room with no windows uh but
08:26 - there's a room with Windows right over
08:27 - there I can go get a little sunshine
08:30 - um but over in that room over there I
08:31 - left a raspberry piie so I need to just
08:34 - walk over there and get it be right back
08:36 - there's lots of things here I could trip
08:37 - over so I have to do this very
08:40 - carefully be right back oh you can still
08:42 - hear me though because I got a live mic
08:44 - going on here so I'm in the other room
08:46 - you can't see me now and it I can't find
08:49 - the raspberry Pine oh you know why
08:52 - because I already brought it in
08:54 - here cuz I'm a lunatic oh and you know
08:56 - what a light went out um one of my
08:58 - lights went out probably because I
08:59 - stepped on the cable now it's on it just
09:02 - shined in my eyes Okay um so let's talk
09:05 - about the Raspberry Pi for a
09:08 - second
09:10 - so here's the thing if you've made so if
09:14 - you've made a
09:16 - twitterbot and if you've made it using
09:18 - node or whatever you made it with you
09:20 - now have the ability as we just saw to
09:23 - on your own
09:25 - computer run that tter oh this the font
09:28 - should be bigger
09:30 - here so you can see that to run
09:40 - it there we go right you have the
09:42 - ability to run it and you could just let
09:44 - that twitterbot run but uh if this is
09:48 - your laptop eventually you want to close
09:50 - it you want to shut it down you need
09:51 - some place where it can run permanently
09:53 - and your options could be like okay well
09:55 - you could dedicate a computer sitting in
09:57 - your home or office or wherever you have
09:58 - your your computer to running your Bot
10:01 - but that might be a little bit
10:03 - unreasonable um you know it's kind of an
10:05 - expensive thing to dedicate an entire
10:07 - computer just for a bot so one of the
10:09 - nice things you can do I have a box
10:13 - here hey
10:15 - props I have in here a Raspberry Pi I
10:20 - show it to the C this won't this will be
10:22 - out of focus uh a Raspberry Pi a
10:25 - Raspberry Pi is a small computer it
10:29 - looks like this I actually have a little
10:30 - camera hooked up to it which I will at
10:32 - some point see if I can get working um I
10:35 - happen to have also a little um I need
10:38 - another camera to like close up on this
10:40 - I happen to have a little um what what
10:43 - do you call this wi-fi thing dongle USB
10:46 - Wi-Fi thing so this can connect to the
10:48 - internet of course I could just plug it
10:50 - directly into ethernet um and this is
10:53 - computer this is running a Linux
10:55 - operating system there's a little micro
10:57 - SD card in here um which is has the
11:01 - Raspberry Pi uh has the Linux operating
11:03 - system on it um it's running that and
11:07 - that can run node so this being only $35
11:11 - is a much more reasonable thing to leave
11:13 - dedicated to running your Bot so that is
11:17 - one option and I would like to maybe I'm
11:20 - not going to do this right now set this
11:22 - up I'm going to try to outp get the HDMI
11:25 - output of this or actually I don't even
11:27 - need that because if I'm just going to
11:29 - could log into it I don't know what I'm
11:30 - doing yet but I'm going to set this up
11:32 - and show you guys some stuff with the
11:33 - Raspberry Pi but maybe we should move
11:36 - on um uh maybe we should move on and I'm
11:40 - going to look at some options for
11:42 - deploying this bot to servers so let's
11:46 - think about what some oh this light does
11:48 - not stay
11:50 - on why is that hold on maybe I need a
11:52 - piece of tape here why is it Loose hold
11:54 - on I'm going to work on
11:57 - this light over here okay come on there
12:01 - we
12:05 - go there we go all right um
12:12 - so uh oh I've lost a lot of viewers I
12:15 - was up to like 30 30 some viewers now
12:18 - there's only 23 of you watching but
12:19 - that's nice okay so what I want to do is
12:21 - look up here um I have some notes on
12:25 - this which I will show you where those
12:27 - are uh um uh shi.
12:32 - github.io A2Z F15 so if
12:36 - you
12:39 - A2Z df15 okay if you go to this URL I
12:44 - have some notes on how to deploy your
12:46 - Bot to both Heroku which is a company
12:51 - that runs
12:52 - servers that you can get an account on
12:55 - um and actually you can run your
12:57 - twitterbot on Heroku for free as far as
13:00 - I can tell I've been I've I've been able
13:01 - to do that I'm going to show you that um
13:04 - obviously if you want to do more
13:05 - sophisticated things you'll probably
13:06 - need a paid account for Heroku so we'll
13:08 - look at that briefly um and um so on
13:13 - this page I have um two uh two links
13:17 - here of notes one is a page of notes on
13:20 - how to deploy your Bot to ec2 and
13:22 - another is a page of notes of how to
13:24 - deploy your Bot to Heroku so I'm going
13:26 - to open this up and and uh you can see
13:30 - the and what I'm going to do is you can
13:32 - kind of like see the basic instructions
13:34 - here but I'm going to walk through them
13:36 - and I'm going to then I'm going to hit
13:37 - record so maybe this first video that
13:39 - I'm going to do is will be called how to
13:42 - deploy your nodejs Bot to Heroku when
13:47 - when I woke up this morning is that
13:48 - really what I thought I was going to do
13:49 - with my day was come here and talk to
13:51 - myself in a room with a wall painted
13:54 - green about deploying a node bot to
13:57 - Heroku anyway such is my life you're the
14:01 - you your life is to watch this of course
14:04 - you you you you have free will and can
14:06 - turn this off and go to the sunshine I
14:08 - will stay here in my dark
14:11 - room okay so um I'm going to do a couple
14:14 - things one is
14:17 - um ah hello tun I see hello Andrew uh oh
14:21 - Andrew Kim writes in the chat by the way
14:23 - Twitter Bots are estimated to create
14:25 - approximately 24% of tweets that are on
14:27 - Twitter is that really true
14:29 - well we are only adding to the problem
14:31 - if that's the case so I want to get my
14:32 - notes open on this I have a second La my
14:35 - my my second labtop over here uh so
14:39 - shiftman
14:41 - github.io um
14:43 - slash uh A2 z-
14:47 - F15 and I'm going to go to
14:51 - um the I'm gonna start with Heroku up
14:54 - the camera just went off I'm going to
14:55 - walk around here and turn it back on
14:57 - sorry about that I also got to check the
15:00 - I'm in a bit of a battery situation
15:03 - which is that uh I I'm running this lav
15:07 - mic and the receiver for the lav mic off
15:09 - doublea batteries and I kind of um those
15:12 - might run out which Cas I might have to
15:14 - pause and go out and get some batteries
15:15 - but uh we'll see I still got a full bar
15:18 - so I think it's going to last for a
15:19 - little while okay so um okay
15:24 - so what I want to check here is okay
15:29 - good that's not installed so I need to
15:31 - install this Heroku tool belt and the
15:35 - one thing I need to make sure I can
15:37 - do uh is make sure I can log into Heroku
15:41 - here uh so I'm going to log in uh make
15:45 - sure I know my
15:48 - password so sad I use one password and
15:52 - I'm just don't have it ah I was lucky
15:54 - okay uh let's not save it I probably
15:56 - should save it I don't know what's
15:57 - happening anymore okay the boy look at
15:59 - all of these tests test test delete soon
16:02 - this is my brilliant bot test delete
16:05 - soon test Twitter bot test think I
16:07 - should delete some of these can I delete
16:09 - them very quickly uh it's probably going
16:11 - to take me a while we'll just make
16:12 - another test it's fine okay so I think
16:15 - I'm ready for the first tutorial for
16:17 - today it only took me 16 minutes to get
16:20 - to that and the first tutorial I'm going
16:22 - to do is deploying your twitterbot to
16:26 - Heroku and I probably should practice
16:29 - this before I hit record but I could
16:30 - always do it twice and whatever anyway
16:33 - so I'm going to check the chat to make
16:35 - sure everybody can still hear me and
16:37 - everything looks okay um uh hello to
16:41 - more of you who are saying hello in the
16:43 - chat I love this purple color I got to
16:45 - change my desktop background to like a
16:47 - nice purple or
16:49 - something um um hello to brother rain uh
16:54 - in the chat uh I gained a viewer I was
16:57 - losing people through my rambling but uh
17:00 - once I started like holding up a prop
17:02 - and had this like Raspberry p and I was
17:04 - trying to I don't know okay so uh we're
17:07 - gonna do this so
17:11 - um so I've got just to revisit this I've
17:15 - got
17:19 - oops I don't need this here or maybe I
17:22 - do uh I've
17:25 - got my Twitter page open for viewing if
17:29 - the bot works I have got I'm logged into
17:33 - my Heroku
17:34 - dashboard I have got the code for this
17:38 - particular bot open and I also have
17:41 - terminal in the directory for the bot
17:45 - okay so I think I'm
17:47 - ready here we go so now I have to come
17:49 - over
17:50 - here and I'm going to hit record I'm
17:53 - going to have a little sip of this uh
17:55 - I'm having coffee today instead of tea
17:57 - which is very dangerous since I have
17:58 - like a sort of a hyper energy problem
18:02 - anyway but what can you do okay here we
18:06 - go hello in this video I'm going to look
18:10 - I got to start over I have this on the
18:11 - wrong
18:12 - page uh okay tur this over here okay uh
18:16 - and then I'm going to make this
18:17 - bigger
18:21 - uh
18:25 - okay okay uh
18:29 - [Music]
18:30 - here we go uh stop I'm gonna try this
18:35 - again hello in this video I am going to
18:38 - look at how you can take a twitterbot
18:41 - written in node.js and deploy it to a
18:44 - server and the server I will look at in
18:46 - this video is one that runs on Heroku so
18:50 - what are the pieces of this the first
18:51 - thing is I have this simple little bot
18:54 - which just tweets a random number you
18:56 - can see I just ran this bot and tested
18:58 - it over here uh and you can see there's
19:00 - the random number it picked random
19:02 - number 39 uh and I also have um the my
19:07 - browser logged into Heroku
19:11 - so shoot I have to start over I have to
19:13 - start over sorry I got I I I I had this
19:17 - in the wrong page uh this code and
19:20 - terminal okay okay here we go I'm going
19:23 - to start over
19:26 - again um
19:30 - record
19:31 - hello
19:33 - hello hello my name is
19:38 - Dan hello in this video I am going to
19:41 - look at how to deploy your Bot written
19:43 - in no JS to uh a server and that server
19:47 - being one that runs on a service called
19:49 - Heroku so let's take a look at the
19:50 - pieces so you can see here I have my
19:52 - browser open to my test account A2Z ITP
19:56 - which uh I most recently just tweeted a
19:59 - bot tweeted a random number 39 and I
20:02 - have the code for that bot open right
20:05 - here you can see it in Sublime it's very
20:06 - simple it has a single function that
20:08 - tweets that random number uh and then I
20:11 - also have my terminal open to that
20:14 - directory and I could just really
20:16 - quickly test to make sure that bot works
20:18 - the bot is starting it worked let's go
20:21 - back to the browser I'm gonna hit
20:22 - refresh and we can see now I got random
20:25 - number four so everything is working the
20:28 - point is in this video is I want to say
20:30 - this bot that's running right over here
20:33 - I don't want to run it from my laptop I
20:35 - want it to run autonomously on a server
20:37 - somewhere that I can set it to go and
20:39 - never think about it again so let's
20:41 - tweet it again let's quit it um and look
20:43 - at how we can do that so the site that
20:45 - I'm the the service that I'm going to
20:47 - use in this particular video is Heroku
20:50 - so um you'll need an account so you know
20:52 - if you're watching this video and you
20:54 - don't have a Heroku account go to uh
20:56 - Heroku dcom
20:59 - Heroku spelled this way.com
21:03 - and you can see here I went there now
21:06 - now I'm already logged in so it went
21:08 - straight to my dashboard and you can see
21:12 - that I have all these things already
21:14 - listed on my dashboard because
21:15 - apparently I've tried to make a variety
21:18 - of I've tried to do this a whole bunch
21:19 - of time test this test that delete soon
21:22 - Etc so what are these things these
21:24 - things are referred to as
21:27 - dinos I think that's right not Dino DS
21:30 - Dino Dy NS like a dynamic thing that's
21:34 - running it's a process that you're
21:35 - running so what I need to do is create a
21:38 - dyo um to run my bot so the very first
21:43 - thing that I'm going to do is go up here
21:44 - to this plus sign up in the top right
21:47 - and I'm going to say create new app so
21:50 - app is really what I'm doing I'm going
21:51 - to create an app I'm going to call it uh
21:55 - coding rainbow uh demo
21:59 - uh should only contain lowercase letters
22:01 - okay rainbow demo uh it is available I'm
22:05 - going to create
22:07 - it and it is now there so there's a
22:11 - whole bunch of things I need to do here
22:13 - and one of the things about using
22:15 - Heroku is Heroku is kind of its own
22:18 - animal it's not really an animal it's a
22:20 - web server but whatever it's it's its
22:22 - own it has its own way of doing things
22:24 - and the way that you send things to
22:26 - Heroku and get things back from Heroku
22:28 - is two ways one is you use git what is
22:32 - git oh boy if you don't know what git is
22:33 - stay tuned for my upcoming set of git
22:36 - and GitHub tutorials but for now if you
22:38 - don't know what git is um you're going
22:41 - to be you'll still be able to follow
22:42 - this but you're just going to have to
22:44 - verbatim kind of
22:45 - copy I heard a
22:48 - noise there's a person somewhere nearby
22:52 - I have to keep going anyway okay um uh
22:55 - you can just sort of verbatim copy um
22:57 - some of these uh
23:01 - commands um okay so now I'm waving to
23:05 - somebody who uh it's my my neighbor Joe
23:07 - I love Joe he's a great guy uh he came
23:10 - and said hi the other day okay I got to
23:12 - keep going here so um so you can see
23:14 - here that on the Heroku page it's even
23:17 - giving you some sort of commands that
23:18 - you can follow we'll worry about that in
23:20 - a moment but we're missing one other
23:23 - aspect here the first thing that it's
23:25 - saying to do is saying herok login
23:28 - meaning log into your Heroku account
23:31 - from terminal somehow so if I go over
23:33 - here and I type in Heroku
23:36 - login it says command not found so one
23:39 - of the things you need in order to work
23:41 - with Heroku is a piece of software
23:43 - called the Heroku tool belt so I
23:46 - probably should have pre-installed that
23:48 - but I'm just going to Google Heroku tool
23:51 - belt I'm going to click on the first
23:53 - thing that comes up and I'm going to
23:55 - download it and I think it's going to
23:57 - this is going to happen quickly enough
23:58 - that I can just do this I'm going to
24:01 - install it continue continue
24:05 - install uh password and there we go I'm
24:09 - installing it I do my installing
24:15 - dance I don't know I I didn't I like the
24:19 - weird thing about me doing this dance
24:20 - while this video is going I have a
24:22 - preview screen I'm like watching myself
24:23 - over here I supposed to just dancing to
24:25 - the camera that was very weird I will
24:27 - edit that out that no one that someone
24:29 - will make a weird GI out of that or
24:31 - something okay so now I should be able
24:34 - to go
24:35 - back and type in Heroku look at that oh
24:38 - installing tool I didn't even know it
24:40 - was going to do that so maybe you have
24:42 - to do that I was about to just say
24:43 - Heroku log in but I just was typing
24:46 - Heroku to make sure it works apparently
24:47 - I have to do another dance because it's
24:50 - installing a bunch of stuff oh that was
24:53 - I don't have to dance okay so now we can
24:56 - see um I should be able to say Heroku
24:58 - login and it should ask for my
25:01 - credentials my account is under my email
25:04 - my password
25:06 - [Music]
25:08 - is ah I'm logged in so now that I'm
25:11 - logged in I can actually start to do
25:13 - things which would allow me to deploy uh
25:17 - from terminal here all the stuff for my
25:20 - bot to Heroku itself so let's go back
25:25 - now to this p
25:29 - page and uh oh actually this page no
25:33 - this page sorry and we can see here
25:39 - now now that I've logged into Heroku the
25:42 - next thing I need to do is make my uh
25:47 - bot into a git repository again the what
25:51 - git is if you're not familiar with it is
25:53 - out of the scope of this particular
25:55 - video but it's um version Control
25:58 - software and uh what it's going to allow
26:02 - me to do is once I turn it into a git
26:04 - repository meaning all the code for my
26:07 - bot is in this folder it's going to
26:09 - allow me to push that git repository to
26:11 - Heroku because everything that lives on
26:13 - Heroku is also a g repository so I'm
26:16 - going to be able to follow these
26:17 - commands the first thing I'm going to do
26:18 - is say get
26:20 - AIT get
26:23 - init and it initialized an empty git
26:25 - reposit now if you get if I type got by
26:28 - the way instead of git it's going to say
26:30 - got command not found if you get this
26:33 - error meaning get command not found this
26:36 - just means you need to download and
26:38 - install git so if I Google git the very
26:41 - first thing that comes up is this
26:43 - particular website
26:56 - g-.& reason you didn't have that already
26:59 - okay now that I've done that the next
27:02 - command that I need to go to is this
27:06 - Heroku git remote- a so what I'm doing
27:09 - is I'm saying I want my git repository
27:12 - this thing that lives on my computer I
27:14 - want it to be linked to a remote place
27:17 - that remote place far off in the
27:19 - distance is Heroku and I not just want
27:21 - to link it to Heroku but I want to link
27:23 - it to my app that's coding rainbow demo
27:26 - so I can just take exactly this here and
27:31 - I can type put that into terminal I see
27:33 - it over here on my preview screen and
27:36 - there we go it's all set now and
27:39 - then I can go here and I can say the
27:44 - next thing okay so the next set of
27:46 - commands here is now I actually want to
27:49 - send the stuff to Heroku the way that
27:51 - you send stuff to Heroku is with a
27:53 - command a get command called push in git
27:56 - push means send pull means receive so
28:00 - there's a there's there's a lot to
28:02 - there's a lot to this but I first thing
28:03 - I need to do is like add and commit and
28:05 - so I'm just going to follow these
28:06 - commands I someday this will link to my
28:09 - get tutorials which will explain all
28:11 - these commands so I'm going to say get
28:12 - add and then I'm just going to use
28:14 - exactly I'm going to say commit get
28:17 - commit D am make it better this I could
28:19 - put my own comment in here I'm going to
28:21 - say uh oh and you can't this needs to
28:24 - move like a little bit over here I'm
28:25 - going to say uh
28:28 - this is my
28:29 - bot and it did that and then I'm going
28:32 - to say get push Heroku
28:36 - Master get push Heroku Master which will
28:40 - send it so now it's sending it to Heroku
28:43 - and it's going to do all sorts of stuff
28:44 - to try to run
28:46 - it the thing is I missed some steps so
28:50 - these would have been the steps if I had
28:52 - a kind of traditional
28:54 - old-fashioned uh web application you
28:56 - know I made some sort of server it
28:58 - serves up web pages people log onto my
29:00 - server they see the web pages but that's
29:02 - not actually what I made I made this bot
29:04 - which is just this process that needs to
29:06 - run behind the scenes uh with no there's
29:09 - no web server there's no place there's
29:10 - no URL for anyone to go to I just want
29:12 - this thing to run on the server so I
29:13 - have over here I'm just want to make
29:15 - sure I get the syntax right my notes um
29:19 - and uh okay so in order to do this I'm
29:23 - missing a particular piece so first
29:27 - thing I want to do actually by the way I
29:29 - really should have practiced this in
29:30 - advance but this is fine so there's so
29:33 - let's here we are we' kind we've got
29:35 - okay what have we done so far we wrote
29:37 - the code for our bot we pushed it to
29:39 - Heroku and we and it even just sort of
29:41 - said verifying deploy done it didn't
29:43 - give me any error messages so let's
29:44 - actually go and look now I'm going to go
29:47 - back to uh my
29:49 - dashboard and I should see here I should
29:52 - be able to find oh yeah sorry whoops I
29:54 - should be able to find coding rainbow
29:56 - demo I'm going to click on that and
29:59 - we're going to see um it says sleeping
30:03 - so it's not really working it's not
30:05 - really doing anything yet the reason
30:07 - it's not doing anything yet is because
30:10 - it is listed as a web app I need to
30:14 - change this to be what's called a worker
30:17 - app and that's what I was talking about
30:18 - a worker is a web app is something that
30:20 - serves up web pages a worker is
30:22 - something that just works behind the
30:23 - scenes with its own process and that's
30:25 - what the bot is so in order to do that I
30:28 - need to go back to my code here and I
30:31 - actually need to create a new file so
30:33 - this is my folder with all the stuff and
30:36 - I need to create a new file and I need
30:38 - that file to be
30:40 - called I'm going to save it uh
30:44 - P file proc file this is the process
30:48 - file it's a configuration file that
30:50 - Heroku will look for to know what is it
30:53 - that this thing is supposed to do so I'm
30:55 - going to save that and in that file I'm
30:57 - going to say this thing is actually a
30:59 - worker not not a web application and it
31:03 - its job is to run node bot. js so I'm
31:08 - going to save that in there and then I
31:11 - have got to go back and this is again um
31:15 - if you're unfamiliar with Git I here's
31:18 - the thing I need to I made some changes
31:20 - to my project now I need those changes
31:23 - to go onto Heroku those changes are only
31:25 - locally on my laptop so to do that I
31:27 - need to say get add dot this is adding
31:30 - my changes and I need to say commit
31:33 - which is giving a message to those which
31:35 - is adding the proc file you can follow
31:39 - along those this is the same things I
31:41 - did for the first one and then I can say
31:43 - get push Heroku Master this is sending
31:46 - it to Heroku Master Heroku is our
31:51 - Master uh and now that done it's
31:56 - finished
31:58 - uh as I do my little dance I have to
32:01 - wait for all this to finish launching
32:04 - verifying deploy Etc now I should be
32:07 - able to go here and hit
32:10 - refresh and I see now I see look at that
32:13 - it says worker node bot. js and this I
32:17 - want to turn off I need to hit edit I
32:19 - want to turn off the
32:22 - web the web process confirm and I want
32:26 - to turn on
32:27 - the worker one
32:30 - confirm and
32:32 - now as far as I
32:35 - know oh my goodness boy we we sent a lot
32:38 - of
32:39 - tweets um you can see now it's uh you
32:42 - can see it's it's running now so it was
32:44 - probably running it's it's interesting
32:46 - that it actually worked maybe earlier
32:48 - but now it should be running every 20
32:50 - seconds it should um post a new tweet
32:53 - and we should be able to see this by the
32:55 - way uh if I back here say Heroku
32:59 - log uh oh what I meant log is not a
33:02 - command perhaps I meant logs and in fact
33:05 - yes I meant
33:06 - logs uh
33:08 - Heroku
33:11 - logs and you can see by the way this is
33:14 - running because there's two new
33:16 - tweets uh and here uh it
33:22 - worked right so
33:25 - um this is oh yeah so you can see by the
33:28 - way there's a bunch of things going on
33:30 - here because I let it run as a web thing
33:33 - the first time and the web thing has an
33:35 - error it stopped but you can see the
33:37 - worker thing is just saying it worked it
33:39 - worked it worked so I don't know if 20
33:41 - seconds has passed but if I do this
33:44 - again look at the logs you can see the
33:45 - worker is still going so um I'm actually
33:48 - going to shut it off um because I have
33:51 - it set to like tweet every 20 seconds
33:53 - which is pretty often but you can see
33:54 - that this works so now my bot is
33:56 - deployed on Heroku and by the way free
33:59 - account free Heroku account um to to do
34:02 - this so um so you don't this you not
34:05 - need a paid Heroku account to Simply run
34:07 - run a an app with a worker process so
34:10 - hopefully this was helpful to you this
34:12 - is about a 15 minutes of the steps um
34:15 - what I'm going to do in the video's
34:17 - description is uh kind of paste links to
34:20 - all the pieces you need to download uh
34:23 - I'll have links to all the pieces you
34:24 - need to download I also have this that I
34:27 - ran through as a written tutorial so I
34:28 - will post a link to that as well um and
34:32 - uh but before I go away I'm just going
34:35 - to show you how I could shut it off if I
34:36 - want to so I could hit edit here I could
34:39 - turn this off and hit confirm so now my
34:42 - bot uh even though it did four more
34:45 - random numbers it should have stopped
34:47 - now and it won't do any more random
34:48 - numbers I've shut it off right now so uh
34:51 - that was that concludes our discussion
34:53 - of how to deploy your no dutchs bot to
34:58 - Heroku over here I'm gonna hit
35:02 - stop okay so I'm now GNA uh I don't know
35:05 - if anyone's still watching the live
35:06 - stream I'm going to come back here and
35:10 - look at the live
35:11 - dashboard um
35:15 - and uh some people said hi okay there 25
35:18 - of you watching how was that did that
35:21 - make sense I'm like tempted to just like
35:23 - redo that whole video cuz I was like
35:24 - didn't know what was happening but but
35:27 - um hopefully that was okay up this light
35:30 - keeps going you know the key seems to be
35:31 - fine even with this light going out
35:34 - um I don't know whether it's a power
35:37 - issue or it's just loose like if I
35:39 - squeeze it the light goes on can you see
35:41 - that there's a light going on and off
35:42 - yeah probably can
35:45 - um let me hold
35:47 - on let me take some more drastic
35:50 - measures here I have a feeling that this
35:53 - just is not in tightly
35:55 - enough
36:00 - okay sorry I just want to fix this
36:09 - light hello
36:12 - everyone
36:15 - hello sorry ah there we go I'm I'm I
36:20 - will be back talking to you
36:22 - momentarily there we go that seems more
36:25 - that seems better now
36:28 - okay seems to be staying on okay um
36:31 - hello again so let's see
36:35 - uh so uh Andrew writes uh what kinds of
36:39 - things do you have to pay Heroku to be
36:40 - able to do to be honest with you I'm not
36:42 - that much of an expert on Heroku but I
36:44 - know for a fact that I use it for um so
36:48 - one thing I use n Heroku for if I go to
36:50 - natureof code.com
36:52 - because I'm inadvertently plugging this
36:55 - um and I click buy now you'll notice
36:57 - actually the URL takes you to here so
37:00 - it's actually I'm running a server on
37:01 - Heroku to run this uh purchasing system
37:05 - uh which by the way you can you can
37:06 - download it for free but um so but I
37:09 - have a database that stores a record of
37:11 - every purchase and I have to have a paid
37:14 - account in order to have that database
37:15 - so that's one thing certainly I think to
37:17 - use a database probably it also was I
37:20 - would imagine related to how much
37:21 - bandwidth you get uh server space you
37:24 - get those types of things uh also how
37:26 - many different like apps you can run
37:28 - probably also is related to um whether
37:31 - you have a paid or a free
37:33 - account um okay uh that was one question
37:36 - uh another question is so that is for
37:38 - JavaScript based bots so you could
37:40 - deploy non-javascript based Bots to
37:42 - Heroku whatever runs on Heroku you can
37:45 - run the thing that I have not been able
37:47 - to do with Heroku is run a bot that one
37:51 - um you know I made these tutorials so
37:52 - long ago but um the bot tutorials if you
37:55 - go through them look at doing just a
37:57 - text based bot and then an image-based
37:59 - bot and the image based bot uses then
38:02 - processing which runs a Java program to
38:05 - do the image stuff so I have not been
38:07 - able to run Java uh Java with the
38:10 - JavaScript node bot on Heroku but I have
38:12 - been able to do that on Amazon ec2 which
38:15 - is what I also want to show uh next in
38:18 - this session
38:19 - today what about Windows users I guess
38:22 - the console commands are similar uh
38:24 - Leander R asks uh correct uh for Windows
38:29 - users you just need your
38:31 - own uh everything is the same uh you
38:35 - just need to have like sigin or
38:37 - Powershell or even like git bash is a
38:40 - tool you can download to have uh console
38:43 - command line access to your Windows
38:44 - machine but otherwise it's exactly the
38:46 - same um
38:48 - yeah um okay any other questions um I'm
38:53 - going to start getting ready here to
38:55 - look at
38:57 - Amazon
38:59 - ec2
39:01 - uh um okay
39:04 - Amazon okay so first thing I want to do
39:06 - is go to shiftman GitHub so I also have
39:09 - some notes here oh yeah
39:14 - um so I'm going to go through this
39:18 - now uh one of the tricky things
39:23 - was oh my God
39:27 - this is like totally insane I'm going to
39:28 - leave this open on this machine um so
39:32 - I'm going to go through the ec2 stuff
39:34 - the tricky thing is getting to log in I
39:40 - think I'm just going to like hope that
39:41 - this I can make this
39:43 - work
39:46 - um yeah so let me go let me just see
39:49 - though if
39:51 - whoops
39:53 - um why is this
39:55 - URL not
39:58 - correct uh let me fix
40:00 - this uh so hold
40:04 - on I'm going to fix that URL on that
40:07 - tutorial
40:08 - page um
40:14 - still um post your questions in the chat
40:17 - while I'm and I will answer them in a
40:20 - moment while I'm getting here where
40:22 - where was that week
40:24 - nine ec2
40:28 - ec2 uh edit I don't know why this oh wh
40:32 - I have this
40:35 - backwards in the
40:37 - brackets should be Amazon
40:46 - ec2 so this should eventually
40:50 - update
40:53 - um okay um
40:59 - uh okay
41:03 - uh oh interesting somebody writes in the
41:06 - chat I I'm I'm sorry I would love to
41:08 - know how to pronounce your name Goa
41:10 - tasan writes uh for web apps Heroku used
41:13 - to be very generous with their offer now
41:16 - free Dino is limited to run maximum of
41:18 - 18 hours during a 24 hours window that's
41:21 - interesting I was not aware of that so
41:23 - it might be the case that um this might
41:26 - not be the best uh it be interesting to
41:28 - see as you guys try deploying with a
41:30 - free account if it lets you run your Bot
41:32 - 24 hours a day um you know you might be
41:34 - fine if your Bot as a worker process
41:37 - only does something like once every hour
41:40 - um but uh be curious and then uh Cy
41:43 - writes as a non webd what does Heroku do
41:47 - well
41:48 - Heroku I'm I'm really the wrong person
41:50 - to be I should just not be here making
41:53 - these videos cuz there are certain
41:54 - things I really I'm also a non webdev as
41:58 - a non- webdev I will now attempt to make
42:00 - up an answer for that question but I I
42:02 - I'll give you my sense of it those of
42:04 - you who I'm sure know this better will
42:05 - write in the chat but oroku is a uh
42:08 - server um uh that you get to have an
42:11 - account on and a server is just a
42:13 - computer that can run programs now for
42:15 - the most part the kinds of programs you
42:17 - want to run are those that serve web
42:19 - pages but as I'm showing you here any
42:22 - program that you can run you can run on
42:25 - your Heroku inst the thing about Heroku
42:27 - is they have their own way of doing
42:29 - things which is a little nonstandard
42:31 - it's a little different than I just have
42:33 - a computer that's plugged into the
42:34 - internet that I can log into and put
42:36 - files on they want you to use their
42:37 - Heroku tool belt software and you have
42:39 - to send things using git so there's it's
42:42 - Heroku is a um Heroku has a kind of High
42:47 - um sort of high threshold it's not that
42:49 - user friendly for a beginner or someone
42:51 - who doesn't have a lot of experience
42:52 - working with these but but you know hack
42:54 - away at it and hopefully these that
42:56 - video will help
43:00 - um uh is there documentation for the
43:02 - different commands you can make the
43:03 - Twitter bot do uh yes so what I what I
43:06 - would suggest in this case is um if you
43:09 - go to uh my uh YouTube
43:12 - channel um and go back to um this
43:17 - particular playlist Twitter about
43:19 - tutorial no. and processing I go through
43:21 - all of the twitterbot stuff in a series
43:23 - of like five or six videos of how you
43:25 - can be unate with the API and how you
43:27 - set up your keys and all that stuff so
43:29 - that video that I made about Heroku is
43:30 - going to get tacked on the end of that
43:32 - playlist as just deploying your
43:34 - Bot uh okay
43:37 - um and now I will attempt to do the next
43:44 - demonstration I'm going to check the
43:45 - battery on the oh on my
43:50 - um I still have a full bar there so I
43:53 - think I'm good battery wise and I have
43:55 - three bars here so I think I'm pretty
43:59 - good battery wise for
44:00 - audio um incidentally I'm not trying to
44:04 - the one thing I'm doing today is making
44:06 - uh videos that you that don't use the
44:08 - Whiteboard um oh whoops I don't have the
44:12 - um because I I have a new whiteboard
44:14 - coming by FedEx today I'm going try to
44:17 - mount it to the wall over there I
44:18 - realize now that I probably need
44:20 - unfortunately I have four LED lights
44:23 - which is lighting this area really well
44:25 - I thought I would just use two here and
44:26 - two there I might need to get four more
44:29 - um um but that that should be so as soon
44:32 - as I get the Whiteboard up I'm very the
44:35 - I'm going to uh be able to do a lot more
44:36 - tutorials that involve kind of different
44:38 - math-based algorithms and also the set
44:41 - of get tutorials I want to do which um
44:43 - even though I I kind of want to use the
44:45 - Whiteboard to kind of diagram out how
44:47 - git Works um okay
44:53 - uh um okay so let's let me get to uh
44:58 - here and Let me refresh this uh Ah
45:00 - that's good the camera went
45:05 - off and I am going
45:09 - to uh come back over
45:14 - here
45:17 - uh
45:19 - uh uh Chris Coleman writes on Twitter by
45:23 - the way we need a diagram and walk of
45:26 - your setup Studio setup sometime so I
45:28 - did that the other day on Periscope and
45:30 - maybe I'll do that again today I I I
45:31 - kind of but I didn't like it wasn't my
45:33 - intention to do that so I will um I
45:36 - definitely will do that I have a a video
45:38 - about it that I made a while ago but
45:40 - it's it's a different set up now so yeah
45:42 - I will do that um okay
45:49 - uh uh here we go now um let me just have
45:54 - a little sip of this
45:58 - okay so um I'm going to go back to I'm
46:01 - going to close this we don't need Heroku
46:03 - open anymore we need this
46:06 - open
46:07 - um and uh ah so actually so here's the
46:15 - thing I want to show how in this video
46:18 - not just to run a plain vanilla
46:22 - twitterbot but a twitterbot that also
46:25 - posts
46:26 - images so let me see if I think that's
46:30 - this
46:32 - one so this is the
46:34 - one that
46:38 - runs um that does the
46:41 - image let me see what happens here so
46:44 - hold on a
46:47 - second uh let me get this
46:51 - set
46:54 - um
46:56 - sorry
46:58 - uh I want to go to the node five
47:03 - example uh and say node bot.
47:06 - js let's see if this
47:11 - works claims it
47:13 - worked let's see what's here okay great
47:17 - so that did work so um so I'm going to
47:21 - uh did I yeah so this particular bot
47:25 - what it's do doing and again the
47:28 - tutorial
47:30 - is
47:32 - um uh the tutorial I'm sorry I've lost
47:35 - my train of thought here for a
47:37 - second the it I I already made tutorials
47:40 - that show how to have the twitterbot
47:42 - create an image and post that image so
47:45 - what I'm going to do now is just show
47:48 - how
47:49 - to um send the image uh how to do that
47:54 - on Amazon Okay so I got to look through
47:56 - these notes for a second just to
47:58 - see
48:00 - um that's installing Java doing this
48:04 - command
48:06 - uh oh right right right right right
48:09 - right right right right right right
48:10 - right right okay uh all right so I'm
48:12 - going to follow these
48:14 - instructions in this video I probably
48:17 - should practice
48:18 - this but I'm not going to
48:22 - um and so here we go so
48:26 - so actually what I want to do also
48:30 - is I just need to have this here uh I
48:36 - need to have this
48:37 - here and what I'm going to do is open
48:43 - up uh processing let me just see if I
48:46 - need to update my processing oh I
48:49 - do
48:51 - uh okay yes so by the way uh
48:56 - um uh there is 3.0.2 which I'm going to
48:59 - get right now uh so I'm using the most
49:02 - recent processing in this particular
49:04 - video uh we'll be getting to the ec2
49:07 - thing in a second hey I've got I'm
49:08 - gating audience members I got to get do
49:11 - something more interesting I did do a
49:13 - little dance earlier that was kind of
49:15 - pathetic
49:16 - but uh so I
49:20 - am just I just want to have the most
49:23 - recent version of processing and I'm
49:25 - going to have this sketch
49:27 - open oh it's in use let's close
49:30 - processing let's replace it on the
49:35 - desktop okay so here I have the notes I
49:37 - have Twitter open I'm also going to need
49:40 - cyberduck at some point but I will get
49:42 - to that later I have this and let we
49:44 - open up
49:47 - processing open it
49:50 - and just getting all the pieces together
49:54 - can close
49:56 - close this
49:58 - one uh processing is now open I guess I
50:01 - don't need to show the welcome message
50:03 - every time and what I want to do
50:07 - is uh look at
50:14 - this
50:17 - and
50:20 - uh okay oh I forgot that it has exit in
50:24 - there
50:26 - okay great so this is the processing
50:29 - sketch it creates an image the bot
50:32 - triggers the processing sketch draws the
50:35 - image posts it to
50:37 - Twitter
50:38 - and that's that okay so I'm going to
50:42 - show you how now to run this locally and
50:45 - then deploy to
50:46 - ec2 okay and I'm going to have my notes
50:48 - open over here as
50:51 - well
50:53 - um in case I need need to look at that
50:57 - ec2 it's a little bit big uh
51:01 - okay
51:04 - and uh
51:06 - here we
51:08 - go so I
51:11 - have the processing sketch the
51:15 - twitterbot
51:17 - code
51:18 - [Music]
51:20 - and uh the twitterbot open getting all
51:24 - these notifications what are they oh
51:27 - people are liking my tweets and saying
51:29 - hi to me that's
51:32 - nice okay uh but I just want to
51:35 - be in my egg I'm an egg okay uh purple
51:40 - yay more purple okay sorry I'm I'm I'm
51:43 - I'm like scared of making this
51:44 - particular tutorial but I'm just gonna
51:46 - do it all
51:49 - right here we
51:52 - go um I'm going to hit let me just check
51:57 - the chat to make sure there's nobody
51:58 - saying
52:00 - anything
52:01 - uh I lost a
52:05 - viewer okay here we go I have my notes
52:09 - Here There we
52:14 - go
52:17 - okay hello in this video I'm going to
52:20 - look at how you can deploy a Twitter bot
52:23 - written in node.js to an amaz Amazon ec2
52:26 - instance in particular one of the
52:28 - reasons I want to use an Amazon ec2
52:30 - instance in this case is because not
52:32 - only is my twitterbot written in node.js
52:35 - but my twitterbot triggers a processing
52:37 - sketch which is a Java program to create
52:40 - an image and that image is posted to
52:42 - Twitter so if you want to uh make a
52:46 - image producing twitterbot this is one
52:48 - solution for you this is not the be all
52:50 - endall solution of course there's lots
52:52 - of ways to write Twitter Bots and
52:53 - there's lots of ways to make images but
52:55 - you can see here so I'm in a moment I'm
52:57 - going to start going through those steps
52:59 - but let's just kind of get a lay of the
53:01 - land here for a second so here you can
53:03 - see this is a particular twitterbot it
53:05 - posts an image made from processing you
53:07 - can see the image here this is the
53:09 - processing sketch if I run the
53:11 - processing sketch here you can see it
53:13 - just draws this particular image uh it
53:15 - also saves it to a file and exits um
53:18 - because here now is the code you can see
53:21 - the code in node is triggering that
53:24 - processing sketch here uh and now if I
53:29 - run that
53:31 - code the image bot is starting it says
53:34 - it worked and if I go back to
53:38 - Twitter we can see here I got another
53:40 - one now these two images are different
53:42 - even though they look remarkably the
53:44 - same remarkably similar um but um they
53:47 - are they are different right someone
53:50 - doing a quick pixel analysis they're
53:52 - different they have to be different
53:53 - otherwise my whole understanding of the
53:54 - way the universe work works is faulty
53:56 - okay so now we see this is how we you
53:59 - run this stuff locally this is what I
54:00 - did in all the previous uh videos in
54:02 - this playlist about node Twitter bot
54:05 - things now we need to look at how do we
54:07 - uh how do we uh deploy this stuff to an
54:10 - Amazon ec2 instance you know basically
54:14 - you know any other any Linux uh uh Linux
54:16 - server um you could follow these same
54:18 - steps and I'm just going to happen to
54:20 - use Amazon and I was able to do this
54:22 - with a free account now at some point
54:25 - you might discover you have to pay but
54:27 - for the most part it seems like you can
54:28 - run this using uh free credits at least
54:30 - for quite a long time okay so I do
54:32 - happen to have these notes online on a
54:34 - web page which will be linked to in the
54:36 - description of this video which
54:38 - presumably you are watching at some
54:39 - other time than the actual moment that
54:41 - I'm speaking right now um but the first
54:43 - thing I'm going to do here is go to this
54:45 - link Amazon ec2 but actually I can just
54:47 - type in Amazon ec2 probably into Google
54:50 - and uh I'm going to even just uh go down
54:53 - here and click on the first result
54:55 - result and what I want to do is sign
54:57 - into the console the console is where
54:59 - I'm going to get to configure my server
55:02 - so that's the first thing I want to do
55:03 - sign into the
55:05 - console and then I have to enter in my
55:11 - password uh and I don't want Chrome to
55:14 - save it okay ah I'm presented with this
55:17 - terrifying page of like 50 zillion
55:19 - things we could do I there's so much
55:21 - here I have no idea what any of it does
55:23 - but up here in the top left
55:25 - ec2 virtual servers in the cloud
55:28 - floating in the air um so uh those
55:31 - servers which are more likely in an
55:33 - underground bunker somewhere not in a
55:34 - cloud but uh this is what I want I want
55:37 - to run a server somewhere else or I can
55:39 - run this particular bot so I'm going to
55:41 - click on
55:43 - ec2 and I get an ec2 Management console
55:47 - and oh good oh no I do I have I
55:50 - currently have one running instance
55:53 - which is I guess probably some previous
55:54 - test that I did at another time but I'm
55:56 - going to just click launch
55:59 - instance uh and now I'm presented also
56:01 - with a terrifying set of objects of op
56:03 - of objects of options so I'm going to go
56:06 - back to my notes page where I said this
56:08 - is the one that I happen to use so
56:10 - there's different versions of Linux
56:12 - operating systems and different kinds of
56:14 - and uh um the the the key things that
56:17 - I'm looking for one is free tier
56:19 - eligible I'm to see if I can get this
56:20 - running on the free tier the other is I
56:23 - need one that can also not just run but
56:25 - run Java and so happens that this ubut
56:27 - server
56:28 - 14.04 it happens to also be able to run
56:31 - uh Java I also want to make sure I pick
56:33 - general purpose free tier micro and then
56:36 - set review and launch so I'm going to do
56:38 - that I'm going to look for that one
56:40 - which is this one I'm going to hit
56:42 - select over here I don't know if you
56:44 - guys can see this I should make the but
56:45 - Ubuntu Server 1404 I'm going to hit
56:48 - select uh a general purpose T2 free tier
56:53 - eligible I'm going to hit review and
56:57 - launch and now it is
57:00 - launched um great oh no launch now I'm
57:04 - gonna hit
57:05 - launch and ah okay so
57:09 - ah so here's so if okay so here's the
57:12 - deal this is the weirdest part of
57:14 - working with Amazon ec2 is how you're
57:16 - going to now authenticate and log into
57:18 - it and you need to create this secret
57:21 - file that holds the keys to your server
57:23 - now apparently I've been here before and
57:26 - I've made a bunch of these because I was
57:28 - showing different uh examples so you
57:31 - likely won't have any previous Keys you
57:33 - can use so but I I'm going to create a
57:36 - new key pair so I need to give it a name
57:38 - and I'm going to call it coding rainbow
57:41 - if you can see that and I'm going to
57:42 - then click download key pair oh yikes ah
57:47 - what
57:48 - happened I'm zooming like a I've
57:51 - completely lost my ability to zoom
57:54 - effectively so I'm going to hit download
57:56 - key
57:57 - pair and we should see hopefully uh that
58:01 - ah you can see here uh oh I'm standing
58:04 - in front of it but down here under my
58:06 - downloads uh in the downloads there is
58:09 - now this file coding rainbow. pem you
58:13 - must have this file I now need that file
58:16 - always and forever to log into uh this
58:19 - ec2 instance in a variety of different
58:22 - ways that I'll show you okay so I have
58:24 - that file now and uh now I should be
58:27 - able to now finally say launch instances
58:30 - now that I have that file I can say
58:32 - launch instances and waiting your
58:35 - instances are now
58:37 - launching and now I can go to view
58:41 - instances and uh I don't I'm not
58:44 - worrying about that right now so you can
58:45 - see this is clearly one that I made a
58:48 - while ago uh when I was doing another
58:50 - tutorial or another test or um and you
58:53 - can see this one hasn't actually
58:54 - completely launched yet um so this is
58:57 - the problem of making these videos in
58:59 - real time where I I I I sometimes uh I
59:04 - just stand here like completely
59:05 - awkwardly like dumbfounded I don't know
59:06 - what to do it's pending let's go to the
59:08 - next steps and when we come back
59:09 - hopefully it'll be um hopefully it'll be
59:11 - working so okay so uh I I followed these
59:15 - steps I did this part now aha okay so
59:18 - what I need to do now is use that key
59:22 - that file to be able to log into that
59:25 - instance so the way that the first thing
59:27 - I need to do is actually change the
59:29 - files
59:30 - permissions so files on computers have
59:33 - permissions some files are like locked
59:35 - and you can't edit them some files are
59:37 - applications that can be executable this
59:39 - particular key file needs uh CH stands
59:42 - for like change modif actually what does
59:44 - it stand for somebody tell me somebody
59:46 - write I'll do an annotation here it say
59:48 - but I I need to run this command to
59:50 - change its file permissions so what I'm
59:53 - going to do
59:55 - is uh the first thing I need to do is I
59:58 - need to go to where that file is so
60:00 - actually I'm just going to put that file
60:02 - on the
60:03 - desktop you can come up with a better
60:05 - place to put it uh and I'm going to go
60:09 - to the desktop and I can see there is
60:12 - that
60:12 - file and uh I guess I'm zoomed in or
60:16 - something uh so now what I want to do is
60:20 - oops type in this particular command
60:24 - chod 400 and then that file name which
60:28 - is was coding rainbow. PM so that's a
60:32 - first thing I've done I've now changed
60:33 - the file permissions to 400 for that
60:36 - particular file and then now I can you
60:40 - do something called
60:42 - SSH ssh secure shell um so basically
60:48 - what I want to do is in the same way
60:50 - that I have my I'm here in terminal on
60:53 - my computer and I can look at the files
60:55 - by saying LS I can run the files by
60:57 - saying like node what I want to do is be
61:00 - able to remote into that Amazon ec2
61:04 - instance so that the terminal I'm
61:06 - looking at the commands I'm typing are
61:08 - actually not running on my laptop which
61:10 - is here that was dangerous to pick it up
61:13 - not running on this laptop but actually
61:14 - the commands are executing on the server
61:16 - floating in the cloud that's buried in
61:18 - the underground bunker okay so uh let's
61:21 - see here if ah so me rambling for a long
61:26 - period of time we're at 9 minutes here
61:28 - has actually caused this this instance
61:30 - to be running I don't know why it
61:31 - doesn't have a name here let me give it
61:33 - a
61:34 - name so um and one thing I can do here
61:38 - uh if I zoom in and rightclick see this
61:40 - connect option this is going to be
61:42 - really useful to me because actually it
61:45 - gives me all of right this is the
61:47 - command it's got I've got the command
61:49 - right here uh this is like the public
61:52 - this is like the I the address
61:54 - essentially of that instance and then
61:58 - here it's actually giving me the exact
62:00 - command to log into it so I don't even
62:03 - need to figure out what it is uh I can
62:06 - just copy this and go back to terminal
62:09 - and paste that in here hit enter and
62:13 - okay this is the first time that I'm
62:15 - connecting so my computer is saying I
62:18 - don't know about this I haven't
62:19 - connected this place before is anything
62:21 - is there anything that I should be
62:22 - afraid of here it's nothing so I should
62:24 - hit type yes and now it's added and then
62:28 - I just sit here and I hope I wait and I
62:31 - hope that the internet will oblige me
62:33 - and connect ah there we go so look at
62:36 - that you can now see here that I am
62:39 - connected I have logged in under my new
62:41 - name Ubuntu to my new address IP 17231
62:46 - 34179 so now I can do things like say uh
62:51 - PWD with print working directory here I
62:53 - am in home Ubuntu I can type LS and I
62:56 - can see there's nothing there so now
63:00 - this is great right this bot which I
63:04 - have here locally on my computer I want
63:06 - to be able to get it over here on my
63:09 - Amazon ec2 instance so how do I upload
63:11 - files there so the way one way to upload
63:14 - files to your Amazon ec2 instance is
63:17 - with uh uh FTP or file transfer protocol
63:21 - secure FTP so the way that I could do
63:24 - that is you could use any any FTP
63:27 - software and all sorts of there's
63:29 - probably a way to do it through the web
63:31 - through a browser but I'm going to use
63:32 - something called cyberduck uh which you
63:34 - can Google and download I already have
63:36 - it installed here and so I'm going to
63:38 - run cyberduck apparently I and what I'm
63:41 - going to do here I have a cyberduck open
63:44 - what I want to hit is this open
63:46 - connection so I click open connection
63:49 - and now I have this window where what I
63:53 - need to do is is put in all the
63:55 - information for that Amazon ec2 instance
63:58 - so first thing I want to do is make sure
64:00 - I do SFTP it's got to be secure shell
64:03 - fiot transfer protocol and then the
64:06 - server address if I go back to here
64:10 - should be this right this is connect to
64:13 - your instance using the public DNS it's
64:16 - this so I'm going to copy this and go
64:19 - back to
64:20 - cyberduck paste that in here now there's
64:24 - this interesting question here which is
64:26 - what's my username and password well I
64:28 - don't have a username and password I
64:30 - have this weird coding rainbow. pem
64:33 - private key file it turns out in
64:35 - cyberduck under here under more options
64:38 - I can click that and I can say
64:41 - use public key
64:44 - authentication so I click that and now I
64:46 - go to the desktop and I select this
64:50 - file and
64:52 - now I um
64:54 - I've now have this file selected as my
64:57 - way of authenticating and I should be
64:59 - able to just say
65:01 - connect oh maybe I need to write Ubuntu
65:04 - here just in the uh
65:09 - username and uh ah it works okay so that
65:13 - was one little step that I had
65:14 - personally forgotten that I need to put
65:16 - in the username I need to say Ubuntu but
65:18 - now I just have this window here right
65:20 - this is now a view into home/ Ubuntu so
65:23 - what do I want to do I want to go and I
65:26 - want to just go here this is this folder
65:29 - here node five is where I have all of my
65:33 - stuff and I'm actually just I'm just
65:35 - going to take um bot config and
65:38 - package.json I'm just going to upload
65:40 - those files right now so I can drag them
65:43 - in here drag those files into here and
65:46 - they're now uploading a little window is
65:47 - telling me progress they're transferring
65:49 - I can see that those files are listed
65:51 - here right now and now I can go back
65:54 - here and I can say LS and you can see
65:57 - those files are there yay these things
66:01 - are working so now running out of breath
66:04 - here um now I can type in node and you
66:09 - no this is going to not work because I
66:11 - i' I've missed a set of steps here but
66:13 - node bot.
66:15 - js and so what's happening here the
66:19 - program node can be found in the
66:21 - following packages node nodejs Legacy so
66:25 - and then it's saying pseudo app get
66:27 - install selected package so one thing we
66:29 - first have to do is at least configure
66:31 - node to work that the way that we want
66:33 - it to work and I believe that I have
66:35 - mentioned that here uh and these are
66:39 - some steps that you can do so let's
66:42 - actually just run through these steps
66:43 - the first thing I want to do is call uh
66:47 - do pseudo apt get update so what that
66:50 - does is just says this apt get thing
66:52 - which is a tool to like get things like
66:54 - node and other software I want to make
66:56 - sure it's updated and has all of the
66:58 - most recent stuff so that's done then
67:00 - the next thing I want to do is install
67:04 - nodejs which say pseudo app get install
67:08 - nodejs so I'm going to run that uh my
67:11 - audio is still working ah this is asking
67:13 - me if I want to use the disk space which
67:15 - of course I do um so I'm going to run
67:17 - and install
67:18 - nodejs which is great then I also want
67:21 - to make sure I have npm installed which
67:23 - is node package manager which you might
67:25 - remember from the previous node
67:27 - tutorials uh and this needs 130
67:30 - megabytes of disc space so hopefully
67:31 - this doesn't take too long um so um this
67:34 - is installing now the next step while
67:36 - it's installing let's talk about the
67:38 - next step for a second
67:41 - um this is now a a command to make sure
67:47 - that the particular version of node that
67:50 - I installed is now the actual version of
67:53 - node that will run when I type in the
67:55 - node command um so I am going to grab
68:00 - this command here and hope that this is
68:03 - done it's done and I'm going to because
68:06 - watch what happens if I just type node
68:08 - right now it doesn't actually know what
68:10 - node it can be found in the it's like
68:12 - well which one should I run nodejs
68:14 - Legacy or this one node so I want to
68:16 - make sure that I run this particular one
68:20 - with that command and now when I type
68:22 - node you'll see I'm in node so now I
68:24 - have node running on my Amazon ec2
68:27 - instance and I can oh wait if I say
68:29 - clear here oh it does still work I can
68:31 - say uh node bot. js now first error I
68:36 - get is it cannot find module twit this
68:39 - is going to be notice when I uploaded my
68:41 - files remember how I said I uploaded the
68:44 - files I didn't upload the directory that
68:46 - said node modules I could have uploaded
68:48 - that directory but it makes more sense
68:51 - for me to just let those modules get
68:53 - installed by Amazon itself so I can just
68:56 - type in npm
68:58 - install and it's now going to install
69:00 - all the modules that are needed for this
69:02 - particular bot we went through this
69:04 - locally now I'm doing this on the server
69:07 - so if if we looked here and I said I
69:09 - refreshed you can see that now there is
69:11 - a directory called node modules which
69:13 - has for example that twit module in it
69:16 - so now I should be able to say node bot.
69:19 - js and it will run now here's the thing
69:23 - it runs so these are all the steps you
69:26 - need if you just have a plain old bot
69:28 - that only runs in node but the reason
69:31 - why I got an error now is it can't find
69:34 - that image file
69:37 - output.png the reason why it can't find
69:39 - that image file output.png is because
69:42 - that's the image file that's created by
69:44 - the processing sketch so while this part
69:46 - of the video I've now concluded like you
69:48 - could if you just have a node.js bot
69:51 - you're kind of done although there's
69:52 - another step of getting it to run after
69:54 - you log out which I will get to Let's uh
69:58 - but let's get the let's get the image
70:00 - itself to let's get the image making
70:03 - processing sketch to run as well so
70:05 - let's look at how we do that and there's
70:07 - a lot of like sort of uh awfully scary
70:09 - looking weird commands to do that okay
70:12 - uh oh but
70:14 - um actually so um yeah I'll come back to
70:17 - the forever thing okay so the first
70:20 - thing we need to do is make sure Java is
70:23 - on our our uh server so first thing I
70:25 - want to do is install Java which I want
70:27 - to say apt get install default
70:30 - JRE uh so I'm going to put that in and
70:34 - run that and it's going to take 209
70:36 - megabytes of dis space I'm going to say
70:37 - yes so now I'm installing
70:40 - Java and I'm going to wait for that to
70:43 - install let's go back while we're doing
70:44 - that to the next step The Next Step okay
70:47 - so look at all these like terrifyingly
70:49 - weird looking commands so what's the
70:52 - weird thing that has to happen
70:55 - when you work when you work with
70:57 - processing on a computer your computer
70:59 - is typically connected to a monitor a
71:02 - screen and you're seeing the output of
71:04 - processing on that screen your Amazon
71:06 - ec2 instance has no screen it has no
71:09 - goey interface it's just a server that
71:11 - you can SSH into or FTP files to but
71:15 - it's known as headless meaning
71:17 - processing actually when it runs it
71:19 - breaks because it's like I don't know
71:21 - what Graphics thing to draw anything to
71:23 - there is no Graphics thing so these next
71:25 - steps are steps that create a fake
71:29 - display essentially the ec2 instance has
71:32 - this display you're tricking it into
71:34 - thinking that it is connected to a
71:36 - display because we don't need to see it
71:37 - we just want the graphics to be rendered
71:39 - to a file so the first thing I'm going
71:41 - to do is install something called xvfb
71:44 - which you could uh Google to find out
71:46 - what it
71:47 - is uh I'm going to run this particular
71:50 - command which will install this tool for
71:52 - a fake display
71:54 - the other thing I'm going to do
71:57 - is uh give it a now I'm going to give it
72:00 - an actual screen which is has a
72:02 - resolution of 1024 by 768 why
72:06 - not so I will do that it gives some
72:10 - weird little errors but you know big
72:12 - deal so this seems to be running a
72:15 - process that um uh I need to like now
72:19 - quit out of so I'm going to hit control
72:20 - C to do that uh and then then I'm ah
72:25 - okay so this was this was the command
72:28 - that creates that screen and that screen
72:30 - was there only while it's running um but
72:33 - I also now need to export it and and
72:35 - assign it to be display one so so
72:37 - actually these commands are no good so
72:40 - this is the command let me uh let me
72:42 - explain that again so I'm going to run
72:44 - this Command
72:45 - right and that screen now exists for
72:48 - processing to draw into but I can't type
72:50 - in any other commands here because it's
72:53 - it's like running so what I needed to do
72:55 - is I needed to run in the background and
72:57 - a command for having things run in the
72:59 - background is no
73:02 - hop so I'm actually going to say this
73:07 - now and now you can see I'm back to my
73:11 - terminal but that screen is now created
73:14 - and I also just want to assign it
73:16 - display number one that's what
73:17 - processing will draw to display number
73:19 - one so that's
73:21 - done so now we're in good shape now
73:24 - here's the thing if we go
73:28 - back to the code you'll notice here this
73:32 - is the code that I ran locally on my
73:35 - laptop for triggering processing to run
73:38 - processing Das Java but actually now
73:41 - that I'm on a Amazon server boy this is
73:44 - I'm 20 minutes is anybody still watching
73:46 - this 20 minutes into a tour about
73:48 - uploading stuff to Amazon ec2
73:51 - but I have now I'm now on an Amazon ec2
73:55 - instance which is a Linux machine so
73:57 - there's actually a different way that I
73:58 - can do this I can go to my processing
74:02 - sketch and I can go under file export
74:05 - application so export application is
74:08 - something you can always do and it opens
74:11 - up a little window and what I want to
74:12 - actually do is check
74:15 - Linux okay I want to export it as a
74:19 - Linux application now there is this
74:21 - embed Java option
74:23 - which I'm kind of confused whether I
74:25 - want to select did
74:28 - I I don't recall whether I need to
74:30 - select that or not let's try unselecting
74:34 - it uh I probably should keep it selected
74:37 - but let's try unselecting it and I'm
74:39 - going to hit
74:42 - export so you can see here now I have um
74:46 - the Linux application incidentally
74:49 - here's a version that you could run on a
74:50 - Raspberry Pi which we'll get to later
74:54 - so now um I should be able to go back
74:57 - and uh upload
75:00 - this um to okay so I I I'm G to have
75:04 - this application which I want to include
75:06 - so oh no ah boy this tutorial is not
75:08 - going very well that light went off
75:10 - camera went off I don't know why this
75:11 - light keeps coming off um so I'm going
75:15 - to now now what I need to do is I need
75:20 - to take this folder and and I'm going to
75:24 - upload that
75:26 - folder
75:28 - to
75:29 - oops my server so I'm G to upload that
75:33 - here so I'm uploading that Linux
75:38 - application it's there now I'm also
75:40 - going to rename this file this folder
75:43 - and call it
75:45 - rainbow uh and I want to I do want to do
75:48 - that um so you can see here the
75:51 - application is now here in this
75:53 - particular folder so the first thing we
75:56 - need to do is figure out does this even
75:58 - work so remember here I am now on my I'm
76:02 - now logged in to the server and you can
76:05 - see there is a directory called
76:07 - rainbow so I can go into that directory
76:10 - we can see what's there this is actually
76:11 - the application and the way in Linux the
76:14 - way that you execute something is with
76:17 - do
76:18 - SL rainbow and it's going to say
76:21 - permission denied so there's a few
76:23 - things that I need to do here I need to
76:24 - get this to run somehow so let's go back
76:27 - to the steps um so it looks like uh all
76:32 - I need to do uh uh is say pseudo right
76:36 - so pseudo is a way of saying like I am
76:39 - in charge Here I Am the super user here
76:43 - so let's try running the application now
76:47 - uh what did I do wrong command not found
76:54 - Pudo oh oh you know what weirdly
76:56 - interestingly enough it needs to be in
77:01 - quotes is that really
77:03 - true that doesn't make any
77:08 - sense uh no why did I put the quotes
77:11 - there okay I have to pause this
77:13 - video while I figure this out I don't
77:15 - know if anyone is still watching this in
77:17 - the chat this has turned into such a
77:20 - like ginormous topic I knew I didn't
77:23 - want to make this
77:24 - video
77:28 - uh uh I'm looking in the chat okay does
77:31 - anybody know what I'm missing here well
77:33 - one thing is maybe I just need
77:34 - to uh change the
77:43 - permissions oh that's all I needed to
77:48 - do and now you see the image file is
77:51 - there crap okay so let me
77:54 - [Music]
78:00 - remove that file it's not there anymore
78:04 - let me
78:07 - uh
78:13 - uh oh it's working
78:16 - I uh I don't know what's something to
78:19 - make
78:21 - it not
78:24 - work no it's still
78:28 - working uh whatever ah
78:32 - shoot yes thank you oh plus X I like
78:35 - that better okay thank you sack Fab for
78:38 - correcting me all right I'm I'm just GNA
78:40 - have to frustratingly um splice this
78:43 - video back
78:45 - together um
78:48 - okay and I'm going to hit record okay I
78:53 - did forget a crucial step which is that
78:55 - I have to fix the permissions on that
78:57 - file to make it executable and a way I
78:59 - can do that is by chod plus x uh the
79:03 - file's name is
79:07 - Rainbow I don't know why I said plus X
79:11 - when what did I do wrong there sack but
79:13 - I'll just go back to 777 which makes it
79:16 - executable uh so let me try this
79:21 - again uh okay
79:24 - so I did miss a step there which is that
79:26 - um the the the permissions of the file I
79:28 - have to set the permissions to be
79:29 - executable which I can do by saying chod
79:32 - 777 uh rainbow and now I should be able
79:36 - to say do SL rainbow and run it and it
79:41 - did something it finished and now let's
79:43 - type LS and we can see look at that
79:46 - there is a file in there now called
79:49 - output.png so if I go in here and hit
79:54 - refresh and we go grab this file and I
79:57 - download it to my
79:59 - desktop and I take a look at it you can
80:01 - see this is the image that was now
80:03 - generated on the server so now we have
80:07 - the um processing sketch as a exported
80:10 - Linux application running on the Amazon
80:13 - ec2
80:15 - instance boy this is I know this is like
80:18 - 20 some minutes into this long tutorial
80:20 - but we're so close now to actually
80:21 - making the thing run it's very exciting
80:24 - okay so now if I go back to here one
80:27 - thing you'll notice I'm going to go back
80:28 - to the code is remember this this was
80:32 - the command that I had for running on my
80:34 - Mac to execute a processing sketch using
80:37 - processing command line processing Das
80:39 - Java but now that it's a Linux
80:41 - application the only thing I need to do
80:44 - is actually just I change that command
80:46 - to
80:48 - this rainbow only that's not exactly
80:52 - right because it's in a different
80:53 - directory and so I'm going to go here
80:57 - and um I just need to make sure
81:00 - uh um I I have the folder so I think
81:05 - actually I can just do this
81:07 - rainbowrainbow
81:09 - and uh now I've changed the code and
81:12 - since I changed the code I also need to
81:16 - re-upload the
81:20 - code uh to the server so I'm overwriting
81:24 - it continue so now that new code is
81:26 - running on the
81:28 - server and I should be able to go back a
81:34 - directory so now what's here we have
81:38 - bot. Js which triggers the processing
81:41 - application which is in rainbow and
81:43 - communicates with the Twitter API and po
81:45 - post a tweet so let's see if this works
81:48 - image bot is
81:49 - starting it worked and now now if I go
81:54 - here and look at the bot we should see 7
81:59 - seconds ago this particular image now I
82:02 - want to make sure it's really
82:04 - overwriting and making a new image so
82:06 - the only way I can think to really do
82:08 - that is to um go into the processing
82:12 - sketch for a
82:14 - second and uh change this to
82:18 - like a green
82:21 - value so let's make
82:25 - um
82:28 - oops you can see now the color should be
82:31 - green and I'm going to uh export this
82:36 - export application as a Linux
82:38 - application go into here take
82:43 - this and I probably shouldn't be doing
82:46 - this right now I'm going to upload
82:48 - it so I'm replacing
82:51 - it
82:54 - here we go so now I uploaded the new
82:58 - application and I'm going to go into
83:01 - that directory I'm going to whoops
83:04 - change the permissions again you don't
83:06 - ever need to do this I just want to
83:07 - really make sure it's working which is
83:09 - risky because it might not be I'm GNA go
83:12 - back up a directory and I'm going to say
83:15 - node bot. js image bot is
83:19 - starting it says it worked but I'm not
83:22 - entirely sure it overwrote that file I
83:24 - have a bad feeling it didn't ah it did
83:27 - okay that's magical so it does work so
83:30 - um and I can run it
83:32 - again now this particular bot by the way
83:35 - you noticed it just quits it only does
83:37 - it
83:38 - once and you can see we got another one
83:40 - these are two even though the this the
83:41 - same color scheme they're different I I
83:43 - should just make a a processing sketch
83:45 - that makes a much more recognizable
83:47 - image but here's the thing um uh what
83:51 - you want probably is your Bot to be
83:53 - running continuously so the one thing is
83:55 - just to add set interval to the code um
83:58 - but the other thing that you need is to
84:00 - use a tool known as forever so this is
84:03 - the last piece that's on um that's on
84:07 - this particular uh walk through so in
84:09 - other words what you want is for the
84:11 - node app to run forever in the
84:13 - background even when you log out of
84:16 - Amazon uh your instance and forever we
84:19 - saw that this no Huff thing is a way of
84:21 - doing it which is also a way but node
84:24 - has its own way of doing that which is
84:25 - something called forever so um I can say
84:28 - pseudo npm install forever- G so this is
84:32 - a node module that's not associated with
84:34 - a particular node application but a sort
84:36 - of global thing that you would run
84:38 - across a lot of applications so if I
84:41 - copy that here that's going to install
84:45 - this tool called
84:47 - Forever and then
84:51 - um
84:54 - it's gonna I'm do my in Forever install
84:57 - dance uh and then uh and then I can now
85:01 - um start and stop things I can say
85:04 - forever start bot.
85:07 - JS which is running it uh and you know
85:10 - you can set all sorts of parameters like
85:13 - you know how long should it be up for
85:14 - how long should it sleep and all that
85:16 - thing but I'm just letting it use the
85:17 - default and another thing I can type now
85:19 - is
85:21 - forever list I think and you can see
85:26 - um let's let's hold on let's make this a
85:28 - little bit more easy for you to see uh
85:32 - forever. list and you can see that uh
85:36 - this is the particular process that's
85:38 - running no. JS bot JS so if I wanted
85:41 - that one's just running now forever it's
85:43 - not tweeting forever because the process
85:46 - is not set to do that but I could um I
85:48 - can do things like say forever stop all
85:51 - I believe which just stopped everything
85:54 - so now if I say forever list again
85:57 - there's no forever processes running and
85:59 - I can say uh forever uh start again um
86:03 - so there's lots of different ways so so
86:05 - this is what you want to do you want to
86:07 - and so if I set that running and I log
86:10 - out my bot is now going to be running
86:12 - Forever on that Amazon ec2
86:14 - instance this is like probably one of
86:16 - the longest tutorial videos I've ever
86:18 - made it was completely sort of like
86:19 - frantic and a little haphazard this is
86:21 - probably hard to follow probably to be
86:23 - honest with you this page of
86:25 - instructions might actually make it
86:27 - easier but let me just review to recap
86:30 - what I covered at this particular very
86:32 - long tutorial which is that first thing
86:34 - you want to do is create that server
86:37 - instance right you need to get a key
86:40 - pair a file so that you can log into it
86:44 - once you've logged into it you want to
86:46 - SSH into it you can connect to it from
86:48 - terminal then you want to do things like
86:50 - install node then you want to connect to
86:53 - it with FTP SFTP cyberduck being a tool
86:57 - for doing that that allows you to upload
86:59 - your files there once you've uploaded
87:01 - your files there you can run your Bot
87:04 - but if your Bot also runs a processing
87:06 - sketch you want to also install Java run
87:10 - these commands to create the fake
87:11 - display in the background then export
87:14 - your processing sketch as a Linux
87:16 - application and upload that once you
87:18 - have all of that there then you can use
87:21 - forever to run your node bot that
87:23 - triggers the processing
87:25 - sketch this is like the um the kick the
87:28 - cat that my father bought for tuu Z but
87:32 - anyway that that that that runs the node
87:35 - that runs the processing sketch that
87:37 - creates the fake display that runs with
87:39 - forever my father bought for anyway
87:41 - whatever um so uh all those steps and
87:44 - you've got your thing running so I've
87:46 - anybody actually watched this entire
87:48 - video and actually has a node bot
87:50 - running on an Amazon EC do instance
87:53 - successfully I don't know please send me
87:55 - a tweet or something or to let me know
87:57 - because um uh uh because that would make
88:01 - me happy um to hear that okay so I'm
88:03 - going to stop recording now uh I will in
88:06 - the description for this video link to
88:08 - the written instructions link to all the
88:10 - references you need and hopefully this
88:13 - will be something that's useful to
88:14 - somebody someday somewhere in the
88:17 - universe and record okay um I have lost
88:22 - 50% of the viewers which is no surprise
88:26 - this was kind of one of my like uh not
88:28 - so
88:29 - interesting um oh I missed the space for
88:32 - the plus X thank you um this is uh one
88:35 - of my um um you know the tutorials that
88:38 - I just sort of said I would do and been
88:39 - meeting to get to um but to be honest it
88:43 - is not not I mean it's just like not one
88:45 - of the more interesting are are uh ones
88:49 - but it it is what it is
88:51 - um okay what time is it it
88:53 - is um 12:50 I think so I said I was
88:57 - going to um does anybody have any
88:58 - questions about the raspberry pie I
89:00 - think I'm going to come back to the
89:01 - Raspberry Pi this afternoon I'm going to
89:02 - take a break for lunch I'm just doing
89:05 - this all day by the way if you were
89:06 - wondering and I'm going to come back I
89:08 - know some of you might be late at night
89:09 - wherever you are in the world or maybe
89:11 - now you're just waking up um but I'm I'm
89:13 - I I'll Stick Around for another minute
89:14 - or two um five or 10 minutes even uh if
89:18 - people have a few questions they want to
89:19 - ask about any of that was there stuff uh
89:22 - also just you know I'm happy to just
89:23 - hear any feedback now is that is this
89:25 - kind of this not the kind of tutorial I
89:27 - usually do because it like involved so
89:30 - many moving parts and all these weird
89:31 - commands and I'm copying pasting and I
89:33 - don't understand half of what any of it
89:34 - means um but
89:38 - uh uh I see there are some things uh in
89:41 - the chat from before uh um but if people
89:46 - are just making comments but if anybody
89:48 - has any questions they want to ask let
89:50 - me know I'm planning to come back this
89:51 - afterno afternoon I'm going to see if
89:52 - the Whiteboard
89:53 - arrived so I can install it um because
89:57 - then maybe I could do some tutorials
89:58 - with the Whiteboard which would be
90:03 - exciting how is the white balance
90:05 - looking do I look like a a human being
90:07 - or like do I have like a weird orange
90:11 - color um okay I think an hour and a half
90:15 - um I feel pleased that I was able to get
90:17 - these two things off my list I'm just
90:20 - going to go look at the list by by the
90:22 - way uh while I'm here I'm waiting to see
90:24 - if anybody has any
90:25 - questions
90:29 - um uh so here deploying to ec2 this is
90:33 - basically what I did I did Heroku and
90:36 - ec2 I wanted to do a run it on Raspberry
90:38 - Pi tutorial which I might try to do this
90:41 - afternoon um and then there were some
90:43 - other other aspects to the twitterbot
90:46 - stuff that I think would be good to
90:48 - include as well um which I will get to
90:55 - um great uh thank you Dale um nice to
90:59 - hear that
91:00 - feedback um okay um white balance it
91:04 - looks okay thanks Sam okay so um can you
91:09 - tell how to host a website locally in a
91:12 - network okay that's a good question
91:14 - actually so I could do that right here
91:16 - right now which is that
91:19 - um uh if I
91:22 - um so uh okay so let me go back so if I
91:26 - had a
91:29 - um so if I had a node program that was a
91:33 - web server I could just run that node
91:36 - program right here and then this laptop
91:39 - this thing that I'm using right here you
91:40 - can see there's a laptop here uh sfpc
91:42 - that's where I am um this laptop will
91:45 - become a web server and I actually have
91:47 - another laptop over here that I could
91:49 - then connect to and see the web server
91:51 - and I I'll show you kind of um a little
91:53 - version of that real quick so I'm not
91:55 - going to write a node
91:57 - server I don't have that at the ready
92:00 - but actually
92:01 - Macs uh come with python pre-installed
92:04 - and python allows you to run a web
92:06 - server so if I were to just go here um
92:09 - I'm going to go to any one of these um
92:13 - uh folders I'm going to just go into
92:15 - this folder here and a CD into this
92:17 - directory so let's say in this directory
92:20 - these are all my files from my website
92:22 - they HTML files CSS files all that stuff
92:25 - and if what I and and now I want to run
92:27 - whatever my thing is that's a web server
92:30 - so you oh whoops okay I need to let you
92:33 - guys be able to see this um so I want to
92:36 - run so here is one way of running a web
92:39 - server on a Mac but you know node
92:41 - programmer can run a web server any you
92:43 - can program your own web server in any
92:44 - number of languages you can download
92:46 - things that run web servers but I'm
92:47 - running a web server so you can see the
92:50 - web Ser web server is running running on
92:52 - 0.0.0 meaning this computer Local Host
92:54 - on Port 8000 so if I go to my browser
92:58 - and I type in Local Host Port 8000
93:02 - that's the URL for this particular web
93:05 - server I can see it here and I can go
93:07 - into here and I can click here and I can
93:09 - see like this is a page that's running
93:10 - one of my p5js examples so now the
93:14 - question
93:15 - becomes that's running on this
93:17 - particular laptop what if I want this
93:19 - laptop to access this both of these
93:21 - laptops are on the same local network so
93:23 - first thing I need to know
93:25 - is um not about this Mac if I go to
93:29 - system
93:30 - preferences um under
93:34 - network uh and under uh Advanced here
93:37 - actually you know what it's right
93:39 - here Wi-Fi is connected and has this
93:42 - particular IP address this is actually
93:43 - going to become quite important when I
93:44 - look at some Raspberry Pi uh tutorials
93:47 - because I'm going to connect to the
93:47 - Raspberry Pi in a similar way so what I
93:50 - need to do now is on this lab laptop I
93:52 - need to typee in that that IP address
93:55 - into the into the um browser so I'm
93:58 - going to do that
94:05 - 192.168.1.1 191 but that's not enough
94:08 - because I'm running the server on Port
94:11 - 8000 so colon
94:14 - 8000 and you can see here I don't know
94:16 - if you can see you probably can't see
94:18 - this but if I go under forces under one
94:21 - of the examples I don't know if you can
94:23 - see this but this is that web page
94:24 - running I've messed with the key by like
94:27 - Shining Light at the camera um but so
94:29 - now I have this laptop connecting it so
94:31 - there's a web server here and the other
94:33 - computers are connecting to it like it's
94:35 - a web server hopefully that answered
94:37 - that
94:39 - question that's kind of its own little
94:41 - tutorial itself I should have hit record
94:43 - um okay I am now going to uh pause for a
94:47 - second and look at some things on my
94:50 - computer while I wait to see if there's
94:51 - any other
94:52 - questions I made 16 oh boy I think that
94:58 - twitterbot might still be running on
95:00 - Amazon ec2 or did I just do it so many
95:02 - times nine minutes
95:05 - ago that's weird I wonder what that
95:08 - twitterbot is doing I should make sure
95:10 - it's
95:11 - stopped uh oh okay it is stopped maybe
95:15 - it did
95:16 - have oh yeah I just didn't have the set
95:19 - interval I haven't commented out that
95:20 - was silly me I should have put that back
95:22 - in it's in the code there um notice that
95:25 - okay
95:28 - um all right so I'm gonna take a lunch
95:33 - break Tuesdays and Fridays are currently
95:36 - my days Friday I have actually some
95:37 - other stuff planned this week so I'm
95:39 - going to see if I can do some more
95:40 - recording on Thursday maybe this week if
95:42 - I have time but I uh as for those of you
95:45 - who might not be aware I'm kind of
95:47 - trying to spend more time uh this
95:49 - semester while I have a break from
95:52 - teaching my usual load of classes to
95:53 - make many video
95:55 - tutorials um and I have a list of things
95:57 - I'm kind of tracking here uh Chrome
95:59 - extension tutorials get tutorials more
96:03 - other things um so uh send me feedback
96:05 - Twitter at shiffman is the best way to
96:07 - reach me um I I'm not really uh uh and
96:11 - also if programming questions it's great
96:13 - if you use forum. processing.org for
96:15 - processing in p5js questions um and I'm
96:19 - going to try it's 1:00 I'm going to try
96:22 - in about an hour or an hour and a half
96:24 - to do some more recording for lat this
96:26 - afternoon around 2:30 so somewhere
96:28 - around 2 or 3 Eastern Standard Time um
96:31 - so send me feedback send me your weird
96:34 - gifts that you make of these videos if
96:36 - anybody wants to do that um and um
96:40 - that's
96:41 - uh that's it for for right now I will be
96:44 - back this afternoon okay um see you all
96:47 - I'm G click I click a button over here
96:49 - and then I go away I think

Cleaned transcript:

Dan and I am broadcasting live from the school for poetic computation on uh Tuesday March 22nd it's not really the morning anymore it's about 1120 a.m. I'm here um hopefully you can hear me hopefully you can see me I've got some new lights set up so I think the picture quality should be a bit better the keying from the green screen should be a bit better please let me know in the chat how it looks how it sounds um I'm still kind of in a phase of kind of testing this setup and getting it configured so I like not really prepared which is why I'm kind of stream of conscious rambling here but I do have some stuff I want to do today uh in addition to just kind of talk and answer any questions but on my list is I've been meeting for a long time I made a whole set of video tutorials about making a Twitter pot Twitter pot a Twitter bot using node.js so I finally want to look at some strategies for deploying that bot to a server we can look at how you can deploy it to Heroku or an Amazon ec2 instance or discuss other possibilities oh Cloud9 is another one you can use I think for free I should maybe look at that um as well as actually just running your Bot on a Raspberry Pi so I want to not really I'm going to pull out a Raspberry Pi and see if I can even hook it up into the system and have it behind me and see what we can kind of like FS futs with it Fitz with it fuddle with it I don't know what you do with a Raspberry Pi you program it you make it do stuff um but um so I don't know I'm going to hang out here for an hour or two and kind of do this stuff if I get a good if I have a good like chunk of something I'm going to record that separately as a video tutorial that will get all this will get saved but I'm looking to make in the next hour or two while I'm fussing around also make some video tutorials so I'm looking in the chat um do I look I don't know if I I noticed the way I had the white balance on the camera I was very like pale the other day now I look a little bit orange but um if uh if you wouldn't mind letting me know how the picture quality is and how the sound is that would be helpful to me before I get kind of started here um okay so let's see uh yeah I got some folders on the desktop here all right um does that make a weird noise like a slurping noise um okay so picture and sound are good seems perfect perfect great okay thanks for the feedback so I'm going to get started then um let's see what we can do first here let me revisit um and try to get so here's the thing I'm kind of doing my strategy for today is rather than like prepare and then turn on the stream and be prepared I'm just gonna prepare while I'm streaming so I think the first thing I'm going to do is kind of get myself back to um some of those bot examples um so I'm going to open up Sublime uh and I'm going to go here to the finder uh and see if I can figure out where where are all the where are all those oh documents yeah uh data apis arrays other R of code video notes where are all the bot examples other documents this is not going well so far uh uh hold on let's look let's try this bot. JS okay ah they're definitely somewhere um let me see these things in the finder uh old desktop old YouTube code Old this is brilliant brilliant file naming here documents old desktop old YouTube code but that's what I'm looking for so I'm going to grab those things old desktop old YouTube code uh so let's grab I'm going to move this stuff to the desktop here and and drag this into here uh so this was a bunch of my old bot examples um oh unregistered Sublime Text I have purchased Sublime Text but I guess because I made a different user account on this machine uh um I see somebody wrote in the comment image could be sharper I'm assuming that's just the sort of compression of the internet speed um it is I am I am streaming this out in 720p I was reluctant to try to do it higher but anybody else let me know if it seems like you have trouble um seeing anything um okay uh let's see here let's just find a very simple example which just uh let's look for the like this one I think maybe uh this one does a random number uh every what's 20 times a th000 every 20 seconds um and um somebody asks why not use adom IO text editor no reason I just happened to using Sublime here um that would be that would also be a good one for me to use um so I think this will work here as a demonstration to start with um let me open up terminal now uh uh well where am I here in terminal here oh my goodness uh and I'm in this one I have no idea and I think the the good question another question here is what is this example hooked up to Twitter am I logged in to uh no I'm logged into to who myself let's let's log out out that now you all saw my Twitter page let's log into ITP A2Z I try to remember the password which is my test Twitter account no oh wait first of all let's even see if that's the right account name ITP A2Z no A2Z ITP yes okay log in uh what did I say it was A2 Z ITP uh interact oops I just said the password out loud uh I don't know should I save it what do you guys think oh I feel so stressed out when I get these queries let's not save it let's not save it bad idea bad idea okay um so now let's run this bot uh bot is starting it worked yeah there we go this is a tweet we just made 3 seconds ago random number 39 the number of the day isn't that that's a Sesame Street thing right the number of today is 39 uh okay and we've got our random number bot and so I think I have all the pieces here now I have a browser Page open to the twitterbot I have Sublime Text open to the code for the twitterbot there it is and I have also terminal now uh in the directory for that Twitter bot so I can run things and I don't need the activity monitor and Etc I don't need this oh I I am going to need this ah yeah when we get to the Amazon thing okay do I have cyberduck here somewhere yep okay we're going to use that for ftping files uh am I logged into some sort of get something like that okay um so let's see here let me look um there are 28 people watching hello so a lot of people seem to have just joined I'm just getting set up here the things that I wanted to talk about today are how to deploy your twitterbot uh and as well as look at a Raspberry Pi let's should we try should I try let me get my res I got to leave for a second not really leave not really I'm in a place I'm in this like kind of underground bunker it's not underground at all it's like a room with no windows uh but there's a room with Windows right over there I can go get a little sunshine um but over in that room over there I left a raspberry piie so I need to just walk over there and get it be right back there's lots of things here I could trip over so I have to do this very carefully be right back oh you can still hear me though because I got a live mic going on here so I'm in the other room you can't see me now and it I can't find the raspberry Pine oh you know why because I already brought it in here cuz I'm a lunatic oh and you know what a light went out um one of my lights went out probably because I stepped on the cable now it's on it just shined in my eyes Okay um so let's talk about the Raspberry Pi for a second so here's the thing if you've made so if you've made a twitterbot and if you've made it using node or whatever you made it with you now have the ability as we just saw to on your own computer run that tter oh this the font should be bigger here so you can see that to run it there we go right you have the ability to run it and you could just let that twitterbot run but uh if this is your laptop eventually you want to close it you want to shut it down you need some place where it can run permanently and your options could be like okay well you could dedicate a computer sitting in your home or office or wherever you have your your computer to running your Bot but that might be a little bit unreasonable um you know it's kind of an expensive thing to dedicate an entire computer just for a bot so one of the nice things you can do I have a box here hey props I have in here a Raspberry Pi I show it to the C this won't this will be out of focus uh a Raspberry Pi a Raspberry Pi is a small computer it looks like this I actually have a little camera hooked up to it which I will at some point see if I can get working um I happen to have also a little um I need another camera to like close up on this I happen to have a little um what what do you call this wifi thing dongle USB WiFi thing so this can connect to the internet of course I could just plug it directly into ethernet um and this is computer this is running a Linux operating system there's a little micro SD card in here um which is has the Raspberry Pi uh has the Linux operating system on it um it's running that and that can run node so this being only $35 is a much more reasonable thing to leave dedicated to running your Bot so that is one option and I would like to maybe I'm not going to do this right now set this up I'm going to try to outp get the HDMI output of this or actually I don't even need that because if I'm just going to could log into it I don't know what I'm doing yet but I'm going to set this up and show you guys some stuff with the Raspberry Pi but maybe we should move on um uh maybe we should move on and I'm going to look at some options for deploying this bot to servers so let's think about what some oh this light does not stay on why is that hold on maybe I need a piece of tape here why is it Loose hold on I'm going to work on this light over here okay come on there we go there we go all right um so uh oh I've lost a lot of viewers I was up to like 30 30 some viewers now there's only 23 of you watching but that's nice okay so what I want to do is look up here um I have some notes on this which I will show you where those are uh um uh shi. github.io A2Z F15 so if you A2Z df15 okay if you go to this URL I have some notes on how to deploy your Bot to both Heroku which is a company that runs servers that you can get an account on um and actually you can run your twitterbot on Heroku for free as far as I can tell I've been I've I've been able to do that I'm going to show you that um obviously if you want to do more sophisticated things you'll probably need a paid account for Heroku so we'll look at that briefly um and um so on this page I have um two uh two links here of notes one is a page of notes on how to deploy your Bot to ec2 and another is a page of notes of how to deploy your Bot to Heroku so I'm going to open this up and and uh you can see the and what I'm going to do is you can kind of like see the basic instructions here but I'm going to walk through them and I'm going to then I'm going to hit record so maybe this first video that I'm going to do is will be called how to deploy your nodejs Bot to Heroku when when I woke up this morning is that really what I thought I was going to do with my day was come here and talk to myself in a room with a wall painted green about deploying a node bot to Heroku anyway such is my life you're the you your life is to watch this of course you you you you have free will and can turn this off and go to the sunshine I will stay here in my dark room okay so um I'm going to do a couple things one is um ah hello tun I see hello Andrew uh oh Andrew Kim writes in the chat by the way Twitter Bots are estimated to create approximately 24% of tweets that are on Twitter is that really true well we are only adding to the problem if that's the case so I want to get my notes open on this I have a second La my my my second labtop over here uh so shiftman github.io um slash uh A2 z F15 and I'm going to go to um the I'm gonna start with Heroku up the camera just went off I'm going to walk around here and turn it back on sorry about that I also got to check the I'm in a bit of a battery situation which is that uh I I'm running this lav mic and the receiver for the lav mic off doublea batteries and I kind of um those might run out which Cas I might have to pause and go out and get some batteries but uh we'll see I still got a full bar so I think it's going to last for a little while okay so um okay so what I want to check here is okay good that's not installed so I need to install this Heroku tool belt and the one thing I need to make sure I can do uh is make sure I can log into Heroku here uh so I'm going to log in uh make sure I know my password so sad I use one password and I'm just don't have it ah I was lucky okay uh let's not save it I probably should save it I don't know what's happening anymore okay the boy look at all of these tests test test delete soon this is my brilliant bot test delete soon test Twitter bot test think I should delete some of these can I delete them very quickly uh it's probably going to take me a while we'll just make another test it's fine okay so I think I'm ready for the first tutorial for today it only took me 16 minutes to get to that and the first tutorial I'm going to do is deploying your twitterbot to Heroku and I probably should practice this before I hit record but I could always do it twice and whatever anyway so I'm going to check the chat to make sure everybody can still hear me and everything looks okay um uh hello to more of you who are saying hello in the chat I love this purple color I got to change my desktop background to like a nice purple or something um um hello to brother rain uh in the chat uh I gained a viewer I was losing people through my rambling but uh once I started like holding up a prop and had this like Raspberry p and I was trying to I don't know okay so uh we're gonna do this so um so I've got just to revisit this I've got oops I don't need this here or maybe I do uh I've got my Twitter page open for viewing if the bot works I have got I'm logged into my Heroku dashboard I have got the code for this particular bot open and I also have terminal in the directory for the bot okay so I think I'm ready here we go so now I have to come over here and I'm going to hit record I'm going to have a little sip of this uh I'm having coffee today instead of tea which is very dangerous since I have like a sort of a hyper energy problem anyway but what can you do okay here we go hello in this video I'm going to look I got to start over I have this on the wrong page uh okay tur this over here okay uh and then I'm going to make this bigger uh okay okay uh here we go uh stop I'm gonna try this again hello in this video I am going to look at how you can take a twitterbot written in node.js and deploy it to a server and the server I will look at in this video is one that runs on Heroku so what are the pieces of this the first thing is I have this simple little bot which just tweets a random number you can see I just ran this bot and tested it over here uh and you can see there's the random number it picked random number 39 uh and I also have um the my browser logged into Heroku so shoot I have to start over I have to start over sorry I got I I I I had this in the wrong page uh this code and terminal okay okay here we go I'm going to start over again um record hello hello hello my name is Dan hello in this video I am going to look at how to deploy your Bot written in no JS to uh a server and that server being one that runs on a service called Heroku so let's take a look at the pieces so you can see here I have my browser open to my test account A2Z ITP which uh I most recently just tweeted a bot tweeted a random number 39 and I have the code for that bot open right here you can see it in Sublime it's very simple it has a single function that tweets that random number uh and then I also have my terminal open to that directory and I could just really quickly test to make sure that bot works the bot is starting it worked let's go back to the browser I'm gonna hit refresh and we can see now I got random number four so everything is working the point is in this video is I want to say this bot that's running right over here I don't want to run it from my laptop I want it to run autonomously on a server somewhere that I can set it to go and never think about it again so let's tweet it again let's quit it um and look at how we can do that so the site that I'm the the service that I'm going to use in this particular video is Heroku so um you'll need an account so you know if you're watching this video and you don't have a Heroku account go to uh Heroku dcom Heroku spelled this way.com and you can see here I went there now now I'm already logged in so it went straight to my dashboard and you can see that I have all these things already listed on my dashboard because apparently I've tried to make a variety of I've tried to do this a whole bunch of time test this test that delete soon Etc so what are these things these things are referred to as dinos I think that's right not Dino DS Dino Dy NS like a dynamic thing that's running it's a process that you're running so what I need to do is create a dyo um to run my bot so the very first thing that I'm going to do is go up here to this plus sign up in the top right and I'm going to say create new app so app is really what I'm doing I'm going to create an app I'm going to call it uh coding rainbow uh demo uh should only contain lowercase letters okay rainbow demo uh it is available I'm going to create it and it is now there so there's a whole bunch of things I need to do here and one of the things about using Heroku is Heroku is kind of its own animal it's not really an animal it's a web server but whatever it's it's its own it has its own way of doing things and the way that you send things to Heroku and get things back from Heroku is two ways one is you use git what is git oh boy if you don't know what git is stay tuned for my upcoming set of git and GitHub tutorials but for now if you don't know what git is um you're going to be you'll still be able to follow this but you're just going to have to verbatim kind of copy I heard a noise there's a person somewhere nearby I have to keep going anyway okay um uh you can just sort of verbatim copy um some of these uh commands um okay so now I'm waving to somebody who uh it's my my neighbor Joe I love Joe he's a great guy uh he came and said hi the other day okay I got to keep going here so um so you can see here that on the Heroku page it's even giving you some sort of commands that you can follow we'll worry about that in a moment but we're missing one other aspect here the first thing that it's saying to do is saying herok login meaning log into your Heroku account from terminal somehow so if I go over here and I type in Heroku login it says command not found so one of the things you need in order to work with Heroku is a piece of software called the Heroku tool belt so I probably should have preinstalled that but I'm just going to Google Heroku tool belt I'm going to click on the first thing that comes up and I'm going to download it and I think it's going to this is going to happen quickly enough that I can just do this I'm going to install it continue continue install uh password and there we go I'm installing it I do my installing dance I don't know I I didn't I like the weird thing about me doing this dance while this video is going I have a preview screen I'm like watching myself over here I supposed to just dancing to the camera that was very weird I will edit that out that no one that someone will make a weird GI out of that or something okay so now I should be able to go back and type in Heroku look at that oh installing tool I didn't even know it was going to do that so maybe you have to do that I was about to just say Heroku log in but I just was typing Heroku to make sure it works apparently I have to do another dance because it's installing a bunch of stuff oh that was I don't have to dance okay so now we can see um I should be able to say Heroku login and it should ask for my credentials my account is under my email my password is ah I'm logged in so now that I'm logged in I can actually start to do things which would allow me to deploy uh from terminal here all the stuff for my bot to Heroku itself so let's go back now to this p page and uh oh actually this page no this page sorry and we can see here now now that I've logged into Heroku the next thing I need to do is make my uh bot into a git repository again the what git is if you're not familiar with it is out of the scope of this particular video but it's um version Control software and uh what it's going to allow me to do is once I turn it into a git repository meaning all the code for my bot is in this folder it's going to allow me to push that git repository to Heroku because everything that lives on Heroku is also a g repository so I'm going to be able to follow these commands the first thing I'm going to do is say get AIT get init and it initialized an empty git reposit now if you get if I type got by the way instead of git it's going to say got command not found if you get this error meaning get command not found this just means you need to download and install git so if I Google git the very first thing that comes up is this particular website g.& reason you didn't have that already okay now that I've done that the next command that I need to go to is this Heroku git remote a so what I'm doing is I'm saying I want my git repository this thing that lives on my computer I want it to be linked to a remote place that remote place far off in the distance is Heroku and I not just want to link it to Heroku but I want to link it to my app that's coding rainbow demo so I can just take exactly this here and I can type put that into terminal I see it over here on my preview screen and there we go it's all set now and then I can go here and I can say the next thing okay so the next set of commands here is now I actually want to send the stuff to Heroku the way that you send stuff to Heroku is with a command a get command called push in git push means send pull means receive so there's a there's there's a lot to there's a lot to this but I first thing I need to do is like add and commit and so I'm just going to follow these commands I someday this will link to my get tutorials which will explain all these commands so I'm going to say get add and then I'm just going to use exactly I'm going to say commit get commit D am make it better this I could put my own comment in here I'm going to say uh oh and you can't this needs to move like a little bit over here I'm going to say uh this is my bot and it did that and then I'm going to say get push Heroku Master get push Heroku Master which will send it so now it's sending it to Heroku and it's going to do all sorts of stuff to try to run it the thing is I missed some steps so these would have been the steps if I had a kind of traditional oldfashioned uh web application you know I made some sort of server it serves up web pages people log onto my server they see the web pages but that's not actually what I made I made this bot which is just this process that needs to run behind the scenes uh with no there's no web server there's no place there's no URL for anyone to go to I just want this thing to run on the server so I have over here I'm just want to make sure I get the syntax right my notes um and uh okay so in order to do this I'm missing a particular piece so first thing I want to do actually by the way I really should have practiced this in advance but this is fine so there's so let's here we are we' kind we've got okay what have we done so far we wrote the code for our bot we pushed it to Heroku and we and it even just sort of said verifying deploy done it didn't give me any error messages so let's actually go and look now I'm going to go back to uh my dashboard and I should see here I should be able to find oh yeah sorry whoops I should be able to find coding rainbow demo I'm going to click on that and we're going to see um it says sleeping so it's not really working it's not really doing anything yet the reason it's not doing anything yet is because it is listed as a web app I need to change this to be what's called a worker app and that's what I was talking about a worker is a web app is something that serves up web pages a worker is something that just works behind the scenes with its own process and that's what the bot is so in order to do that I need to go back to my code here and I actually need to create a new file so this is my folder with all the stuff and I need to create a new file and I need that file to be called I'm going to save it uh P file proc file this is the process file it's a configuration file that Heroku will look for to know what is it that this thing is supposed to do so I'm going to save that and in that file I'm going to say this thing is actually a worker not not a web application and it its job is to run node bot. js so I'm going to save that in there and then I have got to go back and this is again um if you're unfamiliar with Git I here's the thing I need to I made some changes to my project now I need those changes to go onto Heroku those changes are only locally on my laptop so to do that I need to say get add dot this is adding my changes and I need to say commit which is giving a message to those which is adding the proc file you can follow along those this is the same things I did for the first one and then I can say get push Heroku Master this is sending it to Heroku Master Heroku is our Master uh and now that done it's finished uh as I do my little dance I have to wait for all this to finish launching verifying deploy Etc now I should be able to go here and hit refresh and I see now I see look at that it says worker node bot. js and this I want to turn off I need to hit edit I want to turn off the web the web process confirm and I want to turn on the worker one confirm and now as far as I know oh my goodness boy we we sent a lot of tweets um you can see now it's uh you can see it's it's running now so it was probably running it's it's interesting that it actually worked maybe earlier but now it should be running every 20 seconds it should um post a new tweet and we should be able to see this by the way uh if I back here say Heroku log uh oh what I meant log is not a command perhaps I meant logs and in fact yes I meant logs uh Heroku logs and you can see by the way this is running because there's two new tweets uh and here uh it worked right so um this is oh yeah so you can see by the way there's a bunch of things going on here because I let it run as a web thing the first time and the web thing has an error it stopped but you can see the worker thing is just saying it worked it worked it worked so I don't know if 20 seconds has passed but if I do this again look at the logs you can see the worker is still going so um I'm actually going to shut it off um because I have it set to like tweet every 20 seconds which is pretty often but you can see that this works so now my bot is deployed on Heroku and by the way free account free Heroku account um to to do this so um so you don't this you not need a paid Heroku account to Simply run run a an app with a worker process so hopefully this was helpful to you this is about a 15 minutes of the steps um what I'm going to do in the video's description is uh kind of paste links to all the pieces you need to download uh I'll have links to all the pieces you need to download I also have this that I ran through as a written tutorial so I will post a link to that as well um and uh but before I go away I'm just going to show you how I could shut it off if I want to so I could hit edit here I could turn this off and hit confirm so now my bot uh even though it did four more random numbers it should have stopped now and it won't do any more random numbers I've shut it off right now so uh that was that concludes our discussion of how to deploy your no dutchs bot to Heroku over here I'm gonna hit stop okay so I'm now GNA uh I don't know if anyone's still watching the live stream I'm going to come back here and look at the live dashboard um and uh some people said hi okay there 25 of you watching how was that did that make sense I'm like tempted to just like redo that whole video cuz I was like didn't know what was happening but but um hopefully that was okay up this light keeps going you know the key seems to be fine even with this light going out um I don't know whether it's a power issue or it's just loose like if I squeeze it the light goes on can you see that there's a light going on and off yeah probably can um let me hold on let me take some more drastic measures here I have a feeling that this just is not in tightly enough okay sorry I just want to fix this light hello everyone hello sorry ah there we go I'm I'm I will be back talking to you momentarily there we go that seems more that seems better now okay seems to be staying on okay um hello again so let's see uh so uh Andrew writes uh what kinds of things do you have to pay Heroku to be able to do to be honest with you I'm not that much of an expert on Heroku but I know for a fact that I use it for um so one thing I use n Heroku for if I go to natureof code.com because I'm inadvertently plugging this um and I click buy now you'll notice actually the URL takes you to here so it's actually I'm running a server on Heroku to run this uh purchasing system uh which by the way you can you can download it for free but um so but I have a database that stores a record of every purchase and I have to have a paid account in order to have that database so that's one thing certainly I think to use a database probably it also was I would imagine related to how much bandwidth you get uh server space you get those types of things uh also how many different like apps you can run probably also is related to um whether you have a paid or a free account um okay uh that was one question uh another question is so that is for JavaScript based bots so you could deploy nonjavascript based Bots to Heroku whatever runs on Heroku you can run the thing that I have not been able to do with Heroku is run a bot that one um you know I made these tutorials so long ago but um the bot tutorials if you go through them look at doing just a text based bot and then an imagebased bot and the image based bot uses then processing which runs a Java program to do the image stuff so I have not been able to run Java uh Java with the JavaScript node bot on Heroku but I have been able to do that on Amazon ec2 which is what I also want to show uh next in this session today what about Windows users I guess the console commands are similar uh Leander R asks uh correct uh for Windows users you just need your own uh everything is the same uh you just need to have like sigin or Powershell or even like git bash is a tool you can download to have uh console command line access to your Windows machine but otherwise it's exactly the same um yeah um okay any other questions um I'm going to start getting ready here to look at Amazon ec2 uh um okay Amazon okay so first thing I want to do is go to shiftman GitHub so I also have some notes here oh yeah um so I'm going to go through this now uh one of the tricky things was oh my God this is like totally insane I'm going to leave this open on this machine um so I'm going to go through the ec2 stuff the tricky thing is getting to log in I think I'm just going to like hope that this I can make this work um yeah so let me go let me just see though if whoops um why is this URL not correct uh let me fix this uh so hold on I'm going to fix that URL on that tutorial page um still um post your questions in the chat while I'm and I will answer them in a moment while I'm getting here where where was that week nine ec2 ec2 uh edit I don't know why this oh wh I have this backwards in the brackets should be Amazon ec2 so this should eventually update um okay um uh okay uh oh interesting somebody writes in the chat I I'm I'm sorry I would love to know how to pronounce your name Goa tasan writes uh for web apps Heroku used to be very generous with their offer now free Dino is limited to run maximum of 18 hours during a 24 hours window that's interesting I was not aware of that so it might be the case that um this might not be the best uh it be interesting to see as you guys try deploying with a free account if it lets you run your Bot 24 hours a day um you know you might be fine if your Bot as a worker process only does something like once every hour um but uh be curious and then uh Cy writes as a non webd what does Heroku do well Heroku I'm I'm really the wrong person to be I should just not be here making these videos cuz there are certain things I really I'm also a non webdev as a non webdev I will now attempt to make up an answer for that question but I I I'll give you my sense of it those of you who I'm sure know this better will write in the chat but oroku is a uh server um uh that you get to have an account on and a server is just a computer that can run programs now for the most part the kinds of programs you want to run are those that serve web pages but as I'm showing you here any program that you can run you can run on your Heroku inst the thing about Heroku is they have their own way of doing things which is a little nonstandard it's a little different than I just have a computer that's plugged into the internet that I can log into and put files on they want you to use their Heroku tool belt software and you have to send things using git so there's it's Heroku is a um Heroku has a kind of High um sort of high threshold it's not that user friendly for a beginner or someone who doesn't have a lot of experience working with these but but you know hack away at it and hopefully these that video will help um uh is there documentation for the different commands you can make the Twitter bot do uh yes so what I what I would suggest in this case is um if you go to uh my uh YouTube channel um and go back to um this particular playlist Twitter about tutorial no. and processing I go through all of the twitterbot stuff in a series of like five or six videos of how you can be unate with the API and how you set up your keys and all that stuff so that video that I made about Heroku is going to get tacked on the end of that playlist as just deploying your Bot uh okay um and now I will attempt to do the next demonstration I'm going to check the battery on the oh on my um I still have a full bar there so I think I'm good battery wise and I have three bars here so I think I'm pretty good battery wise for audio um incidentally I'm not trying to the one thing I'm doing today is making uh videos that you that don't use the Whiteboard um oh whoops I don't have the um because I I have a new whiteboard coming by FedEx today I'm going try to mount it to the wall over there I realize now that I probably need unfortunately I have four LED lights which is lighting this area really well I thought I would just use two here and two there I might need to get four more um um but that that should be so as soon as I get the Whiteboard up I'm very the I'm going to uh be able to do a lot more tutorials that involve kind of different mathbased algorithms and also the set of get tutorials I want to do which um even though I I kind of want to use the Whiteboard to kind of diagram out how git Works um okay uh um okay so let's let me get to uh here and Let me refresh this uh Ah that's good the camera went off and I am going to uh come back over here uh uh uh Chris Coleman writes on Twitter by the way we need a diagram and walk of your setup Studio setup sometime so I did that the other day on Periscope and maybe I'll do that again today I I I kind of but I didn't like it wasn't my intention to do that so I will um I definitely will do that I have a a video about it that I made a while ago but it's it's a different set up now so yeah I will do that um okay uh uh here we go now um let me just have a little sip of this okay so um I'm going to go back to I'm going to close this we don't need Heroku open anymore we need this open um and uh ah so actually so here's the thing I want to show how in this video not just to run a plain vanilla twitterbot but a twitterbot that also posts images so let me see if I think that's this one so this is the one that runs um that does the image let me see what happens here so hold on a second uh let me get this set um sorry uh I want to go to the node five example uh and say node bot. js let's see if this works claims it worked let's see what's here okay great so that did work so um so I'm going to uh did I yeah so this particular bot what it's do doing and again the tutorial is um uh the tutorial I'm sorry I've lost my train of thought here for a second the it I I already made tutorials that show how to have the twitterbot create an image and post that image so what I'm going to do now is just show how to um send the image uh how to do that on Amazon Okay so I got to look through these notes for a second just to see um that's installing Java doing this command uh oh right right right right right right right right right right right right right okay uh all right so I'm going to follow these instructions in this video I probably should practice this but I'm not going to um and so here we go so so actually what I want to do also is I just need to have this here uh I need to have this here and what I'm going to do is open up uh processing let me just see if I need to update my processing oh I do uh okay yes so by the way uh um uh there is 3.0.2 which I'm going to get right now uh so I'm using the most recent processing in this particular video uh we'll be getting to the ec2 thing in a second hey I've got I'm gating audience members I got to get do something more interesting I did do a little dance earlier that was kind of pathetic but uh so I am just I just want to have the most recent version of processing and I'm going to have this sketch open oh it's in use let's close processing let's replace it on the desktop okay so here I have the notes I have Twitter open I'm also going to need cyberduck at some point but I will get to that later I have this and let we open up processing open it and just getting all the pieces together can close close this one uh processing is now open I guess I don't need to show the welcome message every time and what I want to do is uh look at this and uh okay oh I forgot that it has exit in there okay great so this is the processing sketch it creates an image the bot triggers the processing sketch draws the image posts it to Twitter and that's that okay so I'm going to show you how now to run this locally and then deploy to ec2 okay and I'm going to have my notes open over here as well um in case I need need to look at that ec2 it's a little bit big uh okay and uh here we go so I have the processing sketch the twitterbot code and uh the twitterbot open getting all these notifications what are they oh people are liking my tweets and saying hi to me that's nice okay uh but I just want to be in my egg I'm an egg okay uh purple yay more purple okay sorry I'm I'm I'm I'm like scared of making this particular tutorial but I'm just gonna do it all right here we go um I'm going to hit let me just check the chat to make sure there's nobody saying anything uh I lost a viewer okay here we go I have my notes Here There we go okay hello in this video I'm going to look at how you can deploy a Twitter bot written in node.js to an amaz Amazon ec2 instance in particular one of the reasons I want to use an Amazon ec2 instance in this case is because not only is my twitterbot written in node.js but my twitterbot triggers a processing sketch which is a Java program to create an image and that image is posted to Twitter so if you want to uh make a image producing twitterbot this is one solution for you this is not the be all endall solution of course there's lots of ways to write Twitter Bots and there's lots of ways to make images but you can see here so I'm in a moment I'm going to start going through those steps but let's just kind of get a lay of the land here for a second so here you can see this is a particular twitterbot it posts an image made from processing you can see the image here this is the processing sketch if I run the processing sketch here you can see it just draws this particular image uh it also saves it to a file and exits um because here now is the code you can see the code in node is triggering that processing sketch here uh and now if I run that code the image bot is starting it says it worked and if I go back to Twitter we can see here I got another one now these two images are different even though they look remarkably the same remarkably similar um but um they are they are different right someone doing a quick pixel analysis they're different they have to be different otherwise my whole understanding of the way the universe work works is faulty okay so now we see this is how we you run this stuff locally this is what I did in all the previous uh videos in this playlist about node Twitter bot things now we need to look at how do we uh how do we uh deploy this stuff to an Amazon ec2 instance you know basically you know any other any Linux uh uh Linux server um you could follow these same steps and I'm just going to happen to use Amazon and I was able to do this with a free account now at some point you might discover you have to pay but for the most part it seems like you can run this using uh free credits at least for quite a long time okay so I do happen to have these notes online on a web page which will be linked to in the description of this video which presumably you are watching at some other time than the actual moment that I'm speaking right now um but the first thing I'm going to do here is go to this link Amazon ec2 but actually I can just type in Amazon ec2 probably into Google and uh I'm going to even just uh go down here and click on the first result result and what I want to do is sign into the console the console is where I'm going to get to configure my server so that's the first thing I want to do sign into the console and then I have to enter in my password uh and I don't want Chrome to save it okay ah I'm presented with this terrifying page of like 50 zillion things we could do I there's so much here I have no idea what any of it does but up here in the top left ec2 virtual servers in the cloud floating in the air um so uh those servers which are more likely in an underground bunker somewhere not in a cloud but uh this is what I want I want to run a server somewhere else or I can run this particular bot so I'm going to click on ec2 and I get an ec2 Management console and oh good oh no I do I have I currently have one running instance which is I guess probably some previous test that I did at another time but I'm going to just click launch instance uh and now I'm presented also with a terrifying set of objects of op of objects of options so I'm going to go back to my notes page where I said this is the one that I happen to use so there's different versions of Linux operating systems and different kinds of and uh um the the the key things that I'm looking for one is free tier eligible I'm to see if I can get this running on the free tier the other is I need one that can also not just run but run Java and so happens that this ubut server 14.04 it happens to also be able to run uh Java I also want to make sure I pick general purpose free tier micro and then set review and launch so I'm going to do that I'm going to look for that one which is this one I'm going to hit select over here I don't know if you guys can see this I should make the but Ubuntu Server 1404 I'm going to hit select uh a general purpose T2 free tier eligible I'm going to hit review and launch and now it is launched um great oh no launch now I'm gonna hit launch and ah okay so ah so here's so if okay so here's the deal this is the weirdest part of working with Amazon ec2 is how you're going to now authenticate and log into it and you need to create this secret file that holds the keys to your server now apparently I've been here before and I've made a bunch of these because I was showing different uh examples so you likely won't have any previous Keys you can use so but I I'm going to create a new key pair so I need to give it a name and I'm going to call it coding rainbow if you can see that and I'm going to then click download key pair oh yikes ah what happened I'm zooming like a I've completely lost my ability to zoom effectively so I'm going to hit download key pair and we should see hopefully uh that ah you can see here uh oh I'm standing in front of it but down here under my downloads uh in the downloads there is now this file coding rainbow. pem you must have this file I now need that file always and forever to log into uh this ec2 instance in a variety of different ways that I'll show you okay so I have that file now and uh now I should be able to now finally say launch instances now that I have that file I can say launch instances and waiting your instances are now launching and now I can go to view instances and uh I don't I'm not worrying about that right now so you can see this is clearly one that I made a while ago uh when I was doing another tutorial or another test or um and you can see this one hasn't actually completely launched yet um so this is the problem of making these videos in real time where I I I I sometimes uh I just stand here like completely awkwardly like dumbfounded I don't know what to do it's pending let's go to the next steps and when we come back hopefully it'll be um hopefully it'll be working so okay so uh I I followed these steps I did this part now aha okay so what I need to do now is use that key that file to be able to log into that instance so the way that the first thing I need to do is actually change the files permissions so files on computers have permissions some files are like locked and you can't edit them some files are applications that can be executable this particular key file needs uh CH stands for like change modif actually what does it stand for somebody tell me somebody write I'll do an annotation here it say but I I need to run this command to change its file permissions so what I'm going to do is uh the first thing I need to do is I need to go to where that file is so actually I'm just going to put that file on the desktop you can come up with a better place to put it uh and I'm going to go to the desktop and I can see there is that file and uh I guess I'm zoomed in or something uh so now what I want to do is oops type in this particular command chod 400 and then that file name which is was coding rainbow. PM so that's a first thing I've done I've now changed the file permissions to 400 for that particular file and then now I can you do something called SSH ssh secure shell um so basically what I want to do is in the same way that I have my I'm here in terminal on my computer and I can look at the files by saying LS I can run the files by saying like node what I want to do is be able to remote into that Amazon ec2 instance so that the terminal I'm looking at the commands I'm typing are actually not running on my laptop which is here that was dangerous to pick it up not running on this laptop but actually the commands are executing on the server floating in the cloud that's buried in the underground bunker okay so uh let's see here if ah so me rambling for a long period of time we're at 9 minutes here has actually caused this this instance to be running I don't know why it doesn't have a name here let me give it a name so um and one thing I can do here uh if I zoom in and rightclick see this connect option this is going to be really useful to me because actually it gives me all of right this is the command it's got I've got the command right here uh this is like the public this is like the I the address essentially of that instance and then here it's actually giving me the exact command to log into it so I don't even need to figure out what it is uh I can just copy this and go back to terminal and paste that in here hit enter and okay this is the first time that I'm connecting so my computer is saying I don't know about this I haven't connected this place before is anything is there anything that I should be afraid of here it's nothing so I should hit type yes and now it's added and then I just sit here and I hope I wait and I hope that the internet will oblige me and connect ah there we go so look at that you can now see here that I am connected I have logged in under my new name Ubuntu to my new address IP 17231 34179 so now I can do things like say uh PWD with print working directory here I am in home Ubuntu I can type LS and I can see there's nothing there so now this is great right this bot which I have here locally on my computer I want to be able to get it over here on my Amazon ec2 instance so how do I upload files there so the way one way to upload files to your Amazon ec2 instance is with uh uh FTP or file transfer protocol secure FTP so the way that I could do that is you could use any any FTP software and all sorts of there's probably a way to do it through the web through a browser but I'm going to use something called cyberduck uh which you can Google and download I already have it installed here and so I'm going to run cyberduck apparently I and what I'm going to do here I have a cyberduck open what I want to hit is this open connection so I click open connection and now I have this window where what I need to do is is put in all the information for that Amazon ec2 instance so first thing I want to do is make sure I do SFTP it's got to be secure shell fiot transfer protocol and then the server address if I go back to here should be this right this is connect to your instance using the public DNS it's this so I'm going to copy this and go back to cyberduck paste that in here now there's this interesting question here which is what's my username and password well I don't have a username and password I have this weird coding rainbow. pem private key file it turns out in cyberduck under here under more options I can click that and I can say use public key authentication so I click that and now I go to the desktop and I select this file and now I um I've now have this file selected as my way of authenticating and I should be able to just say connect oh maybe I need to write Ubuntu here just in the uh username and uh ah it works okay so that was one little step that I had personally forgotten that I need to put in the username I need to say Ubuntu but now I just have this window here right this is now a view into home/ Ubuntu so what do I want to do I want to go and I want to just go here this is this folder here node five is where I have all of my stuff and I'm actually just I'm just going to take um bot config and package.json I'm just going to upload those files right now so I can drag them in here drag those files into here and they're now uploading a little window is telling me progress they're transferring I can see that those files are listed here right now and now I can go back here and I can say LS and you can see those files are there yay these things are working so now running out of breath here um now I can type in node and you no this is going to not work because I i' I've missed a set of steps here but node bot. js and so what's happening here the program node can be found in the following packages node nodejs Legacy so and then it's saying pseudo app get install selected package so one thing we first have to do is at least configure node to work that the way that we want it to work and I believe that I have mentioned that here uh and these are some steps that you can do so let's actually just run through these steps the first thing I want to do is call uh do pseudo apt get update so what that does is just says this apt get thing which is a tool to like get things like node and other software I want to make sure it's updated and has all of the most recent stuff so that's done then the next thing I want to do is install nodejs which say pseudo app get install nodejs so I'm going to run that uh my audio is still working ah this is asking me if I want to use the disk space which of course I do um so I'm going to run and install nodejs which is great then I also want to make sure I have npm installed which is node package manager which you might remember from the previous node tutorials uh and this needs 130 megabytes of disc space so hopefully this doesn't take too long um so um this is installing now the next step while it's installing let's talk about the next step for a second um this is now a a command to make sure that the particular version of node that I installed is now the actual version of node that will run when I type in the node command um so I am going to grab this command here and hope that this is done it's done and I'm going to because watch what happens if I just type node right now it doesn't actually know what node it can be found in the it's like well which one should I run nodejs Legacy or this one node so I want to make sure that I run this particular one with that command and now when I type node you'll see I'm in node so now I have node running on my Amazon ec2 instance and I can oh wait if I say clear here oh it does still work I can say uh node bot. js now first error I get is it cannot find module twit this is going to be notice when I uploaded my files remember how I said I uploaded the files I didn't upload the directory that said node modules I could have uploaded that directory but it makes more sense for me to just let those modules get installed by Amazon itself so I can just type in npm install and it's now going to install all the modules that are needed for this particular bot we went through this locally now I'm doing this on the server so if if we looked here and I said I refreshed you can see that now there is a directory called node modules which has for example that twit module in it so now I should be able to say node bot. js and it will run now here's the thing it runs so these are all the steps you need if you just have a plain old bot that only runs in node but the reason why I got an error now is it can't find that image file output.png the reason why it can't find that image file output.png is because that's the image file that's created by the processing sketch so while this part of the video I've now concluded like you could if you just have a node.js bot you're kind of done although there's another step of getting it to run after you log out which I will get to Let's uh but let's get the let's get the image itself to let's get the image making processing sketch to run as well so let's look at how we do that and there's a lot of like sort of uh awfully scary looking weird commands to do that okay uh oh but um actually so um yeah I'll come back to the forever thing okay so the first thing we need to do is make sure Java is on our our uh server so first thing I want to do is install Java which I want to say apt get install default JRE uh so I'm going to put that in and run that and it's going to take 209 megabytes of dis space I'm going to say yes so now I'm installing Java and I'm going to wait for that to install let's go back while we're doing that to the next step The Next Step okay so look at all these like terrifyingly weird looking commands so what's the weird thing that has to happen when you work when you work with processing on a computer your computer is typically connected to a monitor a screen and you're seeing the output of processing on that screen your Amazon ec2 instance has no screen it has no goey interface it's just a server that you can SSH into or FTP files to but it's known as headless meaning processing actually when it runs it breaks because it's like I don't know what Graphics thing to draw anything to there is no Graphics thing so these next steps are steps that create a fake display essentially the ec2 instance has this display you're tricking it into thinking that it is connected to a display because we don't need to see it we just want the graphics to be rendered to a file so the first thing I'm going to do is install something called xvfb which you could uh Google to find out what it is uh I'm going to run this particular command which will install this tool for a fake display the other thing I'm going to do is uh give it a now I'm going to give it an actual screen which is has a resolution of 1024 by 768 why not so I will do that it gives some weird little errors but you know big deal so this seems to be running a process that um uh I need to like now quit out of so I'm going to hit control C to do that uh and then then I'm ah okay so this was this was the command that creates that screen and that screen was there only while it's running um but I also now need to export it and and assign it to be display one so so actually these commands are no good so this is the command let me uh let me explain that again so I'm going to run this Command right and that screen now exists for processing to draw into but I can't type in any other commands here because it's it's like running so what I needed to do is I needed to run in the background and a command for having things run in the background is no hop so I'm actually going to say this now and now you can see I'm back to my terminal but that screen is now created and I also just want to assign it display number one that's what processing will draw to display number one so that's done so now we're in good shape now here's the thing if we go back to the code you'll notice here this is the code that I ran locally on my laptop for triggering processing to run processing Das Java but actually now that I'm on a Amazon server boy this is I'm 20 minutes is anybody still watching this 20 minutes into a tour about uploading stuff to Amazon ec2 but I have now I'm now on an Amazon ec2 instance which is a Linux machine so there's actually a different way that I can do this I can go to my processing sketch and I can go under file export application so export application is something you can always do and it opens up a little window and what I want to actually do is check Linux okay I want to export it as a Linux application now there is this embed Java option which I'm kind of confused whether I want to select did I I don't recall whether I need to select that or not let's try unselecting it uh I probably should keep it selected but let's try unselecting it and I'm going to hit export so you can see here now I have um the Linux application incidentally here's a version that you could run on a Raspberry Pi which we'll get to later so now um I should be able to go back and uh upload this um to okay so I I I'm G to have this application which I want to include so oh no ah boy this tutorial is not going very well that light went off camera went off I don't know why this light keeps coming off um so I'm going to now now what I need to do is I need to take this folder and and I'm going to upload that folder to oops my server so I'm G to upload that here so I'm uploading that Linux application it's there now I'm also going to rename this file this folder and call it rainbow uh and I want to I do want to do that um so you can see here the application is now here in this particular folder so the first thing we need to do is figure out does this even work so remember here I am now on my I'm now logged in to the server and you can see there is a directory called rainbow so I can go into that directory we can see what's there this is actually the application and the way in Linux the way that you execute something is with do SL rainbow and it's going to say permission denied so there's a few things that I need to do here I need to get this to run somehow so let's go back to the steps um so it looks like uh all I need to do uh uh is say pseudo right so pseudo is a way of saying like I am in charge Here I Am the super user here so let's try running the application now uh what did I do wrong command not found Pudo oh oh you know what weirdly interestingly enough it needs to be in quotes is that really true that doesn't make any sense uh no why did I put the quotes there okay I have to pause this video while I figure this out I don't know if anyone is still watching this in the chat this has turned into such a like ginormous topic I knew I didn't want to make this video uh uh I'm looking in the chat okay does anybody know what I'm missing here well one thing is maybe I just need to uh change the permissions oh that's all I needed to do and now you see the image file is there crap okay so let me remove that file it's not there anymore let me uh uh oh it's working I uh I don't know what's something to make it not work no it's still working uh whatever ah shoot yes thank you oh plus X I like that better okay thank you sack Fab for correcting me all right I'm I'm just GNA have to frustratingly um splice this video back together um okay and I'm going to hit record okay I did forget a crucial step which is that I have to fix the permissions on that file to make it executable and a way I can do that is by chod plus x uh the file's name is Rainbow I don't know why I said plus X when what did I do wrong there sack but I'll just go back to 777 which makes it executable uh so let me try this again uh okay so I did miss a step there which is that um the the the permissions of the file I have to set the permissions to be executable which I can do by saying chod 777 uh rainbow and now I should be able to say do SL rainbow and run it and it did something it finished and now let's type LS and we can see look at that there is a file in there now called output.png so if I go in here and hit refresh and we go grab this file and I download it to my desktop and I take a look at it you can see this is the image that was now generated on the server so now we have the um processing sketch as a exported Linux application running on the Amazon ec2 instance boy this is I know this is like 20 some minutes into this long tutorial but we're so close now to actually making the thing run it's very exciting okay so now if I go back to here one thing you'll notice I'm going to go back to the code is remember this this was the command that I had for running on my Mac to execute a processing sketch using processing command line processing Das Java but now that it's a Linux application the only thing I need to do is actually just I change that command to this rainbow only that's not exactly right because it's in a different directory and so I'm going to go here and um I just need to make sure uh um I I have the folder so I think actually I can just do this rainbowrainbow and uh now I've changed the code and since I changed the code I also need to reupload the code uh to the server so I'm overwriting it continue so now that new code is running on the server and I should be able to go back a directory so now what's here we have bot. Js which triggers the processing application which is in rainbow and communicates with the Twitter API and po post a tweet so let's see if this works image bot is starting it worked and now now if I go here and look at the bot we should see 7 seconds ago this particular image now I want to make sure it's really overwriting and making a new image so the only way I can think to really do that is to um go into the processing sketch for a second and uh change this to like a green value so let's make um oops you can see now the color should be green and I'm going to uh export this export application as a Linux application go into here take this and I probably shouldn't be doing this right now I'm going to upload it so I'm replacing it here we go so now I uploaded the new application and I'm going to go into that directory I'm going to whoops change the permissions again you don't ever need to do this I just want to really make sure it's working which is risky because it might not be I'm GNA go back up a directory and I'm going to say node bot. js image bot is starting it says it worked but I'm not entirely sure it overwrote that file I have a bad feeling it didn't ah it did okay that's magical so it does work so um and I can run it again now this particular bot by the way you noticed it just quits it only does it once and you can see we got another one these are two even though the this the same color scheme they're different I I should just make a a processing sketch that makes a much more recognizable image but here's the thing um uh what you want probably is your Bot to be running continuously so the one thing is just to add set interval to the code um but the other thing that you need is to use a tool known as forever so this is the last piece that's on um that's on this particular uh walk through so in other words what you want is for the node app to run forever in the background even when you log out of Amazon uh your instance and forever we saw that this no Huff thing is a way of doing it which is also a way but node has its own way of doing that which is something called forever so um I can say pseudo npm install forever G so this is a node module that's not associated with a particular node application but a sort of global thing that you would run across a lot of applications so if I copy that here that's going to install this tool called Forever and then um it's gonna I'm do my in Forever install dance uh and then uh and then I can now um start and stop things I can say forever start bot. JS which is running it uh and you know you can set all sorts of parameters like you know how long should it be up for how long should it sleep and all that thing but I'm just letting it use the default and another thing I can type now is forever list I think and you can see um let's let's hold on let's make this a little bit more easy for you to see uh forever. list and you can see that uh this is the particular process that's running no. JS bot JS so if I wanted that one's just running now forever it's not tweeting forever because the process is not set to do that but I could um I can do things like say forever stop all I believe which just stopped everything so now if I say forever list again there's no forever processes running and I can say uh forever uh start again um so there's lots of different ways so so this is what you want to do you want to and so if I set that running and I log out my bot is now going to be running Forever on that Amazon ec2 instance this is like probably one of the longest tutorial videos I've ever made it was completely sort of like frantic and a little haphazard this is probably hard to follow probably to be honest with you this page of instructions might actually make it easier but let me just review to recap what I covered at this particular very long tutorial which is that first thing you want to do is create that server instance right you need to get a key pair a file so that you can log into it once you've logged into it you want to SSH into it you can connect to it from terminal then you want to do things like install node then you want to connect to it with FTP SFTP cyberduck being a tool for doing that that allows you to upload your files there once you've uploaded your files there you can run your Bot but if your Bot also runs a processing sketch you want to also install Java run these commands to create the fake display in the background then export your processing sketch as a Linux application and upload that once you have all of that there then you can use forever to run your node bot that triggers the processing sketch this is like the um the kick the cat that my father bought for tuu Z but anyway that that that that runs the node that runs the processing sketch that creates the fake display that runs with forever my father bought for anyway whatever um so uh all those steps and you've got your thing running so I've anybody actually watched this entire video and actually has a node bot running on an Amazon EC do instance successfully I don't know please send me a tweet or something or to let me know because um uh uh because that would make me happy um to hear that okay so I'm going to stop recording now uh I will in the description for this video link to the written instructions link to all the references you need and hopefully this will be something that's useful to somebody someday somewhere in the universe and record okay um I have lost 50% of the viewers which is no surprise this was kind of one of my like uh not so interesting um oh I missed the space for the plus X thank you um this is uh one of my um um you know the tutorials that I just sort of said I would do and been meeting to get to um but to be honest it is not not I mean it's just like not one of the more interesting are are uh ones but it it is what it is um okay what time is it it is um 1250 I think so I said I was going to um does anybody have any questions about the raspberry pie I think I'm going to come back to the Raspberry Pi this afternoon I'm going to take a break for lunch I'm just doing this all day by the way if you were wondering and I'm going to come back I know some of you might be late at night wherever you are in the world or maybe now you're just waking up um but I'm I'm I I'll Stick Around for another minute or two um five or 10 minutes even uh if people have a few questions they want to ask about any of that was there stuff uh also just you know I'm happy to just hear any feedback now is that is this kind of this not the kind of tutorial I usually do because it like involved so many moving parts and all these weird commands and I'm copying pasting and I don't understand half of what any of it means um but uh uh I see there are some things uh in the chat from before uh um but if people are just making comments but if anybody has any questions they want to ask let me know I'm planning to come back this afterno afternoon I'm going to see if the Whiteboard arrived so I can install it um because then maybe I could do some tutorials with the Whiteboard which would be exciting how is the white balance looking do I look like a a human being or like do I have like a weird orange color um okay I think an hour and a half um I feel pleased that I was able to get these two things off my list I'm just going to go look at the list by by the way uh while I'm here I'm waiting to see if anybody has any questions um uh so here deploying to ec2 this is basically what I did I did Heroku and ec2 I wanted to do a run it on Raspberry Pi tutorial which I might try to do this afternoon um and then there were some other other aspects to the twitterbot stuff that I think would be good to include as well um which I will get to um great uh thank you Dale um nice to hear that feedback um okay um white balance it looks okay thanks Sam okay so um can you tell how to host a website locally in a network okay that's a good question actually so I could do that right here right now which is that um uh if I um so uh okay so let me go back so if I had a um so if I had a node program that was a web server I could just run that node program right here and then this laptop this thing that I'm using right here you can see there's a laptop here uh sfpc that's where I am um this laptop will become a web server and I actually have another laptop over here that I could then connect to and see the web server and I I'll show you kind of um a little version of that real quick so I'm not going to write a node server I don't have that at the ready but actually Macs uh come with python preinstalled and python allows you to run a web server so if I were to just go here um I'm going to go to any one of these um uh folders I'm going to just go into this folder here and a CD into this directory so let's say in this directory these are all my files from my website they HTML files CSS files all that stuff and if what I and and now I want to run whatever my thing is that's a web server so you oh whoops okay I need to let you guys be able to see this um so I want to run so here is one way of running a web server on a Mac but you know node programmer can run a web server any you can program your own web server in any number of languages you can download things that run web servers but I'm running a web server so you can see the web Ser web server is running running on 0.0.0 meaning this computer Local Host on Port 8000 so if I go to my browser and I type in Local Host Port 8000 that's the URL for this particular web server I can see it here and I can go into here and I can click here and I can see like this is a page that's running one of my p5js examples so now the question becomes that's running on this particular laptop what if I want this laptop to access this both of these laptops are on the same local network so first thing I need to know is um not about this Mac if I go to system preferences um under network uh and under uh Advanced here actually you know what it's right here WiFi is connected and has this particular IP address this is actually going to become quite important when I look at some Raspberry Pi uh tutorials because I'm going to connect to the Raspberry Pi in a similar way so what I need to do now is on this lab laptop I need to typee in that that IP address into the into the um browser so I'm going to do that 192.168.1.1 191 but that's not enough because I'm running the server on Port 8000 so colon 8000 and you can see here I don't know if you can see you probably can't see this but if I go under forces under one of the examples I don't know if you can see this but this is that web page running I've messed with the key by like Shining Light at the camera um but so now I have this laptop connecting it so there's a web server here and the other computers are connecting to it like it's a web server hopefully that answered that question that's kind of its own little tutorial itself I should have hit record um okay I am now going to uh pause for a second and look at some things on my computer while I wait to see if there's any other questions I made 16 oh boy I think that twitterbot might still be running on Amazon ec2 or did I just do it so many times nine minutes ago that's weird I wonder what that twitterbot is doing I should make sure it's stopped uh oh okay it is stopped maybe it did have oh yeah I just didn't have the set interval I haven't commented out that was silly me I should have put that back in it's in the code there um notice that okay um all right so I'm gonna take a lunch break Tuesdays and Fridays are currently my days Friday I have actually some other stuff planned this week so I'm going to see if I can do some more recording on Thursday maybe this week if I have time but I uh as for those of you who might not be aware I'm kind of trying to spend more time uh this semester while I have a break from teaching my usual load of classes to make many video tutorials um and I have a list of things I'm kind of tracking here uh Chrome extension tutorials get tutorials more other things um so uh send me feedback Twitter at shiffman is the best way to reach me um I I'm not really uh uh and also if programming questions it's great if you use forum. processing.org for processing in p5js questions um and I'm going to try it's 100 I'm going to try in about an hour or an hour and a half to do some more recording for lat this afternoon around 230 so somewhere around 2 or 3 Eastern Standard Time um so send me feedback send me your weird gifts that you make of these videos if anybody wants to do that um and um that's uh that's it for for right now I will be back this afternoon okay um see you all I'm G click I click a button over here and then I go away I think
