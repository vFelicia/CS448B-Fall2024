02:20 - do
02:25 - [Music]
02:39 - audio sound check now
02:42 - uh my audio should be better than it
02:45 - usually is because i have a new
02:46 - microphone but i am curious to hear from
02:48 - you
02:49 - what it sounds like let me know
03:07 - [Music]
03:30 - [Music]
03:34 - second audio sound check i actually
03:37 - had the audio of the music doubled so
03:40 - now this is a better
03:41 - check although everyone said it sounded
03:43 - good before
03:44 - all right
03:48 - can anyone actually tell that this mic
03:50 - is better than what i used to use last
03:53 - [Music]
03:58 - week
04:08 - [Music]
04:18 - [Music]
04:39 - i'll be starting in about two minutes or
04:42 - one minute and
04:43 - 40 seconds
04:57 - [Music]
05:36 - baby
05:40 - [Music]
06:10 - [Music]
06:28 - hello there's gotta be a universal way
06:32 - to say
06:32 - good blank with all of the different
06:35 - times good day but it might be the
06:36 - middle of the night for some of you
06:38 - good day i said good day um good morning
06:41 - good afternoon good evening good
06:42 - middle of the night to all of you hi
06:45 - this is dan
06:46 - coming to you live from the from an
06:48 - attic in brooklyn new york
06:49 - um where it is a beautiful day outside
06:52 - although getting a little chilly
06:53 - um this is not the time i usually like
06:56 - to live stream
06:57 - this is actually the time i usually like
06:59 - to take a nap
07:01 - but i'm wearing my cozy sweater i'm here
07:04 - on the internet with all of you
07:06 - um so far nobody's said anything like
07:09 - this has stopped working
07:10 - so i'm assuming i'm actually live
07:12 - streaming now i i've been
07:14 - working steadily to improve the quality
07:16 - of my live streams
07:17 - as you might remember last week i
07:20 - received some new i received i didn't
07:22 - receive them because i ordered them and
07:23 - they came but i installed some new
07:25 - lights
07:25 - so my skin and my face and everything
07:27 - should be looking
07:29 - positively aglow for you now
07:32 - the cool crisp dulcet tones of my voice
07:36 - should be arriving into your ear
07:40 - devices in a new and perhaps higher
07:44 - quality way because and i'm just going
07:46 - to hold this up for you
07:47 - i uh this is not a sponsored anything
07:50 - although hey i'm available elgato elgato
07:53 - are you listening
07:54 - um this is the elgato wave 3 mic that i
07:57 - ordered
07:58 - um and somebody in the chat raw heath
08:01 - just said oh no it stopped working but
08:03 - i'm assuming only raith
08:06 - is having an issue with the live stream
08:07 - right now rahith come back come back
08:09 - rahith
08:10 - i want you to be experiencing the dulcet
08:12 - tones of my voice in my new
08:15 - microphone i don't know i probably
08:18 - should get one of those things where
08:20 - it's like on
08:20 - an arm and it swivels around and it's
08:23 - just like propped right here but
08:25 - i don't know i don't know if that's for
08:27 - me
08:28 - every week i would like to make a small
08:29 - upgrade which incidentally i have no
08:31 - nothing left to upgrade so if you got
08:33 - any ideas for me let me know what i
08:35 - should upgrade
08:36 - for next week
08:40 - actually there is something also new
08:43 - that i would like to
08:44 - experiment with let me see here
08:47 - if we can get this to work this is a new
08:50 - feature that i will be
08:52 - using on the coding train um and i'm
08:54 - just gonna
08:55 - quickly test it right now i probably
08:57 - should do more to introduce myself and
08:58 - what i'm gonna be doing today
08:59 - but um bear with me i'm moving to here
09:02 - oh and i've got my glitch page open but
09:04 - actually
09:05 - let me remove this no wrong what no
09:09 - ah wrong button all right i have to do
09:11 - this manually
09:13 - um well this is very silly what i'm
09:16 - doing now
09:18 - i can't find my screen to remove it oh
09:21 - it's so
09:22 - hard where oh there it is
09:26 - i'm in emptiness it is so sad here in
09:30 - the emptiness
09:32 - all right this is fine just put that
09:33 - back um and it doesn't matter
09:36 - uh spoiler alert i'm gonna use glitch um
09:38 - let's see here so
09:39 - um everyone who is a coding train member
09:43 - meaning you've signed up through the uh
09:45 - subscription
09:46 - um no that's not the right i'm trying to
09:48 - under i'm trying to not use the word
09:49 - paid but honestly that's what it is
09:51 - um in there's a discord available for
09:54 - everyone there's a public discord for
09:55 - anybody who wants to join
09:57 - um i just posted a link to it in the
10:00 - chat
10:01 - but i also have if you would like to
10:03 - join the coding trade membership program
10:08 - i feel like
10:12 - for your membership in the coding train
10:14 - you will receive
10:16 - not very much to be perfectly honest but
10:18 - um it's a nice smaller community of
10:20 - folks
10:20 - uh we've got a uh chat a channel in the
10:23 - discord dedicated to chatting during the
10:25 - live stream and
10:26 - what i am very excited to demonstrate
10:28 - for you right now and most likely it's
10:30 - not gonna work
10:32 - i was having some problems but um david
10:34 - snyder and kobe
10:36 - who are um i can upgrade the green
10:38 - screen area says bruno oh wait see oh no
10:40 - let's let's make this
10:41 - i don't have to i need this on you know
10:44 - what i need to do i need to put this on
10:46 - a tablet
10:47 - i don't know why i didn't think of this
10:48 - i need a tablet another
10:50 - where we need a mobile version of this
10:53 - touch
10:54 - enabled click add it crashed
10:58 - so i don't know what's going on uh but
11:01 - i'm we're
11:01 - attempting to debug this i'm using a
11:04 - piece of software known as disk stream
11:05 - chat which i suppose is
11:09 - discord plus streaming and plus chatting
11:13 - but i always think it's trying to diss
11:14 - me
11:17 - oh i am used myself let's run it again
11:20 - i have a feeling it's gonna for some
11:22 - reason right now it's it's uh
11:24 - got this really wonderful feature where
11:25 - it works the second time i click the
11:27 - button
11:28 - but as soon as i click bruno i hope this
11:30 - is okay with you i'm gonna assume this
11:31 - is okay with bruno
11:32 - bruno can you give me a big thumbs up
11:34 - that i'm going to bring your chat
11:35 - message onto the screen right here
11:37 - i will wait because i actually so what i
11:40 - should say is that anyone
11:42 - who now posts in and i could use a
11:44 - different channel for this but in the
11:46 - members discord
11:50 - live chat channel just then
11:54 - um your message i have a mechanism by
11:56 - which i can click a button
11:57 - and your message pops up on the screen
11:59 - here using the this stream chat software
12:01 - by david and kobe
12:02 - okay
12:06 - i'm waiting for bruno to say okay in the
12:08 - meantime
12:12 - um bruno bruno is typing everybody
12:15 - bruno is
12:22 - it's okay says bruno so now let me go
12:25 - back
12:26 - over to here i really hope this works
12:32 - there it is look bruno's message popped
12:34 - up
12:35 - maybe i should move this like where
12:37 - where should this be ideally where
12:39 - should this be positioned
12:41 - won't move how come the
12:44 - ah what is wrong
12:47 - with open broadcast studio i can't move
12:50 - it that's so weird but anyway
12:53 - you can see bruno's message there and i
12:55 - can even show you that bruno said
12:57 - and i think this might crash let's see
12:59 - and it crashed oh well
13:01 - so i'm not gonna use this anymore
13:03 - probably unless we
13:04 - um can figure it out and i don't know
13:06 - how to get bruno's message off now
13:08 - um but this is my idea that
13:12 - um that i will be able to interact a bit
13:16 - more
13:17 - by answering questions and showing
13:19 - messages by selecting them and curating
13:21 - them and moderating them
13:22 - to have them show up on my fancy live
13:26 - streaming
13:27 - rectangle over here ah now uh keenan
13:31 - says daniel i have a lot of homework
13:34 - but i am watching you and kenan i have
13:36 - one thing to say to you and i think
13:37 - everybody knows what i'm going to say
13:39 - you can all think about it for a minute
13:40 - say it to yourselves
13:46 - please go and do your homework i mean my
13:48 - goodness
13:49 - i understand the desire to procrastinate
13:52 - but i cannot imagine that anything i do
13:54 - here today
13:55 - is in any way shape or form anywhere
13:58 - close
13:59 - to nearly as meaningful impactful and
14:01 - important as your homework so i
14:02 - encourage you to do your homework you
14:04 - know maybe you've budgeted your time you
14:06 - know you will have enough time
14:07 - then i suppose it's okay you could stay
14:09 - we could be together here
14:11 - on the streaming with the coding and all
14:13 - of that
14:14 - but um please please your dad is saying
14:18 - please do your homework okay
14:22 - it should be above or below your head i
14:25 - assume that's referring to the
14:26 - microphone it is
14:28 - below my head right now my head is cut
14:31 - off oh
14:32 - i have to slouch i think i need to move
14:35 - the camera
14:36 - back hold on everybody i don't have a
14:39 - wide enough
14:40 - area so let's see here this is probably
14:43 - going to cause all sorts of problems
14:46 - moving the camera back oh boy
14:49 - let's see what this does
14:54 - and there we are
15:00 - that's a little bit uh better all right
15:02 - so we ironed out uh we
15:03 - all right so what's happening today on
15:05 - today's live stream so first of all i'm
15:07 - um this is hopefully i mean famous last
15:10 - words were ever spoken by me
15:12 - a hundred thousand times in basically
15:13 - every stream ever but
15:16 - i hope this will be a little bit shorter
15:18 - than usual
15:20 - um i would like to be done by 5 p.m
15:22 - eastern time which is an hour and 15
15:24 - minutes from now
15:25 - probably not gonna happen but um i i do
15:28 - have a limited amount of time
15:29 - there is some fun family activities that
15:31 - i am planning for this
15:33 - evening it is getting dark outside the
15:35 - evening is coming
15:37 - winter is coming and i do need to get to
15:39 - some other stuff but
15:41 - um i would like to do a number of things
15:43 - today one
15:44 - is thank our new member louise
15:48 - i'm not sure if louise is still watching
15:51 - welcome louise to the coding train you
15:53 - have joined just now you might have
15:55 - joined not even being in the chat
15:57 - because i get a message whether or not
15:58 - you're watching in the chat or not and
15:59 - when you join
16:00 - and for your joining of the coding train
16:02 - i will
16:04 - show you this train whistle i will ring
16:06 - this bell
16:08 - i will also go and find my book of
16:10 - random numbers because
16:12 - you will have for yourself
16:18 - a random number oh dear over there nope
16:22 - over here
16:25 - this green screen what's behind it's a
16:28 - whoa
16:29 - um well let's see
16:32 - maybe i will there's so many different
16:34 - ways i could fix this but
16:36 - i'm going to do it this way right now
16:39 - let's see how that does
16:47 - okay i'm not going to worry about it too
16:48 - much you can see me you can hear me
16:50 - let's find louise their random number
16:53 - and here it is
16:56 - two snaps in a circle and we are at
17:00 - 47 081 that is from row 6370 and column
17:09 - six so i hope somebody the uh coding
17:12 - train
17:12 - uh secretary who's recording this in the
17:15 - coding train book of numbers
17:18 - members and their random numbers will be
17:21 - saved for all of history and time
17:23 - forevermore
17:27 - now that we've gotten that out of the
17:28 - way
17:30 - let's set the tone for today
17:34 - and let's read from our book of random
17:36 - numbers ah
17:37 - i need to figure out where
17:41 - i last left off and the way that i do
17:43 - that is by not showing you my screen for
17:46 - a second
17:47 - and finding my way over to the coding
17:49 - train discord
18:00 - okay wait i just got i got just swept
18:02 - away in the music
18:04 - for a moment um looking for coding train
18:08 - live links live links
18:12 - command option i
18:16 - documented again once i tag name i
18:17 - hadn't have index zero style of
18:18 - visibility was hidden
18:21 - option command i and now we're back
18:26 - and
18:29 - the next random number where i last left
18:31 - off
18:33 - row 14
18:36 - column two i'm still on page one
18:42 - i mean it's kind of amazing like i wish
18:44 - i had thought of this
18:45 - eight years ago or whenever i started it
18:47 - ten years ago whenever i started
18:48 - recording videos
18:50 - when was my first live stream it's there
18:51 - on youtube it was from
18:53 - many years ago i think that was more
18:55 - like 2015 if i'm
18:57 - correct but some of the video tutorials
18:58 - are were recorded in like 2011 2012
19:02 - but i'm on row index 14
19:05 - column zero one two eighty seven
19:08 - thousand five hundred and 517
19:10 - 64 969
19:14 - 91 826
19:19 - 8928 there's an animal in the attic with
19:23 - me
19:24 - i don't know it's either a cat or it's a
19:26 - dog
19:27 - oh it's a cat we'll see if the cat comes
19:29 - over
19:31 - kitty would you like a random number
19:36 - kitty
19:38 - what there are people watching this
19:41 - i kind of forgot that for a second i
19:43 - don't even remember where i am someone
19:44 - remember the last random number i read
19:47 - shoot okay go back ugh
19:52 - well i was starting on
19:53 - [Music]
19:56 - robotic oh my god
20:00 - my that this is a wash we're gonna go
20:02 - back we'll do this again this is i'm
20:04 - just getting warmed up all right
20:06 - all right all right somebody will tell
20:07 - me what random number was the last one i
20:09 - read and i'll find it and then i'll
20:11 - post it and everything's gonna be okay
20:13 - all right what's happening today
20:15 - i'm gonna start doing some uh projects
20:18 - and actually i'm going to do the same
20:19 - thing
20:20 - i did last week because i want to start
20:23 - training a machine learning model and
20:25 - once i get that model
20:26 - cooking i'm going to be baking it in my
20:29 - machine learning gpu
20:31 - oven i'm going to take a break and
20:34 - look at some community contributions so
20:36 - things that you the viewers of the
20:38 - coding train have made
20:39 - and submitted on the coding train
20:40 - website then i will come back
20:43 - and work on making a glitch uh well it's
20:45 - not a glitch application it is a
20:47 - node a web application hosted on glitch
20:50 - um to be able to uh communicate with
20:53 - that machine learning model that
20:54 - when it's fully baked and crispy and
20:58 - delightful and very healthy we're gonna
21:00 - make a nice healthy
21:02 - low fat that's not a thing anymore low i
21:04 - don't know what the low that you need is
21:06 - it's gonna be a good a very nice very
21:09 - nice machine learning model
21:14 - okay
21:17 - so let's go to um my uh
21:21 - friendly uh my website from my friends
21:23 - over at
21:24 - runwayml dot oh there's something new
21:28 - oh i wasn't sure if this would show up
21:31 - i don't think i have anything special
21:33 - unlocked in my account i cannot be
21:35 - distracted
21:36 - hold on i'm just opening up my slack
21:38 - communicates
21:41 - i just see if i have a slack telegram no
21:43 - slack telegram so i was asking if this
21:45 - is something that
21:46 - uh is publicly available it says beta
21:48 - i'm sure i could show it it's on there
21:50 - it's on their social media but i'm not
21:52 - going to get distracted we're not doing
21:53 - the green screen right now
21:55 - i'm going to come back to that i am
21:57 - going to go to here train
22:00 - and i want to do something that i have
22:01 - not done before zoom on into it is train
22:04 - my own
22:05 - uh custom object detection model now you
22:08 - might recall
22:10 - on hereto with
22:13 - the coding train youtube channel coding
22:16 - train object
22:17 - detection that there is
22:20 - a video on said youtube channel called
22:22 - ml5.js
22:23 - object detection with coco ssd this is a
22:26 - pre-trained machine learning object
22:28 - detection model with 80
22:30 - um 80 pre-defined categories so very
22:33 - limited amount
22:34 - of objects it's looking for and can
22:36 - detect and give you a
22:38 - bounding box so you can watch that video
22:40 - go through the code
22:41 - shows you the example what i was not
22:43 - able to demonstrate in that example is
22:45 - how to train your own object detection
22:47 - model and basically
22:48 - you know for example i think what i'll
22:50 - do i mean i could do
22:51 - oh let's do the rubik's cube i was going
22:54 - to do the train whistle but i sort of
22:56 - feel like
22:56 - the rubik's cube might be by the way i
22:59 - was having trouble my bra is having
23:00 - trouble solving it okay
23:01 - here it is um the rubik's cube might be
23:03 - a kind of nicer
23:04 - interesting thing to detect especially
23:07 - because
23:08 - i can it's got so many different colors
23:10 - on different sides i wonder if i
23:11 - shuffled it this is an interesting
23:13 - test case of object detection so let's
23:15 - use the rubik's cube
23:17 - although really i do love this mug so
23:19 - and i kind of want to make an after
23:20 - detection model that detects my
23:22 - mug i mean there's nothing special if
23:24 - only this mug were made in rainbow
23:26 - colors it would be
23:28 - everything i'd ever hoped for and wished
23:30 - for in my entire life i am a simple but
23:32 - a simple man
23:33 - who lives i don't live in the attic but
23:35 - i spend a lot of time in this attic
23:38 - talking to a camera
23:41 - that's what i do what's happened to me
23:45 - but i do love this mug it brings me
23:46 - great joy and happiness you should find
23:48 - something in your life
23:49 - that you can love and that loves you
23:51 - back
23:52 - like this mug loves me
24:04 - i understand why those like you know
24:07 - late night talk showy like things they
24:08 - use a studio audience
24:11 - because it's very weird to just be on my
24:14 - own
24:14 - i can make my children sit over there
24:16 - and just watch me the entire time that
24:18 - would basically torture them
24:20 - what was i doing right so we're going to
24:22 - train object detection model we're going
24:23 - to
24:24 - um uh
24:27 - have it uh find the rubik's cube okay so
24:30 - but the sort of key difference is here
24:32 - um you know i should say so ml5.js to be
24:34 - clear
24:35 - is a javascript uh library from machine
24:38 - learning
24:38 - built on top of tensorflow.js um and
24:42 - runway is a web application a
24:45 - company that provides a service here
24:47 - essentially to
24:48 - operate different machine learning
24:50 - models in the cloud um it does cost
24:52 - money um you can sign up for it this is
24:54 - not a sponsored
24:56 - ad for runway i am the founders of
24:58 - runway are former students of mine at
25:00 - nyu and i'm an advisor to the company so
25:02 - in that sense it's kind of is an ad
25:04 - but um i'm really just showing it to you
25:07 - out of my own
25:07 - enthusiasm and excitement to try using
25:09 - it so
25:10 - i'm gonna go here to object detection
25:12 - and actually so before
25:15 - before i can train the model i need to
25:16 - collect my data set so this is the way
25:18 - that i'm going to do it this
25:19 - is the way
25:21 - [Laughter]
25:25 - i'm going to go to new movie recording
25:28 - and so there are a lot of different ways
25:29 - you can collect an image data set you
25:31 - can see by the way
25:32 - my little behind the scenes here um oh i
25:35 - did get some
25:36 - here's the other upgrade i'm gonna make
25:38 - i have these like led lights
25:40 - let me turn them on um
25:43 - so i'm gonna by the way but you know
25:45 - this is why i make edited videos now
25:47 - because people do enjoy the fact that i
25:48 - just get distracted and like can never
25:50 - get anywhere
25:51 - that's what the live stream is but
25:53 - plenty of edited videos where i'm
25:54 - focused or at least i'm not focused that
25:56 - part got edited out
25:58 - or coming soon so let me go here and
26:00 - turn on these lights
26:02 - so i just turned on those lights um
26:04 - those will blink by the way if anybody
26:06 - signs up for a membership
26:08 - um but the other upgrade i'll be making
26:09 - hopefully by next week
26:11 - is um and i don't know what that did to
26:13 - my
26:14 - uh key here but um the idea i had i
26:17 - thought this would help
26:18 - like make the key better but i think it
26:19 - might actually be causing me some issues
26:23 - i bought white gaffers tape so i can
26:26 - gaff tape the various cables and things
26:29 - for these leds with
26:31 - white gaffers tape so it doesn't look as
26:33 - ugly as that black kaffir state
26:35 - so i am now going to hit record
26:38 - and i'm going to just record a video of
26:41 - me
26:42 - um with this rubik's cube kind of
26:46 - showing it and using it and i really
26:48 - don't want this to be more than like
26:51 - actually uh 20 i guess i can i can
26:53 - sample the frame rate however i want
26:56 - um let's try to get some different sizes
27:04 - okay let's just go for 30 seconds
27:11 - okay beautiful i'm going to hit stop
27:15 - let us save this to the desktop by the
27:18 - way i was doing this
27:19 - already with some other tests um
27:24 - and i'm gonna just make i might as well
27:26 - use this directory structure
27:27 - i'm gonna call this rubik's
27:31 - let's save this as uh rubik's
27:35 - rubix
27:39 - that's all well and good i actually i
27:42 - don't know what i think i want to do
27:43 - just to have these be
27:44 - less um i don't
27:48 - know if it really matters but i think
27:50 - that i want
27:51 - um let's just at least export it as 720
27:55 - uh because i don't need super high
27:56 - resolution images for this i'm sort of
27:58 - afraid to go down to 480 although
28:00 - it would make total sense to do that i
28:01 - have a feeling runway once i upload
28:03 - my data set it's going to be resizing
28:04 - all these images just a much lower
28:06 - resolution anyway
28:07 - so that's fine what i'm attempting to do
28:10 - again is collect a data set that i am
28:12 - going to have to hand
28:13 - label so this is going to be one of the
28:15 - most exciting and
28:16 - riveting things i have ever done on the
28:18 - coding train
28:20 - you're going to actually sit and watch
28:22 - me hand label a data set for machine
28:24 - learning it's really exciting
28:26 - um but and i could have certainly um
28:30 - used you know sort of uh scraped the
28:32 - internet maybe doc
28:33 - looked uh did a google image search for
28:36 - rubik's cube and gathered a data set of
28:38 - images that way i could have taken a lot
28:40 - of photos with my
28:42 - old tiny telephone camera and
28:45 - uploaded those but i actually find a
28:47 - quite a useful way to collect a data set
28:50 - um is to record a video and then extract
28:53 - all the frames of that video
28:55 - so the way i will do that is
28:59 - with uh ffmpeg and so i'm in my
29:03 - uh console here on my computer i type in
29:05 - ffmpeg and i see all these
29:07 - possible commands so this won't happen
29:10 - automatically on your computer whether
29:11 - you're on windows or linux or mac
29:13 - you will need to make sure you go and
29:15 - find
29:16 - um i guess go to ffmpeg.org it's a
29:20 - complete cross-platform solution to
29:21 - record convert and stream audio and
29:23 - video it is
29:24 - a really excellently incredibly useful
29:27 - tool
29:28 - i use it frequently um and basically you
29:31 - can see here the sort
29:33 - the kind of foundational example of what
29:36 - you do with it
29:37 - you call you the command via your
29:40 - console ffmpeg
29:41 - dash i i believe stands for the input
29:43 - video input.mp4
29:45 - and then the file name of what you want
29:47 - to convert it to so this would be how to
29:48 - convert
29:49 - very quickly this mp4 video to an avi
29:52 - file
29:52 - but it there is so much more you can do
29:54 - with ffmpeg in terms of extracting audio
29:56 - and
29:57 - um automating so many kinds of video
30:00 - processes so the one that i want to do
30:03 - is and if i can well i need to go to the
30:06 - desktop um
30:08 - under images maybe i think this is where
30:11 - my that directory was
30:12 - um ffmpeg what was it called again rubix
30:17 - here we go and i'm going to say ffmpeg
30:20 - dash i rubik's 720 does anybody
30:24 - happen to know and i really wish i could
30:27 - pin marcos
30:28 - message to the screen right now but does
30:30 - anybody happen to know the command
30:33 - from ffmpeg to extract it to frames
30:37 - i want to say it's dash vf i don't know
30:40 - if that's really true
30:41 - um i know i know that i need to say
30:45 - fps equals like let's do let's try just
30:49 - for a second one frame per second so i
30:51 - just want to get
30:52 - one image every second from the video
30:55 - um and then i think i can just say like
30:58 - frames what do you do to like number
31:01 - them
31:03 - like if there's this would be now the
31:05 - file name would be
31:06 - i'm going to call it like rubik number
31:09 - number number number
31:11 - dot png if i wanted them to be png's do
31:14 - i want them to be pngs or jpegs i have
31:16 - no idea let's try this okay
31:18 - so ah that one seemed right but i got
31:20 - could not open
31:21 - file frame oh because you know i feel
31:24 - like ffmpeg should make that directory
31:26 - for me but i don't think it will so i
31:27 - made the frames directory
31:30 - uh let's try this again that was super
31:34 - fast did it actually work
31:36 - if i look in frames there we go
31:39 - so now i have frames of the video um
31:42 - and this is probably not enough
31:46 - um this is like how many total uh
31:49 - 35 i think i should do
31:53 - let's delete all these
31:56 - and let's say
32:00 - hmm
32:03 - i mean how many am i i think i could do
32:05 - i think i could annotate 150 images
32:08 - right now
32:08 - i think that's reasonable i've got i
32:10 - don't have my watch on
32:12 - i've got like another hour here at least
32:14 - so i think i could annotate 150 images
32:16 - we'll play some music
32:17 - some royalty-free music
32:24 - by the way in the market for
32:27 - commissioned
32:28 - musical themes for the coding train i'm
32:30 - already in touch with some people i have
32:32 - some ideas it's a very slow process
32:33 - because i
32:34 - started thinking about this probably
32:35 - over a year ago but if you are a
32:37 - composer
32:37 - and a musician uh join the discord
32:40 - please reach out
32:41 - you know you want to compose and record
32:43 - some music i'm looking for
32:45 - uh contributions in that area okay by
32:47 - the way if there could ever be the
32:48 - coding train musical
32:50 - i will just and what's the expression i
32:54 - suppose die and go to heaven i don't
32:56 - that's not really how i think it works
32:58 - scientifically speaking but
33:00 - um boy that would make me very happy
33:03 - okay
33:03 - um let's do five frames per second
33:07 - that was 178 frames i'm going to go back
33:10 - to runway here
33:12 - and i'm going to click object detection
33:14 - let's do a rubik's
33:17 - cube and by the way i probably i should
33:20 - have done
33:20 - both of these because i can train an
33:23 - object detection model
33:24 - with more than one object in particular
33:27 - in my data set so i'm doing this in the
33:29 - simplest way possible
33:31 - i'm gonna create this now um
33:34 - i'm going to upload
33:38 - oh which oh i'm logged in it's fine
33:42 - i'm meant to be logged into my other
33:43 - runway account it's all so confusing but
33:47 - this is fine this is fine i will i will
33:50 - do that later i'm gonna go to desktop
33:54 - images ffmpeg
33:57 - rubik's frames hit upload
34:03 - and we'll wait for these to upload
34:07 - [Music]
34:14 - [Music]
34:19 - can we do that thing in the edited
34:22 - videos where the time speeds up that
34:23 - would be nice right
34:25 - [Music]
34:27 - i guess i could log out well no i'm
34:29 - already uploading it ah
34:31 - i keep just messing this up
34:35 - you can see by the way oh how different
34:38 - how
34:39 - what a difference a year makes this was
34:41 - a data set that i uploaded a year ago
34:44 - in an attempt to work with uh
34:47 - thanksgiving
34:48 - turkeys okay frames here we go click
34:51 - uh next now um
34:54 - what is the next step i need to create
34:58 - an
34:58 - annotation group so i can't
35:01 - say that i entirely understand what an
35:03 - annotation group is in terms of the
35:04 - runway interface
35:05 - but i'm assuming it means a collection
35:07 - of labels
35:09 - um so um you know if i were doing
35:12 - uh rubik's cubes and train whistles my
35:15 - annotation group
35:16 - would contain both of those labels but i
35:17 - just have one and i don't have one that
35:19 - i've done before so i'll make a new one
35:22 - we'll call this annotation for coding
35:25 - train live stream rubrics give it a very
35:28 - long name
35:30 - and then i want to oh and then i want to
35:34 - put in the label will be rubik's
35:38 - that's the one label i have i'm going to
35:39 - click start annotating
35:42 - hopefully this will load i had a problem
35:44 - with this the other day um somebody can
35:46 - report this as a bug to runway
35:48 - where when i first load this page
35:50 - nothing comes up
35:52 - and i think that let's see if i just
35:54 - click on image two
35:57 - if i recall correctly what i did last
35:59 - time
36:00 - to fix this uh was oh no it worked so i
36:04 - don't know why that first one didn't
36:06 - show up but there it is
36:07 - so this is what i'm doing i'm looking at
36:09 - these images
36:11 - and i'm going to annotate where the
36:13 - rubik's cube is but there's no rubik's
36:14 - cube
36:15 - so i can click skip there's a skip
36:17 - button all the way down here
36:18 - that i realize you can't see skip but i
36:20 - can also just hit the space bar
36:21 - which will be much more efficient so i'm
36:24 - going through the images
36:25 - now here is the rubik's cube so now i'm
36:27 - going to annotate it
36:28 - i'm going to draw a little square over
36:30 - it and that is the rubik's cube and i'm
36:32 - going to click next
36:33 - so i believe there are other tools like
36:37 - this
36:38 - but i really appreciate how kind of
36:42 - quiet and meditative and relaxing this
36:44 - is
36:45 - and how easy it is to do um you know i
36:47 - can move this around and
36:49 - you know resize it i could be really i'm
36:52 - not going to be
36:53 - very particular about it this definitely
36:56 - appeals to my obsessive nature
36:58 - to try to like very precisely annotate
37:01 - it
37:02 - but i want to move quickly and i think
37:05 - that i want to see if we can just
37:07 - have some nice relaxing
37:10 - um music like
37:15 - to annotate by
37:23 - how many do i got to do
37:38 - [Music]
37:41 - talk amongst yourselves everybody
37:43 - [Music]
37:46 - for those of you wondering why didn't he
37:49 - just do this
37:50 - before he started live streaming and
37:53 - then he could show us when guess what
37:55 - look i actually already did this here's
37:57 - the finished version i'm just going to
37:58 - show you the beginning of the process
37:59 - nope that's not how this works people
38:04 - the whole project all the pieces
38:07 - i will demonstrate to you oh i'm really
38:10 - doing a terrible job
38:12 - by the way what would be really cool
38:16 - is to build a system by which we could
38:18 - crowdsource this
38:21 - so what if i could give you know runway
38:24 - could think about this
38:26 - what if i could give this url out
38:29 - and all of you who are watching this
38:32 - right now
38:34 - could participate in the annotation
38:38 - [Music]
38:44 - process
38:45 - [Music]
39:06 - what this song's over already what
39:08 - number am i on
39:10 - 40 hey i'm not i'm like uh
39:14 - pretty far along here
39:19 - i don't know what oh these are all the
39:20 - halloween things i had
39:23 - i forgot about the halloween music oh no
39:26 - this always gets me like a copyright
39:28 - violation the gold the goldberg
39:31 - variations let's try
39:33 - this
39:36 - oh yeah this is good oh my god why not
39:40 - alright everybody montage annotation
39:43 - montage
39:49 - [Music]
39:51 - hey
39:52 - [Music]
39:55 - welcome henry whitaker
39:59 - by joining the coding train right now
40:01 - you have interrupted me
40:03 - from my special hand labeling process of
40:06 - machine learning imagery but
40:08 - i thank you actually you've saved
40:10 - everybody because we were just stuck
40:12 - there was nothing else we could possibly
40:13 - do but now having joined the coding
40:16 - train henry
40:17 - i will now find for you your very own
40:19 - personal random number oh i got the
40:20 - timing of that
40:21 - way wrong it is
40:24 - on row 8915
40:27 - column zero one two three four five six
40:30 - seven
40:33 - six thousand four hundred and sixty nine
40:35 - thank you henry
40:36 - for your support mwah it means a lot it
40:39 - helps me
40:40 - upgrade my studio and keeps me going it
40:44 - motivates me
40:44 - it fills me all of that stuff
40:48 - wrong one okay
40:52 - back to annotating
40:56 - i think this is not annotating do you
40:59 - know what this
40:59 - is it's dance notating
41:07 - [Music]
41:14 - kind of makes it go a little bit slower
41:16 - but it's much more fun
41:22 - i really need a standing desk here in
41:24 - the attic that's the other upgrade i'm
41:25 - going to make
41:26 - this sitting while live streaming does
41:27 - not work for me
41:30 - all right let's move faster people
41:35 - [Music]
41:46 - [Music]
42:16 - [Music]
42:31 - [Music]
42:34 - oh that was a terrible one i really had
42:37 - to go back and do this again like with
42:38 - much
42:39 - greater precision
42:45 - [Music]
43:05 - [Music]
43:07 - where are we now halfway there people
43:10 - [Music]
43:11 - halfway there
43:13 - [Music]
43:20 - dance notation
43:28 - what's happening in the chat anything
43:36 - [Music]
43:38 - yeah so in the chat there's a little bit
43:40 - of a discussion going on
43:42 - that uh here's a bias of how uh here's a
43:45 - human bias
43:46 - here's an example of human bias see i
43:47 - really need to bring these messages up
43:49 - on the screen so i don't have to read
43:50 - them
43:50 - um but um i'm gonna read this
43:54 - uh dan's fingers are present in each
43:56 - annotation of the cube
43:59 - then the resulting model might not be
44:01 - able to identify a cube lying on a table
44:02 - because it wouldn't be surrounded by
44:04 - fingers
44:05 - exactly so if i wanted to have
44:08 - a very um sort of broadly
44:12 - functional uh model that could
44:16 - recognize and find a rubik's cube in any
44:18 - image
44:19 - this would be a pretty terrible data set
44:21 - because the rubik's cube is only ever
44:23 - present in one environment
44:25 - uh the environment with me in it with
44:27 - this green screen background with my
44:28 - hand holding the rubik's cube
44:30 - so i would want to collect a much more
44:34 - elaborate and varied
44:37 - data set but i would say that
44:40 - one of the things about what i'm doing
44:42 - here which isn't
44:44 - necessarily a problem is my use case
44:47 - might be
44:48 - i want to build something for myself
44:51 - that can find the rubik's cube
44:53 - in my hand when i'm holding it because
44:56 - um
44:56 - and also i have don't have a single
44:58 - example of it without the same color on
44:59 - one side
45:00 - so that's certainly a problem but um
45:03 - i could imagine uh in an interactive
45:07 - uh exhibit for example or some type of
45:10 - uh interactive context where you can
45:12 - really have control over the environment
45:15 - that having that fixed environment in
45:17 - your data set
45:18 - actually uh has a lot of advantages oh
45:21 - this
45:21 - is just not good i just gotta get at
45:25 - least slightly more
45:26 - i probably also don't need 150 so this
45:29 - is kind of
45:32 - maybe a little bit ridiculous what i'm
45:33 - doing but i can't stop now
45:38 - can't stop won't stop
45:46 - oh what is this weird i don't know if
45:47 - this is gonna be a problem but i'm just
45:49 - gonna
45:50 - also all the blurriness i didn't really
45:52 - think of that because i was moving it
45:53 - around a lot
45:54 - and um
45:57 - i mean should i mark it here like should
46:00 - it learn it
46:01 - be able to see it with my hand
46:03 - completely covering it i'm gonna
46:05 - i'm gonna annotate it that way this is
46:07 - this is gonna be an interesting
46:08 - experiment
46:09 - uh and my goal here in many ways is not
46:13 - to do this so that i have a very like
46:16 - a model that's working incredibly well i
46:19 - mostly want to demonstrate this process
46:21 - so that if any of you want to embark on
46:22 - it you might have
46:24 - more time or more sort of clever ways of
46:28 - collecting
46:29 - your data and being more precise about
46:31 - annotating it
46:36 - where are we how are we going 122. boy i
46:38 - feel like i've slowed down
46:41 - by the way having an actual night i'm
46:43 - using a track pad for this
46:44 - which is kind of sad oh did i finish
46:50 - wait what's going on no i don't see the
46:52 - images anymore
46:56 - weird hold on
46:59 - uh let me click here uh-oh
47:03 - uh rename export what do i do here
47:07 - edit annotation group boy okay
47:28 - this will be done soon don't worry it
47:31 - only takes about four hours to train
47:33 - them
47:34 - i'm just kidding i'm gonna let it train
47:36 - for as long as i can
47:39 - manage to wait
48:04 - so
48:06 - [Music]
48:06 - [Applause]
48:07 - [Music]
48:19 - what's it like to be a machine learning
48:21 - researcher you may ask
48:23 - let me tell you something boy is it
48:25 - exciting
48:26 - [Music]
48:28 - ah yes let me move this rectangle here
48:30 - and slide it a little bit over a little
48:32 - bit over here and all right
48:35 - [Applause]
48:40 - dance notation
48:51 - that's one way of doing it
49:02 - [Music]
49:24 - i know i'm getting to the end now
49:30 - [Applause]
49:34 - i love you rubik's cube you are my baby
49:38 - [Music]
49:40 - yeah oh there's more
49:44 - [Music]
49:53 - it's got to be the end now right
49:57 - what is going on what was i doing
50:01 - [Laughter]
50:11 - okay come on almost there almost there
50:15 - almost there people
50:20 - all right oh this is probably a bad idea
50:24 - let's give it that some training again
50:25 - okay
50:26 - no rubik's cube no rivets cube no
50:27 - rubik's cube no rubik's cube no rubik's
50:29 - cube
50:30 - no rubik's cube no rooms cube no rooms
50:32 - cube no rooms cube no
50:33 - rubik's cube no rubik's cube never looks
50:35 - cubed everyone's cute
50:36 - no rubbish we are done people
50:40 - close
50:43 - next um i am going to
50:47 - select a pre-trained model as the base
50:49 - model for
50:50 - this uh training um i right here we can
50:53 - see i could choose from other models i'm
50:55 - pretty sure the last time i checked this
50:56 - that actually
50:57 - oh no there's also yolo version three
51:00 - tiny
51:01 - interesting i wonder optimized for real
51:03 - time
51:05 - oh interesting i'm imagining using this
51:07 - in real time
51:10 - let's train it with both i'm going to
51:12 - just run this twice
51:13 - i mean i'm going to have this run twice
51:14 - i'm going to set let it go 5000 training
51:17 - steps i might stop it early
51:18 - i'm going to click start training and
51:21 - then i
51:22 - think if i
51:25 - go back to
51:28 - um
51:32 - oh no train and i do object detection
51:35 - again
51:36 - and let's do a rubik's cube
51:41 - um tiny real time
51:44 - question mark it's going to let me use a
51:46 - question mark in my name my experiment
51:48 - take this uh i already have these
51:51 - annotations
51:53 - next let's choose from yolo version
51:56 - three
51:56 - tiny and so now i have both of these
51:59 - going
52:00 - um and we can see them here as my
52:04 - two uh training experiments that are
52:06 - going so let's open this one
52:09 - in one window and oh it didn't it didn't
52:12 - open in a new window what did i
52:13 - click the wrong thing rook's cube
52:18 - i want you to open in a new oh weird
52:20 - it's like that's fine
52:22 - um then let's go to
52:26 - train uh rubik's cube tiny okay so we've
52:29 - got them both going
52:30 - so now i'm at the point and let me just
52:34 - click something here this is really
52:35 - bothering me
52:36 - there we go um
52:46 - wow louise it looks like you joined and
52:48 - you made it into the discord welcome
52:50 - that's so exciting
52:51 - um i i wish i could click your messages
52:53 - to bring them up on the screen
52:54 - look at this glow that's going on here i
52:56 - think it's the leds there
52:58 - so what's gonna happen now i now am
53:00 - letting this run
53:02 - um we can see both of these are running
53:05 - um
53:05 - just to be clear let me let me clarify a
53:08 - little bit about what's happening with
53:09 - runway
53:11 - so nothing besides my browser is
53:14 - actually running on this computer right
53:16 - here the one that i
53:17 - am operating here what i am looking at
53:21 - is a web
53:21 - interface to a set of servers that are
53:24 - runways
53:25 - presumably runways web servers and
53:27 - runways web servers are what are hosting
53:29 - up and showing me the interface and
53:30 - all the status updates and runway
53:33 - additionally has
53:34 - access to um what i'm assuming is a
53:38 - large number of
53:39 - gpu optimized for machine learning cloud
53:42 - servers
53:43 - so one of the the what you're for paying
53:46 - for when you sign up for runway and use
53:48 - runway
53:49 - is ease and efficiency really and
53:52 - in many ways so in theory i have a
53:55 - windows pc over
53:56 - here with a pretty good graphics card
53:58 - maybe i could figure out
54:00 - how to set it up with a
54:04 - training system and cuda and
54:08 - tiny yolo version 4 and all the stuff
54:10 - that i need
54:11 - to just train my model right over here
54:13 - on my own computer
54:14 - um but by having runway
54:17 - have access to a sort of pre-configured
54:20 - and ready-to-go
54:21 - cloud server with all of the
54:22 - dependencies and configuration settings
54:24 - it needs
54:25 - i'm just upload my files annotate them
54:27 - press a button for training and it's
54:29 - going to run it
54:30 - and then make the finished model
54:31 - available to me so
54:33 - um you could certainly do the same kind
54:35 - of thing also with
54:36 - google colab notebook you know an aws
54:39 - instance
54:41 - spell paper paper space
54:44 - these are other kinds of cloud-based
54:46 - services that have
54:47 - gpu-enabled machines that you can do
54:50 - machine learning and other things on
54:52 - a runway is kind of my favorite tool du
54:54 - jour to use
54:55 - and one of the things that is the most
54:57 - exciting about it for me
54:59 - is just this huge library of
55:02 - models that i have access to and these
55:04 - are new actually there's a there's a
55:06 - youtube channel called
55:08 - artificial images i don't know who
55:11 - runs this channel but i've been recently
55:13 - quite tuned into it
55:15 - and it's been using um runway for a lot
55:18 - of things
55:19 - making a data set a walk-through
55:21 - tutorial so this is all great i really
55:22 - got to check some of this stuff out
55:24 - um and i'm kind of do trying to do some
55:26 - of this kinds of stuff on my channel as
55:28 - well
55:30 - um all right so um what i think i would
55:33 - i'm going to do a couple things here hmm
55:36 - i really messed up
55:38 - so i apologize for this because i'm
55:40 - totally going to ruin everything right
55:42 - now
55:45 - um i'm going to check back on these
55:47 - models in a little while i
55:48 - i have two runway accounts because i
55:51 - want to be able to have an account with
55:52 - runway where i can upload data
55:54 - and do things in runway that are you
55:56 - know with my own private data so to
55:58 - speak
55:59 - i mean i can't i don't really have an
56:01 - example of data that i want to use for
56:03 - the runway that's private right now
56:04 - but i often do this with lots of things
56:07 - i have a separate account which is the
56:08 - one i stray logged into on streaming so
56:10 - i don't buy accident like open my email
56:12 - and that sort of thing um but i messed
56:15 - up and this
56:16 - this shiffman runway account is the one
56:17 - that i intended to be
56:19 - my private account but i'm already
56:20 - training these models i'm not going to
56:23 - uh but i'm going to log out
56:26 - and i'll come back to check on them in a
56:28 - little bit i'm going to go to my coding
56:30 - train one
56:34 - i can't get this right i've done this so
56:36 - many times i don't know
56:38 - oh i know what's going on i also have
56:42 - different
56:42 - logins to this browser and i'm it's fine
56:45 - it's fine everything's gonna be fine
56:47 - talk amongst yourselves
56:58 - [Music]
57:10 - do
57:14 - [Music]
57:20 - okay so now i'm in my choo choo account
57:24 - [Music]
57:25 - and we can see here that i've actually
57:28 - been working with this already um this
57:30 - past week
57:31 - i have some really weird models that i
57:33 - was training
57:34 - this is let's take a look at this one
57:35 - this is not what i meant to like show
57:37 - you
57:38 - um add to workspace
57:41 - what is going on here uh oh wait why do
57:43 - i have workspace work
57:45 - model workspaces what is going on
57:49 - i think runway changes interface my
57:52 - models train hosted
57:54 - this looks different all right i got to
57:57 - create a workspace
57:58 - add to workspace okay fine new workspace
58:01 - uh coding
58:04 - train demos
58:08 - and uh let's just run this model for a
58:11 - second
58:13 - so this model is a style gann model that
58:16 - i just trained off of images of my face
58:18 - looking in different directions wearing
58:20 - different glasses and things like that
58:22 - so um i wanted to um
58:26 - start with a style gan model i probably
58:28 - should just go to the sky gan one which
58:30 - is what i was actually using
58:31 - just to demonstrate the next phase
58:34 - of what i'm going to do which is
58:36 - demonstrate how to use
58:41 - runway beyond just the interface itself
58:46 - and essentially treat it as an api with
58:49 - your own code
58:50 - and any moment now it looks like it's
58:52 - about to spin up it's
58:54 - it's got this model running in the cloud
58:55 - my dan faces style
58:58 - model so just to be clear this is not an
59:00 - actual photo of me
59:03 - this is a stylegan
59:07 - generated version you can see it's uh
59:09 - got some
59:11 - kind of weird aspects to it and i mean i
59:14 - do look kind of like that
59:16 - i was wearing this shirt i was standing
59:17 - in front of a green screen when i
59:19 - collected this data set
59:20 - um and we can actually sort of start to
59:22 - like move around
59:23 - in the latent space of me oh my god
59:27 - so weird what have i done what monster
59:30 - have i created
59:31 - so creating an image synthesis model is
59:34 - one that you can do
59:35 - um and i need to i really need to get my
59:38 - act together and do a whole bunch of
59:39 - sequence video tutorials about this
59:41 - process right now i'm just kind of
59:42 - playing with it
59:43 - but let's move on over to glitch i'm
59:45 - gonna hit stop so
59:47 - uh i believe the current pricing and
59:49 - runway is about like five cents per
59:50 - minute when you're running the model in
59:52 - the cloud
59:53 - um so i'm gonna hit stop so that i don't
59:55 - use up too many of my credits
59:58 - and i am going to go over to this here
60:00 - called runway ml
60:01 - template and i'm going to hit um edit
60:04 - project i wonder if this one's actually
60:05 - running
60:06 - i think i disabled
60:11 - the model let's see
60:16 - actually doesn't look like i disabled it
60:17 - because i think if i disabled the model
60:18 - it would have
60:20 - um are already um
60:26 - it would have already given me an error
60:27 - message so one of the things you can do
60:29 - with runway is once you have a model
60:31 - like this coding train dan faces one
60:35 - um i can go click over here onto network
60:38 - and i can host this model so i've done
60:40 - this kind of stuff
60:41 - previously probably about a year ago and
60:43 - i used the runway desktop software that
60:45 - is still
60:46 - something you can use i really prefer
60:48 - the mic is off
60:50 - um i don't think the mic is off
60:54 - i am seeing everything working just fine
60:58 - so hopefully
61:01 - uh somebody else will tell me and
61:02 - confirm i think the microsoft i'd be
61:03 - getting a lot more messages
61:05 - um i'm gonna click host this model
61:09 - and i'm gonna host this model
61:12 - and now i have a list of all of my
61:14 - hosted models aha this is the one that
61:16 - i am actually using with this code sky
61:19 - gan
61:19 - the sky gan model and this model will
61:22 - you will see in a moment
61:24 - where am i going here uh generate
61:30 - uh images of the sky so this is a
61:33 - style gan model that's been trained
61:36 - on many many many uh images of the sky
61:40 - and one of the things you'll notice ah
61:42 - there we go look at this daily limit
61:44 - reached
61:45 - so you can all go
61:48 - to this url runway dash ml-template
61:53 - and you will not be able to generate
61:54 - your own sky because
61:56 - when you do generate a sky it costs me
61:59 - but i actually have some free credits so
62:01 - i'm not paying for any of this right now
62:03 - but it the actual cost the runway cost
62:06 - is one cent per request
62:09 - so i in this template that i've built
62:12 - i have built into it this json file
62:15 - which always saves the current number of
62:17 - requests
62:19 - and i have also placed into this.env
62:21 - file which i don't want to show you
62:23 - right now just hold on a second
62:31 - going to zoom in on it
62:35 - like this for a second um where one of
62:39 - the properties of the dot env file in
62:40 - addition to the
62:41 - tokens which i will show you in a moment
62:43 - so i can regenerate them
62:45 - is the daily limit so i'm going to
62:46 - change this daily limit to 100 right now
62:49 - that should restart the glitch web
62:51 - application i realize
62:52 - i'm jumping right into the middle of a
62:54 - project with lots of pieces and things
62:56 - leading up to it that you might not be
62:57 - familiar with
62:58 - that's okay bear with me um ask your
63:02 - questions
63:03 - join the discord to get help um
63:06 - and i could see that peter is here in
63:07 - the chat hi peter nice to see you
63:10 - um and let me come back
63:13 - to here and now i should be able to go
63:17 - back to my web application
63:21 - and we can already see the count is at
63:23 - 18. let's see if i generate one
63:26 - it's gonna it's gonna run out it's gonna
63:28 - run out of its daily limit uh we've just
63:30 - collectively spent a dollar
63:33 - on generating sky images together
63:36 - so the reason why i've built this in is
63:38 - for
63:39 - uh a number of different reasons but
63:42 - um one is just to like have a protection
63:45 - layer a sort of rate limiting it's
63:47 - not something that the runway interface
63:49 - currently has as a feature
63:50 - but i've built it into this template um
63:53 - so what i would like to show you how to
63:55 - do is how to create your
63:58 - own uh web application
64:01 - where your p5.js or any other javascript
64:04 - html css code
64:05 - communicates and works with runway and
64:08 - ultimately
64:09 - i'm going to do that with the object
64:12 - detection model that i'm currently
64:13 - cooking
64:14 - um here in my machine learning oven and
64:16 - my machine learning oven is somewhere in
64:17 - the cloud
64:18 - i mean it's an underground bunker if
64:20 - we're being honest here it's
64:22 - the server is likely not actually
64:23 - floating in the sky with
64:25 - rainbows and birds tweeting about that
64:27 - would be nice though
64:32 - so um so what's next um so
64:35 - let's look at this code for a second and
64:38 - um
64:40 - um and and by look at this code let me
64:43 - go back to here
64:44 - so in the runway interface i could also
64:47 - by the way just turn off the model
64:49 - that's another way for me to make sure
64:51 - you can see i've had 1 399
64:54 - requests on this model to date having
64:56 - used it
64:58 - so i could click this uh code snippet
65:02 - here
65:02 - and what you would see is that there is
65:05 - a javascript
65:06 - library a runway hosted models library
65:09 - that allows me oh there's my token
65:11 - i didn't i've sort of forgotten i'm not
65:13 - showing you the token why is my key so
65:15 - off
65:16 - is it really the um these leds hold on
65:19 - i don't know why my key has been
65:21 - actually really good recently
65:22 - maybe because the my lights are so much
65:23 - brighter
65:26 - i guess that made it a little bit better
65:27 - i turned the uh those leds off
65:30 - um
65:35 - max is that the max that i know who's in
65:37 - the chat
65:39 - i think it might be um hi max
65:43 - i'm all nervous max is watching
65:46 - um anyway back to my
65:50 - back to what i was looking at here so uh
65:53 - now you all have my token oh boy
65:54 - let's just let's quickly i just realized
65:56 - let's quickly disable that model
65:59 - the request didn't go up so you could
66:00 - written your own code very quickly with
66:01 - that token
66:02 - if you could have copied it out and put
66:03 - it into your code but looking at that
66:05 - code snippet again
66:08 - then the idea is i can create a runway
66:10 - hosted model object
66:12 - with a url to
66:16 - the model uh token is
66:21 - i heard a weird noise like it was the
66:22 - cat it's the cat
66:26 - all right i really wish the cat would
66:28 - come and say hello um i forgot what
66:30 - truncation is we can look it up in the
66:31 - runway
66:32 - interface i can query the model i can
66:34 - get an image back
66:35 - this is what i'm actually doing in my
66:36 - code however it's actually going to look
66:39 - a little bit different
66:40 - because if and i could just paste this
66:43 - right i've done this
66:44 - i could paste this right into the p5 web
66:46 - editor copy paste that put in the p5 web
66:48 - editor run it
66:49 - have my style get example working up and
66:51 - running immediately
66:52 - it's awesome but what would be the
66:55 - problem is
66:56 - my model url and my model token would be
67:00 - there
67:01 - right in the code and anyone on that web
67:03 - page could grab those and i want to keep
67:05 - those secure
67:06 - so what i have done here with this uh
67:09 - runway ml template
67:11 - and in theory you can use it by only
67:13 - ever using this server.js file
67:15 - i'm not sorry but you had to use the
67:18 - other stuff too but you could
67:19 - work with this without having to write
67:21 - your own server but i have a
67:23 - server a node server that's actually
67:25 - doing the runway communication
67:27 - and you'll notice in the code when i
67:30 - create
67:32 - the runway model by the way does anybody
67:36 - does anybody know this is i think it's i
67:38 - don't know what the equivalent family
67:40 - friendly thing of a drinking game is
67:42 - but yes i put a quarter in the jar every
67:43 - time i show my api tokens on a stream
67:47 - but you can see here i'm calling on
67:50 - process.env
67:51 - runway url runway token which means the
67:54 - code itself
67:56 - does not actually have the token in it
67:58 - instead
67:59 - i'm having like a crazy deja vu because
68:01 - literally recording a video tutorial on
68:03 - this yesterday that will go with my
68:04 - discord bot series
68:05 - but instead the the
68:08 - keys are stored in that dot env file you
68:10 - can see that little heart key thing
68:12 - this is something that only i or other
68:14 - you know uh
68:15 - um approved editors to this project can
68:18 - see
68:19 - so if you were to go remix this project
68:22 - like this code is open source
68:24 - you can go to the url to it i'll paste
68:26 - it in in the discord
68:27 - i believe if i go you know you guys can
68:29 - all confirm this to me and go back to
68:31 - our discord
68:32 - where did discord go um in the live
68:36 - channel links channel and just paste it
68:37 - here so you can grab that url go there
68:40 - you'll see
68:40 - all the code but when you go to the dot
68:42 - env file it will be empty
68:44 - because i'm not packaging that up with
68:47 - the example so that's a really
68:48 - convenient and this is not
68:49 - unique to glitch this is a common sort
68:52 - of standard for how to
68:54 - save um you know secret important
68:57 - information in environment variables
68:59 - across different web applications okay
69:02 - so what i what i want to show you here
69:05 - is let's look at the actual p5
69:07 - code does anybody know by the way how to
69:09 - increase the font size
69:11 - in the p5 and the glitch web editor i
69:14 - have not been able to figure out how to
69:15 - do this
69:15 - i know i could zoom the web page but it
69:17 - like grows everything which kind of
69:19 - makes me a little bit crazy
69:20 - but i'll just do that for right now look
69:22 - at all you nice people popping up
69:24 - anonymous anonymous who are you who are
69:26 - you watching i know max is watching and
69:29 - peter and klaus and stray and seon and
69:32 - shrey shrey is watching it twice are you
69:34 - two people
69:36 - but um all the rest of you are just
69:38 - these anonymous little smiley faces hi
69:40 - anonymous little smiley faces i love you
69:43 - all
69:44 - what time i said it was gonna be five
69:46 - well we'll see we'll see
69:48 - so here's here's what i'm trying the
69:50 - code is quite simple
69:52 - on the client side and i'm rather than
69:54 - programming this whole thing i'm just
69:55 - going to talk you through it
69:56 - and then i'm going to make some new
69:58 - version i'm going to remix it and make
69:59 - some new versions of it to do other
70:01 - things
70:02 - so one is i'm creating a canvas it's a
70:04 - 640x480
70:05 - i'm creating a button that button called
70:07 - generate right we can see all this
70:09 - here canvas the generate button this is
70:11 - all p5
70:12 - code for manipulating a canvas and dom
70:14 - elements it's not your sort of
70:16 - traditional
70:17 - uh javascript but it's the way i like to
70:19 - work with the p5 creative coding
70:21 - environment
70:22 - um i'm making this sort of span um dom
70:24 - element because i want to show the count
70:26 - that's
70:26 - rather unnecessary but um you know we
70:29 - got to tally all the votes uh i mean um
70:31 - count all of our requests to the uh to
70:33 - the runway server
70:34 - and then when i press the mouse
70:38 - this function send vector is called it's
70:40 - the callback
70:41 - to the mouse pressed event on the
70:43 - generate button so what's going on in
70:45 - that function
70:46 - well every model in runway and if i go
70:49 - back to browse models and i search for
70:52 - sky gan and i come up to it and
70:55 - let's just add it to create why do i
70:58 - need to create a new workspace
71:00 - isn't there shouldn't it like add to my
71:02 - existing workspace
71:03 - where here's my model workspace i'm so
71:06 - confused
71:08 - uh i'm just not going to worry about
71:10 - this something is going on
71:12 - somebody will teach me how to use runway
71:16 - by the way there's a slack for runway
71:17 - and somebody should i'm almost taking
71:19 - notes so i give all this feedback to
71:20 - them
71:21 - um so i don't know codingtrain2 i don't
71:23 - know why i have
71:24 - more than one workspace was i in my
71:26 - other account i don't think so
71:27 - yeah where's the other workspace so
71:29 - strange um
71:31 - but with every single
71:34 - model
71:38 - where does inference know where what am
71:40 - i looking at view i think i want to look
71:42 - at here
71:43 - i want to look at where it shows me the
71:45 - sort of specs
71:46 - the model the inputs and the outputs
71:50 - and i'm probably all saying this and
71:51 - this is this always happens to me where
71:53 - you're all
71:53 - saying how to do this in the chat and
71:54 - i'm just completely incapable of seeing
71:56 - it
71:56 - my models no model workspace yes all
71:59 - right well i know what it is
72:02 - and it's telling me right here uh vector
72:05 - so um the inputs to this particular
72:08 - model
72:09 - are vector oh i'm gonna have to make a
72:10 - whole video about this i've talked about
72:12 - this before
72:12 - i don't wanna get into the weeds of this
72:14 - right now but uh in an image
72:16 - in an image classification uh context
72:18 - the inputs to the machine learning model
72:20 - would be the image
72:20 - the outputs would be the labels here
72:23 - something this is a generative model
72:24 - so the inputs is actually really just
72:26 - like a bucket of numbers
72:27 - uh like a noise that's like a list of
72:31 - noise
72:31 - and that list of noises the signature
72:34 - that signature input which will generate
72:36 - a particular image so that's what i'm
72:38 - doing
72:39 - um in my uh code wherever that was
72:43 - where i am i know the expectation for uh
72:46 - stylegan is to receive 512 uh
72:50 - input values a vector of 512 numbers i
72:52 - think an appropriate range is between
72:54 - negative one and one but i'm not
72:55 - entirely sure and so i make the inputs
72:58 - with the z is often referred to as the z
73:00 - vector or the or the latent
73:02 - vector is another term for this and then
73:04 - i don't see the runway code anymore
73:06 - the reason is i'm actually going to send
73:10 - the vector to my own
73:11 - server the server is essentially
73:13 - middleware is that the right term
73:15 - it is really just its job is just to
73:17 - like pass the football
73:18 - pass the baton that's a better metaphor
73:20 - i think it's a relay race
73:22 - the runner is running up with its vector
73:24 - it's passing the baton to the server
73:26 - who's gonna run it all the way
73:27 - to runway the server is really secure
73:31 - i mean it's not that secure to be honest
73:32 - but it's it's much more secure i'm sure
73:34 - there's
73:35 - the security flaws in what i'm doing but
73:37 - it is secure in the sense that
73:39 - it's got the sort of secret keys to talk
73:41 - to runway
73:42 - so you can see i'm using the javascript
73:44 - fetch function
73:45 - my endpoint on my own api that i've
73:48 - basically written to that node server is
73:49 - called runway
73:50 - so and then uh the server's keeping
73:53 - track of the count
73:54 - and if it's reached its limit it'll just
73:55 - log the daily room it was the daily
73:57 - limit was reached otherwise it returns
74:01 - the outputs from the model and that's an
74:03 - image which i can generate and draw
74:05 - so this is looks this is identical the
74:07 - way i've set this template up
74:09 - is if you send the inputs
74:13 - to the node server's runway ml endpoint
74:16 - that node server if i look all the way
74:19 - down here
74:20 - will take the body of that request as
74:23 - inputs and then call await model.query
74:27 - so this is the actual runway call
74:29 - and if it comes back and works um it
74:31 - sets a status to
74:33 - success and returns the outputs
74:35 - otherwise i'm just keeping track of this
74:37 - count right this is my like
74:38 - highly advanced rate limiting
74:40 - methodology i have a variable which is
74:43 - literally a count and as it goes up if
74:46 - it goes above some threshold
74:48 - which is defined here in the environment
74:50 - variables you can see by the way here's
74:51 - the url and the token
74:53 - um in the in the environment variables
74:56 - uh if it reaches that
74:57 - uh account um it is what's it trying to
75:01 - say
75:01 - then it just sends back it doesn't
75:03 - actually query the model
75:05 - and i also i'm doing um i also put made
75:07 - an endpoint to just like check the count
75:09 - so for example i think that if i do
75:12 - slash count here you can see that um
75:16 - it's at 100 and if i went back to here
75:20 - and i went the count is also being
75:21 - stored in this json file i don't know
75:22 - why it says five there
75:24 - something funny happens with me with
75:25 - glitch i don't really get it when you're
75:27 - writing to text files or json files
75:29 - the browser doesn't always like refresh
75:31 - the latest contents but if i set that to
75:33 - zero
75:34 - and it'll it'll like save it and then go
75:35 - back to here oh
75:37 - and my app went to sleep i thought i had
75:39 - by the way i have a glitch pro account i
75:41 - thought i boosted this
75:42 - but you can see now the count is zero
75:45 - and then this won't actually work right
75:47 - now because
75:50 - i think i have to say i disabled the
75:52 - model but you get that's the
75:54 - entire story
75:58 - uh um
76:01 - so let's see and right so protecting it
76:04 - by an ip
76:05 - there's a variety of other ways you
76:06 - could protect it also
76:14 - let's see here um what questions do you
76:16 - have about this let's check our models
76:17 - that are cooking
76:20 - i'm going to go this is so
76:23 - ridiculous what i've done here by using
76:25 - two runway accounts
76:27 - let's log out and let's log
76:30 - into my other runway account this is not
76:33 - a necessary thing for you to do
76:34 - go under train and uh let's
76:38 - check these models
76:42 - let's see the this one is 46 percent
76:44 - done and this one is 28
76:46 - done let's take a look at the one that's
76:48 - 46 done
76:50 - so you can see here um what what's
76:53 - what i love about the runway interface
76:56 - is it's actually
76:57 - showing me its progress while it's
76:59 - training so it's
77:00 - running a bunch of training images
77:02 - through the model this is not showing me
77:04 - my annotations
77:06 - right this is showing me its guess based
77:08 - on
77:09 - the current state of the model based on
77:11 - the current step and if i go back
77:13 - we can look at step 1200 600 you know
77:16 - all the way back to
77:17 - one foot right this was early in the
77:19 - training process it was finding the
77:20 - rubik's cube
77:21 - everywhere and around step 750 it sort
77:24 - of found it in two places
77:26 - it's getting more and more accurate and
77:29 - you know i might venture to say
77:32 - that i can stop this from training
77:34 - because it's done but this is the sort
77:35 - of like metric
77:37 - this map metric which is mean average
77:40 - precision a measure of a performance of
77:41 - an object detection model
77:43 - it summarizes both the position how many
77:45 - of the predicted bounding boxes
77:46 - correspond to the true bounding boxes
77:49 - as well as its recall which measures how
77:50 - many of the true bounding boxes have
77:52 - been correctly predicted by the model so
77:54 - i would like to see this at a hundred
77:56 - percent
77:57 - um we can look through all the different
77:58 - example images this is probably good
78:00 - enough for me to try running it in my
78:02 - own application right now
78:04 - but let's let it train a little bit more
78:07 - and i'm pretty happy with how tiny yolo
78:09 - is working
78:10 - so since that is a faster smaller model
78:13 - it's probably the one i'll want to use
78:15 - i wonder if this is something i believe
78:17 - tiny yolo is compatible with javascript
78:20 - and i wonder if this is something that
78:22 - runway i mean i realized the business
78:23 - model here
78:25 - is to use their cloud servers
78:28 - but i wonder if there is a possibility
78:30 - of doing like an export to javascript so
78:32 - i could download a sort of like local i
78:34 - think you can download any mod it does
78:35 - let you download any model that you've
78:37 - trained
78:38 - so you can work with it locally but i
78:40 - would what i would like to download is a
78:41 - javascript compatible one
78:44 - okay
78:48 - that was confusing as hell
78:52 - right nitrous oxide
78:56 - apologies i don't know which part was
78:57 - confusing but um
78:59 - you know i'm kind of just bouncing
79:00 - around between a lot of different things
79:01 - so i recognize that this could be
79:03 - confusing
79:04 - all right so we've got some
79:07 - non-anonymous people welcome welcome to
79:09 - this glitch application
79:11 - so what do i one of the things that i've
79:13 - been wanting to make as an example for
79:15 - my course
79:17 - um and i'm going to go back this is very
79:19 - ridiculous what i'm doing here
79:22 - um i'm going to i can't believe this is
79:26 - what i'm doing but it's too late for me
79:28 - i'll log into this one and i'm going to
79:32 - look
79:32 - for models
79:36 - i want to look for a particular model
79:38 - called spade
79:42 - uh spade landscapes so this is
79:46 - an image uh segmentation
79:49 - model which will allow me to
79:53 - like it says generate realistic images
79:55 - of landscapes from sketches and doodles
79:59 - let's take a look at this one
80:02 - and why see it's me asking me to make a
80:04 - new workspace again i don't get it
80:06 - i don't get it uh coding train
80:13 - three electric boogaloo
80:16 - okay um now we're in this model i'm
80:19 - going to choose an input source which
80:20 - will be a segmentation
80:22 - and i'm going to run this model so
80:24 - runway again one of the reasons why i
80:26 - love using runway is
80:27 - i can just immediately play around and
80:29 - see how the model works
80:31 - before trying to build it into my own
80:33 - application so let's look at how this
80:35 - model works while it's booting up
80:37 - this is an image segmentation model what
80:40 - does that mean
80:40 - usually an image segmentation model is
80:43 - for doing the inverse of what i'm about
80:45 - to do
80:46 - we can see this in let's see if i go to
80:49 - ml5 and look at body picks for example
80:53 - this is an image segmentation model
80:56 - actually let's look at um
81:00 - u-net i'm just curious about this one um
81:03 - let's go here really quickly and see if
81:05 - i can grab one of the examples
81:07 - and i'm just curious to see if this
81:09 - works i haven't run this one in a while
81:15 - ah open broadcast studio virtual camera
81:18 - uh
81:19 - so frustrating here when i uh let me
81:20 - just let me just search uh body pics
81:30 - so this is what image segmentation
81:33 - typically does
81:35 - it takes the as the input the image and
81:37 - labels different pixels of the image as
81:40 - part of a given segment so in the body
81:42 - pics model
81:43 - it's able to recognize the human form
81:46 - and label different parts as
81:47 - torso green maybe thigh as purple right
81:50 - thigh
81:50 - left thigh head and sort of segment the
81:53 - image that way
81:54 - and you could use that for a variety of
81:56 - different creative applications that i'm
81:58 - sure are swimming around
81:59 - in your head right now
82:02 - what i love about the inverse of that
82:05 - for example if i come back to this
82:07 - particular image segmentation model
82:10 - is that it's doing the reverse it's this
82:13 - is a generative model
82:14 - it's generating an image and i am
82:16 - providing the segments
82:19 - via a color map so i'm going to create a
82:22 - scene oh this is like perfect for doing
82:23 - like like
82:24 - a bob ross like pseudo fake i should
82:26 - really set that up and just have like a
82:28 - little wig and a little like thing that
82:29 - i can paint colors on and have it
82:30 - generate the landscape for me this is
82:32 - great
82:32 - that'll that'll be next halloween or
82:34 - april fool's day but i can sort of paint
82:36 - over here
82:37 - because this is where the grass should
82:39 - be
82:42 - and you can see it's starting to
82:43 - generate this image below
82:47 - then i'm going to add a river
82:51 - that's going to flow like through here
82:55 - i don't know if this makes sense
82:58 - let's add a river
83:02 - i don't know that's very weird what i'm
83:03 - doing let's draw some trees
83:12 - some trees here and
83:15 - some clouds in the sky
83:21 - and there we go oh look at my beautiful
83:23 - landscape
83:24 - i am such an artiste um so what i have
83:27 - done with this model
83:29 - um is i have generated this image from
83:32 - this segment map so this is fun to play
83:36 - around with runway
83:37 - and um if this is all i want to do then
83:39 - great but
83:40 - what if i wanted to create my own p5.js
83:43 - sketch or processing sketch or
83:45 - other type of app software application
83:48 - where
83:48 - the uh the segment map is the
83:51 - segmentation map is generated a
83:52 - different way i actually what i want to
83:54 - do right now is just
83:55 - recreate exactly this so i want to go
83:57 - look at that glitch
83:58 - template and recreate exactly this
84:01 - interaction but with the
84:05 - with my own code so first i'm going to
84:07 - hit stop
84:09 - then i'm going to go to well actually
84:10 - one thing i really want to do
84:12 - is click this export colors because i
84:14 - really need to get the colors
84:16 - right so let's click um export colors
84:19 - um and it came in as an uh csv so i'll
84:23 - take a look at that um in a moment let's
84:25 - just put that over there
84:26 - whoops how come you didn't show up over
84:28 - here
84:30 - where are you colors um and
84:35 - i'll find that later let's go to um
84:39 - whoops let's host this model
84:43 - and host the model i'm going to have to
84:46 - not show you my
84:46 - api keys to turn this one off just i
84:49 - don't need that one on
84:50 - i'm going to go here so now i want how
84:53 - do you do this in runway if this is my
84:55 - project i think i can still do remix
84:58 - so i'm going to re i'm going to show you
84:59 - the process of starting with my template
85:01 - and remixing it so i'm going to hit
85:03 - remix
85:05 - and then this will be
85:09 - and ideally my goal here is to create
85:12 - like many many many examples in glitch
85:16 - of working with different models in
85:17 - runway
85:18 - um so i'm going to call this a spade
85:22 - coding train oh that's a
85:26 - coco ding train
85:29 - yeah it's got to have the choo choo on
85:31 - there this is everything
85:33 - here we go right no put a little dash
85:36 - there there we go
85:37 - this is like the best name of any glitch
85:40 - project
85:40 - ever spade coco ding
85:44 - train
85:46 - [Music]
85:48 - uh now i'm going to hit and look at this
85:51 - so i should be going to the
85:53 - env files and nothing is there so just
85:56 - to be
85:56 - safe and secure i'm going to make my
85:58 - daily limit 5 to make sure that as i
86:01 - start putting this in there if my
86:02 - token goes out into the wild or the url
86:04 - this project goes out into the wild
86:07 - i'll i'll have some protections it's
86:10 - fine let's just make it 100.
86:12 - um and then the server
86:15 - i'm suggesting doesn't need to change
86:18 - the server is totally generic
86:20 - as long as i send my request to the
86:23 - runway ml
86:24 - endpoint on the server the inputs come
86:27 - in go to the model the outputs go
86:29 - out so i just want to work on my p5 code
86:34 - so here i am in sketch.js um this is
86:38 - and i need to do this differently so
86:39 - very quickly um let's not worry about
86:41 - runway for a second
86:44 - this image should be send
86:48 - uh it should it should be called send
86:51 - image
86:52 - because i am not sending a vector the
86:55 - input to spade cocoa is an image
87:00 - oh yeah okay so um i'm going to take i'm
87:02 - not going to worry about this just
87:04 - yet so let's actually comment all this
87:06 - out
87:07 - just for the time being
87:11 - um and let's uh
87:14 - let's look at this in a new window
87:17 - failed to start there's an error in my
87:19 - project right the error in the project
87:20 - which i can see here by going probably
87:22 - under tools under logs
87:24 - is that there is no um valid token
87:28 - so hold on hold off on that i will
87:32 - i'll put the token in in a little bit
87:35 - and what i want to do here
87:36 - is instead let's say background 255
87:41 - function draw
87:45 - i'm gonna say uh ellipse
87:49 - i'm gonna make this in the simplest way
87:51 - if mouse is pressed
87:55 - ellipse mouse x
87:58 - mouse y uh 32. so obviously i would
88:02 - probably
88:03 - in the sort of fantasy way of doing this
88:07 - i would want to create a whole drawing
88:09 - interface where i can select colors and
88:11 - change the size i'm not going to do any
88:12 - of that right now
88:14 - i just want to see uh it draw and let me
88:16 - get one of the colors
88:18 - so if i go to the desktop
88:21 - and i think this is the colors can i
88:23 - open this with i don't know what
88:25 - um visual studio code can i actually
88:28 - just
88:28 - bring this in to like assets well no i
88:31 - don't want to open numbers are you
88:33 - insane uh great so here we go
88:36 - so let's start with sky which is this
88:39 - color um and i i could lo
88:42 - i would want to load from this file and
88:44 - make this much fancier but again i'm
88:45 - doing the quickest
88:47 - hello world version of this i can think
88:49 - no stroke
88:50 - a fill and just use that hex color
88:54 - and by the way i i think there's a way
88:56 - to disable these
88:57 - but because of the weirdness of p5 and
88:59 - how it uses the global
89:01 - namespace for its functions glitch
89:03 - always thinks these are errors
89:05 - nobody knows how to just like tell
89:06 - glitch to stop um
89:08 - that would be good i copied the html
89:11 - code into the style.css file
89:13 - i certainly did when did i do that it's
89:16 - so
89:17 - weird is that like
89:20 - in all of the in my template i did that
89:22 - let's just take that out i don't know
89:23 - why
89:24 - what what happened there that was very
89:26 - weird
89:28 - um
89:31 - so the glitch app is attempting to wake
89:35 - up but i'm gonna need those api keys
89:37 - so let's let's go so what i'm actually i
89:39 - think i'm going to go back to
89:41 - hosted models runway and i'm going to
89:44 - grab
89:45 - if i click on this it's going to copy
89:46 - the api key to the clipboard
89:48 - oops sorry i'm missing i'm going to go
89:50 - back to this view
89:51 - and i'm going to right now i'm going to
89:53 - attempt
89:54 - to put the api key into
89:58 - the uh runway i'm into the env file
90:01 - without you seeing it
90:03 - let's get the model url
90:06 - just so i stopped getting those errors
90:09 - so i've got the model url and the token
90:11 - and i'm going back to my code
90:14 - and that is now done and i can show it
90:17 - to you again all right so i have put
90:19 - the api keys into the dot env file
90:23 - um and
90:27 - uh now i should see this send vector is
90:30 - not defined
90:32 - where did i put send vector in
90:38 - send image send oh whoops right so let's
90:41 - also comment this out
90:44 - great so now so now i can draw
90:48 - just by i i can only draw one color
90:52 - and i can only um go and draw one color
90:56 - and i can only um draw one color
91:00 - and one thickness sorry what was the
91:01 - other part ah i'm getting tired it's
91:03 - five o'clock
91:06 - we're going to do this then the object
91:08 - detection model oh i was going to do
91:09 - commute i gotta do some community
91:10 - contributions
91:14 - yeah um so okay next
91:19 - let me rethink this a little bit i'm
91:21 - gonna make the background
91:24 - that color so the background will
91:27 - already be sky
91:30 - and then i think i'll just try to draw
91:32 - clouds
91:33 - so if i go look at the assets where did
91:36 - i upload that oh no it's here
91:38 - um clouds oh clouds is just this
91:41 - so let's just try it with sky and i'm
91:44 - drawing although let's try
91:45 - c i'm just curious here let's try
91:49 - c um
91:53 - so if i say fill
91:58 - here and now it's going to default with
92:01 - and i can draw
92:03 - excuse me the c down here
92:07 - coming back let's make this a little bit
92:10 - bigger just so i can do it more quickly
92:12 - great now
92:15 - what do i need to do i need to send
92:20 - the and i what i want to show you is
92:22 - going to leak my keys again but that's
92:24 - fine
92:25 - i'll regenerate them i need to adjust
92:28 - this code
92:29 - so the first thing that i need to do is
92:31 - get the image
92:32 - in a format that i can use to send
92:35 - to runway and the way that i will do
92:40 - that is by turning it into a base64
92:43 - encoding of that image
92:45 - so how does that work i am going to say
92:49 - image64 equals canvas
92:52 - you need to make a variable to store the
92:55 - canvas
92:58 - when and what happened all the red dots
93:00 - went away i talked about it they
93:02 - disappeared
93:03 - did somebody do something to make that
93:05 - happen what is going on oh my goodness
93:10 - ah okay so simon is clarifying thank you
93:13 - simon for this my use of language here
93:16 - i'm talking about image segmentation
93:18 - models and then i was saying what we're
93:19 - doing really is the inverse of it
93:21 - and there actually there is a specific
93:22 - name for that it's called a reverse
93:24 - image segmentation model thank you for
93:26 - that
93:26 - um clarification um so
93:31 - uh imagecanvas.elt so let's talk about
93:34 - what's going on here
93:35 - canvas is a variable that's holding on
93:39 - to
93:39 - a p5 canvas object the p5 canvas object
93:43 - is a
93:44 - wrapper of the native javascript browser
93:47 - canvas
93:47 - dom element that happens to exist in the
93:50 - dot elt
93:51 - property and then i should be able to
93:54 - say
93:55 - to data url is that the right
93:59 - name of the function let's look this up
94:01 - to data url
94:03 - javascript yeah
94:06 - so the to data url function returns a
94:09 - data uri containing a representative of
94:12 - the image into the format specified by
94:14 - the type parameter
94:15 - defaults to png so there's a lot of ways
94:17 - i could configure this
94:18 - but this particular function is what i
94:20 - want to turn
94:21 - the image essentially into a string now
94:24 - it seems like a crazy thing when i turn
94:26 - the image into a string
94:27 - i think i've talked about this in some
94:28 - of my video tutorials but this makes it
94:30 - very convenient to pass it over
94:32 - a uh a post request to send it to a web
94:35 - server
94:36 - um okay so now where was i
94:40 - here so did i get the name of the
94:42 - function right ah i didn't actually it's
94:44 - to data url with capital url so that
94:48 - would go here
94:49 - and let's just this is a little bit
94:50 - ridiculous for me to do this
94:52 - but let's just console.log it so we can
94:54 - see if this works
95:00 - i'll paint a little bit hit generate and
95:02 - there it is
95:03 - this is the entire image encoded as a
95:05 - base64 string of characters
95:08 - um so now if i go back to here i don't
95:12 - want to console.log that
95:14 - i want to create my post request
95:22 - and the inputs are now this is what i
95:24 - need to look up in runway
95:26 - i don't recall what the inputs are i
95:28 - know it's the image
95:30 - it's probably something like
95:36 - this is probably what i send it but i'm
95:39 - not entirely sure
95:40 - i need to look it up in runway but it's
95:42 - going to show my api token
95:44 - so i don't mind i'm going to show you
95:47 - how to do it with showing your api token
95:49 - and then quickly regenerate your api
95:51 - token
95:52 - so first i'm going to do is i'm going to
95:54 - disable the model so it's not active
95:56 - then i'm going to click on view the code
95:57 - snippet and that's where it's showing my
96:00 - api key
96:01 - and i can see the input says ah it's
96:03 - called semantic map
96:05 - so what i'm sending is something called
96:07 - a semantic map
96:08 - and then the property the value that's
96:10 - the property name the value is a base64
96:12 - image so um let us
96:16 - how do i do the regenerate the
96:19 - token edit right down here
96:23 - so this is me regenerating the api key
96:25 - which i'm going to do
96:27 - and i'm not going to let you see the
96:28 - regenerated one
96:31 - i'm going to copy it
96:34 - i'm going to put it into my env file
96:40 - the new token is there go back to
96:43 - sketch.js
96:45 - where am i where am i where am i
96:48 - let's turn i can come back to show you
96:51 - let's turn the model back on
96:52 - activate it um and
96:56 - uh this is supposed to be now we
96:58 - remember a semantic map
97:00 - so that's semantic map and send it to
97:03 - runway
97:03 - uh wait for the res outputs and i don't
97:06 - let's just look at
97:07 - console log outputs okay so i'm going to
97:10 - look at the output that comes back
97:15 - let's refresh this page hit generate
97:18 - sending the image
97:19 - now it'll probably take quite some time
97:21 - for oh it came back
97:22 - look there we go i have an output which
97:25 - is guess what a base64 encoded image
97:27 - status success and the count is going up
97:30 - so i can go back to the code
97:32 - and i can now um
97:35 - put this stuff back in um the outputs
97:39 - it wasn't well what was it called
97:43 - was it it wasn't called image was it so
97:46 - weird um
97:49 - why do i have an error now oh i have two
97:52 - things called
97:53 - image 64. uh
97:57 - input image 64.
98:01 - 764. let's call it that
98:07 - that's why i'll just leave this one this
98:11 - you know i'll just rename this variable
98:13 - to landscape
98:15 - because why not
98:19 - um and then i forgot what it's
98:24 - daily limit reached come on people
98:28 - have a little pity on me here
98:38 - [Music]
98:42 - come on you don't don't you want to
98:46 - bring generated landscape imagery out
98:50 - into the world
98:51 - in a way that we can all enjoy
98:56 - um i am going to against my better
98:58 - judgment
99:00 - go to here set this back to zero
99:05 - and try to beat everybody
99:11 - great so oh it's so this is this is
99:13 - something this is another bit of
99:14 - feedback for the
99:15 - for those of you who are taking notes
99:19 - it's weird that the property is called
99:21 - output here and in
99:22 - skygen it was called image like i feel
99:24 - like that would make sense for that to
99:25 - be pretty consistent
99:27 - across runway models so i wouldn't have
99:28 - to keep changing it for every example
99:30 - um so but here under sketch.js
99:34 - i'm going to call this now outputs dot
99:37 - output and the
99:40 - this is a spade
99:44 - coco generated a landscape
99:50 - and let's try this one more time
99:56 - i need to refresh the page oh there we
99:59 - got it
100:00 - look at this that's my generated sky
100:04 - let's draw some ocean on it and try to
100:07 - be faster than all of you
100:08 - people
100:12 - and there's the ocean oh this is so cool
100:18 - and i'm at eight thank you people please
100:20 - please
100:22 - all right um i guess what i'll do just
100:24 - to
100:25 - shut it off for a minute here um
100:29 - so this is why i should run this stuff
100:31 - locally so only i could run it and then
100:33 - deploy it to glitch but
100:34 - so i want to do something now i want to
100:36 - change the code
100:38 - i want um i want to
100:42 - make a
100:46 - variable called output image
100:49 - and that is going to be output image dot
100:52 - create
100:53 - image blank
100:57 - so i want to create an image
101:00 - dom element that's sitting below the
101:02 - canvas
101:03 - and then rather than make a new one here
101:10 - i just want to take the existing one
101:14 - let me put the alt text in
101:18 - hopefully this works i have not tried to
101:21 - do this before
101:24 - um let's put this in here
101:28 - and i think i can say
101:33 - like output image dot elt dot
101:36 - source equals image 64. right this would
101:39 - be setting the source
101:41 - of the image to that base64 encoding
101:44 - which would make it appear in the drum
101:45 - element
101:46 - i think is that right does anybody know
101:58 - uh
102:00 - um cannot read property create image of
102:02 - undefined
102:07 - oh equals create image okay
102:13 - all right so now all right i've disabled
102:16 - it
102:20 - if you could please hold off on running
102:22 - this for a moment
102:26 - i guess i could make it a private
102:27 - project but i think
102:29 - um
102:33 - let's see if this works
102:38 - great and then if i do this
102:42 - it generate uh daily limit reach come on
102:44 - people
102:47 - we're gonna use this isn't even a
102:50 - sponsored live stream
102:51 - i'm using up all my credits i don't even
102:53 - know
102:54 - um all right back over here i'm gonna be
102:58 - doing my object
102:59 - my model detection my sorry my um
103:04 - my object detection example i'm gonna be
103:06 - doing that locally
103:08 - you won't be able to see it uh
103:11 - [Music]
103:22 - i just want to see if i can get
103:31 - i want to see if it'll replace it with
103:32 - the new one
103:36 - all right so that works now if i do this
103:39 - and hit generate again
103:42 - great awesome it's working shutting you
103:45 - down people
103:46 - all right so this works now that
103:50 - it's going to always update this one
103:53 - and maybe i don't need 640 by 480 just
103:56 - to be able to see it
103:57 - um what i'm going to do now is have it
103:59 - update uh as i'm drawing
104:01 - so this is going to use a lot of
104:03 - requests and this is where i would want
104:04 - probably more like a socket connection
104:06 - or something to the model but let's just
104:09 - sort of see
104:10 - um let's see what happens here so if i
104:14 - go back to sketch.js
104:17 - and then essentially this
104:20 - send image function
104:24 - i am going to call it
104:27 - recursively i am going to call it
104:31 - immediately when the program starts
104:34 - and then every time after i've updated
104:36 - the image
104:37 - i'm going to call send image again and
104:42 - let's see let me set the count back down
104:44 - to zero
104:46 - let me turn the model back on to
104:49 - activate it
104:50 - and now it should be
104:57 - updating
105:01 - um as i draw
105:06 - so i didn't pick like really smart
105:10 - colors here but you can see here as i'm
105:12 - drawing
105:13 - it's updating below and i should
105:16 - obviously
105:18 - turn this off um
105:21 - i should certainly um
105:28 - what am i saying i should certainly like
105:29 - so there's lots more next steps to this
105:32 - but i just wanted to save this as a
105:34 - basic
105:35 - um example and i'm realizing here also
105:38 - this should say
105:39 - spade spade
105:42 - coco p5.js example
105:47 - i think actually i should publish the
105:49 - example with the generate button
105:51 - so i just want to i just want to clean i
105:53 - wanted to show you how it worked to do
105:54 - it continuously
105:56 - but i'm going to take that out i'm going
105:59 - to take this out
106:01 - i'm going to
106:04 - take this out and
106:08 - um i just want to leave this
106:11 - let's what would happen if i made this
106:14 - 320 by 240 would it still work
106:17 - just as well so i think it would just
106:19 - sort of be easier to see
106:24 - um
106:27 - uh yeah actually so this should i it
106:30 - should do this first
106:31 - because i do want to see that always
106:33 - filled up let's turn this back on
106:36 - um let's go to the server
106:39 - and i'm gonna set the count to one
106:41 - whatever it may be
106:43 - and now let's just see if this is
106:45 - working again
106:49 - it's weird why why is that why isn't it
106:52 - why won't it put the image next to it
106:53 - well whatever
106:55 - so now if i draw here and click generate
106:59 - there we go
107:04 - great and i can turn it off all right
107:08 - this example is finished
107:10 - thank you for watching
107:13 - what was the thing that i wanted to fix
107:15 - here oh i don't think i need the console
107:17 - log
107:19 - um here right now okay
107:22 - all right so this you can use um as an
107:25 - example
107:26 - to um work with a runway all right
107:31 - [Music]
107:34 - um
107:37 - let's take a look at our i really gotta
107:39 - do let's do some community contributions
107:42 - it's 5 20. i got to finish up here going
107:44 - to be done soon
107:46 - [Music]
107:48 - um
107:50 - uh okay
107:55 - hey everybody it's time it's quite late
107:58 - in this stream usually i try to do this
108:00 - at the beginning it's a nice way to
108:01 - start off and
108:02 - say hello to the community and people
108:04 - watching the coding train but
108:06 - i it's very important to me that every
108:08 - live stream
108:10 - i show some of you work because you the
108:11 - people of the coding train are what
108:13 - power the train itself you are the
108:15 - engine that produces the steam
108:17 - that drives the train
108:20 - uh so let's go on over to our discord
108:24 - and i am going to type in the wheel
108:28 - command
108:28 - [Music]
108:30 - and what happened
108:34 - what happened to the wheel what happened
108:37 - to the wheel
108:41 - i think the stream chat bot is down
108:46 - oh it's because we can find it it's
108:48 - right up here
108:51 - [Music]
108:52 - so here's the wheel of community
108:54 - contributions
108:56 - um thank you to david and oh
109:01 - um king over here on the
109:04 - uh i forgot the user's name who did some
109:08 - of these new features
109:09 - um let's spin the wheel so this pulls
109:12 - from some of the contributions that are
109:13 - on the website
109:14 - um and ultimate didn't we look at
109:18 - ultimate tic-tac-toe i kind of remember
109:19 - looking at this one already am i wrong
109:21 - about that
109:23 - uh i looked we looked at this one yeah
109:25 - well
109:26 - did we i really haven't remember i
109:29 - looked at somebody's ultimate sec tick
109:30 - toe
109:31 - but this now looks unfamiliar to me
109:34 - let's move this over by the way so i'm
109:36 - not in front of it so much
109:38 - also i like to see my friendly masked
109:41 - sun there
109:43 - um where where were we here okay so take
109:46 - turns playing on the highlighted board
109:47 - however you move determines where your
109:49 - opponent will place their next move
109:50 - the first player concord board claims
109:52 - that board right ultimate tic-tac-toe
109:54 - is playing mini games of tic-tac-toe
109:56 - inside a larger
109:57 - tic-tac-toe board
110:00 - oh i see i don't really know what's
110:03 - going on here
110:04 - but this is really cool wait why does it
110:06 - switch so i'm playing both
110:08 - players oh you don't put you do one
110:11 - board at a time it just does a random
110:12 - one next
110:13 - so you each get a turn in one cell
110:16 - and then you get a turn in oh oh it it
110:19 - goes around randomly
110:22 - so like you really have an advantage if
110:26 - you get lucky
110:30 - right like this is just luck now
110:36 - oh
110:38 - who's going to win i'm playing against
110:39 - myself i'm rooting for o
110:41 - i think o is just friend more friendly
110:45 - looking than um
110:46 - x come on oh you can do it
110:50 - place your bets people place your bets
110:53 - wait
110:55 - oh x gets to go again shouldn't this
110:58 - square be done
110:59 - oh it's got to go here
111:03 - oh it's going to go here
111:06 - all right oh looking good oh uh oh
111:11 - yeah this one's already done
111:15 - where am i now oh x
111:20 - next gonna block o
111:24 - where are we now here here
111:27 - x i must finish this
111:30 - must finish
111:36 - um it's not random i'm being told
111:41 - uh interesting but o
111:45 - has a good spot oh where where am i now
111:47 - here
111:48 - x is going to go there oh
111:52 - can i get three in a row like that
111:53 - probably not right
111:56 - uh oh where
111:59 - where am i now here x
112:03 - oh yeah come on oh you can do it
112:14 - so don't tell me the logic of which one
112:21 - the game ends when three oh
112:24 - a move yeah someone tell me the logic of
112:28 - which one it picks i'm curious
112:30 - um
112:39 - where are we where are we
112:45 - oh x is doing really well whoever wins
112:48 - this down here
112:58 - oh didn't oh just win
113:01 - didn't oh just win oh no x had already
113:03 - won that one
113:04 - it's very i'm very confused uh
113:09 - okay wait wait wait
113:14 - and now
113:21 - i'm i'm lost people uh
113:24 - oh
113:32 - is it over
113:39 - i'm so confused what happened
113:42 - oh there's no o can go maybe wherever it
113:46 - wants
113:46 - yeah okay now it's over right
113:52 - yeah oh one
113:56 - [Music]
114:01 - thank you this is pretty cool i think
114:03 - like i'm like two hours into a live
114:05 - stream my brain
114:06 - is like non-functioning suppose you okay
114:09 - the square you select in the mini board
114:11 - determines which mini board the next
114:13 - player will play in
114:15 - oh can you start a new game and let the
114:18 - chat play
114:19 - it'll be havoc to read but it'll be fun
114:22 - for us
114:24 - says adrian this is an excellent
114:26 - suggestion
114:27 - however um i don't have a mechanism
114:32 - for um doing that so i think i'm
114:35 - this is really wonderful i apologize to
114:37 - the creator of this
114:39 - for me being um the
114:42 - brain dead person that i am amrit ammar
114:45 - um
114:46 - that i did not understand the logic here
114:48 - also i'm playing against myself so who
114:50 - knows what i would have done with that
114:51 - logic
114:52 - but now it makes sense to me that there
114:54 - is sort of like a meta
114:55 - strategy inside the regular tic-tac-toe
114:57 - strategy which is really interesting to
114:59 - think about i would love
115:01 - for it to i think some of the color
115:03 - choices are could be
115:05 - more evident and you might be able to
115:07 - use like a fill even also to like
115:09 - highlight the active square i'm often
115:11 - confused like
115:13 - you know something to like separate the
115:15 - individual three by three tiles might be
115:17 - helpful so i think there are some
115:19 - visual augmentations you could make here
115:21 - to make the
115:22 - sort of like the distinctive areas and
115:24 - and the sort of interactions more clear
115:26 - um but um this is a fantastic project
115:31 - ding the bell ring the train whistle
115:36 - and let's move on to
115:40 - uh look at one more
115:44 - spin that wheel
115:50 - well there's a lot of tic-tac-toe ones
115:52 - coming up today resizable tic-tac-toe
115:55 - let's look at this one
115:58 - resizable tic-tac-toe pvsp click
116:03 - oh this one i did look at i definitely
116:06 - remember this one
116:08 - right this one we've looked at before so
116:10 - one of the things we need to do one of
116:12 - the things i would like to do hi
116:13 - code guppy again welcome thank you code
116:16 - guppy
116:19 - a member of the coding train um
116:24 - so um
116:27 - thank you code guppy all right now um
116:32 - well i we looked at this so one of the
116:34 - things that i really would like to do
116:35 - is make some improvements and
116:37 - advancements in this sort of community
116:39 - contribution
116:40 - sharing system uh the wheel is great i
116:42 - think there's probably some nice design
116:44 - upgrades we could do with it
116:45 - um having a sort of a database or an api
116:48 - that keeps track of what i've shown or
116:50 - kind of like tries to um highlight
116:53 - people who haven't had their things
116:54 - shown i know there's a lot more that can
116:55 - be done with it so apologies
116:56 - apologies for skipping that one but i'm
116:58 - really sure that i looked at that one
116:59 - before in a previous so let's let's spin
117:01 - the wheel and look at one more
117:08 - yeah this one i also we also did look at
117:10 - because i remember that raycasting was
117:12 - spelled wrong
117:14 - ray casing with pie game so i'm just
117:16 - gonna double check and confirm
117:19 - but i i have a very yeah i have a very
117:21 - specific memory that this one came up
117:23 - already
117:24 - let's like refresh the wheel entirely to
117:26 - get 10 new selections and
117:28 - spin that wheel i think we need some
117:30 - music to bring us better luck
117:37 - and guess what everybody the coding
117:39 - train is brought to you today by
117:41 - tic-tac-toe it's a simple game
117:44 - fun to play for all the family and yet
117:48 - it seems to be what everyone is
117:50 - so let's take a look at it by gamer5000
117:55 - raw gamer 5000. i'm mispronouncing your
117:58 - name on purpose
117:59 - okay uh we can change the size and we
118:02 - can play look at this it's cool so much
118:04 - tic-tac-toe
118:06 - i love how you can do this in real time
118:08 - it'd be interesting to think about if
118:09 - you would started to play it
118:11 - and um you resized it and it kept
118:14 - what you had played so far like you're
118:16 - sort of zooming out let's see let's see
118:18 - if there's any interesting thing that
118:19 - happens when you win
118:24 - animating the line drawing yeah welcome
118:26 - to
118:27 - the tic-tac-toe coding channel youtube
118:30 - channel where
118:31 - every week we talk about the game
118:33 - tic-tac-toe how do you play it what does
118:35 - it mean where did you come from
118:36 - who loves tic-tac-toe more than me
118:39 - nobody
118:40 - [Music]
118:44 - yes all right one more one more one more
118:49 - that was a little weird that like yes
118:50 - that i did that was that made me
118:52 - uncomfortable
118:52 - i hope you're doing all right
118:54 - [Music]
118:56 - oh it's the editable game of life
118:58 - remember the editable the edible game of
119:00 - life
119:00 - all right we looked at that last week
119:02 - we've got um 10 print i'm excited for
119:04 - this a
119:05 - web 10 print is one of my favorite
119:07 - coding challenges that people contribute
119:08 - to
119:09 - um just to look at it briefly it's this
119:12 - coding challenge
119:13 - um it's actually i don't i don't know if
119:14 - anyone broke the record but this is one
119:16 - has
119:16 - so many contributions it's a really
119:18 - really simple
119:20 - uh system of drawing uh one of two
119:23 - possible lines in a grid
119:25 - that's famously from this one line
119:27 - commodore 64 program
119:29 - um if you're not familiar i think if i
119:30 - just go to tenprint.org with this book
119:32 - by this collection of wonderful authors
119:35 - all about the sort of like
119:37 - history of it's really in a way it's
119:39 - like looking at the history of creative
119:40 - computing through the lens of this one
119:42 - line of code
119:43 - highly recommend this wonderful book
119:46 - let's take a look
119:48 - at this particular version of it by
119:51 - near b
119:56 - oh this is cool this is interesting so
119:59 - at first i thought huh
120:01 - this looks to me like it is essentially
120:04 - um identical to the original
120:08 - 10 print challenge and i was about to
120:10 - say
120:11 - that's wonderful there's no reason why
120:14 - anybody shouldn't feel free to submit
120:16 - their own version of basically the exact
120:18 - same thing
120:19 - and getting it working however there's
120:20 - something quite different here and i
120:22 - i now have a very clear picture in my
120:25 - head of what i am assuming is going on
120:27 - here
120:27 - but i'm curious to let
120:31 - to see if the chat um you know i know
120:33 - you're about 30 seconds behind me here
120:34 - so i'll have to sort of vamp for a
120:35 - second
120:36 - but if anyone in the chat wants to try
120:38 - to make a guess as to what is going on
120:40 - here
120:41 - why how is this different from the
120:44 - the example if i just go back to it
120:47 - again if i just look at my
120:49 - particular example which is this from
120:52 - the actual video itself
120:54 - looks very similar but there is a
120:56 - different quality to it let's refresh
120:58 - this
120:59 - just to see it again
121:05 - so zork master says i feel like that's
121:07 - using
121:08 - some sort of noise that's my thought
121:12 - exactly too
121:14 - so i'm assuming that what this is doing
121:17 - is it's
121:18 - mapping the probability or not just
121:20 - mapping the probability it's
121:21 - picking the left line or right line
121:24 - or the whichever direction the line is
121:26 - going based off of
121:29 - most likely some purlin noise like
121:32 - algorithm
121:32 - rather than pure randomness so in pure
121:35 - randomness and if i one thing we can do
121:36 - that's nice if i go to full here
121:39 - um we can see um i can quickly click
121:42 - over to look at the code
121:43 - and you can see noise x off y off
121:47 - so very quickly it's you can see how
121:49 - it's
121:50 - i'm checking to see if the value is less
121:52 - than 50 or greater than 50.
121:54 - so just to demonstrate this more clearly
121:57 - if i were to replace that with
121:58 - a random number between 0 and 100 that's
122:01 - what we'll get oh
122:02 - but also the line has a different
122:05 - um it looks to me like it's always
122:08 - brighter
122:09 - when pointing to the right is it tying
122:12 - its
122:12 - stroke also to the noise value or the
122:16 - random value in this case
122:17 - that's really interesting i didn't think
122:18 - of that so those are the looks like the
122:20 - two changes if i
122:22 - if i take that out we can see here this
122:24 - is the original 10 print code
122:26 - but by changing it to
122:30 - uh using uh a noise algorithm over a two
122:34 - dimensional space
122:35 - and then additionally and i already like
122:37 - um got rid of that but additionally
122:38 - changing the sort of
122:39 - um the weight of the stroke weight of
122:42 - the line or actually it's not the stroke
122:43 - weight it's the
122:44 - the brightness of the line that's those
122:46 - are really clever um
122:48 - adjustments to maker there's so there's
122:50 - so many rich
122:52 - and deep possible kinds of things you
122:54 - could do with this one
122:55 - algorithm that's just ah i love it so
122:58 - much
123:00 - okay uh unoriginal pun has woken up in
123:03 - um
123:04 - australia is that right where are you
123:05 - located on original pond welcome
123:08 - to uh the live stream i am going to have
123:10 - some water here and i'm removing myself
123:16 - we are finishing up here but um i'm
123:19 - gonna do one more thing before we go
123:21 - so let us go back to
123:25 - the rubik's cube
123:30 - um i need to sign out of runway here and
123:33 - go back
123:34 - to this account because i'm a lunatic
123:38 - the uh rubik the tiny one completed
123:42 - you can see oh the other one is at 97 so
123:45 - we could compare and contrast these
123:47 - but let's look at this one so this one
123:50 - uh
123:50 - trained completed let's add it to the
123:53 - workspace
123:55 - um we're going to call this coding train
123:58 - demo
124:00 - i'm going to i'm going to give myself a
124:02 - lot more space here
124:03 - i'm going to just test it out here in
124:05 - the browser
124:07 - with camera
124:10 - then i can select the actual webcam here
124:15 - um let's run the model
124:19 - and wait for it to pop up here and see
124:22 - how well this goes
124:27 - this is exciting
124:30 - okinawa oh unoriginal pun i have got to
124:33 - get in touch with you
124:35 - i knew there was some reason why okinawa
124:38 - japan was in my head
124:40 - okay we'll be in touch on discord i've
124:42 - got
124:43 - i've got to speak to you about okinawa
124:45 - japan all right let's see
124:48 - so this is what i was told this was
124:50 - happening to me the other day
124:52 - this i'm told is a bug in the runway
124:54 - interface the fact that
124:56 - it is uh flickering back and forth to
124:58 - the edge
124:59 - so this means i've really got to do it
125:02 - on my own
125:03 - unfortunately i cannot abide by
125:06 - people um um going to the
125:10 - the url of the glitch project in real
125:12 - time i suppose i could
125:15 - like go to full screen and glitch or
125:17 - like this and then you can't see the
125:20 - or maybe what let's do it this way this
125:23 - is kind of cruel of me
125:24 - but um or i could just i could just
125:27 - develop i'm going to develop this
125:28 - locally
125:29 - can't i just like i can clone a glitch
125:31 - project right
125:32 - so if i go back to this will be good
125:36 - good for us to know how to do
125:38 - when i have to sneeze so badly right now
125:40 - i'm going to mute the mic
125:50 - oh that was the most amazing sneeze of
125:52 - my whole life
125:53 - do i have a box of kleenex up here
125:55 - somewhere in the attic
125:58 - i can reach the ceiling a nice tin
126:00 - ceiling here in the attic
126:02 - i don't have a box of kleenex i think
126:03 - i'll be all right for just a few minutes
126:05 - um whoa what happened
126:09 - the camera is doing some crazy adjust
126:11 - color adjusting here all right so
126:12 - um let's go back to the runway template
126:16 - now there is a way if i go to edit
126:18 - project how do i get the um
126:21 - the github url of a project
126:27 - somebody will somebody will know this
126:29 - and tell me in the chat
126:34 - tools custom domains import import
126:37 - export
126:38 - here he is git url so that's where it is
126:40 - by the way
126:41 - under um tools
126:46 - custom sorry under tools
126:52 - import export get url so let's go back
126:54 - to terminal here
126:56 - um
127:01 - let's see if we can clone it so i'm
127:04 - going to develop this locally
127:06 - just because i want to like keep the key
127:09 - not i don't think i can keep the key
127:11 - secure but i
127:12 - don't want to like use up a zillion
127:14 - requests to
127:16 - um the runway uh library and i just want
127:19 - to um
127:20 - be able to operate it just myself i
127:22 - think you'll all understand why okay
127:24 - so what's it called now runway ml
127:28 - template perfect
127:30 - um let's open up the code
127:37 - so here it is i need to make
127:40 - a dot env file
127:43 - and if i look in here the things that i
127:46 - need are
127:47 - i i can kind of not worry about the
127:48 - daily limit right now
127:50 - so i'll just make it a thousand so that
127:52 - i kind of have something in there
127:55 - um i need to get a
128:01 - where do i create the model how come i
128:03 - don't see this i'm so blind there it is
128:05 - runway url
128:10 - runway url equals and
128:14 - runway token
128:20 - so let's go to runway
128:23 - and um
128:26 - close all this stuff oh stop
128:30 - there i was using up some credits there
128:32 - just running it let's do network
128:34 - let's host this model uh
128:37 - host model
128:40 - and i'm going to get the api key
128:43 - actually
128:44 - let me
128:49 - where do i have i wanted to just sort of
128:52 - test it with sky gan
128:53 - let me just test this with sky gan just
128:56 - to make sure it's working
128:59 - where do i go model workspace
129:02 - back to models sky gan
129:06 - sky gan network
129:10 - host this model host this model
129:14 - so i am going to grab the model url
129:18 - put it in the url then i'm going to grab
129:21 - the token
129:22 - the api no the api the api key
129:26 - i don't know why i call it runway token
129:27 - i guess that makes sense it's an api key
129:29 - i'm going to remove my screen paste it
129:32 - in
129:33 - hit save hit close and come back
129:37 - so i believe now if i were to
129:40 - uh run this whoops
129:45 - uh oh i guess i need to do npm install
129:48 - to install the node modules
129:52 - run the server nope
129:55 - writing out count not a number
130:00 - what's going on here
130:11 - count 100 writing out count not a number
130:15 - check day oh i forgot about this whole
130:17 - check day thing
130:23 - this is weird i mean i don't really care
130:25 - about this right now
130:27 - so i'm just going to comment this out i
130:28 - don't know why that's not working i have
130:30 - a thing that i wrote that it resets the
130:31 - count every day
130:33 - so my rate limiting is like 100 requests
130:35 - per day
130:36 - but i'm just going to like comment this
130:38 - out because i don't really need to worry
130:40 - about the rate limiting right now
130:47 - the url provide is not your hosted model
130:49 - must be in the format
130:52 - i think i did something wrong with
130:56 - getting the hosted model so hold on
130:59 - people
131:01 - uh going back to here looking at my.env
131:03 - file
131:05 - oh i know what the problem is i know
131:07 - what the problem is
131:09 - nobody has actually did i actually
131:11 - figured out before the chat did oh how
131:12 - exciting
131:14 - so um let me close the dot in via file
131:17 - so here's the problem the problem is
131:21 - that like loading the uh information
131:23 - from the dot env file
131:25 - works out of the box on glitch glitch is
131:27 - set up to know about it automatically
131:29 - but i need to use the dot env
131:32 - package then only the dot env file will
131:36 - only be loaded if i require the
131:38 - the npm package.env and call the config
131:40 - function
131:41 - so i should say node npm
131:45 - i dot env
131:49 - so i have that now and now i should be
131:50 - able to say
131:52 - node server what's this shrink wrap
131:55 - thing okay great
131:57 - so the app is going and it's listening
132:01 - on
132:01 - port i guess i
132:04 - why did it why did it pick that port
132:07 - i guess there's some weird things i have
132:09 - to change when i'm doing this locally
132:11 - uh process.env port oh um well
132:14 - i want to put this in the env file
132:17 - but i have to every time i look at the
132:19 - emv file it's like danger danger will
132:21 - robinson
132:23 - um port i'll just do three thousand
132:28 - um close that
132:32 - and
132:35 - okay so i should be able to go to
132:36 - localhost 3000
132:40 - and click generate oh it's doing it
132:42 - already
132:44 - let's make sure this works
132:48 - great i got my sky gan and look at this
132:51 - the count is just going up by one each
132:53 - time
132:54 - because nobody else can run this but
132:57 - [Music]
132:59 - all right so let's now change this over
133:02 - to
133:03 - using the object detection model
133:07 - um so i am going to go to my p5 sketch
133:13 - i am going to say
133:16 - let video video
133:20 - equals create cap create capture video
133:25 - then
133:29 - uh video dot hide
133:32 - function draw image
133:35 - video zero
133:38 - zero and uh
133:42 - width height
133:45 - so let's not worry about send vector
133:48 - or uh calling that right now or the
133:53 - oh i'm gonna keep the generate button in
133:54 - there right now okay
133:57 - allow and of course we have the obs
133:59 - virtual camera i will switch this
134:02 - i can just do it like this why i have to
134:05 - do this always and forever
134:08 - okay i've got my video showing up there
134:11 - next
134:12 - up we've done this is all the same that
134:13 - i already did i should go grab
134:15 - actually i'm going to do that let's go
134:17 - back to
134:18 - the glitch project that
134:22 - i was working on spade coco choo choo
134:25 - coatings spade coco
134:31 - um let's grab this this is a much
134:35 - better function for me to use
134:40 - um as my basis
134:45 - um now i don't know i don't believe it's
134:48 - called semantic map
134:50 - my guess is it's called image and what's
134:52 - coming back
134:54 - is not an image so i can get rid of that
134:58 - let's take a look at what comes back
135:01 - so i'm just guessing that this is what
135:02 - i'm supposed to send to runway
135:04 - the other thing i need to do of course
135:06 - is go to my hosted models
135:09 - and check
135:13 - and get the rubik's cube url now i've
135:16 - got to go back to my.env file again
135:19 - sorry everybody
135:20 - i'm going to the dot env file
135:26 - dot env file now i'm going back to
135:28 - runway and i'm getting the api key
135:32 - i'm putting the api key in my.env file
135:36 - there it is and now i am going back
135:39 - to sketch.js closing the dot env file
135:43 - excellent
135:46 - and i think i should be able to
135:50 - say let's do let's create button like
135:54 - uh detect
135:58 - let's call this object detect and then
136:01 - call this object detect so i'm not 100
136:03 - sure this is all correct
136:05 - but in theory when i press the button
136:07 - it'll send
136:09 - the image of the video uh to runway
136:13 - the server node server will manage that
136:15 - and give me back the outputs which
136:16 - presumably would have
136:18 - the label of the thing it found the xy
136:20 - width height let's see
136:24 - so i need to go to here hit refresh
136:30 - let's hold this up ah
136:33 - cannot read property to your data url of
136:36 - undefined
136:37 - i guess i didn't check what i was doing
136:40 - here
136:40 - what am i reading uh canvas so actually
136:42 - this should be the video
136:45 - i want to take the video uh
136:49 - and and turn that into a data url and
136:51 - send it so this is a case where i don't
136:53 - want to send the canvas
136:54 - so hopefully that's all i needed to do
137:02 - there's an error to drill could not be
137:04 - function ah you know what it is
137:07 - video canvas and i probably have to say
137:09 - video load pixels
137:11 - i think in order to turn it into a data
137:14 - url
137:14 - i need to not look at the dom element
137:16 - but the canvas associated with the dom
137:18 - element
137:19 - that has the pixel data loaded on it i
137:21 - think we'll find out
137:24 - i'll try it without load pixels in a
137:26 - second detect
137:28 - okay
137:32 - wow it froze everything up that's weird
137:37 - and shouldn't say like console log
137:42 - not saying console log sending image
137:54 - hmm let's check one of the things that
137:56 - you should always check when you're
137:58 - doing this
137:59 - is is the model awake or asleep
138:04 - this is weird that the model is
138:07 - not waking it should be turning yellow
138:10 - here
138:15 - all right let's
138:21 - let me double check what it's looking
138:24 - for
138:25 - um let me double check what it's looking
138:26 - for so i'm going to switch back to just
138:28 - showing me
138:29 - because when i look at the runway
138:31 - example code it has the api key in it
138:33 - image threshold i also need a threshold
138:36 - so i'm just going to show this to you
138:38 - without the api key visible so in runway
138:41 - the inputs are the image the base64
138:43 - image as well as a threshold
138:45 - i would assume it's using a default
138:47 - threshold and then i should get back
138:49 - bounding boxes categories and scores
138:52 - so let me make sure everything is right
138:54 - here
138:56 - let me make sure the url and the token
138:58 - is correct
139:02 - in the dot env file
139:06 - yeah looks absolutely looks right
139:09 - um server let's console.logs is there
139:12 - any error in the server i didn't
139:14 - actually check
139:14 - oh the requests are going through i i
139:17 - know i need to show you my screen
139:19 - but why
139:24 - i'm kind of confused because
139:28 - this should show it as waking up
139:31 - ooh sky gan is waking up because
139:34 - somebody's running that glitch
139:35 - application
139:37 - i should turn this one off uh
139:41 - that's not the one that i'm using right
139:42 - now um
139:44 - let's go here
139:48 - and you know maybe
139:52 - i just need to also add threshold
139:56 - 0.5 let's try that threshold 0.5
140:01 - and let's make sure that base64 image is
140:03 - actually working properly
140:08 - it just got stuck there
140:16 - okay
140:19 - froze so that's definitely a base64
140:22 - image
140:23 - where did it get stuck though
140:27 - i don't log understanding images
140:36 - oh i got an error here the model
140:39 - experienced an error while processing
140:40 - your input
140:43 - double check that you are sending
140:44 - properly formed input parameters
140:46 - hosted model.info method
140:50 - so let's do that
140:54 - boy this was this was this is supposed
140:56 - to be the end like i'm like it's almost
140:58 - six o'clock i'm going an hour later than
140:59 - i said but i really want to get this to
141:01 - work
141:02 - uh let's turn this off uh
141:05 - take close these things uh close these
141:10 - things
141:12 - um so let's look again
141:16 - um
141:21 - looking at the code snippet
141:28 - uh threshold number from point zero one
141:32 - to point to one
141:35 - this is weird um
141:38 - okay so i'm just gonna do something here
141:42 - in the server
141:49 - and when i run the server i'm gonna call
141:52 - model.info
141:53 - just to make sure that that's working
141:55 - properly so let's do that
142:02 - something weird is going on
142:06 - right that
142:10 - your app is in port 3000 count 100
142:13 - why is this not communicating with the
142:20 - model
142:39 - let's add some additional console logs
142:41 - here
142:43 - ah there we go
142:46 - okay default okay
142:50 - this is the inputs are channels three
142:52 - default name image type
142:54 - image default point five
142:58 - minimum consonant score max one
143:00 - threshold
143:01 - name threshold okay so image base64
143:04 - image
143:05 - and then i should get objects back so
143:07 - maybe the model
143:09 - oh it's awake now i know something i
143:12 - guess maybe something was going
143:13 - weird with it let's refresh this page
143:21 - oh there we go
143:25 - the bounding boxes came back rubik's
143:28 - scores
143:28 - status success bounding boxes looks like
143:32 - these are normalized values
143:34 - now why why why why why why did this
143:44 - stop
143:46 - why did that stop on the client
143:50 - function draw
143:56 - oh hold on i have something i have to do
143:58 - on my phone
143:59 - the alarm went off i have to do this at
144:01 - six o'clock
144:02 - so at 5 59 i need to uh stop for a
144:05 - second
144:06 - why what's so weird
144:11 - what happened here that caused it to
144:15 - stop let's let's
144:22 - it's just um
144:31 - okay now i'm going to detect call detect
144:35 - that's still going why did the canvas
144:40 - stop
144:42 - why did draw i mean i recognize that
144:45 - this is like an
144:46 - this is an asynchronous function
144:51 - did like the load pixels act of loading
144:53 - the pixels let's
144:54 - let's comment this out see if it works
145:00 - ah so load pixels messes it up but it
145:04 - can't get the
145:08 - um can i call like update pixels
145:12 - and that'll like get it going again
145:20 - no that's like a p5
145:24 - bug it shouldn't be doing that all right
145:26 - i'm not gonna this is a p5 bug that's
145:28 - unrelated to what i'm trying to do
145:30 - so i'm gonna just not worry about that
145:32 - for because i
145:33 - i gotta stop i gotta stop live streaming
145:36 - somebody will help me uh figure this out
145:38 - i have two minutes so i need to do
145:40 - something very important on my
145:42 - phone but uh
145:46 - i have an activity that i do with my
145:48 - kids and you have to book it 48 hours in
145:50 - advance or you know
145:51 - due to like covid restrictions um and if
145:54 - i don't do it right at six it's for like
145:56 - monday at six
145:57 - it doesn't like i you have to join the
145:59 - waitlist so i'm watching the clock here
146:02 - um so let's just draw
146:05 - um let's do it this way
146:09 - um
146:12 - let's i could copy it you know what i
146:14 - could do
146:15 - this is making me annoyed that i want to
146:17 - fix this even though it feels like a p5
146:19 - bug
146:20 - uh let video copy
146:24 - oh i can just do this
146:31 - can i do this
146:47 - ah it does the same thing because get is
146:49 - gonna load the pixels of the video in
146:51 - order to copy it okay
146:52 - never mind i won't worry about this
146:55 - let's look at what comes out bounding
146:58 - boxes okay nothing
147:01 - um
147:05 - so let's um
147:09 - i think if i do
147:13 - uh make a variable called detections is
147:15 - an empty array
147:17 - and then if i say
147:21 - detections equals outputs dot bounding
147:25 - boxes
147:27 - is that what it was called let's
147:29 - actually oops let's get
147:31 - 558 when says 5 59 i'm gonna stop
147:34 - for a second you know i'ma stop now
147:38 - you guys have to bear with me while i
147:40 - refresh a page
147:41 - on my phone over and over again
147:46 - and then i'm gonna finish this off
147:50 - this is such a weird thing i'm doing
147:52 - sunday
147:53 - monday 6 pm
147:56 - you all will think of me at 6 00 p.m on
147:58 - monday if i get this
148:00 - too early to join
148:01 - [Music]
148:03 - too early to join too early to join
148:09 - too early to join too early to join
148:14 - too early to join really to join
148:19 - really to join too early to join
148:23 - [Music]
148:25 - too early to join too early to join
148:29 - [Music]
148:30 - to really join that's good
148:34 - come on change the six o'clock already
148:38 - really enjoy
148:41 - it's really to join it's really
148:44 - just refreshing this over and over again
148:46 - too early to join
148:48 - [Music]
148:51 - early to join yeah join
148:54 - join join join yes i got it
148:58 - okay monday at six o'clock all right
149:00 - excellent
149:01 - uh so the bounding boxes are
149:05 - uh an array with four values in it and i
149:08 - assume this is normalized to the width
149:10 - and the height
149:11 - so i could say here
149:16 - now in draw four let i
149:20 - equal zero i is less than what did i
149:21 - call this detections
149:24 - sections dot length uh let
149:27 - cube equals detections index i
149:30 - and then i want to say x equals
149:35 - dot zero times width
149:41 - y equals cube one dot dot height
149:44 - times height what do we think do we
149:47 - think these
149:48 - are the width and height of the box or
149:50 - do we think this is the bottom right
149:52 - corner of the box
149:54 - does it explain that to me anywhere i
149:56 - mean looking at those numbers what would
149:57 - you guess
149:58 - i don't think they're the width and the
150:00 - height that would be huge
150:02 - must be the bottom right and bottom the
150:04 - corner so i think i would then
150:06 - say x x1
150:09 - y1
150:14 - x2 y2 2
150:17 - and three and then i could think i could
150:19 - say rect mode
150:21 - corners i think that's what it is in p5
150:23 - if instead of
150:24 - specifying the xy width and height i
150:26 - want to specify the corners
150:27 - and then i would draw a rectangle x1 y1
150:29 - x2 y2
150:31 - stroke 255
150:35 - no fill stroke weight uh let's make it
150:38 - pretty thick
150:39 - eight all right let's try this now
150:45 - so um no rubik's cube
150:51 - the model must have gone to sleep during
150:52 - all that time
151:01 - this model has trouble waking up it
151:02 - seems
151:06 - so that's green
151:09 - i'm impatient
151:15 - oh i'm so close to being done with this
151:18 - live stream
151:22 - wow why did it break so this is also a
151:26 - weird bug
151:27 - which i would uh sort of assume
151:30 - is maybe a runway issue
151:33 - where did i have that querying the model
151:40 - yeah
151:42 - all right let's restart the server
151:50 - so the model's not returning oh there we
151:52 - no the info yet
151:58 - i suppose i could try
152:01 - oh it's yellow that's a good sign it's
152:03 - waking up
152:13 - if anybody has watched this entire
152:15 - stream has been taking notes on all the
152:17 - different runway-related things that
152:19 - have come up
152:20 - that would be so amazing to compile
152:23 - i would be forever grateful but with
152:25 - even with like the time codes of what
152:27 - they are
152:27 - because i want to get in touch with the
152:28 - runway folks um after this
152:31 - is the audio peaking by the way i'm
152:33 - seeing a lot of red actually
152:34 - in my i'm turning down the uh gain a
152:37 - little bit
152:38 - i'm seeing a lot of red in the um
152:41 - monitor i'm using
152:43 - still yellow ah no it it it's it's awake
152:46 - i think
152:51 - okay no bounding box
152:54 - there we go
152:58 - amazing oh this is so cool
153:04 - a custom trained object detection model
153:08 - working like essentially perfectly
153:11 - i mean look how good this is this is
153:14 - crazy the thing is i wanted to get it to
153:18 - work in real time
153:20 - and i don't understand why
153:24 - the video is
153:29 - frozen whenever i call load pixels
153:33 - such a strange thing so that's i guess
153:36 - i'm gonna have to work that out later
153:37 - i'm gonna publish this the glitch right
153:39 - now
153:40 - um with obviously without the
153:43 - the environment variables if anybody
153:45 - wants to
153:48 - you don't need like you could work on
153:50 - debugging this for me without the runway
153:52 - call
153:52 - like for example this should still work
153:55 - just fine
153:57 - if um
154:00 - you know i don't actually
154:03 - if i if i if i don't actually query
154:06 - runway
154:06 - like just the act of loading the pixels
154:10 - right so if you want to debug this for
154:12 - help debug this for me with p5
154:15 - like if i take out all of this
154:20 - just comment all of this out right now
154:23 - let's be sure about this refresh it
154:29 - right just the act of calling load
154:30 - pixels freezes
154:33 - the canvas element of the video
154:36 - it's not supposed to do that and i don't
154:38 - recall that it used to do that i wonder
154:42 - if that's a like new bug and i mean i'm
154:46 - using the latest p5 i mean
154:48 - again i've got to stop so i've got to
154:50 - turn this off but that's one of the
154:51 - first things i would do is go back and
154:53 - try earlier versions
154:54 - um this this feels like a bug in p5 so
154:57 - let's just
154:58 - wrap all this up by
155:01 - um i'm gonna put this back
155:05 - in um i am going to
155:09 - add a
155:14 - how do i do this i'm going to add a dot
155:17 - env file no
155:20 - not in public
155:26 - a dot ev file sorry
155:29 - um i don't come on make a new file down
155:31 - here thank you
155:32 - a dot get ignore that's what i want to
155:35 - do
155:36 - and in dot get ignored uh ignore emv
155:39 - node modules um
155:42 - [Music]
155:46 - i don't really need this but that's fine
155:48 - count is fine
155:50 - that's fine readme find server
155:54 - i don't know what this is i don't know
155:56 - what this shrink wrap yaml thing is
155:58 - let me just take that out because i
156:00 - don't need that for what i'm doing
156:02 - that's it seems like a glitch thing
156:04 - i can also take this out
156:09 - um okay so now
156:18 - uh let's make a branch called main
156:34 - um let's
156:38 - call this sorry what am i doing this is
156:42 - updating to work with object detection
156:47 - then i'm going to go to github.com
156:50 - codingtrain
156:56 - um what is this runway
157:01 - ml object detection
157:04 - uh object detection
157:08 - object detection model with runway
157:14 - ml node.js and p5.js
157:18 - um
157:19 - [Music]
157:22 - no i don't want to create a repository i
157:24 - do want to create a repository but i'm
157:26 - using an existing repository so there we
157:27 - go
157:30 - then
157:34 - okay so
157:34 - [Music]
157:37 - this is what i want to do add
157:40 - this whoops origin get a remote dash
157:44 - v oh cause get
157:48 - remote remove origin
157:53 - okay oh
157:57 - yeah okay and then git push origin
158:01 - main i guess
158:07 - so now all the code for it is here
158:12 - um and i can put that in this chord if
158:15 - anybody wants to look at it
158:18 - let's see did the just streambot come
158:19 - back no
158:22 - uh run object detection um
158:25 - okay there we go so this is the if
158:27 - you're in the discord under
158:28 - live under links that's the github repo
158:31 - and why not just put this on glitch now
158:34 - i should be able to do
158:38 - um so the runway ml template that was
158:41 - the first one
158:43 - the spade coco ding train choo choo
158:45 - runway ml template is the next one for
158:48 - spade coco
158:49 - and now new project
158:53 - import from github i think this will
158:55 - work
158:58 - um and just paste this in import from
159:01 - github
159:02 - there here let's see what happens
159:08 - let's re well i'll let it load let's
159:10 - give it a minute here
159:13 - so this is the end by the way everybody
159:15 - um
159:22 - i'll be back hopefully next saturday
159:24 - we'll be taking at least one
159:25 - saturday off in um let me pause this for
159:28 - a second
159:29 - i will be taking at least one saturday
159:30 - off in november i i scheduled to take
159:33 - the saturday of thanksgiving weekend off
159:35 - um i am not going anywhere for
159:37 - thanksgiving
159:38 - i am not having anyone come over for
159:40 - thanksgiving
159:41 - it is i don't think it's really safe or
159:43 - advisable to do so um you know
159:45 - everyone's got to make their own
159:46 - decision of course
159:47 - um you know following their your local
159:50 - guidelines and laws um
159:52 - but so it's conceivable that i might
159:54 - live stream that weekend
159:55 - but um we'll see a lot is going on this
159:57 - is a very busy time of year with the nyu
159:59 - semester which is wrapping up soon
160:01 - which is a good thing for me in terms of
160:03 - more time to stream
160:04 - but um let's just see here i
160:07 - i believe if i look at this there
160:10 - shouldn't be anything in there
160:11 - yeah right so this you can now also find
160:15 - this project although i want to rename
160:16 - it to
160:18 - runway ml object
160:22 - detection
160:25 - so now i should be able to
160:31 - you should be able to see this project
160:35 - as well here oops i'm it's on the readme
160:38 - sorry about that
160:39 - so um i don't i'm going to disable the
160:41 - model right now
160:43 - um and the api keys aren't in
160:46 - this anyway but so that that wraps that
160:48 - up so
160:49 - what is coming next on the coding train
160:52 - yesterday on friday um i recorded
160:56 - four uh secret there
161:00 - there are five i have five in the can
161:02 - now five
161:03 - video tutorials to come out the first
161:06 - one is
161:07 - using ml5 convolutional neural network
161:10 - part one the second is using ml5
161:13 - convolutional neural network
161:14 - part two the third is using the ml5
161:18 - pre-trained
161:19 - convolutional neural network model
161:20 - doodle net
161:22 - the fourth is uh posting gifs from your
161:26 - discord bot
161:27 - and the fifth is oh no the fourth is
161:32 - dot in using a dot env file to hide your
161:34 - api keys
161:35 - with a discord bot which if you watch
161:37 - today's stream you you're familiar with
161:38 - that somewhat
161:39 - and the fifth is posting gifs so
161:41 - hopefully those will come out
161:43 - soon um if you um
161:46 - i've been doing um recording sessions on
161:48 - fridays it's a little bonus if you want
161:50 - to join as a member

161:54 - um recording sessions
161:56 - if you're not a member don't worry

162:03 - you want a little early access or to
162:04 - interact in that way you're welcome to
162:05 - join
162:06 - the coding train membership program um
162:10 - hopefully at least one of them will come
162:11 - out next week my process has really
162:13 - slowed down
162:14 - for better or worse um but
162:17 - i'm working with uh doing some video
162:19 - editing and getting the descriptions and
162:21 - the captions and all that stuff
162:22 - done before they are released um i'm
162:25 - looking in the chat to see
162:26 - if there's any questions or otherwise
162:29 - things coming out
162:31 - question mark wheel ah i'm told the
162:34 - prefix changed
162:37 - there we go question mark wheel the
162:39 - prefix uh in in trainbot 2.0 just
162:41 - streambot had changed
162:43 - okay um
162:46 - so anyway i hope you enjoyed today's
162:47 - live stream i feel like
162:49 - last week was such a you know
162:53 - disaster it's an unmitigated disaster i
162:56 - suppose to put it away hey patricia
162:58 - parker

163:04 - pause let's everybody take a moment to
163:08 - welcome
163:09 - patricia parker welcome for boarding the
163:12 - coding train
163:14 - we'll ring the bell for you and blow the
163:16 - train whistle
163:18 - your membership is greatly appreciated
163:20 - it is really just i've been honored and
163:22 - thrilled and thankful
163:24 - um and for each member of the coding
163:27 - trade
163:28 - at some point you will get some stickers
163:29 - in the mail i'm getting myself that's
163:31 - actually been
163:32 - um actually the sticker mailing process
163:36 - is really working quite well much better
163:38 - than it ever has before
163:40 - so stay tuned for more about that that's
163:42 - happening soon
163:43 - um a lot of you got them recently but
163:45 - all of you have joined the last few
163:46 - weeks
163:47 - um you should be getting them soon i
163:49 - know poor david has been waiting like
163:50 - two years
163:51 - and there was like some a lot of mix-ups
163:54 - that happened so i apologize to david
163:55 - but patricia your random number
164:02 - is and again we really need a system for
164:05 - keeping track of all these
164:09 - on page 187 row 9 308
164:13 - column 4
164:16 - 73 thousand eight hundred and three
164:19 - thank you
164:20 - patricia reset my song
164:25 - uh greetings lars from denmark
164:30 - um i know i i was thinking what i would
164:33 - do actually with the
164:34 - um tutorial about how to post a gif to
164:37 - your discord bot that i would release
164:39 - two versions of it one with me saying
164:42 - gif
164:42 - and one with me saying jiff it'd be
164:44 - exactly the same tutorial
164:46 - but i'd have two videos i think i really
164:48 - will do this
164:49 - so i'm just gonna have to dub it over or
164:51 - use machine learning or something
164:53 - i think i should dub it over actually
164:54 - but just that you know and then this is
164:56 - where you post your
164:57 - gif and then this is where you post your
164:59 - chat
165:00 - so i think that'll be pretty awesome um
165:04 - all right bruno's asked me if i
165:06 - regenerated all the keys leaked early
165:09 - i think i did but i i think i i either
165:11 - regenerated or then i disabled the
165:13 - models
165:14 - i'm i'm i'm letting this run for another
165:17 - two minutes i'll answer any questions
165:19 - that i see in the chat
165:21 - um by the way what's fun what's funny to
165:23 - me about the membership thing
165:24 - is i literally that message will come in
165:26 - if somebody just happened to join at
165:28 - this time
165:28 - not actually tuning into i know i said
165:30 - this livestream so patricia i don't know
165:32 - if you're actually there
165:32 - but please um make sure you if you are
165:34 - there patricia make sure you sign up
165:36 - and get information about the the
165:38 - discord yes the way it's pronounced is
165:40 - definitely um gif
165:42 - that's how it's pronounced
165:46 - am i from denmark i am not from denmark
165:48 - have i ever been to denmark
165:50 - nobody asked that question but i'm
165:52 - asking it
165:54 - no i have never been to denmark that is
165:57 - i've got to get to denmark
165:59 - an unoriginal pun if you're still
166:01 - watching
166:02 - i gotta talk to you about okinawa japan
166:04 - [Music]
166:05 - um i'm in the market for a place to live
166:09 - for a little while
166:12 - and i have fantasies of going to various
166:14 - places and for some okinawa japan is
166:15 - kind of on my list
166:17 - uh if uh patricia is here hi patricia um
166:20 - if you uh live somewhere beautiful and
166:22 - amazing in the world
166:24 - uh i have a um what i'm hoping is a six
166:27 - months period where i could
166:28 - with my family go in a little adventure
166:30 - you know assuming
166:31 - this is far off in the future i'm kind
166:33 - of assuming that
166:34 - um the world will hopefully be mostly
166:37 - recovered from the
166:38 - pandemic currently that's a huge
166:41 - assumption obviously but i'm
166:43 - starting to plan for that uh possibility
166:45 - just to
166:46 - look forward to something um i hope that
166:48 - you have something to look forward to
166:50 - boy
166:50 - it's really depressing whatever there's
166:52 - 20 seconds left
166:53 - uh don't go to denmark norway i have
166:58 - been to norway okay can i tell you about
167:00 - one of my favorite places in the world
167:02 - ah i have some of my favorite memories
167:05 - in life from this place

167:19 - days there with my family
167:22 - i believe it means bird island um and we
167:25 - went on hikes we hiked all the way out
167:28 - to this lighthouse here and by the way
167:30 - there's no way to get to that lighthouse
167:32 - other than hiking and it was like at
167:35 - hours and hours hike
167:36 - and i had a three-year-old and a uh
167:39 - six-year-old at the time it was a really
167:41 - amazing adventure and
167:42 - i actually asked when i got there the
167:45 - proprietor of the lighthouse which you
167:46 - can stay overnight there for free if you
167:48 - hike out there
167:49 - i asked the proprietor if there was
167:51 - maybe a boat that could take us back
167:54 - and they laughed at me in a friendly way
167:56 - it was quite kind of funny we hiked back
167:58 - ah i had such an amazing time you can we
168:00 - went there to see puffins so we were the
168:02 - wrong time of year
168:03 - there were no puffins but i really just
168:05 - had i would love to go back there that
168:07 - was really um
168:08 - just an amazing time um on this little
168:10 - spot
168:11 - that uh in the world that we visited
168:13 - okay
168:15 - 16 seconds left um

168:20 - hopefully
168:22 - next stay tuned probably next saturday
168:25 - but some saturday in the future
168:27 - here on the coding grain hopefully in
168:28 - the morning again on my time but
168:30 - we'll see goodbye
168:44 - [Music]
169:13 - [Music]
169:20 - this dot

171:49 - this is usually the part of the live
171:50 - stream as i'm packing up that i
171:53 - i like to do a little behind the scenes
171:54 - here take down the green screen
172:02 - you can turn off the lights
172:08 - [Music]
172:10 - i i gotta listen i'm very curious
172:12 - listening back to how this microphone
172:14 - is if i even have it like set up
172:16 - correctly
172:17 - [Music]
172:20 - come on control center
172:25 - turn off the light oh darkness oh it's

172:33 - off now it's gonna be okay today
172:35 - is not broken it has not frozen this
172:37 - isn't so at least turn on the regular
172:39 - lights
172:39 - which i now i'm realizing that's why the
172:42 - key was weird i have these other
172:44 - just regular lamps that usually brighten
172:47 - up the green screen
173:00 - [Music]
173:04 - that was invalid syntax i forgot uh
173:06 - there was one other
173:07 - thing here that i think is important
173:10 - that i will use
173:10 - continuously over and over again all
173:13 - sorts of text generation
173:15 - analysis things thanks everybody for
173:17 - watching
173:19 - over and over again i think i have
173:21 - successfully put everything away this is

Cleaned transcript:

do do so do audio sound check now uh my audio should be better than it usually is because i have a new microphone but i am curious to hear from you what it sounds like let me know second audio sound check i actually had the audio of the music doubled so now this is a better check although everyone said it sounded good before all right can anyone actually tell that this mic is better than what i used to use last week i'll be starting in about two minutes or one minute and 40 seconds baby hello there's gotta be a universal way to say good blank with all of the different times good day but it might be the middle of the night for some of you good day i said good day um good morning good afternoon good evening good middle of the night to all of you hi this is dan coming to you live from the from an attic in brooklyn new york um where it is a beautiful day outside although getting a little chilly um this is not the time i usually like to live stream this is actually the time i usually like to take a nap but i'm wearing my cozy sweater i'm here on the internet with all of you um so far nobody's said anything like this has stopped working so i'm assuming i'm actually live streaming now i i've been working steadily to improve the quality of my live streams as you might remember last week i received some new i received i didn't receive them because i ordered them and they came but i installed some new lights so my skin and my face and everything should be looking positively aglow for you now the cool crisp dulcet tones of my voice should be arriving into your ear devices in a new and perhaps higher quality way because and i'm just going to hold this up for you i uh this is not a sponsored anything although hey i'm available elgato elgato are you listening um this is the elgato wave 3 mic that i ordered um and somebody in the chat raw heath just said oh no it stopped working but i'm assuming only raith is having an issue with the live stream right now rahith come back come back rahith i want you to be experiencing the dulcet tones of my voice in my new microphone i don't know i probably should get one of those things where it's like on an arm and it swivels around and it's just like propped right here but i don't know i don't know if that's for me every week i would like to make a small upgrade which incidentally i have no nothing left to upgrade so if you got any ideas for me let me know what i should upgrade for next week actually there is something also new that i would like to experiment with let me see here if we can get this to work this is a new feature that i will be using on the coding train um and i'm just gonna quickly test it right now i probably should do more to introduce myself and what i'm gonna be doing today but um bear with me i'm moving to here oh and i've got my glitch page open but actually let me remove this no wrong what no ah wrong button all right i have to do this manually um well this is very silly what i'm doing now i can't find my screen to remove it oh it's so hard where oh there it is i'm in emptiness it is so sad here in the emptiness all right this is fine just put that back um and it doesn't matter uh spoiler alert i'm gonna use glitch um let's see here so um everyone who is a coding train member meaning you've signed up through the uh subscription um no that's not the right i'm trying to under i'm trying to not use the word paid but honestly that's what it is um in there's a discord available for everyone there's a public discord for anybody who wants to join um i just posted a link to it in the chat but i also have if you would like to join the coding trade membership program i feel like for your membership in the coding train you will receive not very much to be perfectly honest but um it's a nice smaller community of folks uh we've got a uh chat a channel in the discord dedicated to chatting during the live stream and what i am very excited to demonstrate for you right now and most likely it's not gonna work i was having some problems but um david snyder and kobe who are um i can upgrade the green screen area says bruno oh wait see oh no let's let's make this i don't have to i need this on you know what i need to do i need to put this on a tablet i don't know why i didn't think of this i need a tablet another where we need a mobile version of this touch enabled click add it crashed so i don't know what's going on uh but i'm we're attempting to debug this i'm using a piece of software known as disk stream chat which i suppose is discord plus streaming and plus chatting but i always think it's trying to diss me oh i am used myself let's run it again i have a feeling it's gonna for some reason right now it's it's uh got this really wonderful feature where it works the second time i click the button but as soon as i click bruno i hope this is okay with you i'm gonna assume this is okay with bruno bruno can you give me a big thumbs up that i'm going to bring your chat message onto the screen right here i will wait because i actually so what i should say is that anyone who now posts in and i could use a different channel for this but in the members discord live chat channel just then um your message i have a mechanism by which i can click a button and your message pops up on the screen here using the this stream chat software by david and kobe okay i'm waiting for bruno to say okay in the meantime um bruno bruno is typing everybody bruno is it's okay says bruno so now let me go back over to here i really hope this works there it is look bruno's message popped up maybe i should move this like where where should this be ideally where should this be positioned won't move how come the ah what is wrong with open broadcast studio i can't move it that's so weird but anyway you can see bruno's message there and i can even show you that bruno said and i think this might crash let's see and it crashed oh well so i'm not gonna use this anymore probably unless we um can figure it out and i don't know how to get bruno's message off now um but this is my idea that um that i will be able to interact a bit more by answering questions and showing messages by selecting them and curating them and moderating them to have them show up on my fancy live streaming rectangle over here ah now uh keenan says daniel i have a lot of homework but i am watching you and kenan i have one thing to say to you and i think everybody knows what i'm going to say you can all think about it for a minute say it to yourselves please go and do your homework i mean my goodness i understand the desire to procrastinate but i cannot imagine that anything i do here today is in any way shape or form anywhere close to nearly as meaningful impactful and important as your homework so i encourage you to do your homework you know maybe you've budgeted your time you know you will have enough time then i suppose it's okay you could stay we could be together here on the streaming with the coding and all of that but um please please your dad is saying please do your homework okay it should be above or below your head i assume that's referring to the microphone it is below my head right now my head is cut off oh i have to slouch i think i need to move the camera back hold on everybody i don't have a wide enough area so let's see here this is probably going to cause all sorts of problems moving the camera back oh boy let's see what this does and there we are that's a little bit uh better all right so we ironed out uh we all right so what's happening today on today's live stream so first of all i'm um this is hopefully i mean famous last words were ever spoken by me a hundred thousand times in basically every stream ever but i hope this will be a little bit shorter than usual um i would like to be done by 5 p.m eastern time which is an hour and 15 minutes from now probably not gonna happen but um i i do have a limited amount of time there is some fun family activities that i am planning for this evening it is getting dark outside the evening is coming winter is coming and i do need to get to some other stuff but um i would like to do a number of things today one is thank our new member louise i'm not sure if louise is still watching welcome louise to the coding train you have joined just now you might have joined not even being in the chat because i get a message whether or not you're watching in the chat or not and when you join and for your joining of the coding train i will show you this train whistle i will ring this bell i will also go and find my book of random numbers because you will have for yourself a random number oh dear over there nope over here this green screen what's behind it's a whoa um well let's see maybe i will there's so many different ways i could fix this but i'm going to do it this way right now let's see how that does okay i'm not going to worry about it too much you can see me you can hear me let's find louise their random number and here it is two snaps in a circle and we are at 47 081 that is from row 6370 and column six so i hope somebody the uh coding train uh secretary who's recording this in the coding train book of numbers members and their random numbers will be saved for all of history and time forevermore now that we've gotten that out of the way let's set the tone for today and let's read from our book of random numbers ah i need to figure out where i last left off and the way that i do that is by not showing you my screen for a second and finding my way over to the coding train discord okay wait i just got i got just swept away in the music for a moment um looking for coding train live links live links command option i documented again once i tag name i hadn't have index zero style of visibility was hidden option command i and now we're back and the next random number where i last left off row 14 column two i'm still on page one i mean it's kind of amazing like i wish i had thought of this eight years ago or whenever i started it ten years ago whenever i started recording videos when was my first live stream it's there on youtube it was from many years ago i think that was more like 2015 if i'm correct but some of the video tutorials are were recorded in like 2011 2012 but i'm on row index 14 column zero one two eighty seven thousand five hundred and 517 64 969 91 826 8928 there's an animal in the attic with me i don't know it's either a cat or it's a dog oh it's a cat we'll see if the cat comes over kitty would you like a random number kitty what there are people watching this i kind of forgot that for a second i don't even remember where i am someone remember the last random number i read shoot okay go back ugh well i was starting on robotic oh my god my that this is a wash we're gonna go back we'll do this again this is i'm just getting warmed up all right all right all right somebody will tell me what random number was the last one i read and i'll find it and then i'll post it and everything's gonna be okay all right what's happening today i'm gonna start doing some uh projects and actually i'm going to do the same thing i did last week because i want to start training a machine learning model and once i get that model cooking i'm going to be baking it in my machine learning gpu oven i'm going to take a break and look at some community contributions so things that you the viewers of the coding train have made and submitted on the coding train website then i will come back and work on making a glitch uh well it's not a glitch application it is a node a web application hosted on glitch um to be able to uh communicate with that machine learning model that when it's fully baked and crispy and delightful and very healthy we're gonna make a nice healthy low fat that's not a thing anymore low i don't know what the low that you need is it's gonna be a good a very nice very nice machine learning model okay so let's go to um my uh friendly uh my website from my friends over at runwayml dot oh there's something new oh i wasn't sure if this would show up i don't think i have anything special unlocked in my account i cannot be distracted hold on i'm just opening up my slack communicates i just see if i have a slack telegram no slack telegram so i was asking if this is something that uh is publicly available it says beta i'm sure i could show it it's on there it's on their social media but i'm not going to get distracted we're not doing the green screen right now i'm going to come back to that i am going to go to here train and i want to do something that i have not done before zoom on into it is train my own uh custom object detection model now you might recall on hereto with the coding train youtube channel coding train object detection that there is a video on said youtube channel called ml5.js object detection with coco ssd this is a pretrained machine learning object detection model with 80 um 80 predefined categories so very limited amount of objects it's looking for and can detect and give you a bounding box so you can watch that video go through the code shows you the example what i was not able to demonstrate in that example is how to train your own object detection model and basically you know for example i think what i'll do i mean i could do oh let's do the rubik's cube i was going to do the train whistle but i sort of feel like the rubik's cube might be by the way i was having trouble my bra is having trouble solving it okay here it is um the rubik's cube might be a kind of nicer interesting thing to detect especially because i can it's got so many different colors on different sides i wonder if i shuffled it this is an interesting test case of object detection so let's use the rubik's cube although really i do love this mug so and i kind of want to make an after detection model that detects my mug i mean there's nothing special if only this mug were made in rainbow colors it would be everything i'd ever hoped for and wished for in my entire life i am a simple but a simple man who lives i don't live in the attic but i spend a lot of time in this attic talking to a camera that's what i do what's happened to me but i do love this mug it brings me great joy and happiness you should find something in your life that you can love and that loves you back like this mug loves me i understand why those like you know late night talk showy like things they use a studio audience because it's very weird to just be on my own i can make my children sit over there and just watch me the entire time that would basically torture them what was i doing right so we're going to train object detection model we're going to um uh have it uh find the rubik's cube okay so but the sort of key difference is here um you know i should say so ml5.js to be clear is a javascript uh library from machine learning built on top of tensorflow.js um and runway is a web application a company that provides a service here essentially to operate different machine learning models in the cloud um it does cost money um you can sign up for it this is not a sponsored ad for runway i am the founders of runway are former students of mine at nyu and i'm an advisor to the company so in that sense it's kind of is an ad but um i'm really just showing it to you out of my own enthusiasm and excitement to try using it so i'm gonna go here to object detection and actually so before before i can train the model i need to collect my data set so this is the way that i'm going to do it this is the way [Laughter] i'm going to go to new movie recording and so there are a lot of different ways you can collect an image data set you can see by the way my little behind the scenes here um oh i did get some here's the other upgrade i'm gonna make i have these like led lights let me turn them on um so i'm gonna by the way but you know this is why i make edited videos now because people do enjoy the fact that i just get distracted and like can never get anywhere that's what the live stream is but plenty of edited videos where i'm focused or at least i'm not focused that part got edited out or coming soon so let me go here and turn on these lights so i just turned on those lights um those will blink by the way if anybody signs up for a membership um but the other upgrade i'll be making hopefully by next week is um and i don't know what that did to my uh key here but um the idea i had i thought this would help like make the key better but i think it might actually be causing me some issues i bought white gaffers tape so i can gaff tape the various cables and things for these leds with white gaffers tape so it doesn't look as ugly as that black kaffir state so i am now going to hit record and i'm going to just record a video of me um with this rubik's cube kind of showing it and using it and i really don't want this to be more than like actually uh 20 i guess i can i can sample the frame rate however i want um let's try to get some different sizes okay let's just go for 30 seconds okay beautiful i'm going to hit stop let us save this to the desktop by the way i was doing this already with some other tests um and i'm gonna just make i might as well use this directory structure i'm gonna call this rubik's let's save this as uh rubik's rubix that's all well and good i actually i don't know what i think i want to do just to have these be less um i don't know if it really matters but i think that i want um let's just at least export it as 720 uh because i don't need super high resolution images for this i'm sort of afraid to go down to 480 although it would make total sense to do that i have a feeling runway once i upload my data set it's going to be resizing all these images just a much lower resolution anyway so that's fine what i'm attempting to do again is collect a data set that i am going to have to hand label so this is going to be one of the most exciting and riveting things i have ever done on the coding train you're going to actually sit and watch me hand label a data set for machine learning it's really exciting um but and i could have certainly um used you know sort of uh scraped the internet maybe doc looked uh did a google image search for rubik's cube and gathered a data set of images that way i could have taken a lot of photos with my old tiny telephone camera and uploaded those but i actually find a quite a useful way to collect a data set um is to record a video and then extract all the frames of that video so the way i will do that is with uh ffmpeg and so i'm in my uh console here on my computer i type in ffmpeg and i see all these possible commands so this won't happen automatically on your computer whether you're on windows or linux or mac you will need to make sure you go and find um i guess go to ffmpeg.org it's a complete crossplatform solution to record convert and stream audio and video it is a really excellently incredibly useful tool i use it frequently um and basically you can see here the sort the kind of foundational example of what you do with it you call you the command via your console ffmpeg dash i i believe stands for the input video input.mp4 and then the file name of what you want to convert it to so this would be how to convert very quickly this mp4 video to an avi file but it there is so much more you can do with ffmpeg in terms of extracting audio and um automating so many kinds of video processes so the one that i want to do is and if i can well i need to go to the desktop um under images maybe i think this is where my that directory was um ffmpeg what was it called again rubix here we go and i'm going to say ffmpeg dash i rubik's 720 does anybody happen to know and i really wish i could pin marcos message to the screen right now but does anybody happen to know the command from ffmpeg to extract it to frames i want to say it's dash vf i don't know if that's really true um i know i know that i need to say fps equals like let's do let's try just for a second one frame per second so i just want to get one image every second from the video um and then i think i can just say like frames what do you do to like number them like if there's this would be now the file name would be i'm going to call it like rubik number number number number dot png if i wanted them to be png's do i want them to be pngs or jpegs i have no idea let's try this okay so ah that one seemed right but i got could not open file frame oh because you know i feel like ffmpeg should make that directory for me but i don't think it will so i made the frames directory uh let's try this again that was super fast did it actually work if i look in frames there we go so now i have frames of the video um and this is probably not enough um this is like how many total uh 35 i think i should do let's delete all these and let's say hmm i mean how many am i i think i could do i think i could annotate 150 images right now i think that's reasonable i've got i don't have my watch on i've got like another hour here at least so i think i could annotate 150 images we'll play some music some royaltyfree music by the way in the market for commissioned musical themes for the coding train i'm already in touch with some people i have some ideas it's a very slow process because i started thinking about this probably over a year ago but if you are a composer and a musician uh join the discord please reach out you know you want to compose and record some music i'm looking for uh contributions in that area okay by the way if there could ever be the coding train musical i will just and what's the expression i suppose die and go to heaven i don't that's not really how i think it works scientifically speaking but um boy that would make me very happy okay um let's do five frames per second that was 178 frames i'm going to go back to runway here and i'm going to click object detection let's do a rubik's cube and by the way i probably i should have done both of these because i can train an object detection model with more than one object in particular in my data set so i'm doing this in the simplest way possible i'm gonna create this now um i'm going to upload oh which oh i'm logged in it's fine i'm meant to be logged into my other runway account it's all so confusing but this is fine this is fine i will i will do that later i'm gonna go to desktop images ffmpeg rubik's frames hit upload and we'll wait for these to upload can we do that thing in the edited videos where the time speeds up that would be nice right i guess i could log out well no i'm already uploading it ah i keep just messing this up you can see by the way oh how different how what a difference a year makes this was a data set that i uploaded a year ago in an attempt to work with uh thanksgiving turkeys okay frames here we go click uh next now um what is the next step i need to create an annotation group so i can't say that i entirely understand what an annotation group is in terms of the runway interface but i'm assuming it means a collection of labels um so um you know if i were doing uh rubik's cubes and train whistles my annotation group would contain both of those labels but i just have one and i don't have one that i've done before so i'll make a new one we'll call this annotation for coding train live stream rubrics give it a very long name and then i want to oh and then i want to put in the label will be rubik's that's the one label i have i'm going to click start annotating hopefully this will load i had a problem with this the other day um somebody can report this as a bug to runway where when i first load this page nothing comes up and i think that let's see if i just click on image two if i recall correctly what i did last time to fix this uh was oh no it worked so i don't know why that first one didn't show up but there it is so this is what i'm doing i'm looking at these images and i'm going to annotate where the rubik's cube is but there's no rubik's cube so i can click skip there's a skip button all the way down here that i realize you can't see skip but i can also just hit the space bar which will be much more efficient so i'm going through the images now here is the rubik's cube so now i'm going to annotate it i'm going to draw a little square over it and that is the rubik's cube and i'm going to click next so i believe there are other tools like this but i really appreciate how kind of quiet and meditative and relaxing this is and how easy it is to do um you know i can move this around and you know resize it i could be really i'm not going to be very particular about it this definitely appeals to my obsessive nature to try to like very precisely annotate it but i want to move quickly and i think that i want to see if we can just have some nice relaxing um music like to annotate by how many do i got to do talk amongst yourselves everybody for those of you wondering why didn't he just do this before he started live streaming and then he could show us when guess what look i actually already did this here's the finished version i'm just going to show you the beginning of the process nope that's not how this works people the whole project all the pieces i will demonstrate to you oh i'm really doing a terrible job by the way what would be really cool is to build a system by which we could crowdsource this so what if i could give you know runway could think about this what if i could give this url out and all of you who are watching this right now could participate in the annotation process what this song's over already what number am i on 40 hey i'm not i'm like uh pretty far along here i don't know what oh these are all the halloween things i had i forgot about the halloween music oh no this always gets me like a copyright violation the gold the goldberg variations let's try this oh yeah this is good oh my god why not alright everybody montage annotation montage hey welcome henry whitaker by joining the coding train right now you have interrupted me from my special hand labeling process of machine learning imagery but i thank you actually you've saved everybody because we were just stuck there was nothing else we could possibly do but now having joined the coding train henry i will now find for you your very own personal random number oh i got the timing of that way wrong it is on row 8915 column zero one two three four five six seven six thousand four hundred and sixty nine thank you henry for your support mwah it means a lot it helps me upgrade my studio and keeps me going it motivates me it fills me all of that stuff wrong one okay back to annotating i think this is not annotating do you know what this is it's dance notating kind of makes it go a little bit slower but it's much more fun i really need a standing desk here in the attic that's the other upgrade i'm going to make this sitting while live streaming does not work for me all right let's move faster people oh that was a terrible one i really had to go back and do this again like with much greater precision where are we now halfway there people halfway there dance notation what's happening in the chat anything yeah so in the chat there's a little bit of a discussion going on that uh here's a bias of how uh here's a human bias here's an example of human bias see i really need to bring these messages up on the screen so i don't have to read them um but um i'm gonna read this uh dan's fingers are present in each annotation of the cube then the resulting model might not be able to identify a cube lying on a table because it wouldn't be surrounded by fingers exactly so if i wanted to have a very um sort of broadly functional uh model that could recognize and find a rubik's cube in any image this would be a pretty terrible data set because the rubik's cube is only ever present in one environment uh the environment with me in it with this green screen background with my hand holding the rubik's cube so i would want to collect a much more elaborate and varied data set but i would say that one of the things about what i'm doing here which isn't necessarily a problem is my use case might be i want to build something for myself that can find the rubik's cube in my hand when i'm holding it because um and also i have don't have a single example of it without the same color on one side so that's certainly a problem but um i could imagine uh in an interactive uh exhibit for example or some type of uh interactive context where you can really have control over the environment that having that fixed environment in your data set actually uh has a lot of advantages oh this is just not good i just gotta get at least slightly more i probably also don't need 150 so this is kind of maybe a little bit ridiculous what i'm doing but i can't stop now can't stop won't stop oh what is this weird i don't know if this is gonna be a problem but i'm just gonna also all the blurriness i didn't really think of that because i was moving it around a lot and um i mean should i mark it here like should it learn it be able to see it with my hand completely covering it i'm gonna i'm gonna annotate it that way this is this is gonna be an interesting experiment uh and my goal here in many ways is not to do this so that i have a very like a model that's working incredibly well i mostly want to demonstrate this process so that if any of you want to embark on it you might have more time or more sort of clever ways of collecting your data and being more precise about annotating it where are we how are we going 122. boy i feel like i've slowed down by the way having an actual night i'm using a track pad for this which is kind of sad oh did i finish wait what's going on no i don't see the images anymore weird hold on uh let me click here uhoh uh rename export what do i do here edit annotation group boy okay this will be done soon don't worry it only takes about four hours to train them i'm just kidding i'm gonna let it train for as long as i can manage to wait so what's it like to be a machine learning researcher you may ask let me tell you something boy is it exciting ah yes let me move this rectangle here and slide it a little bit over a little bit over here and all right dance notation that's one way of doing it i know i'm getting to the end now i love you rubik's cube you are my baby yeah oh there's more it's got to be the end now right what is going on what was i doing [Laughter] okay come on almost there almost there almost there people all right oh this is probably a bad idea let's give it that some training again okay no rubik's cube no rivets cube no rubik's cube no rubik's cube no rubik's cube no rubik's cube no rooms cube no rooms cube no rooms cube no rubik's cube no rubik's cube never looks cubed everyone's cute no rubbish we are done people close next um i am going to select a pretrained model as the base model for this uh training um i right here we can see i could choose from other models i'm pretty sure the last time i checked this that actually oh no there's also yolo version three tiny interesting i wonder optimized for real time oh interesting i'm imagining using this in real time let's train it with both i'm going to just run this twice i mean i'm going to have this run twice i'm going to set let it go 5000 training steps i might stop it early i'm going to click start training and then i think if i go back to um oh no train and i do object detection again and let's do a rubik's cube um tiny real time question mark it's going to let me use a question mark in my name my experiment take this uh i already have these annotations next let's choose from yolo version three tiny and so now i have both of these going um and we can see them here as my two uh training experiments that are going so let's open this one in one window and oh it didn't it didn't open in a new window what did i click the wrong thing rook's cube i want you to open in a new oh weird it's like that's fine um then let's go to train uh rubik's cube tiny okay so we've got them both going so now i'm at the point and let me just click something here this is really bothering me there we go um wow louise it looks like you joined and you made it into the discord welcome that's so exciting um i i wish i could click your messages to bring them up on the screen look at this glow that's going on here i think it's the leds there so what's gonna happen now i now am letting this run um we can see both of these are running um just to be clear let me let me clarify a little bit about what's happening with runway so nothing besides my browser is actually running on this computer right here the one that i am operating here what i am looking at is a web interface to a set of servers that are runways presumably runways web servers and runways web servers are what are hosting up and showing me the interface and all the status updates and runway additionally has access to um what i'm assuming is a large number of gpu optimized for machine learning cloud servers so one of the the what you're for paying for when you sign up for runway and use runway is ease and efficiency really and in many ways so in theory i have a windows pc over here with a pretty good graphics card maybe i could figure out how to set it up with a training system and cuda and tiny yolo version 4 and all the stuff that i need to just train my model right over here on my own computer um but by having runway have access to a sort of preconfigured and readytogo cloud server with all of the dependencies and configuration settings it needs i'm just upload my files annotate them press a button for training and it's going to run it and then make the finished model available to me so um you could certainly do the same kind of thing also with google colab notebook you know an aws instance spell paper paper space these are other kinds of cloudbased services that have gpuenabled machines that you can do machine learning and other things on a runway is kind of my favorite tool du jour to use and one of the things that is the most exciting about it for me is just this huge library of models that i have access to and these are new actually there's a there's a youtube channel called artificial images i don't know who runs this channel but i've been recently quite tuned into it and it's been using um runway for a lot of things making a data set a walkthrough tutorial so this is all great i really got to check some of this stuff out um and i'm kind of do trying to do some of this kinds of stuff on my channel as well um all right so um what i think i would i'm going to do a couple things here hmm i really messed up so i apologize for this because i'm totally going to ruin everything right now um i'm going to check back on these models in a little while i i have two runway accounts because i want to be able to have an account with runway where i can upload data and do things in runway that are you know with my own private data so to speak i mean i can't i don't really have an example of data that i want to use for the runway that's private right now but i often do this with lots of things i have a separate account which is the one i stray logged into on streaming so i don't buy accident like open my email and that sort of thing um but i messed up and this this shiffman runway account is the one that i intended to be my private account but i'm already training these models i'm not going to uh but i'm going to log out and i'll come back to check on them in a little bit i'm going to go to my coding train one i can't get this right i've done this so many times i don't know oh i know what's going on i also have different logins to this browser and i'm it's fine it's fine everything's gonna be fine talk amongst yourselves do okay so now i'm in my choo choo account and we can see here that i've actually been working with this already um this past week i have some really weird models that i was training this is let's take a look at this one this is not what i meant to like show you um add to workspace what is going on here uh oh wait why do i have workspace work model workspaces what is going on i think runway changes interface my models train hosted this looks different all right i got to create a workspace add to workspace okay fine new workspace uh coding train demos and uh let's just run this model for a second so this model is a style gann model that i just trained off of images of my face looking in different directions wearing different glasses and things like that so um i wanted to um start with a style gan model i probably should just go to the sky gan one which is what i was actually using just to demonstrate the next phase of what i'm going to do which is demonstrate how to use runway beyond just the interface itself and essentially treat it as an api with your own code and any moment now it looks like it's about to spin up it's it's got this model running in the cloud my dan faces style model so just to be clear this is not an actual photo of me this is a stylegan generated version you can see it's uh got some kind of weird aspects to it and i mean i do look kind of like that i was wearing this shirt i was standing in front of a green screen when i collected this data set um and we can actually sort of start to like move around in the latent space of me oh my god so weird what have i done what monster have i created so creating an image synthesis model is one that you can do um and i need to i really need to get my act together and do a whole bunch of sequence video tutorials about this process right now i'm just kind of playing with it but let's move on over to glitch i'm gonna hit stop so uh i believe the current pricing and runway is about like five cents per minute when you're running the model in the cloud um so i'm gonna hit stop so that i don't use up too many of my credits and i am going to go over to this here called runway ml template and i'm going to hit um edit project i wonder if this one's actually running i think i disabled the model let's see actually doesn't look like i disabled it because i think if i disabled the model it would have um are already um it would have already given me an error message so one of the things you can do with runway is once you have a model like this coding train dan faces one um i can go click over here onto network and i can host this model so i've done this kind of stuff previously probably about a year ago and i used the runway desktop software that is still something you can use i really prefer the mic is off um i don't think the mic is off i am seeing everything working just fine so hopefully uh somebody else will tell me and confirm i think the microsoft i'd be getting a lot more messages um i'm gonna click host this model and i'm gonna host this model and now i have a list of all of my hosted models aha this is the one that i am actually using with this code sky gan the sky gan model and this model will you will see in a moment where am i going here uh generate uh images of the sky so this is a style gan model that's been trained on many many many uh images of the sky and one of the things you'll notice ah there we go look at this daily limit reached so you can all go to this url runway dash mltemplate and you will not be able to generate your own sky because when you do generate a sky it costs me but i actually have some free credits so i'm not paying for any of this right now but it the actual cost the runway cost is one cent per request so i in this template that i've built i have built into it this json file which always saves the current number of requests and i have also placed into this.env file which i don't want to show you right now just hold on a second going to zoom in on it like this for a second um where one of the properties of the dot env file in addition to the tokens which i will show you in a moment so i can regenerate them is the daily limit so i'm going to change this daily limit to 100 right now that should restart the glitch web application i realize i'm jumping right into the middle of a project with lots of pieces and things leading up to it that you might not be familiar with that's okay bear with me um ask your questions join the discord to get help um and i could see that peter is here in the chat hi peter nice to see you um and let me come back to here and now i should be able to go back to my web application and we can already see the count is at 18. let's see if i generate one it's gonna it's gonna run out it's gonna run out of its daily limit uh we've just collectively spent a dollar on generating sky images together so the reason why i've built this in is for uh a number of different reasons but um one is just to like have a protection layer a sort of rate limiting it's not something that the runway interface currently has as a feature but i've built it into this template um so what i would like to show you how to do is how to create your own uh web application where your p5.js or any other javascript html css code communicates and works with runway and ultimately i'm going to do that with the object detection model that i'm currently cooking um here in my machine learning oven and my machine learning oven is somewhere in the cloud i mean it's an underground bunker if we're being honest here it's the server is likely not actually floating in the sky with rainbows and birds tweeting about that would be nice though so um so what's next um so let's look at this code for a second and um um and and by look at this code let me go back to here so in the runway interface i could also by the way just turn off the model that's another way for me to make sure you can see i've had 1 399 requests on this model to date having used it so i could click this uh code snippet here and what you would see is that there is a javascript library a runway hosted models library that allows me oh there's my token i didn't i've sort of forgotten i'm not showing you the token why is my key so off is it really the um these leds hold on i don't know why my key has been actually really good recently maybe because the my lights are so much brighter i guess that made it a little bit better i turned the uh those leds off um max is that the max that i know who's in the chat i think it might be um hi max i'm all nervous max is watching um anyway back to my back to what i was looking at here so uh now you all have my token oh boy let's just let's quickly i just realized let's quickly disable that model the request didn't go up so you could written your own code very quickly with that token if you could have copied it out and put it into your code but looking at that code snippet again then the idea is i can create a runway hosted model object with a url to the model uh token is i heard a weird noise like it was the cat it's the cat all right i really wish the cat would come and say hello um i forgot what truncation is we can look it up in the runway interface i can query the model i can get an image back this is what i'm actually doing in my code however it's actually going to look a little bit different because if and i could just paste this right i've done this i could paste this right into the p5 web editor copy paste that put in the p5 web editor run it have my style get example working up and running immediately it's awesome but what would be the problem is my model url and my model token would be there right in the code and anyone on that web page could grab those and i want to keep those secure so what i have done here with this uh runway ml template and in theory you can use it by only ever using this server.js file i'm not sorry but you had to use the other stuff too but you could work with this without having to write your own server but i have a server a node server that's actually doing the runway communication and you'll notice in the code when i create the runway model by the way does anybody does anybody know this is i think it's i don't know what the equivalent family friendly thing of a drinking game is but yes i put a quarter in the jar every time i show my api tokens on a stream but you can see here i'm calling on process.env runway url runway token which means the code itself does not actually have the token in it instead i'm having like a crazy deja vu because literally recording a video tutorial on this yesterday that will go with my discord bot series but instead the the keys are stored in that dot env file you can see that little heart key thing this is something that only i or other you know uh um approved editors to this project can see so if you were to go remix this project like this code is open source you can go to the url to it i'll paste it in in the discord i believe if i go you know you guys can all confirm this to me and go back to our discord where did discord go um in the live channel links channel and just paste it here so you can grab that url go there you'll see all the code but when you go to the dot env file it will be empty because i'm not packaging that up with the example so that's a really convenient and this is not unique to glitch this is a common sort of standard for how to save um you know secret important information in environment variables across different web applications okay so what i what i want to show you here is let's look at the actual p5 code does anybody know by the way how to increase the font size in the p5 and the glitch web editor i have not been able to figure out how to do this i know i could zoom the web page but it like grows everything which kind of makes me a little bit crazy but i'll just do that for right now look at all you nice people popping up anonymous anonymous who are you who are you watching i know max is watching and peter and klaus and stray and seon and shrey shrey is watching it twice are you two people but um all the rest of you are just these anonymous little smiley faces hi anonymous little smiley faces i love you all what time i said it was gonna be five well we'll see we'll see so here's here's what i'm trying the code is quite simple on the client side and i'm rather than programming this whole thing i'm just going to talk you through it and then i'm going to make some new version i'm going to remix it and make some new versions of it to do other things so one is i'm creating a canvas it's a 640x480 i'm creating a button that button called generate right we can see all this here canvas the generate button this is all p5 code for manipulating a canvas and dom elements it's not your sort of traditional uh javascript but it's the way i like to work with the p5 creative coding environment um i'm making this sort of span um dom element because i want to show the count that's rather unnecessary but um you know we got to tally all the votes uh i mean um count all of our requests to the uh to the runway server and then when i press the mouse this function send vector is called it's the callback to the mouse pressed event on the generate button so what's going on in that function well every model in runway and if i go back to browse models and i search for sky gan and i come up to it and let's just add it to create why do i need to create a new workspace isn't there shouldn't it like add to my existing workspace where here's my model workspace i'm so confused uh i'm just not going to worry about this something is going on somebody will teach me how to use runway by the way there's a slack for runway and somebody should i'm almost taking notes so i give all this feedback to them um so i don't know codingtrain2 i don't know why i have more than one workspace was i in my other account i don't think so yeah where's the other workspace so strange um but with every single model where does inference know where what am i looking at view i think i want to look at here i want to look at where it shows me the sort of specs the model the inputs and the outputs and i'm probably all saying this and this is this always happens to me where you're all saying how to do this in the chat and i'm just completely incapable of seeing it my models no model workspace yes all right well i know what it is and it's telling me right here uh vector so um the inputs to this particular model are vector oh i'm gonna have to make a whole video about this i've talked about this before i don't wanna get into the weeds of this right now but uh in an image in an image classification uh context the inputs to the machine learning model would be the image the outputs would be the labels here something this is a generative model so the inputs is actually really just like a bucket of numbers uh like a noise that's like a list of noise and that list of noises the signature that signature input which will generate a particular image so that's what i'm doing um in my uh code wherever that was where i am i know the expectation for uh stylegan is to receive 512 uh input values a vector of 512 numbers i think an appropriate range is between negative one and one but i'm not entirely sure and so i make the inputs with the z is often referred to as the z vector or the or the latent vector is another term for this and then i don't see the runway code anymore the reason is i'm actually going to send the vector to my own server the server is essentially middleware is that the right term it is really just its job is just to like pass the football pass the baton that's a better metaphor i think it's a relay race the runner is running up with its vector it's passing the baton to the server who's gonna run it all the way to runway the server is really secure i mean it's not that secure to be honest but it's it's much more secure i'm sure there's the security flaws in what i'm doing but it is secure in the sense that it's got the sort of secret keys to talk to runway so you can see i'm using the javascript fetch function my endpoint on my own api that i've basically written to that node server is called runway so and then uh the server's keeping track of the count and if it's reached its limit it'll just log the daily room it was the daily limit was reached otherwise it returns the outputs from the model and that's an image which i can generate and draw so this is looks this is identical the way i've set this template up is if you send the inputs to the node server's runway ml endpoint that node server if i look all the way down here will take the body of that request as inputs and then call await model.query so this is the actual runway call and if it comes back and works um it sets a status to success and returns the outputs otherwise i'm just keeping track of this count right this is my like highly advanced rate limiting methodology i have a variable which is literally a count and as it goes up if it goes above some threshold which is defined here in the environment variables you can see by the way here's the url and the token um in the in the environment variables uh if it reaches that uh account um it is what's it trying to say then it just sends back it doesn't actually query the model and i also i'm doing um i also put made an endpoint to just like check the count so for example i think that if i do slash count here you can see that um it's at 100 and if i went back to here and i went the count is also being stored in this json file i don't know why it says five there something funny happens with me with glitch i don't really get it when you're writing to text files or json files the browser doesn't always like refresh the latest contents but if i set that to zero and it'll it'll like save it and then go back to here oh and my app went to sleep i thought i had by the way i have a glitch pro account i thought i boosted this but you can see now the count is zero and then this won't actually work right now because i think i have to say i disabled the model but you get that's the entire story uh um so let's see and right so protecting it by an ip there's a variety of other ways you could protect it also let's see here um what questions do you have about this let's check our models that are cooking i'm going to go this is so ridiculous what i've done here by using two runway accounts let's log out and let's log into my other runway account this is not a necessary thing for you to do go under train and uh let's check these models let's see the this one is 46 percent done and this one is 28 done let's take a look at the one that's 46 done so you can see here um what what's what i love about the runway interface is it's actually showing me its progress while it's training so it's running a bunch of training images through the model this is not showing me my annotations right this is showing me its guess based on the current state of the model based on the current step and if i go back we can look at step 1200 600 you know all the way back to one foot right this was early in the training process it was finding the rubik's cube everywhere and around step 750 it sort of found it in two places it's getting more and more accurate and you know i might venture to say that i can stop this from training because it's done but this is the sort of like metric this map metric which is mean average precision a measure of a performance of an object detection model it summarizes both the position how many of the predicted bounding boxes correspond to the true bounding boxes as well as its recall which measures how many of the true bounding boxes have been correctly predicted by the model so i would like to see this at a hundred percent um we can look through all the different example images this is probably good enough for me to try running it in my own application right now but let's let it train a little bit more and i'm pretty happy with how tiny yolo is working so since that is a faster smaller model it's probably the one i'll want to use i wonder if this is something i believe tiny yolo is compatible with javascript and i wonder if this is something that runway i mean i realized the business model here is to use their cloud servers but i wonder if there is a possibility of doing like an export to javascript so i could download a sort of like local i think you can download any mod it does let you download any model that you've trained so you can work with it locally but i would what i would like to download is a javascript compatible one okay that was confusing as hell right nitrous oxide apologies i don't know which part was confusing but um you know i'm kind of just bouncing around between a lot of different things so i recognize that this could be confusing all right so we've got some nonanonymous people welcome welcome to this glitch application so what do i one of the things that i've been wanting to make as an example for my course um and i'm going to go back this is very ridiculous what i'm doing here um i'm going to i can't believe this is what i'm doing but it's too late for me i'll log into this one and i'm going to look for models i want to look for a particular model called spade uh spade landscapes so this is an image uh segmentation model which will allow me to like it says generate realistic images of landscapes from sketches and doodles let's take a look at this one and why see it's me asking me to make a new workspace again i don't get it i don't get it uh coding train three electric boogaloo okay um now we're in this model i'm going to choose an input source which will be a segmentation and i'm going to run this model so runway again one of the reasons why i love using runway is i can just immediately play around and see how the model works before trying to build it into my own application so let's look at how this model works while it's booting up this is an image segmentation model what does that mean usually an image segmentation model is for doing the inverse of what i'm about to do we can see this in let's see if i go to ml5 and look at body picks for example this is an image segmentation model actually let's look at um unet i'm just curious about this one um let's go here really quickly and see if i can grab one of the examples and i'm just curious to see if this works i haven't run this one in a while ah open broadcast studio virtual camera uh so frustrating here when i uh let me just let me just search uh body pics so this is what image segmentation typically does it takes the as the input the image and labels different pixels of the image as part of a given segment so in the body pics model it's able to recognize the human form and label different parts as torso green maybe thigh as purple right thigh left thigh head and sort of segment the image that way and you could use that for a variety of different creative applications that i'm sure are swimming around in your head right now what i love about the inverse of that for example if i come back to this particular image segmentation model is that it's doing the reverse it's this is a generative model it's generating an image and i am providing the segments via a color map so i'm going to create a scene oh this is like perfect for doing like like a bob ross like pseudo fake i should really set that up and just have like a little wig and a little like thing that i can paint colors on and have it generate the landscape for me this is great that'll that'll be next halloween or april fool's day but i can sort of paint over here because this is where the grass should be and you can see it's starting to generate this image below then i'm going to add a river that's going to flow like through here i don't know if this makes sense let's add a river i don't know that's very weird what i'm doing let's draw some trees some trees here and some clouds in the sky and there we go oh look at my beautiful landscape i am such an artiste um so what i have done with this model um is i have generated this image from this segment map so this is fun to play around with runway and um if this is all i want to do then great but what if i wanted to create my own p5.js sketch or processing sketch or other type of app software application where the uh the segment map is the segmentation map is generated a different way i actually what i want to do right now is just recreate exactly this so i want to go look at that glitch template and recreate exactly this interaction but with the with my own code so first i'm going to hit stop then i'm going to go to well actually one thing i really want to do is click this export colors because i really need to get the colors right so let's click um export colors um and it came in as an uh csv so i'll take a look at that um in a moment let's just put that over there whoops how come you didn't show up over here where are you colors um and i'll find that later let's go to um whoops let's host this model and host the model i'm going to have to not show you my api keys to turn this one off just i don't need that one on i'm going to go here so now i want how do you do this in runway if this is my project i think i can still do remix so i'm going to re i'm going to show you the process of starting with my template and remixing it so i'm going to hit remix and then this will be and ideally my goal here is to create like many many many examples in glitch of working with different models in runway um so i'm going to call this a spade coding train oh that's a coco ding train yeah it's got to have the choo choo on there this is everything here we go right no put a little dash there there we go this is like the best name of any glitch project ever spade coco ding train uh now i'm going to hit and look at this so i should be going to the env files and nothing is there so just to be safe and secure i'm going to make my daily limit 5 to make sure that as i start putting this in there if my token goes out into the wild or the url this project goes out into the wild i'll i'll have some protections it's fine let's just make it 100. um and then the server i'm suggesting doesn't need to change the server is totally generic as long as i send my request to the runway ml endpoint on the server the inputs come in go to the model the outputs go out so i just want to work on my p5 code so here i am in sketch.js um this is and i need to do this differently so very quickly um let's not worry about runway for a second this image should be send uh it should it should be called send image because i am not sending a vector the input to spade cocoa is an image oh yeah okay so um i'm going to take i'm not going to worry about this just yet so let's actually comment all this out just for the time being um and let's uh let's look at this in a new window failed to start there's an error in my project right the error in the project which i can see here by going probably under tools under logs is that there is no um valid token so hold on hold off on that i will i'll put the token in in a little bit and what i want to do here is instead let's say background 255 function draw i'm gonna say uh ellipse i'm gonna make this in the simplest way if mouse is pressed ellipse mouse x mouse y uh 32. so obviously i would probably in the sort of fantasy way of doing this i would want to create a whole drawing interface where i can select colors and change the size i'm not going to do any of that right now i just want to see uh it draw and let me get one of the colors so if i go to the desktop and i think this is the colors can i open this with i don't know what um visual studio code can i actually just bring this in to like assets well no i don't want to open numbers are you insane uh great so here we go so let's start with sky which is this color um and i i could lo i would want to load from this file and make this much fancier but again i'm doing the quickest hello world version of this i can think no stroke a fill and just use that hex color and by the way i i think there's a way to disable these but because of the weirdness of p5 and how it uses the global namespace for its functions glitch always thinks these are errors nobody knows how to just like tell glitch to stop um that would be good i copied the html code into the style.css file i certainly did when did i do that it's so weird is that like in all of the in my template i did that let's just take that out i don't know why what what happened there that was very weird um so the glitch app is attempting to wake up but i'm gonna need those api keys so let's let's go so what i'm actually i think i'm going to go back to hosted models runway and i'm going to grab if i click on this it's going to copy the api key to the clipboard oops sorry i'm missing i'm going to go back to this view and i'm going to right now i'm going to attempt to put the api key into the uh runway i'm into the env file without you seeing it let's get the model url just so i stopped getting those errors so i've got the model url and the token and i'm going back to my code and that is now done and i can show it to you again all right so i have put the api keys into the dot env file um and uh now i should see this send vector is not defined where did i put send vector in send image send oh whoops right so let's also comment this out great so now so now i can draw just by i i can only draw one color and i can only um go and draw one color and i can only um draw one color and one thickness sorry what was the other part ah i'm getting tired it's five o'clock we're going to do this then the object detection model oh i was going to do commute i gotta do some community contributions yeah um so okay next let me rethink this a little bit i'm gonna make the background that color so the background will already be sky and then i think i'll just try to draw clouds so if i go look at the assets where did i upload that oh no it's here um clouds oh clouds is just this so let's just try it with sky and i'm drawing although let's try c i'm just curious here let's try c um so if i say fill here and now it's going to default with and i can draw excuse me the c down here coming back let's make this a little bit bigger just so i can do it more quickly great now what do i need to do i need to send the and i what i want to show you is going to leak my keys again but that's fine i'll regenerate them i need to adjust this code so the first thing that i need to do is get the image in a format that i can use to send to runway and the way that i will do that is by turning it into a base64 encoding of that image so how does that work i am going to say image64 equals canvas you need to make a variable to store the canvas when and what happened all the red dots went away i talked about it they disappeared did somebody do something to make that happen what is going on oh my goodness ah okay so simon is clarifying thank you simon for this my use of language here i'm talking about image segmentation models and then i was saying what we're doing really is the inverse of it and there actually there is a specific name for that it's called a reverse image segmentation model thank you for that um clarification um so uh imagecanvas.elt so let's talk about what's going on here canvas is a variable that's holding on to a p5 canvas object the p5 canvas object is a wrapper of the native javascript browser canvas dom element that happens to exist in the dot elt property and then i should be able to say to data url is that the right name of the function let's look this up to data url javascript yeah so the to data url function returns a data uri containing a representative of the image into the format specified by the type parameter defaults to png so there's a lot of ways i could configure this but this particular function is what i want to turn the image essentially into a string now it seems like a crazy thing when i turn the image into a string i think i've talked about this in some of my video tutorials but this makes it very convenient to pass it over a uh a post request to send it to a web server um okay so now where was i here so did i get the name of the function right ah i didn't actually it's to data url with capital url so that would go here and let's just this is a little bit ridiculous for me to do this but let's just console.log it so we can see if this works i'll paint a little bit hit generate and there it is this is the entire image encoded as a base64 string of characters um so now if i go back to here i don't want to console.log that i want to create my post request and the inputs are now this is what i need to look up in runway i don't recall what the inputs are i know it's the image it's probably something like this is probably what i send it but i'm not entirely sure i need to look it up in runway but it's going to show my api token so i don't mind i'm going to show you how to do it with showing your api token and then quickly regenerate your api token so first i'm going to do is i'm going to disable the model so it's not active then i'm going to click on view the code snippet and that's where it's showing my api key and i can see the input says ah it's called semantic map so what i'm sending is something called a semantic map and then the property the value that's the property name the value is a base64 image so um let us how do i do the regenerate the token edit right down here so this is me regenerating the api key which i'm going to do and i'm not going to let you see the regenerated one i'm going to copy it i'm going to put it into my env file the new token is there go back to sketch.js where am i where am i where am i let's turn i can come back to show you let's turn the model back on activate it um and uh this is supposed to be now we remember a semantic map so that's semantic map and send it to runway uh wait for the res outputs and i don't let's just look at console log outputs okay so i'm going to look at the output that comes back let's refresh this page hit generate sending the image now it'll probably take quite some time for oh it came back look there we go i have an output which is guess what a base64 encoded image status success and the count is going up so i can go back to the code and i can now um put this stuff back in um the outputs it wasn't well what was it called was it it wasn't called image was it so weird um why do i have an error now oh i have two things called image 64. uh input image 64. 764. let's call it that that's why i'll just leave this one this you know i'll just rename this variable to landscape because why not um and then i forgot what it's daily limit reached come on people have a little pity on me here come on you don't don't you want to bring generated landscape imagery out into the world in a way that we can all enjoy um i am going to against my better judgment go to here set this back to zero and try to beat everybody great so oh it's so this is this is something this is another bit of feedback for the for those of you who are taking notes it's weird that the property is called output here and in skygen it was called image like i feel like that would make sense for that to be pretty consistent across runway models so i wouldn't have to keep changing it for every example um so but here under sketch.js i'm going to call this now outputs dot output and the this is a spade coco generated a landscape and let's try this one more time i need to refresh the page oh there we got it look at this that's my generated sky let's draw some ocean on it and try to be faster than all of you people and there's the ocean oh this is so cool and i'm at eight thank you people please please all right um i guess what i'll do just to shut it off for a minute here um so this is why i should run this stuff locally so only i could run it and then deploy it to glitch but so i want to do something now i want to change the code i want um i want to make a variable called output image and that is going to be output image dot create image blank so i want to create an image dom element that's sitting below the canvas and then rather than make a new one here i just want to take the existing one let me put the alt text in hopefully this works i have not tried to do this before um let's put this in here and i think i can say like output image dot elt dot source equals image 64. right this would be setting the source of the image to that base64 encoding which would make it appear in the drum element i think is that right does anybody know uh um cannot read property create image of undefined oh equals create image okay all right so now all right i've disabled it if you could please hold off on running this for a moment i guess i could make it a private project but i think um let's see if this works great and then if i do this it generate uh daily limit reach come on people we're gonna use this isn't even a sponsored live stream i'm using up all my credits i don't even know um all right back over here i'm gonna be doing my object my model detection my sorry my um my object detection example i'm gonna be doing that locally you won't be able to see it uh i just want to see if i can get i want to see if it'll replace it with the new one all right so that works now if i do this and hit generate again great awesome it's working shutting you down people all right so this works now that it's going to always update this one and maybe i don't need 640 by 480 just to be able to see it um what i'm going to do now is have it update uh as i'm drawing so this is going to use a lot of requests and this is where i would want probably more like a socket connection or something to the model but let's just sort of see um let's see what happens here so if i go back to sketch.js and then essentially this send image function i am going to call it recursively i am going to call it immediately when the program starts and then every time after i've updated the image i'm going to call send image again and let's see let me set the count back down to zero let me turn the model back on to activate it and now it should be updating um as i draw so i didn't pick like really smart colors here but you can see here as i'm drawing it's updating below and i should obviously turn this off um i should certainly um what am i saying i should certainly like so there's lots more next steps to this but i just wanted to save this as a basic um example and i'm realizing here also this should say spade spade coco p5.js example i think actually i should publish the example with the generate button so i just want to i just want to clean i wanted to show you how it worked to do it continuously but i'm going to take that out i'm going to take this out i'm going to take this out and um i just want to leave this let's what would happen if i made this 320 by 240 would it still work just as well so i think it would just sort of be easier to see um uh yeah actually so this should i it should do this first because i do want to see that always filled up let's turn this back on um let's go to the server and i'm gonna set the count to one whatever it may be and now let's just see if this is working again it's weird why why is that why isn't it why won't it put the image next to it well whatever so now if i draw here and click generate there we go great and i can turn it off all right this example is finished thank you for watching what was the thing that i wanted to fix here oh i don't think i need the console log um here right now okay all right so this you can use um as an example to um work with a runway all right um let's take a look at our i really gotta do let's do some community contributions it's 5 20. i got to finish up here going to be done soon um uh okay hey everybody it's time it's quite late in this stream usually i try to do this at the beginning it's a nice way to start off and say hello to the community and people watching the coding train but i it's very important to me that every live stream i show some of you work because you the people of the coding train are what power the train itself you are the engine that produces the steam that drives the train uh so let's go on over to our discord and i am going to type in the wheel command and what happened what happened to the wheel what happened to the wheel i think the stream chat bot is down oh it's because we can find it it's right up here so here's the wheel of community contributions um thank you to david and oh um king over here on the uh i forgot the user's name who did some of these new features um let's spin the wheel so this pulls from some of the contributions that are on the website um and ultimate didn't we look at ultimate tictactoe i kind of remember looking at this one already am i wrong about that uh i looked we looked at this one yeah well did we i really haven't remember i looked at somebody's ultimate sec tick toe but this now looks unfamiliar to me let's move this over by the way so i'm not in front of it so much also i like to see my friendly masked sun there um where where were we here okay so take turns playing on the highlighted board however you move determines where your opponent will place their next move the first player concord board claims that board right ultimate tictactoe is playing mini games of tictactoe inside a larger tictactoe board oh i see i don't really know what's going on here but this is really cool wait why does it switch so i'm playing both players oh you don't put you do one board at a time it just does a random one next so you each get a turn in one cell and then you get a turn in oh oh it it goes around randomly so like you really have an advantage if you get lucky right like this is just luck now oh who's going to win i'm playing against myself i'm rooting for o i think o is just friend more friendly looking than um x come on oh you can do it place your bets people place your bets wait oh x gets to go again shouldn't this square be done oh it's got to go here oh it's going to go here all right oh looking good oh uh oh yeah this one's already done where am i now oh x next gonna block o where are we now here here x i must finish this must finish um it's not random i'm being told uh interesting but o has a good spot oh where where am i now here x is going to go there oh can i get three in a row like that probably not right uh oh where where am i now here x oh yeah come on oh you can do it so don't tell me the logic of which one the game ends when three oh a move yeah someone tell me the logic of which one it picks i'm curious um where are we where are we oh x is doing really well whoever wins this down here oh didn't oh just win didn't oh just win oh no x had already won that one it's very i'm very confused uh okay wait wait wait and now i'm i'm lost people uh oh is it over i'm so confused what happened oh there's no o can go maybe wherever it wants yeah okay now it's over right yeah oh one thank you this is pretty cool i think like i'm like two hours into a live stream my brain is like nonfunctioning suppose you okay the square you select in the mini board determines which mini board the next player will play in oh can you start a new game and let the chat play it'll be havoc to read but it'll be fun for us says adrian this is an excellent suggestion however um i don't have a mechanism for um doing that so i think i'm this is really wonderful i apologize to the creator of this for me being um the brain dead person that i am amrit ammar um that i did not understand the logic here also i'm playing against myself so who knows what i would have done with that logic but now it makes sense to me that there is sort of like a meta strategy inside the regular tictactoe strategy which is really interesting to think about i would love for it to i think some of the color choices are could be more evident and you might be able to use like a fill even also to like highlight the active square i'm often confused like you know something to like separate the individual three by three tiles might be helpful so i think there are some visual augmentations you could make here to make the sort of like the distinctive areas and and the sort of interactions more clear um but um this is a fantastic project ding the bell ring the train whistle and let's move on to uh look at one more spin that wheel well there's a lot of tictactoe ones coming up today resizable tictactoe let's look at this one resizable tictactoe pvsp click oh this one i did look at i definitely remember this one right this one we've looked at before so one of the things we need to do one of the things i would like to do hi code guppy again welcome thank you code guppy a member of the coding train um so um thank you code guppy all right now um well i we looked at this so one of the things that i really would like to do is make some improvements and advancements in this sort of community contribution sharing system uh the wheel is great i think there's probably some nice design upgrades we could do with it um having a sort of a database or an api that keeps track of what i've shown or kind of like tries to um highlight people who haven't had their things shown i know there's a lot more that can be done with it so apologies apologies for skipping that one but i'm really sure that i looked at that one before in a previous so let's let's spin the wheel and look at one more yeah this one i also we also did look at because i remember that raycasting was spelled wrong ray casing with pie game so i'm just gonna double check and confirm but i i have a very yeah i have a very specific memory that this one came up already let's like refresh the wheel entirely to get 10 new selections and spin that wheel i think we need some music to bring us better luck and guess what everybody the coding train is brought to you today by tictactoe it's a simple game fun to play for all the family and yet it seems to be what everyone is so let's take a look at it by gamer5000 raw gamer 5000. i'm mispronouncing your name on purpose okay uh we can change the size and we can play look at this it's cool so much tictactoe i love how you can do this in real time it'd be interesting to think about if you would started to play it and um you resized it and it kept what you had played so far like you're sort of zooming out let's see let's see if there's any interesting thing that happens when you win animating the line drawing yeah welcome to the tictactoe coding channel youtube channel where every week we talk about the game tictactoe how do you play it what does it mean where did you come from who loves tictactoe more than me nobody yes all right one more one more one more that was a little weird that like yes that i did that was that made me uncomfortable i hope you're doing all right oh it's the editable game of life remember the editable the edible game of life all right we looked at that last week we've got um 10 print i'm excited for this a web 10 print is one of my favorite coding challenges that people contribute to um just to look at it briefly it's this coding challenge um it's actually i don't i don't know if anyone broke the record but this is one has so many contributions it's a really really simple uh system of drawing uh one of two possible lines in a grid that's famously from this one line commodore 64 program um if you're not familiar i think if i just go to tenprint.org with this book by this collection of wonderful authors all about the sort of like history of it's really in a way it's like looking at the history of creative computing through the lens of this one line of code highly recommend this wonderful book let's take a look at this particular version of it by near b oh this is cool this is interesting so at first i thought huh this looks to me like it is essentially um identical to the original 10 print challenge and i was about to say that's wonderful there's no reason why anybody shouldn't feel free to submit their own version of basically the exact same thing and getting it working however there's something quite different here and i i now have a very clear picture in my head of what i am assuming is going on here but i'm curious to let to see if the chat um you know i know you're about 30 seconds behind me here so i'll have to sort of vamp for a second but if anyone in the chat wants to try to make a guess as to what is going on here why how is this different from the the example if i just go back to it again if i just look at my particular example which is this from the actual video itself looks very similar but there is a different quality to it let's refresh this just to see it again so zork master says i feel like that's using some sort of noise that's my thought exactly too so i'm assuming that what this is doing is it's mapping the probability or not just mapping the probability it's picking the left line or right line or the whichever direction the line is going based off of most likely some purlin noise like algorithm rather than pure randomness so in pure randomness and if i one thing we can do that's nice if i go to full here um we can see um i can quickly click over to look at the code and you can see noise x off y off so very quickly it's you can see how it's i'm checking to see if the value is less than 50 or greater than 50. so just to demonstrate this more clearly if i were to replace that with a random number between 0 and 100 that's what we'll get oh but also the line has a different um it looks to me like it's always brighter when pointing to the right is it tying its stroke also to the noise value or the random value in this case that's really interesting i didn't think of that so those are the looks like the two changes if i if i take that out we can see here this is the original 10 print code but by changing it to uh using uh a noise algorithm over a two dimensional space and then additionally and i already like um got rid of that but additionally changing the sort of um the weight of the stroke weight of the line or actually it's not the stroke weight it's the the brightness of the line that's those are really clever um adjustments to maker there's so there's so many rich and deep possible kinds of things you could do with this one algorithm that's just ah i love it so much okay uh unoriginal pun has woken up in um australia is that right where are you located on original pond welcome to uh the live stream i am going to have some water here and i'm removing myself we are finishing up here but um i'm gonna do one more thing before we go so let us go back to the rubik's cube um i need to sign out of runway here and go back to this account because i'm a lunatic the uh rubik the tiny one completed you can see oh the other one is at 97 so we could compare and contrast these but let's look at this one so this one uh trained completed let's add it to the workspace um we're going to call this coding train demo i'm going to i'm going to give myself a lot more space here i'm going to just test it out here in the browser with camera then i can select the actual webcam here um let's run the model and wait for it to pop up here and see how well this goes this is exciting okinawa oh unoriginal pun i have got to get in touch with you i knew there was some reason why okinawa japan was in my head okay we'll be in touch on discord i've got i've got to speak to you about okinawa japan all right let's see so this is what i was told this was happening to me the other day this i'm told is a bug in the runway interface the fact that it is uh flickering back and forth to the edge so this means i've really got to do it on my own unfortunately i cannot abide by people um um going to the the url of the glitch project in real time i suppose i could like go to full screen and glitch or like this and then you can't see the or maybe what let's do it this way this is kind of cruel of me but um or i could just i could just develop i'm going to develop this locally can't i just like i can clone a glitch project right so if i go back to this will be good good for us to know how to do when i have to sneeze so badly right now i'm going to mute the mic oh that was the most amazing sneeze of my whole life do i have a box of kleenex up here somewhere in the attic i can reach the ceiling a nice tin ceiling here in the attic i don't have a box of kleenex i think i'll be all right for just a few minutes um whoa what happened the camera is doing some crazy adjust color adjusting here all right so um let's go back to the runway template now there is a way if i go to edit project how do i get the um the github url of a project somebody will somebody will know this and tell me in the chat tools custom domains import import export here he is git url so that's where it is by the way under um tools custom sorry under tools import export get url so let's go back to terminal here um let's see if we can clone it so i'm going to develop this locally just because i want to like keep the key not i don't think i can keep the key secure but i don't want to like use up a zillion requests to um the runway uh library and i just want to um be able to operate it just myself i think you'll all understand why okay so what's it called now runway ml template perfect um let's open up the code so here it is i need to make a dot env file and if i look in here the things that i need are i i can kind of not worry about the daily limit right now so i'll just make it a thousand so that i kind of have something in there um i need to get a where do i create the model how come i don't see this i'm so blind there it is runway url runway url equals and runway token so let's go to runway and um close all this stuff oh stop there i was using up some credits there just running it let's do network let's host this model uh host model and i'm going to get the api key actually let me where do i have i wanted to just sort of test it with sky gan let me just test this with sky gan just to make sure it's working where do i go model workspace back to models sky gan sky gan network host this model host this model so i am going to grab the model url put it in the url then i'm going to grab the token the api no the api the api key i don't know why i call it runway token i guess that makes sense it's an api key i'm going to remove my screen paste it in hit save hit close and come back so i believe now if i were to uh run this whoops uh oh i guess i need to do npm install to install the node modules run the server nope writing out count not a number what's going on here count 100 writing out count not a number check day oh i forgot about this whole check day thing this is weird i mean i don't really care about this right now so i'm just going to comment this out i don't know why that's not working i have a thing that i wrote that it resets the count every day so my rate limiting is like 100 requests per day but i'm just going to like comment this out because i don't really need to worry about the rate limiting right now the url provide is not your hosted model must be in the format i think i did something wrong with getting the hosted model so hold on people uh going back to here looking at my.env file oh i know what the problem is i know what the problem is nobody has actually did i actually figured out before the chat did oh how exciting so um let me close the dot in via file so here's the problem the problem is that like loading the uh information from the dot env file works out of the box on glitch glitch is set up to know about it automatically but i need to use the dot env package then only the dot env file will only be loaded if i require the the npm package.env and call the config function so i should say node npm i dot env so i have that now and now i should be able to say node server what's this shrink wrap thing okay great so the app is going and it's listening on port i guess i why did it why did it pick that port i guess there's some weird things i have to change when i'm doing this locally uh process.env port oh um well i want to put this in the env file but i have to every time i look at the emv file it's like danger danger will robinson um port i'll just do three thousand um close that and okay so i should be able to go to localhost 3000 and click generate oh it's doing it already let's make sure this works great i got my sky gan and look at this the count is just going up by one each time because nobody else can run this but all right so let's now change this over to using the object detection model um so i am going to go to my p5 sketch i am going to say let video video equals create cap create capture video then uh video dot hide function draw image video zero zero and uh width height so let's not worry about send vector or uh calling that right now or the oh i'm gonna keep the generate button in there right now okay allow and of course we have the obs virtual camera i will switch this i can just do it like this why i have to do this always and forever okay i've got my video showing up there next up we've done this is all the same that i already did i should go grab actually i'm going to do that let's go back to the glitch project that i was working on spade coco choo choo coatings spade coco um let's grab this this is a much better function for me to use um as my basis um now i don't know i don't believe it's called semantic map my guess is it's called image and what's coming back is not an image so i can get rid of that let's take a look at what comes back so i'm just guessing that this is what i'm supposed to send to runway the other thing i need to do of course is go to my hosted models and check and get the rubik's cube url now i've got to go back to my.env file again sorry everybody i'm going to the dot env file dot env file now i'm going back to runway and i'm getting the api key i'm putting the api key in my.env file there it is and now i am going back to sketch.js closing the dot env file excellent and i think i should be able to say let's do let's create button like uh detect let's call this object detect and then call this object detect so i'm not 100 sure this is all correct but in theory when i press the button it'll send the image of the video uh to runway the server node server will manage that and give me back the outputs which presumably would have the label of the thing it found the xy width height let's see so i need to go to here hit refresh let's hold this up ah cannot read property to your data url of undefined i guess i didn't check what i was doing here what am i reading uh canvas so actually this should be the video i want to take the video uh and and turn that into a data url and send it so this is a case where i don't want to send the canvas so hopefully that's all i needed to do there's an error to drill could not be function ah you know what it is video canvas and i probably have to say video load pixels i think in order to turn it into a data url i need to not look at the dom element but the canvas associated with the dom element that has the pixel data loaded on it i think we'll find out i'll try it without load pixels in a second detect okay wow it froze everything up that's weird and shouldn't say like console log not saying console log sending image hmm let's check one of the things that you should always check when you're doing this is is the model awake or asleep this is weird that the model is not waking it should be turning yellow here all right let's let me double check what it's looking for um let me double check what it's looking for so i'm going to switch back to just showing me because when i look at the runway example code it has the api key in it image threshold i also need a threshold so i'm just going to show this to you without the api key visible so in runway the inputs are the image the base64 image as well as a threshold i would assume it's using a default threshold and then i should get back bounding boxes categories and scores so let me make sure everything is right here let me make sure the url and the token is correct in the dot env file yeah looks absolutely looks right um server let's console.logs is there any error in the server i didn't actually check oh the requests are going through i i know i need to show you my screen but why i'm kind of confused because this should show it as waking up ooh sky gan is waking up because somebody's running that glitch application i should turn this one off uh that's not the one that i'm using right now um let's go here and you know maybe i just need to also add threshold 0.5 let's try that threshold 0.5 and let's make sure that base64 image is actually working properly it just got stuck there okay froze so that's definitely a base64 image where did it get stuck though i don't log understanding images oh i got an error here the model experienced an error while processing your input double check that you are sending properly formed input parameters hosted model.info method so let's do that boy this was this was this is supposed to be the end like i'm like it's almost six o'clock i'm going an hour later than i said but i really want to get this to work uh let's turn this off uh take close these things uh close these things um so let's look again um looking at the code snippet uh threshold number from point zero one to point to one this is weird um okay so i'm just gonna do something here in the server and when i run the server i'm gonna call model.info just to make sure that that's working properly so let's do that something weird is going on right that your app is in port 3000 count 100 why is this not communicating with the model let's add some additional console logs here ah there we go okay default okay this is the inputs are channels three default name image type image default point five minimum consonant score max one threshold name threshold okay so image base64 image and then i should get objects back so maybe the model oh it's awake now i know something i guess maybe something was going weird with it let's refresh this page oh there we go the bounding boxes came back rubik's scores status success bounding boxes looks like these are normalized values now why why why why why why did this stop why did that stop on the client function draw oh hold on i have something i have to do on my phone the alarm went off i have to do this at six o'clock so at 5 59 i need to uh stop for a second why what's so weird what happened here that caused it to stop let's let's it's just um okay now i'm going to detect call detect that's still going why did the canvas stop why did draw i mean i recognize that this is like an this is an asynchronous function did like the load pixels act of loading the pixels let's let's comment this out see if it works ah so load pixels messes it up but it can't get the um can i call like update pixels and that'll like get it going again no that's like a p5 bug it shouldn't be doing that all right i'm not gonna this is a p5 bug that's unrelated to what i'm trying to do so i'm gonna just not worry about that for because i i gotta stop i gotta stop live streaming somebody will help me uh figure this out i have two minutes so i need to do something very important on my phone but uh i have an activity that i do with my kids and you have to book it 48 hours in advance or you know due to like covid restrictions um and if i don't do it right at six it's for like monday at six it doesn't like i you have to join the waitlist so i'm watching the clock here um so let's just draw um let's do it this way um let's i could copy it you know what i could do this is making me annoyed that i want to fix this even though it feels like a p5 bug uh let video copy oh i can just do this can i do this ah it does the same thing because get is gonna load the pixels of the video in order to copy it okay never mind i won't worry about this let's look at what comes out bounding boxes okay nothing um so let's um i think if i do uh make a variable called detections is an empty array and then if i say detections equals outputs dot bounding boxes is that what it was called let's actually oops let's get 558 when says 5 59 i'm gonna stop for a second you know i'ma stop now you guys have to bear with me while i refresh a page on my phone over and over again and then i'm gonna finish this off this is such a weird thing i'm doing sunday monday 6 pm you all will think of me at 6 00 p.m on monday if i get this too early to join too early to join too early to join too early to join too early to join too early to join really to join really to join too early to join too early to join too early to join to really join that's good come on change the six o'clock already really enjoy it's really to join it's really just refreshing this over and over again too early to join early to join yeah join join join join yes i got it okay monday at six o'clock all right excellent uh so the bounding boxes are uh an array with four values in it and i assume this is normalized to the width and the height so i could say here now in draw four let i equal zero i is less than what did i call this detections sections dot length uh let cube equals detections index i and then i want to say x equals dot zero times width y equals cube one dot dot height times height what do we think do we think these are the width and height of the box or do we think this is the bottom right corner of the box does it explain that to me anywhere i mean looking at those numbers what would you guess i don't think they're the width and the height that would be huge must be the bottom right and bottom the corner so i think i would then say x x1 y1 x2 y2 2 and three and then i could think i could say rect mode corners i think that's what it is in p5 if instead of specifying the xy width and height i want to specify the corners and then i would draw a rectangle x1 y1 x2 y2 stroke 255 no fill stroke weight uh let's make it pretty thick eight all right let's try this now so um no rubik's cube the model must have gone to sleep during all that time this model has trouble waking up it seems so that's green i'm impatient oh i'm so close to being done with this live stream wow why did it break so this is also a weird bug which i would uh sort of assume is maybe a runway issue where did i have that querying the model yeah all right let's restart the server so the model's not returning oh there we no the info yet i suppose i could try oh it's yellow that's a good sign it's waking up if anybody has watched this entire stream has been taking notes on all the different runwayrelated things that have come up that would be so amazing to compile i would be forever grateful but with even with like the time codes of what they are because i want to get in touch with the runway folks um after this is the audio peaking by the way i'm seeing a lot of red actually in my i'm turning down the uh gain a little bit i'm seeing a lot of red in the um monitor i'm using still yellow ah no it it it's it's awake i think okay no bounding box there we go amazing oh this is so cool a custom trained object detection model working like essentially perfectly i mean look how good this is this is crazy the thing is i wanted to get it to work in real time and i don't understand why the video is frozen whenever i call load pixels such a strange thing so that's i guess i'm gonna have to work that out later i'm gonna publish this the glitch right now um with obviously without the the environment variables if anybody wants to you don't need like you could work on debugging this for me without the runway call like for example this should still work just fine if um you know i don't actually if i if i if i don't actually query runway like just the act of loading the pixels right so if you want to debug this for help debug this for me with p5 like if i take out all of this just comment all of this out right now let's be sure about this refresh it right just the act of calling load pixels freezes the canvas element of the video it's not supposed to do that and i don't recall that it used to do that i wonder if that's a like new bug and i mean i'm using the latest p5 i mean again i've got to stop so i've got to turn this off but that's one of the first things i would do is go back and try earlier versions um this this feels like a bug in p5 so let's just wrap all this up by um i'm gonna put this back in um i am going to add a how do i do this i'm going to add a dot env file no not in public a dot ev file sorry um i don't come on make a new file down here thank you a dot get ignore that's what i want to do and in dot get ignored uh ignore emv node modules um i don't really need this but that's fine count is fine that's fine readme find server i don't know what this is i don't know what this shrink wrap yaml thing is let me just take that out because i don't need that for what i'm doing that's it seems like a glitch thing i can also take this out um okay so now uh let's make a branch called main um let's call this sorry what am i doing this is updating to work with object detection then i'm going to go to github.com codingtrain um what is this runway ml object detection uh object detection object detection model with runway ml node.js and p5.js um no i don't want to create a repository i do want to create a repository but i'm using an existing repository so there we go then okay so this is what i want to do add this whoops origin get a remote dash v oh cause get remote remove origin okay oh yeah okay and then git push origin main i guess so now all the code for it is here um and i can put that in this chord if anybody wants to look at it let's see did the just streambot come back no uh run object detection um okay there we go so this is the if you're in the discord under live under links that's the github repo and why not just put this on glitch now i should be able to do um so the runway ml template that was the first one the spade coco ding train choo choo runway ml template is the next one for spade coco and now new project import from github i think this will work um and just paste this in import from github there here let's see what happens let's re well i'll let it load let's give it a minute here so this is the end by the way everybody um i'll be back hopefully next saturday we'll be taking at least one saturday off in um let me pause this for a second i will be taking at least one saturday off in november i i scheduled to take the saturday of thanksgiving weekend off um i am not going anywhere for thanksgiving i am not having anyone come over for thanksgiving it is i don't think it's really safe or advisable to do so um you know everyone's got to make their own decision of course um you know following their your local guidelines and laws um but so it's conceivable that i might live stream that weekend but um we'll see a lot is going on this is a very busy time of year with the nyu semester which is wrapping up soon which is a good thing for me in terms of more time to stream but um let's just see here i i believe if i look at this there shouldn't be anything in there yeah right so this you can now also find this project although i want to rename it to runway ml object detection so now i should be able to you should be able to see this project as well here oops i'm it's on the readme sorry about that so um i don't i'm going to disable the model right now um and the api keys aren't in this anyway but so that that wraps that up so what is coming next on the coding train yesterday on friday um i recorded four uh secret there there are five i have five in the can now five video tutorials to come out the first one is using ml5 convolutional neural network part one the second is using ml5 convolutional neural network part two the third is using the ml5 pretrained convolutional neural network model doodle net the fourth is uh posting gifs from your discord bot and the fifth is oh no the fourth is dot in using a dot env file to hide your api keys with a discord bot which if you watch today's stream you you're familiar with that somewhat and the fifth is

patricia reset my song uh greetings lars from denmark um i know i i was thinking what i would do actually with the um tutorial about how to post a gif to your discord bot that i would release two versions of it one with me saying gif and one with me saying jiff it'd be exactly the same tutorial but i'd have two videos i think i really will do this so i'm just gonna have to dub it over or use machine learning or something i think i should dub it over actually but just that you know and then this is where you post your gif and then this is where you post your chat so i think that'll be pretty awesome um all right bruno's asked me if i regenerated all the keys leaked early i think i did but i i think i i either regenerated or then i disabled the models i'm i'm i'm letting this run

um if you uh live somewhere beautiful and amazing in the world uh i have a um what i'm hoping is a six months period where i could with my family go in a little adventure you know assuming this is far off in the future i'm kind of assuming that um the world will hopefully be mostly recovered from the pandemic currently that's a huge assumption obviously but i'm starting to plan for that uh possibility just to look forward to something um i hope that you have something to look forward to boy it's really depressing whatever there's 20 seconds left uh don't go to denmark norway i have been to norway okay can i tell you about one of my favorite places in the world ah i have some of my favorite memories in life from this place and i'm going to tell you all about it right now it is the island of roonda in norway this is where it is right here i can zoom all the way out i spent three or four days there with my family i believe it means bird island um and we went on hikes we hiked all the way out to this lighthouse here and by the way there's no way to get to that lighthouse other than hiking and it was like at hours and hours hike and i had a threeyearold and a uh sixyearold at the time it was a really amazing adventure and i actually asked when i got there the proprietor of the lighthouse which you can stay overnight there for free if you hike out there i asked the proprietor if there was maybe a boat that could take us back and they laughed at me in a friendly way it was quite kind of funny we hiked back ah i had such an amazing time you can we went there to see puffins so we were the wrong time of year there were no puffins but i really just had i would love to go back there that was really um just an amazing time um on this little spot that uh in the world that we visited okay 16 seconds left um all right everyone i will see you hopefully next stay tuned probably next saturday but some saturday in the future here on the coding grain hopefully in

notice that look what i get i'm really losing my mind okay let's do it the kittens the kittens kittens and kittens and kittens kittens this is usually the part of the live stream as i'm packing up that i i like to do a little behind the scenes here take down the green screen you can turn off the lights i i gotta listen i'm very curious listening back to how this microphone is if i even have it like set up correctly come on control center turn off the light oh darkness oh it's so dark i didn't realize i had all the lights off now it's gonna be okay today is not broken it has not frozen this isn't so at least turn on the regular lights which i now i'm realizing that's why the key was weird i have these other just regular lamps that usually brighten up the green screen that was invalid syntax i forgot uh there was one other thing here that i think is important that i will use continuously over and over again all sorts of text generation analysis things thanks everybody for watching over and over again i think i have successfully put everything away this is the big grand finale of a song kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens of dastada
