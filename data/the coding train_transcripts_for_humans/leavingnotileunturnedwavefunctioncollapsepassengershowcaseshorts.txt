00:18 - which treats each tile as a single Pixel
00:21 - when a cell collapses to a particular
00:23 - color it propagates out to the
00:25 - neighboring cells to recalculate a new
00:28 - color range with a similar color grid
00:30 - kit designed their own tile system to
00:32 - create an abstract ornamental pattern I
00:34 - really love to see project documentation
00:36 - like this with an explanation of the
