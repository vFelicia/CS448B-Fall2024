00:00 - there's like this
00:14 - hello surprise like roaring noise I'm
00:18 - back I don't know if anybody's watching
00:19 - but I missed such as obvious and
00:23 - important bug from this morning this
00:33 - that I've come back to fix that bug so
00:37 - by the way this morning was coding
00:38 - rainbow episode number 49 which means
00:41 - this Thursday it's going to be episode
00:43 - 50 which means I've got to do something
00:45 - special for episode 50 so this is really
00:47 - like episode 49 point A I hope that I
00:53 - hope that this is working point 149 a 49
00:58 - and a half maybe this will just be I
01:00 - don't know if we'll edit this together
01:01 - this will just suddenly appear at the
01:03 - end of 49 Overbeck should be two
01:05 - different youtube videos who knows but
01:07 - I'm back I hope to actually have more
01:10 - time to do more stuff but I am only here
01:14 - just to do one thing I have to leave in
01:15 - about 15 or 20 minutes this is the nice
01:17 - thing go about having a video studio
01:19 - with the camera set up it just turn on
01:21 - in live stream whatever I want does
01:23 - everybody could see me I'm not seeing
01:24 - myself in my own preview so I'm just
01:28 - going to do a quick refresh of the page
01:30 - to see if I see myself but let me know
01:33 - in the chat if this is working for you
01:35 - and I see that Oliver writes all seems
01:39 - good so anyway I've got to go find the
01:44 - example from this morning try now
01:47 - opening up processing
01:53 - this dog this doc okay frosting is open
01:58 - I processing is open come back
02:01 - processing and go to open recent blog
02:05 - tracking too okay so if you recall I had
02:10 - made an improvement here it works I
02:18 - don't know why I can't see myself in the
02:21 - preview but I'm just gonna have to trust
02:23 - that you guys are seeing me if it ever
02:26 - stopped working please tell me that it
02:30 - stopped okay so what do I want to do
02:33 - here this is my blog tracking we have
02:36 - this threshold where they become one
02:38 - blob or separate blobs it's working very
02:40 - nicely okay so what I want to do is ok
02:48 - so i made the blob tracking tutorial
02:51 - video this will not be a new tutorial
02:53 - video this will just be alike hey I'm
02:56 - back let me show you one more thing so
02:59 - and what I'm going to do is go back and
03:02 - make the actual section uh where I add
03:12 - all the points of the blob and then find
03:14 - the shortest distance again even though
03:17 - that's not entirely necessary I've got
03:19 - to do that anyway okay so because I when
03:22 - I had done wrong was I never added the
03:25 - first point otherwise of course it would
03:26 - work okay here we go I'm ready
03:34 - this stop this dock is done if you get
03:37 - this this stop this stop this done and
03:40 - there's eating this stuff is stuck
03:41 - underneath this dis stop not loading it
03:45 - all for me well some people are saying
03:48 - it's working some people are saying it's
03:49 - not I don't know what you do about that
03:58 - okay uh here we go let me minimize this
04:03 - bring this over here and time to do my
04:07 - addenda addendum okay people were saying
04:11 - it works all right well this is being
04:13 - recorded two discs anyway so even if
04:15 - this live stream stopped working i will
04:17 - have this video saved ok back for a
04:21 - quick addendum i had tried to remember
04:23 - to make it work where you find the
04:25 - shortest distance to any pixel it's part
04:27 - of the blob and that didn't work well i
04:29 - had made a silly error of course the
04:31 - internets saved me from my own failings
04:35 - and so i'm going to quickly add this
04:36 - back in and so what I'm going to do is
04:38 - I'm going to make an ArrayList of P
04:40 - vectors called points boy I didn't I
04:42 - already have this i'm going to say
04:44 - points is a new arraylist of P vector
04:50 - objects uh okay and then and then what
05:00 - did i do every time there's a new point
05:01 - i would say points dot add new P vector
05:06 - X comma Y whoops don't don't don't and
05:11 - then in a show what I also want to do is
05:16 - say for int I equals 0 I is less than oh
05:19 - no no no no no no no no I can use my P
05:22 - vector look at all of the peeve actors
05:24 - and just say make it blue and then type
05:30 - in a point to do did the VX meet out why
05:41 - there it is and
05:46 - I don't know what is going on whether
05:49 - things are working or not working so we
05:53 - can see here now that I'm seeing all the
05:57 - points that are part of the blob in
05:58 - addition to that bounding rectangle okay
06:00 - so one way that I could do to find
06:03 - multiple blobs right instead of and I
06:08 - could instead of simply finding that
06:11 - bounding rectangle I can now find the
06:13 - shortest point to any point ah but what
06:15 - was the mistake that I made here was the
06:17 - mistake that I made look in the add
06:20 - function every time there's a new point
06:22 - i added to that list but guess what i
06:24 - forgot when I first make the blob I make
06:27 - it I make it with an XY so what I forgot
06:31 - was to say points add new P vector X
06:35 - comma Y so now I should be able to go
06:39 - back and add that code so I'm going to
06:42 - comment this out which is an excellent
06:44 - method and I'm going to do another
06:45 - method which says that a d is I'm going
06:51 - to start it with like a really high
06:52 - distance and then I'm going to look
06:54 - through all of the vectors and I'm going
07:02 - to do the temporary distance is the
07:06 - distance between that X distance square
07:09 - between that x and y and the vac that
07:13 - particular point and then if that
07:18 - temporary distance is less than the
07:20 - distance then distance equals that
07:24 - temporary distance so this distance this
07:26 - D is like a record I want to find the
07:29 - shortest distance between the new point
07:31 - and any point that's inside the blob and
07:34 - if it's less than the threshold go right
07:38 - ahead so now I'm going to run this and
07:44 - this should actually work if it does so
07:48 - it works and it's perfectly fast I so
07:51 - the only reason it wasn't working before
07:52 - and you can see how this threshold that
07:55 - distance threshold works beautifully as
07:57 - well write it
07:59 - is the blobs when they're in within a
08:01 - certain threshold and I can change that
08:03 - right by making it higher so what's high
08:09 - are gonna do I should make it lower
08:13 - right oh I I really should change this
08:19 - so that it okay so it changed us make
08:22 - this lower I should just have it change
08:24 - by five or something okay and so now we
08:29 - can see here there's their separate
08:31 - blobs until they get quite quite close
08:34 - let me just change that right now
08:36 - because this is driving me crazy I want
08:39 - to change here I whenever I press the
08:41 - key to change those threshold values I
08:43 - want to change it by like five so that I
08:50 - don't have to so that I don't have to be
08:58 - pressing it so many times so here they
09:02 - are right here are two blobs and you can
09:06 - see them whoops till the color threshold
09:09 - now distance threshold they're separate
09:12 - blobs right when that distance threshold
09:14 - is five we get lots of extra little
09:17 - blobs they really don't become the same
09:19 - blob until they're literally touching
09:20 - each other but if that distance
09:23 - threshold is more like 60 then when
09:27 - they're within 60 pixels they become so
09:29 - this is another way of doing it that's
09:30 - perhaps a little bit more accurate than
09:33 - the other way but it works okay so I
09:35 - fixed that problem thank you very much I
09:37 - did both now this video now contains
09:40 - both solutions one solution being the
09:43 - clamping to a rectangle right finding
09:45 - the distance of the new point to the
09:47 - edges of the blob versus another just
09:50 - finding the shortest the shortest
09:51 - distance of the point to the rectangle
09:53 - itself the shorts to disappoint to any
09:55 - points within the rectangle okay that's
09:57 - the end of this video now for sure until
09:59 - I record another addendum goodbye okay
10:04 - so interestingly enough Thomas is saying
10:09 - it's not working it's also not working
10:11 - for me I cannot watch
10:13 - own stream let's see if I do it over
10:15 - here let's go to Schiffman live chip
10:26 - inception this is what's happening to me
10:33 - is this so i don't know why the stream
10:36 - isn't working for some people but it is
10:37 - working for other people you can see
10:39 - that it's not working for me i relieved
10:40 - i want the moment where I appear behind
10:42 - myself uh okay um so let me see if I
10:49 - have any actual questions in the chat I
10:51 - see some not actual questions through
10:53 - the chat anybody have any so that was
10:59 - just really what I came home to record
11:01 - if I have a little bit more time does
11:06 - anyone have any other questions they
11:08 - would like to ask
11:20 - let's play some music we can do let's do
11:24 - a um let's do some green screen footage
11:44 - you put a coating challenge you don't
11:47 - want me to just be doing my dancing in
11:48 - front of a green screen
12:17 - I'm waiting for questions to appear but
12:19 - they're not coming
12:27 - when are the rainbows going to appear
12:29 - that's what I want to know yeah creepy
12:33 - is right sorry I'm sorry ah I think I'm
12:42 - overdoing it but no no way well nobody's
12:47 - watching this there's 40 people watching
12:50 - this yeah I'm also losing it do I know
12:57 - c++ I do know c++ but I haven't used it
13:00 - for a while let's see here if I think
13:04 - that's really all I came I guess this
13:05 - idea of wait look hold on a sec there's
13:12 - me now it's working for me because
13:16 - there's me with the previously not
13:19 - working video but it is not working
13:22 - again put your co2 calculator in 10
13:27 - minutes could I make a quick thumbnail
13:30 - with the new correction yes yes thank
13:32 - you so hold on I have to do something
13:40 - very important this will be a thumbnail
13:43 - for the video
13:48 - oh wait this is a good one to accept uh
13:54 - except i think i want my distance
13:56 - threshold to be less i'll give me this
14:04 - is better
14:12 - move my mouse okay good point the color
14:20 - threshold isn't really working very well
14:22 - when we hold on it does run kind of slow
14:26 - when there's a lot of points
14:39 - oh wait oh yeah okay okay sorry okay
14:47 - everyone i I don't know this is it for
14:50 - today I will be back on Thursday let's
14:53 - check actually let me just take five
15:00 - minutes to answer let's do another Q&A
15:02 - because this is actually a question
15:04 - that's not in this is a question that's
15:08 - in this in my slack channel I feel like
15:13 - I can't underwear is it we find it under
15:17 - share work no okay okay i'm going to do
15:27 - a quick
15:45 - ok
15:46 - I'm going to do a quick oh and I want to
15:49 - bring up something inside p 5 videos
15:56 - looking inside p 5 okay okay okay
16:12 - okay here we go here we go uh I lost my
16:20 - chat okay hello and welcome to another
16:24 - QA the question for today's Q&A comes
16:29 - from Michelle and Michelle rights on
16:31 - helping with p5 development i'm still
16:33 - beginner but is there a way i can
16:36 - contribute to it i was thinking about
16:38 - contributing to the inline examples that
16:40 - might be away are there certain examples
16:41 - which are good wants to keep in mind as
16:44 - a reference so this is I have important
16:49 - text messages but I don't need to look
16:52 - at in the real this video ah somebody
16:54 - edit that out so um you want to do some
16:57 - uh I'm start over cuz i really should
17:01 - not have looked at the text message I
17:03 - underserved from the back beginning okay
17:10 - hello and what hello and welcome to
17:14 - another Q&A video today's question comes
17:17 - from Michelle Michelle right um help I'm
17:20 - helping with p5 development I'm still a
17:22 - beginner but I I want to know about
17:24 - rephrasing her question I'm just going
17:26 - to read it last try hello and welcome to
17:34 - another Q and a creative coding video in
17:38 - this video I'm going to answer a
17:39 - question from Michelle Michelle rights
17:41 - on helping with p5 development i'm still
17:44 - beginner e but is there a way i can
17:46 - contribute to it i was thinking about
17:48 - contributing to the inline examples
17:49 - might be away a via this page and
17:51 - there's a link to a particular page that
17:53 - i'll show you in a minute are there
17:54 - certain examples which might be a good
17:55 - one to keep in mind as a reference okay
17:57 - so you're asking the question let's say
18:00 - the michelle has asked the question I'm
18:02 - going to generalize question a bit more
18:03 - i like p 5 i'm interested in it how can
18:06 - i contribute so the first thing i want
18:08 - to say is that there is a wonderful set
18:11 - of video tutorials that are being
18:13 - created by louisa Pereira and they are
18:16 - called looking inside p5 and you can see
18:19 - there's part 1 and there's also a part 2
18:20 - she also has both of these tutorials in
18:23 - Spanish so they're both in English and
18:25 - now I would play for you right now but
18:27 - you can go the links will be in this
18:28 - video's description and you can go and
18:30 - watch them on your own but what's
18:31 - wonderful about these video tutorials is
18:33 - they kind of explain to you this is
18:35 - let's say you want to contribute to p5
18:36 - guess this is where you will land this
18:39 - is the github repository page 4 p-5 Jess
18:42 - github.com / processing / p5 Jess
18:45 - there's all this stuff there's a source
18:48 - folder and a Lib folder in a docs folder
18:50 - in this bill task and test how is this
18:52 - organized how does it all work louisa
18:54 - does a wonderful job of going through
18:56 - all of these things in her tutorial
18:58 - videos so rather than do that here i'm
19:01 - going to refer you to those particular
19:02 - video so what I'm going to do here is
19:03 - show you a bit about how you might other
19:06 - places and how you might sort of get
19:08 - involved so one thing is is on the first
19:12 - thing that you can do is just kind of go
19:14 - and look at some of the wiki pages so
19:16 - here um they might look through there's
19:19 - some tutorials and different things but
19:21 - they're one thing that I would look at
19:22 - here first is this development wiki so
19:25 - this development wiki gives you a nice
19:28 - kind of set on ideas and things about
19:31 - what you can do in order to get started
19:33 - getting contributing so you can look
19:35 - through the github issues there's links
19:37 - to that here you could think about
19:39 - implementing a new feature there's lots
19:41 - of stuff here there's instructions of
19:44 - what you need to do to set up and
19:45 - download it some of this stuff might
19:47 - look a little bit intimidating or a
19:48 - little bit scary but p5 jess is a
19:51 - friendly and open place it doesn't
19:53 - matter what your skill level is we want
19:54 - you to contribute we want you to help so
19:56 - come and give it a try and see where you
19:58 - get stuck send me a tweet post on the
20:01 - processing forums there's various place
20:03 - where you can where you can get help i
20:05 - also have a bunch of video tutorials
20:06 - about github that you could take a look
20:08 - at now michelle had asked michelle i
20:11 - pointed out this particular this
20:13 - particular wiki page which was called
20:15 - the development checklist and the
20:17 - development checklist is kind of a
20:19 - checklist oh I wish I had looked at this
20:20 - for my WebGL video earlier but you can
20:23 - sort of see here a bunch of things that
20:25 - are kind of in progress or being
20:27 - developed that you can think about
20:28 - contributing to and one of the things
20:30 - that you can look at that she had
20:34 - noticed here that the
20:37 - okay I'm going to find it more quickly
20:39 - is the inline in line exam okay we hold
20:46 - on what am I looking at here sorry
20:48 - reference sketches sorry so these are
20:51 - sketches and things that are for the
20:53 - reference now you can see that some of
20:55 - them are not crossed out meaning they
20:58 - haven't been done yet id class so let's
21:01 - look at how that works and i'll show you
21:03 - a little bit about how you might do this
21:04 - so oh these aren't links so let's say
21:08 - you want to create something for the the
21:14 - ID function in p5 Dom how would you do
21:17 - that so let's go and i'm going to show
21:21 - you actually i'm going to go to p5 jas
21:24 - i'm going to go here to source and
21:27 - actually i just realized this is all the
21:29 - source for all the stuff that's in the
21:31 - p5 just library itself and all gets
21:34 - compiled together into that big p5 jess
21:36 - library but the p5 dom function the p5
21:40 - Don library is actually different and
21:42 - it's right here in lib Adams add-ons p5
21:45 - Dom gas so you can see here is actually
21:48 - all of the source code 4 p-5 Dom j/s now
21:53 - I what I want to do is go back to that
21:55 - development checklist it's not showing
21:58 - up if I there we go that's what I wanted
22:02 - to show up and let's look back under DOM
22:06 - and we can see that for example a
22:09 - position is implemented so right here we
22:12 - can see that position is implemented so
22:13 - I'm going to look for the position
22:14 - function so I can see actually this is
22:21 - the source code for the position
22:24 - function in p5 dot so what position does
22:27 - is it takes a Dom element and gives it
22:29 - an absolute position on the page I don't
22:32 - have my not looking at my chat and I'm
22:34 - worried that something's not working ok
22:36 - so um now here's the source code for it
22:40 - but up here is a quick little example
22:43 - create a canvas and call canvassed
22:45 - opposition and look how this is
22:47 - formatted it's formatted at example
22:50 - with a div with code class equals no
22:53 - render because the code isnt rendered or
22:55 - maybe it should be rendered I don't know
22:57 - and then a closed code tag close div tag
23:01 - so I'm going to go here and I'm just
23:03 - going to copy paste this pause point to
23:09 - editing the video so now what I'm going
23:20 - to do oh we're sorry I'm going to come
23:24 - back so now what I'm going to do is I'm
23:28 - let's look for the ID function so I'm
23:31 - going to look for ID equals equals
23:35 - function I got to find it oh you know
23:45 - why it's not here tricky tricky tricky
23:51 - hold on pause oh no p 5 element
24:01 - why are some here and some aren't here
24:05 - that's interesting oh no it's here it's
24:09 - got to be here that's weird okay hold on
24:17 - I'm having trouble finding this function
24:21 - so that this is going to have to get
24:23 - edited me searching edited out
24:36 - well done
24:42 - there it is oh it's in p5 so that's
24:44 - interesting some of the functions in p5
24:51 - Dom I went off on a tangent here I don't
24:55 - know if this is going to be useful well
24:58 - I'll just keep my tangent i don't know
25:00 - if i should make this a QA answer yeah
25:03 - I'm gonna okay I'm gonna go back to
25:06 - where of us and now I know where it is
25:10 - back I couldn't find the function that I
25:13 - want to edit here in p5 Dom bjs and
25:16 - actually what I didn't realize is the
25:19 - function ID is a function that assigns a
25:22 - specific ID to a Dom element and it's
25:24 - not actually in the p5 DOM is function
25:28 - I'm sorry add on it because it comes
25:31 - with core p5 it's actually part of Corps
25:34 - p5 and for that I need to go to source
25:37 - and then I'm looking for p5 a core p 5
25:43 - element jes and here it is so I want to
25:47 - look for ID equals whoops ID equals and
25:51 - now here's that function and you'll
25:53 - notice that function does not have an
25:55 - example so let's just do this right now
25:57 - we're going to live on youtube on the
26:00 - air make an example in submit a pull
26:02 - request am i logged into i'm logged in
26:06 - as Schiffman that's going to be a bit of
26:07 - a problem that's fine so I'm going to
26:10 - hit edit because I have privileges to
26:15 - make changes so I have to make sure so
26:16 - now I want to look for ID equals and I'm
26:21 - going to go right here and I'm going to
26:22 - paste that in oh I lost it so hold on I
26:27 - got a I got to get back to lib addons p5
26:33 - dumb and I'm going to search for what
26:38 - was one that we liked position position
26:44 - here it is I got to get this example
26:47 - stuff right here I'm going to go back
26:49 - here and now i'm going to zoom in here
26:51 - so you can see what i'm doing i'm going
26:53 - to paste this in here ooh so i need to
26:55 - fix this
26:56 - that the spacing is right you know I
26:58 - could be more thoughtful about this
27:09 - and then I need to make sure this is
27:11 - closed so now you can see I've added the
27:15 - code for an example but this is the code
27:16 - for the position so what I want to do is
27:19 - do make given an ID I'll make that ID my
27:25 - canvas and then what this does is
27:28 - already come assigns a CSS selector ID
27:34 - to the canvas element so I don't know if
27:40 - anybody so this is now adding a quick
27:43 - little example that shows you how you
27:44 - can use the ID function and then oh this
27:49 - German going on in the chat now and then
27:53 - I'm going to go down to the bottom and I
27:55 - want to create a new branch and start a
27:58 - pull request so adding in line example
28:03 - for ID function I'm gonna write I'm live
28:06 - on YouTube demonstrating how to make a
28:11 - pull request and add an inline in line
28:17 - example so once i do that i'm going to
28:22 - click proposed file change and there's
28:28 - some guidelines for contributing that i
28:29 - could click at and i want to see and i'm
28:33 - going to create this this you can see my
28:36 - change is just in this one p 5 element
28:39 - it adds just this code and i'm going to
28:41 - say create pull request and it's going
28:45 - to do some checks to make sure things
28:47 - are okay and we'll see and on Thursday
28:49 - this Thursday is coding rainbow the
28:52 - there will be a mystery will discover
28:55 - was this pull request merged or was it
28:58 - not merged stay tuned to be continued oh
29:01 - I need a sound effect for dun dun dun is
29:07 - that uh okay I won't look for that right
29:09 - now ok so again I kind of went off in a
29:12 - little bit of tangent of showing you a
29:13 - very specific thing but basically what
29:16 - you the p5 as an environment is designed
29:21 - to be both something they could
29:22 - beginners can use to learn to program
29:23 - and also can learn to contribute to an
29:25 - open source environment and the place to
29:28 - do that first is github the problem with
29:30 - github is it doesn't appear that
29:31 - friendly to you so I would encourage you
29:34 - to check out the wiki's in the
29:35 - development page I would encourage you
29:37 - to tweet at p5 xjs on Twitter to post on
29:41 - the processing forum forum dot
29:44 - processing org and you can go down to
29:46 - the p5 j/s and here are p 5 GS
29:51 - development questions if you post it
29:53 - there and are looking for help on how to
29:55 - contribute post there send me a tweet so
29:57 - I can look at your posts and help answer
29:58 - it as well as i'd recommend checking out
30:01 - luis's videos and also something you can
30:03 - just literally do to be a part of the
30:06 - the contributions is go to the issues
30:08 - page this is the issues page read
30:11 - through some of the issues scan through
30:13 - them if there's something that you think
30:14 - should be a feature or something you're
30:16 - not sure about if it works correctly
30:17 - contribute write an issue file issue do
30:20 - not worry about filing an issue
30:21 - correctly hey you incorrectly you cannot
30:24 - file it incorrectly the act of filing an
30:26 - issue is the act of filing it correctly
30:29 - and if there's ways if you need to close
30:31 - the issue Andrea open a new one all of
30:33 - that is possible and fine so please come
30:35 - and join and contribute to p5 j/s and
30:37 - yes dramatic chipmunk that's the name of
30:40 - the sound effect i'm looking for and
30:42 - hopefully this video was somewhat useful
30:44 - about a little bit about how you can get
30:45 - started contributing to p5 Jess thanks
30:48 - for watching okay thanks everybody for
30:53 - tuning in to this extra bonus live
30:57 - session I will be back on Thursday will
31:01 - it be merged will it not i don't know
31:03 - and i will see you guys soon can anyone
31:12 - share link to github i know that i can
31:16 - so i'm going to type this in that should
31:21 - be the github repository now i just
31:24 - shared it to the chat so thanks you guys
31:26 - for tuning in today for being a part of
31:29 - i know you guys want me to do a coded
31:31 - challenge but unfortunately i have to
31:32 - leave and
31:36 - yes oh by the way I had some meetings
31:39 - today and I alvaro makes a good point
31:41 - and I am planning to have some guests on
31:43 - to talk about their work and different
31:45 - project very soon so that's actually
31:47 - something that's coming I'm excited
31:49 - about integrating that into these sort
31:51 - of like live sessions beyond just
31:53 - programming tutorials on so I'm gonna do
31:56 - definitely do a coding challenge on
31:57 - Thursday just some interesting algorithm
31:59 - that makes a pattern or a game so make
32:02 - your voice heard in if you're part of
32:04 - the patrons you can post what you think
32:07 - would be good for thursday and the slack
32:09 - or you can also just post to the rainbow
32:12 - topics github issues and i will see you
32:16 - guys soon i'm going to unfortunately
32:17 - press this button but i'm going to go
32:20 - back to having some music to play you
32:23 - guys out so this is random this is noise
32:26 - pearly noise that is in the core random
32:29 - algorithm the actual random algorithm
32:31 - itself those numbers aren't related

Cleaned transcript:

there's like this hello surprise like roaring noise I'm back I don't know if anybody's watching but I missed such as obvious and important bug from this morning this that I've come back to fix that bug so by the way this morning was coding rainbow episode number 49 which means this Thursday it's going to be episode 50 which means I've got to do something special for episode 50 so this is really like episode 49 point A I hope that I hope that this is working point 149 a 49 and a half maybe this will just be I don't know if we'll edit this together this will just suddenly appear at the end of 49 Overbeck should be two different youtube videos who knows but I'm back I hope to actually have more time to do more stuff but I am only here just to do one thing I have to leave in about 15 or 20 minutes this is the nice thing go about having a video studio with the camera set up it just turn on in live stream whatever I want does everybody could see me I'm not seeing myself in my own preview so I'm just going to do a quick refresh of the page to see if I see myself but let me know in the chat if this is working for you and I see that Oliver writes all seems good so anyway I've got to go find the example from this morning try now opening up processing this dog this doc okay frosting is open I processing is open come back processing and go to open recent blog tracking too okay so if you recall I had made an improvement here it works I don't know why I can't see myself in the preview but I'm just gonna have to trust that you guys are seeing me if it ever stopped working please tell me that it stopped okay so what do I want to do here this is my blog tracking we have this threshold where they become one blob or separate blobs it's working very nicely okay so what I want to do is ok so i made the blob tracking tutorial video this will not be a new tutorial video this will just be alike hey I'm back let me show you one more thing so and what I'm going to do is go back and make the actual section uh where I add all the points of the blob and then find the shortest distance again even though that's not entirely necessary I've got to do that anyway okay so because I when I had done wrong was I never added the first point otherwise of course it would work okay here we go I'm ready this stop this dock is done if you get this this stop this stop this done and there's eating this stuff is stuck underneath this dis stop not loading it all for me well some people are saying it's working some people are saying it's not I don't know what you do about that okay uh here we go let me minimize this bring this over here and time to do my addenda addendum okay people were saying it works all right well this is being recorded two discs anyway so even if this live stream stopped working i will have this video saved ok back for a quick addendum i had tried to remember to make it work where you find the shortest distance to any pixel it's part of the blob and that didn't work well i had made a silly error of course the internets saved me from my own failings and so i'm going to quickly add this back in and so what I'm going to do is I'm going to make an ArrayList of P vectors called points boy I didn't I already have this i'm going to say points is a new arraylist of P vector objects uh okay and then and then what did i do every time there's a new point i would say points dot add new P vector X comma Y whoops don't don't don't and then in a show what I also want to do is say for int I equals 0 I is less than oh no no no no no no no no I can use my P vector look at all of the peeve actors and just say make it blue and then type in a point to do did the VX meet out why there it is and I don't know what is going on whether things are working or not working so we can see here now that I'm seeing all the points that are part of the blob in addition to that bounding rectangle okay so one way that I could do to find multiple blobs right instead of and I could instead of simply finding that bounding rectangle I can now find the shortest point to any point ah but what was the mistake that I made here was the mistake that I made look in the add function every time there's a new point i added to that list but guess what i forgot when I first make the blob I make it I make it with an XY so what I forgot was to say points add new P vector X comma Y so now I should be able to go back and add that code so I'm going to comment this out which is an excellent method and I'm going to do another method which says that a d is I'm going to start it with like a really high distance and then I'm going to look through all of the vectors and I'm going to do the temporary distance is the distance between that X distance square between that x and y and the vac that particular point and then if that temporary distance is less than the distance then distance equals that temporary distance so this distance this D is like a record I want to find the shortest distance between the new point and any point that's inside the blob and if it's less than the threshold go right ahead so now I'm going to run this and this should actually work if it does so it works and it's perfectly fast I so the only reason it wasn't working before and you can see how this threshold that distance threshold works beautifully as well write it is the blobs when they're in within a certain threshold and I can change that right by making it higher so what's high are gonna do I should make it lower right oh I I really should change this so that it okay so it changed us make this lower I should just have it change by five or something okay and so now we can see here there's their separate blobs until they get quite quite close let me just change that right now because this is driving me crazy I want to change here I whenever I press the key to change those threshold values I want to change it by like five so that I don't have to so that I don't have to be pressing it so many times so here they are right here are two blobs and you can see them whoops till the color threshold now distance threshold they're separate blobs right when that distance threshold is five we get lots of extra little blobs they really don't become the same blob until they're literally touching each other but if that distance threshold is more like 60 then when they're within 60 pixels they become so this is another way of doing it that's perhaps a little bit more accurate than the other way but it works okay so I fixed that problem thank you very much I did both now this video now contains both solutions one solution being the clamping to a rectangle right finding the distance of the new point to the edges of the blob versus another just finding the shortest the shortest distance of the point to the rectangle itself the shorts to disappoint to any points within the rectangle okay that's the end of this video now for sure until I record another addendum goodbye okay so interestingly enough Thomas is saying it's not working it's also not working for me I cannot watch own stream let's see if I do it over here let's go to Schiffman live chip inception this is what's happening to me is this so i don't know why the stream isn't working for some people but it is working for other people you can see that it's not working for me i relieved i want the moment where I appear behind myself uh okay um so let me see if I have any actual questions in the chat I see some not actual questions through the chat anybody have any so that was just really what I came home to record if I have a little bit more time does anyone have any other questions they would like to ask let's play some music we can do let's do a um let's do some green screen footage you put a coating challenge you don't want me to just be doing my dancing in front of a green screen I'm waiting for questions to appear but they're not coming when are the rainbows going to appear that's what I want to know yeah creepy is right sorry I'm sorry ah I think I'm overdoing it but no no way well nobody's watching this there's 40 people watching this yeah I'm also losing it do I know c++ I do know c++ but I haven't used it for a while let's see here if I think that's really all I came I guess this idea of wait look hold on a sec there's me now it's working for me because there's me with the previously not working video but it is not working again put your co2 calculator in 10 minutes could I make a quick thumbnail with the new correction yes yes thank you so hold on I have to do something very important this will be a thumbnail for the video oh wait this is a good one to accept uh except i think i want my distance threshold to be less i'll give me this is better move my mouse okay good point the color threshold isn't really working very well when we hold on it does run kind of slow when there's a lot of points oh wait oh yeah okay okay sorry okay everyone i I don't know this is it for today I will be back on Thursday let's check actually let me just take five minutes to answer let's do another Q&A because this is actually a question that's not in this is a question that's in this in my slack channel I feel like I can't underwear is it we find it under share work no okay okay i'm going to do a quick ok I'm going to do a quick oh and I want to bring up something inside p 5 videos looking inside p 5 okay okay okay okay here we go here we go uh I lost my chat okay hello and welcome to another QA the question for today's Q&A comes from Michelle and Michelle rights on helping with p5 development i'm still beginner but is there a way i can contribute to it i was thinking about contributing to the inline examples that might be away are there certain examples which are good wants to keep in mind as a reference so this is I have important text messages but I don't need to look at in the real this video ah somebody edit that out so um you want to do some uh I'm start over cuz i really should not have looked at the text message I underserved from the back beginning okay hello and what hello and welcome to another Q&A video today's question comes from Michelle Michelle right um help I'm helping with p5 development I'm still a beginner but I I want to know about rephrasing her question I'm just going to read it last try hello and welcome to another Q and a creative coding video in this video I'm going to answer a question from Michelle Michelle rights on helping with p5 development i'm still beginner e but is there a way i can contribute to it i was thinking about contributing to the inline examples might be away a via this page and there's a link to a particular page that i'll show you in a minute are there certain examples which might be a good one to keep in mind as a reference okay so you're asking the question let's say the michelle has asked the question I'm going to generalize question a bit more i like p 5 i'm interested in it how can i contribute so the first thing i want to say is that there is a wonderful set of video tutorials that are being created by louisa Pereira and they are called looking inside p5 and you can see there's part 1 and there's also a part 2 she also has both of these tutorials in Spanish so they're both in English and now I would play for you right now but you can go the links will be in this video's description and you can go and watch them on your own but what's wonderful about these video tutorials is they kind of explain to you this is let's say you want to contribute to p5 guess this is where you will land this is the github repository page 4 p5 Jess github.com / processing / p5 Jess there's all this stuff there's a source folder and a Lib folder in a docs folder in this bill task and test how is this organized how does it all work louisa does a wonderful job of going through all of these things in her tutorial videos so rather than do that here i'm going to refer you to those particular video so what I'm going to do here is show you a bit about how you might other places and how you might sort of get involved so one thing is is on the first thing that you can do is just kind of go and look at some of the wiki pages so here um they might look through there's some tutorials and different things but they're one thing that I would look at here first is this development wiki so this development wiki gives you a nice kind of set on ideas and things about what you can do in order to get started getting contributing so you can look through the github issues there's links to that here you could think about implementing a new feature there's lots of stuff here there's instructions of what you need to do to set up and download it some of this stuff might look a little bit intimidating or a little bit scary but p5 jess is a friendly and open place it doesn't matter what your skill level is we want you to contribute we want you to help so come and give it a try and see where you get stuck send me a tweet post on the processing forums there's various place where you can where you can get help i also have a bunch of video tutorials about github that you could take a look at now michelle had asked michelle i pointed out this particular this particular wiki page which was called the development checklist and the development checklist is kind of a checklist oh I wish I had looked at this for my WebGL video earlier but you can sort of see here a bunch of things that are kind of in progress or being developed that you can think about contributing to and one of the things that you can look at that she had noticed here that the okay I'm going to find it more quickly is the inline in line exam okay we hold on what am I looking at here sorry reference sketches sorry so these are sketches and things that are for the reference now you can see that some of them are not crossed out meaning they haven't been done yet id class so let's look at how that works and i'll show you a little bit about how you might do this so oh these aren't links so let's say you want to create something for the the ID function in p5 Dom how would you do that so let's go and i'm going to show you actually i'm going to go to p5 jas i'm going to go here to source and actually i just realized this is all the source for all the stuff that's in the p5 just library itself and all gets compiled together into that big p5 jess library but the p5 dom function the p5 Don library is actually different and it's right here in lib Adams addons p5 Dom gas so you can see here is actually all of the source code 4 p5 Dom j/s now I what I want to do is go back to that development checklist it's not showing up if I there we go that's what I wanted to show up and let's look back under DOM and we can see that for example a position is implemented so right here we can see that position is implemented so I'm going to look for the position function so I can see actually this is the source code for the position function in p5 dot so what position does is it takes a Dom element and gives it an absolute position on the page I don't have my not looking at my chat and I'm worried that something's not working ok so um now here's the source code for it but up here is a quick little example create a canvas and call canvassed opposition and look how this is formatted it's formatted at example with a div with code class equals no render because the code isnt rendered or maybe it should be rendered I don't know and then a closed code tag close div tag so I'm going to go here and I'm just going to copy paste this pause point to editing the video so now what I'm going to do oh we're sorry I'm going to come back so now what I'm going to do is I'm let's look for the ID function so I'm going to look for ID equals equals function I got to find it oh you know why it's not here tricky tricky tricky hold on pause oh no p 5 element why are some here and some aren't here that's interesting oh no it's here it's got to be here that's weird okay hold on I'm having trouble finding this function so that this is going to have to get edited me searching edited out well done there it is oh it's in p5 so that's interesting some of the functions in p5 Dom I went off on a tangent here I don't know if this is going to be useful well I'll just keep my tangent i don't know if i should make this a QA answer yeah I'm gonna okay I'm gonna go back to where of us and now I know where it is back I couldn't find the function that I want to edit here in p5 Dom bjs and actually what I didn't realize is the function ID is a function that assigns a specific ID to a Dom element and it's not actually in the p5 DOM is function I'm sorry add on it because it comes with core p5 it's actually part of Corps p5 and for that I need to go to source and then I'm looking for p5 a core p 5 element jes and here it is so I want to look for ID equals whoops ID equals and now here's that function and you'll notice that function does not have an example so let's just do this right now we're going to live on youtube on the air make an example in submit a pull request am i logged into i'm logged in as Schiffman that's going to be a bit of a problem that's fine so I'm going to hit edit because I have privileges to make changes so I have to make sure so now I want to look for ID equals and I'm going to go right here and I'm going to paste that in oh I lost it so hold on I got a I got to get back to lib addons p5 dumb and I'm going to search for what was one that we liked position position here it is I got to get this example stuff right here I'm going to go back here and now i'm going to zoom in here so you can see what i'm doing i'm going to paste this in here ooh so i need to fix this that the spacing is right you know I could be more thoughtful about this and then I need to make sure this is closed so now you can see I've added the code for an example but this is the code for the position so what I want to do is do make given an ID I'll make that ID my canvas and then what this does is already come assigns a CSS selector ID to the canvas element so I don't know if anybody so this is now adding a quick little example that shows you how you can use the ID function and then oh this German going on in the chat now and then I'm going to go down to the bottom and I want to create a new branch and start a pull request so adding in line example for ID function I'm gonna write I'm live on YouTube demonstrating how to make a pull request and add an inline in line example so once i do that i'm going to click proposed file change and there's some guidelines for contributing that i could click at and i want to see and i'm going to create this this you can see my change is just in this one p 5 element it adds just this code and i'm going to say create pull request and it's going to do some checks to make sure things are okay and we'll see and on Thursday this Thursday is coding rainbow the there will be a mystery will discover was this pull request merged or was it not merged stay tuned to be continued oh I need a sound effect for dun dun dun is that uh okay I won't look for that right now ok so again I kind of went off in a little bit of tangent of showing you a very specific thing but basically what you the p5 as an environment is designed to be both something they could beginners can use to learn to program and also can learn to contribute to an open source environment and the place to do that first is github the problem with github is it doesn't appear that friendly to you so I would encourage you to check out the wiki's in the development page I would encourage you to tweet at p5 xjs on Twitter to post on the processing forum forum dot processing org and you can go down to the p5 j/s and here are p 5 GS development questions if you post it there and are looking for help on how to contribute post there send me a tweet so I can look at your posts and help answer it as well as i'd recommend checking out luis's videos and also something you can just literally do to be a part of the the

chipmunk that's the name of the sound effect i'm looking for and hopefully this video was somewhat useful about a little bit about how you can get started contributing to p5 Jess thanks for watching okay thanks everybody for tuning in to this extra bonus live session I will be back on Thursday will it be merged will it not i don't know and i will see you guys soon can anyone share link to github i know that i can so i'm going to type this in that should be the github repository now i just shared it to the chat so thanks you guys for tuning in today for being a part of i know you guys want me to do a coded challenge but unfortunately i have to leave and yes oh by the way I had some meetings today and I alvaro makes a good point and I am planning to have some guests on to talk about their work and different project very soon so that's actually something that's coming I'm excited about integrating that into these sort of like live sessions beyond just programming tutorials on so I'm gonna do definitely do a coding challenge on Thursday just some interesting algorithm that makes a pattern or a game so make your voice heard in if you're part of the patrons you can post what you think would be good for thursday and the slack or you can also just post to the rainbow topics github issues and i will see you guys soon i'm going to unfortunately press this button but i'm going to go back to having some music to play you guys out so this is random this is noise pearly noise that is in the core random algorithm the actual random algorithm itself those numbers aren't related
