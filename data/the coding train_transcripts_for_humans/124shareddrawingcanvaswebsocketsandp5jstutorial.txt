00:00 - here we are the moment of truth part 4
00:03 - we now have a node server running it's a
00:06 - socket server I have two clients going
00:08 - in two different browser windows both
00:10 - connecting to the server but if I move
00:13 - my mouse around here to draw I don't see
00:16 - the result of that drawing in this one
00:18 - over here so what I need to do now is
00:20 - add the last piece as I move the mouse
00:22 - in a client I need to send a message
00:25 - once I and then in the server I need to
00:29 - receive that message and send it out to
00:30 - everybody else so let's see if we can
00:33 - make that happen so the first step is
00:34 - let's add code in the client to send a
00:38 - message so I'm going to go to sublime
00:40 - here where I have all my different
00:41 - pieces and this is my client code I have
00:44 - a socket variable and I connect to the
00:46 - server so what I want to do is I'm what
00:50 - I'm going to do is in I'm going to write
00:52 - a function called Mouse dragged the
00:54 - mouse drag function you'll see is a
01:06 - function the event function that's
01:07 - triggered whenever I drag the mouse and
01:09 - so if I add that in and put the concepts
01:13 - wrong console put the console in and I
01:16 - hit refresh
01:17 - you can see out when I whenever I drag
01:20 - the mouse and you can see that I'm
01:23 - printing out those mouse coordinates so
01:25 - that's where I want to send I just
01:26 - realized there's sort of a flaw in my
01:27 - program which is that I also want to
01:31 - draw in Mouse dragged as well so now
01:33 - right after I move the mouse nothing
01:36 - happens but if I drag I move the mouse
01:37 - and I see the coordinates spitting out
01:39 - in the console so now what I want to do
01:41 - is I need to create a message that I'm
01:43 - going to send and the way you create a
01:45 - message is two things you need a name
01:47 - for the message which is a string of
01:49 - text and you need the data for that
01:51 - message which is just a JavaScript
01:52 - object so the data for that message is
01:56 - I'm going to say X is Mouse x and y is
02:00 - Mouse y so this is the content of my
02:03 - message I want to send the mouse X
02:05 - announce Y value and then I also need a
02:07 - name so I think I say socket emit Mouse
02:13 - dot data and so I'll change this to
02:16 - saying sending so now in the code you
02:23 - see this is really the sort of crucial
02:25 - part right here which is that I when I
02:28 - want to send a message I create a
02:29 - JavaScript object with the data in it I
02:31 - then say socket dot emit I name the
02:34 - message the name is important because
02:35 - it's a yours making a protocol like what
02:37 - if you have a whole lot of different
02:38 - messages and you do different things
02:39 - based on what the name of the message is
02:41 - that's a way to in this case I don't
02:43 - really have to worry about that but
02:44 - that's kind of important and then I
02:46 - attach the data to it so now I've sent
02:48 - the message now let's first even just
02:50 - run run the sketch to make sure there
02:54 - aren't any weird errors you know sending
02:56 - you can see that it's sending that stuff
02:58 - seems to be working I don't get any
02:59 - errors and the server I don't see
03:02 - anything happening in the server because
03:03 - I haven't written the code to receive
03:06 - the message so now I need to go to the
03:08 - server to write that code server code
03:12 - right here this is the function where
03:19 - that is triggered when there's a new
03:20 - socket connection so what if this
03:23 - particular socket connection sends a
03:26 - message right
03:26 - not just any message I want what if a
03:29 - message comes from this particular
03:31 - client so I should be able to say socket
03:34 - dot on Mouse
03:36 - you know Mouse message I don't know if
03:40 - that's right let me look at my cheat
03:42 - sheet over here yeah look that's right
03:44 - so what I what I'm saying is if this if
03:48 - there's a message called Mouse trigger
03:51 - this function so I'm going to write that
03:54 - function now and I'm just going to say
03:58 - console dot log data so this is now I
04:03 - have a server the server is waiting for
04:06 - connections when there's a new
04:07 - connection I say there's a new
04:08 - connection when there's a message it
04:10 - logs that particular message so let's
04:14 - take a look at this working now so one
04:16 - thing I need to do is I need to restart
04:18 - the server now incidentally there's a
04:21 - way using a tool called node Mon which
04:23 - maybe I should show you at some point to
04:24 - auto restart a server every time
04:26 - you change code but I'm not going to
04:28 - worry about that right now I can hit
04:29 - control-c and start it again so I'm
04:31 - running the server everything is connect
04:32 - reconnected automatically but I'm going
04:34 - to refresh anyway and you can see it's
04:36 - sending sending sending and look at this
04:39 - receiving come on you can do it let me
04:41 - move this over here I'm going to move
04:43 - the mouse around here you can see look
04:45 - I'm sending and I'm receiving for this
04:47 - is getting good
04:48 - I'm sending and I'm receiving I'm
04:50 - sending and I'm receiving but I am not
04:54 - sending again to receive over here right
04:57 - the message went from here and then it
04:59 - went to here now I need it to go here
05:01 - and incidentally if a message from here
05:03 - goes to there I needed to go to there
05:05 - let's see is that happening move this
05:07 - back over here right it's happening here
05:12 - it's happening here you can't see it but
05:14 - it is so the messages are coming into
05:18 - the server but they're not going back
05:20 - out so what do I need to do to have them
05:23 - go back out so I'm going to go to my
05:24 - code and I don't have this memorized so
05:27 - else I'm going to go to my the example I
05:29 - made earlier and I'm going to grab this
05:31 - bit of code whoops sorry everybody I'm
05:34 - in the wrong place a million times over
05:36 - and I'm going to add this back in right
05:40 - I could remembered that so what do I
05:42 - want to do when a message comes in when
05:47 - a mouse message comes in I want to call
05:50 - the broadcast dot emit function to send
05:53 - a message back out what do I want to
05:55 - send back out that exact same message
05:57 - and what do I want to call it Mouse so
05:59 - you can see there's a lot of
06:00 - possibilities here a message that comes
06:02 - in could be parsed altered changed
06:04 - renamed sent back out but I'm not doing
06:07 - that in this sort of simple example I'm
06:08 - just taking the literal message in the
06:10 - name and the data and I'm sending the
06:12 - exact same back out name the data now
06:14 - incidentally we have this question here
06:17 - I'm going to go back to all this let's
06:20 - say the message comes from this client
06:22 - into the server do I want that message
06:24 - then to go back out to blue back back
06:28 - out to both of them or do I want so
06:31 - message comes in goes back out to both
06:33 - of them or do I want message to come in
06:35 - and only go to this one or if there was
06:37 - another one to go to the other two in
06:39 - this case
06:40 - I don't want the message to come back to
06:43 - myself but in other cases you might but
06:45 - I want to show you I'm going to keep
06:46 - this in the code example that I upload
06:49 - that there is this is another way of
06:51 - writing this code I'm going to put it
06:54 - right here if I were to say instead
06:59 - reference the global the more not the
07:02 - specific socket to omit to everyone else
07:05 - but this i/o dot sockets which kind of
07:07 - refers to everything it will also
07:09 - include the client that sent the message
07:11 - so I'm going to leave that in there as a
07:12 - sort of separate side possibility but
07:15 - really we're kind of golden here we've
07:17 - got messages coming in and the message
07:19 - going back out but the message does not
07:22 - get received by the client so I've got
07:24 - to also go back to the client now and
07:26 - I've got to add something that handles
07:30 - the message coming in socket dot on
07:35 - Mouse and I'm going to say new drawing
07:39 - so now if this particular socket
07:42 - receives a message called new drawing
07:45 - what should it do well it should draw
07:51 - and I'm just going to grab exactly this
07:53 - same code it should draw something but
07:57 - at data X data dot Y and let's make it a
08:00 - different color just so we can see it's
08:02 - different so this is now saying in
08:04 - addition this particular sketch should
08:08 - set up an event handler for when a
08:09 - message comes in right it's kind of
08:11 - confusing the same sketch is both has
08:14 - functions for sending out and receiving
08:16 - because it's not like there's two
08:17 - different sketches running there's two
08:19 - different instances of the same sketch
08:21 - so if this one sends this one receives
08:24 - but they both have but if this one sends
08:26 - this one receives they both have the
08:27 - sending and receiving code in them now I
08:29 - might have missed something I'm going to
08:31 - feel ambitious though and just run it
08:33 - because I don't have this stuff
08:34 - memorized so these whoops let's go to
08:37 - the browser here I'm going to refresh
08:39 - and refresh and see oh no I didn't miss
08:42 - anything so you can see it works
08:44 - beautiful oh that's so nice so you know
08:47 - there's so many possibilities here and
08:49 - you know incidentally we are being
08:52 - really
08:54 - there is absolutely no reason why I
08:59 - shouldn't add a third one just to
09:01 - demonstrate what's really going on here
09:03 - so now if I hit refresh here right you
09:07 - can see him let me let me refresh all of
09:09 - these okay here we go I'm going to draw
09:18 - a heart because I love you all for
09:22 - watching this video
09:23 - two hearts for the two people left who
09:26 - are still watching this video and then
09:28 - I'm going to fill in the heart here
09:29 - because that will make it pink on the
09:31 - other two look at this this is way too
09:34 - much fun I'm going to mess around with
09:35 - this later after I turn this video up
09:37 - but you can see the idea here is we have
09:39 - all the pieces we have a node good now
09:43 - remember we have a node server that's
09:45 - hosting a p5 sketch note server is
09:48 - running Express and opening socket
09:50 - connections whatever a client runs it
09:53 - connects via socket to the server if it
09:55 - sends messages to the server the server
09:56 - receives that message and sends it back
09:58 - out to all the other clients not
10:00 - including the original one let me show
10:02 - you again where all the pieces of that
10:03 - to the code are so here this is let me
10:08 - look at the directory of files right
10:10 - this is everything you need the server
10:13 - jeff has the code for running the server
10:15 - and receiving socket messages and send
10:17 - them back out to the clients inside
10:19 - public is my p5.js sketch in sketch Jess
10:23 - I have the client code which sends
10:25 - messages of the server and then also
10:27 - receives messages from the server so if
10:29 - I go to that server we can see all I'm
10:33 - doing is I have new connection I have a
10:37 - function and handles new connections and
10:39 - a function that receives messages and
10:41 - sends them back out immediately and if I
10:43 - go to the client I have I have a
10:48 - variable that connects to the server
10:50 - it handles new messages and also has a
10:54 - function it when the mouse tracked for
10:56 - sending messages so sending receiving
10:58 - sending receiving server client node
11:00 - Express socket p5.js all of those things
11:04 - make this particular example I will have
11:07 - all
11:07 - all of the code on github I hope that
11:10 - you make something with this do
11:11 - something different I'm sure I miss some
11:14 - stuff so leave things in the comments I
11:16 - will add some addendum videos to pick up
11:18 - items I administer maybe how to deploy
11:20 - this somewhere or other kinds of
11:22 - messages that you could send and let me
11:24 - know and have a good day with your
11:27 - sockets and hearts and things like that

Cleaned transcript:

here we are the moment of truth part 4 we now have a node server running it's a socket server I have two clients going in two different browser windows both connecting to the server but if I move my mouse around here to draw I don't see the result of that drawing in this one over here so what I need to do now is add the last piece as I move the mouse in a client I need to send a message once I and then in the server I need to receive that message and send it out to everybody else so let's see if we can make that happen so the first step is let's add code in the client to send a message so I'm going to go to sublime here where I have all my different pieces and this is my client code I have a socket variable and I connect to the server so what I want to do is I'm what I'm going to do is in I'm going to write a function called Mouse dragged the mouse drag function you'll see is a function the event function that's triggered whenever I drag the mouse and so if I add that in and put the
