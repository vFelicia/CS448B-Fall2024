02:36 - [Music]
03:18 - check one two this is my audio test if
03:23 - you can hear me let me know in the chat
03:24 - and enjoy seeing where everyone is from
03:27 - most recently we've got Catalonia
03:30 - Swedish and outer space
03:33 - [Music]
03:35 - all right I'm using this mic again and
03:38 - we'll be starting up in just a couple
03:40 - minutes
03:41 - [Music]
03:49 - thank you

06:07 - foreign
06:09 - [Music]
06:40 - well I didn't realize that was going to
06:42 - happen I haven't used this setup in a
06:44 - little while I'm hoping you can all hear
06:46 - me as well as the music which is about
06:49 - to fade away in five four three two one
06:53 - and we're live I mean I already was live
06:55 - but now I'm really here and I'm looking
06:57 - at myself
06:58 - in my screen that's in front of me and
07:02 - looking at the camera lens and saying
07:03 - hello to all of you it's been a while
07:06 - uh the traditional greeting of course on
07:08 - the coding train is a train whistle
07:11 - I'm gonna just take a peek over in the
07:13 - chat that says now I hear you we see you
07:16 - okay
07:19 - um so I'm assuming it's all working I
07:21 - see ITP is in the chat saying choo choo
07:23 - the catchphrase of the coding Train choo
07:27 - choo so let me just stay right from the
07:29 - outright
07:30 - um this isn't your usual I don't I don't
07:32 - first of all I don't know what your
07:33 - usual coding train stream would be but
07:36 - whatever in your mind you think of as
07:39 - the usual coding train stream uh it is
07:41 - not what is happening today because
07:43 - today is a celebration of the end of the
07:48 - Academic Year here in New York City I'm
07:50 - not actually in New York City right now
07:52 - but I will be there tomorrow
07:54 - um I'm broadcasting from the outer
07:56 - skirts the country uh life The Wind and
07:59 - The Greenery is blowing the the wind is
08:02 - blowing The Greenery outside I don't
08:04 - know what I'm saying
08:05 - uh today is the ITP IMA uh spring show
08:08 - and if you've followed the coding train
08:10 - for
08:12 - you know what is now amounting to many
08:14 - many years I don't know if we've really
08:16 - gotten into double digits yet but
08:18 - um I would often do a live stream from
08:21 - the show itself
08:23 - and today is a little bit different I am
08:25 - doing a live stream from my studio my
08:27 - home studio and then I will be passing
08:30 - the mic I will be sending you all right
08:33 - into Brooklyn downtown Brooklyn New York
08:35 - to see the wonder that is the ITP IMA
08:38 - show and if you don't know what that is
08:39 - I will start talking about that with a
08:41 - bit more detail in a moment I'm seeing
08:44 - from the chat that we've got Japan
08:46 - Ireland Africa Tunisia this to me I know
08:51 - I say this often this is what I love
08:55 - about getting to do this Channel on
08:57 - YouTube is to be able to connect with
09:01 - and broadcast beam out
09:05 - right here from a garage in the Hudson
09:08 - Valley of New York all over the world to
09:10 - talk about creative coding and all the
09:13 - things the magical fun wonderful things
09:15 - you can do with code whether you are a
09:18 - beginner and this is your first time
09:20 - ever thinking about code or thinking
09:23 - about writing a line of code or watching
09:24 - the coding train or you've been here all
09:27 - along for however many years this train
09:30 - has been in service
09:32 - um it's been a little bit out of service
09:34 - this semester just I I do want to use
09:37 - this time to give you some updates about
09:40 - things that are happening in the coding
09:42 - train and particular about the nature of
09:44 - code book which is something I am
09:46 - actively working on we've got now
09:48 - Dominican Republic Syria Czech Republic
09:50 - Denmark and Korea uh out of that list
09:54 - I've only ever been to Denmark so I've
09:56 - definitely got to expand my world travel
10:00 - um all right so um this is also can be
10:04 - as much or little of an interactive
10:06 - stream as you like I'm keeping whenever
10:09 - I look over this way I am looking at the
10:12 - chat and if I catch a question there
10:16 - um you can I'll try to answer it as well
10:19 - as
10:21 - there are a few coding train moderators
10:24 - who are in the chat who can take a
10:27 - question and place it over here into the
10:31 - coding train member Discord so if you
10:34 - want access
10:35 - to that member Discord you can also join
10:37 - the coding train Channel but that's not
10:38 - what today is about I want to talk to
10:39 - you about ITP and Ima
10:42 - so
10:44 - um let me switch over here let's see if
10:46 - this button Works Cuba Netherlands Italy
10:49 - uh Basque Country okay I'm gonna press
10:53 - this I'm a little out of practice here
10:55 - so let's see
10:56 - um
10:57 - what's going on I can't find the button
10:59 - left here it is there we go okay I've
11:01 - made myself a little bit smaller I'm
11:03 - realizing I really need to
11:05 - go for a beard trim
11:08 - um and I've got the uh my browser opened
11:11 - up here okay so um you might know me
11:14 - from the coding train a YouTube channel
11:16 - where I uh live inside a little
11:19 - rectangle and awkwardly try to
11:21 - communicate with the rest of the world
11:24 - but most of my time is in fact spent at
11:28 - a teaching at a program at New York
11:30 - University uh there is a two-year
11:33 - graduate program called ITP stands for
11:35 - interactive telecommunications program
11:37 - there is a four-year undergraduate BFA
11:41 - IMA interactive media arts there is also
11:46 - a low Residency program which is a
11:49 - one-year Master's which can be done
11:51 - mostly remote with a few in-person
11:55 - intensive intensives hopefully I'm
11:58 - getting this somewhat right and that is
12:00 - called the IMA low-res program so if any
12:03 - of those programs are of interest to you
12:05 - I would suggest heading on over to
12:09 - itp.nyu.edu and there's all sorts of
12:12 - more more and more all sorts of
12:14 - information there ah we see I see it now
12:16 - you've got ITP IMA which is
12:18 - undergraduate and then the IMA low
12:20 - Residency program oh there's also this
12:23 - thing called ITP Camp which I am really
12:25 - hoping to participate in this year we'll
12:27 - see if I can make that happen but this
12:29 - is a four-week creative and Cooperative
12:32 - playground playground which is all
12:34 - happening in June so that's coming right
12:36 - up I think you can even still apply to
12:38 - participate in ITP Camp so why don't you
12:41 - use ARC as your default browser yeah
12:43 - that's a good question maybe I should
12:46 - I I accept your criticisms of my use of
12:50 - Google Chrome I use it frankly out of
12:52 - convenience uh
12:55 - oh
12:56 - wait a second here
12:58 - I'm like
13:00 - oh I have the okay I'm like why is my
13:02 - shirt red so okay so I know I know I
13:05 - just went off on a tangent welcome to
13:07 - the coding train where I talk about both
13:09 - uh trigonometric functions like sine
13:12 - cosine and tangent but mostly just go
13:14 - off on tangents
13:17 - all right
13:19 - um
13:21 - uh with love from Saturn okay so I have
13:25 - a new setup where I'm using a confidence
13:28 - monitor with this like reflective glass
13:31 - teleprompter setup So in theory if I
13:33 - wanted to use a teleprompter I could I
13:35 - clearly am not using a teleprompter
13:36 - right now otherwise it would make more
13:38 - sense and one of the things I turned on
13:40 - is like this setting that shows me if
13:43 - any of the pixels are peaking I think
13:45 - like the like my white balance or
13:48 - brightness those of you who are video
13:49 - people know what I'm talking about and
13:51 - my whole shirt has turned red uh which
13:54 - is what I'm seeing in the confidence
13:55 - minor but I look over here to see what's
13:57 - being broadcast to YouTube it still
13:59 - looks normal all right uh
14:03 - um
14:04 - all right so where was I yes talking
14:07 - about ITB so first of all
14:10 - it is about 1pm eastern time and if you
14:14 - happen to be in the New York City area
14:15 - you should just turn this off right now
14:18 - and head on over to 370 J Street uh
14:23 - which is in downtown Brooklyn all the
14:25 - Subways go there to go to the show in
14:28 - person let's switch on over to the show
14:31 - website which I can find at itp.nyu.edu
14:33 - show
14:36 - um so here you'll see the information
14:38 - about the actual in-person show today
14:41 - it's starting at 2PM so this is just me
14:43 - talking for about another hour and you
14:46 - know maybe I'll do a quick coding demo
14:48 - or something if we have time or if
14:49 - there's a topic that comes up
14:52 - um
14:53 - default Focus confirmation is what
14:55 - Andrew Dennis is telling me and thank
14:58 - you for your nice comment souvik
15:01 - um so
15:03 - um
15:04 - um today and tomorrow so you can if you
15:06 - can come in person
15:07 - um however don't just show up you need
15:10 - for in terms of the security system that
15:13 - way it works at NYU you'll need to go
15:15 - through and claim your tickets it's free
15:17 - but you need to make sure you enter the
15:19 - name and email address of each attendee
15:22 - um so I will be there tomorrow in person
15:25 - um and I'm not there in person today I'm
15:28 - doing this pre-show
15:29 - all right so this is the information
15:31 - about the show now it looks like if I
15:34 - click over here I can see the show map
15:37 - wow what is this going to take where is
15:38 - this going to take me it's taking me to
15:40 - figma all right this is this is much to
15:42 - uh this is much too advanced for me
15:45 - right now but we can see the floor and
15:47 - where all the projects are ooh I wonder
15:49 - if we can look at some of the projects
15:51 - that's what that's one thing we could do
15:52 - during today's live stream uh previous
15:54 - shows show map projects let's go over
15:56 - here ah so now we're seeing all of the
15:59 - projects wonderful
16:00 - um one of the things I might do is look
16:02 - at the various projects that are part of
16:06 - uh the nature of code which is a course
16:10 - that I taught this semester and is a
16:14 - project a now
16:18 - I mean a well over 10-year project
16:22 - um that is really bothering me that my
16:24 - shirt is red as I look I should probably
16:26 - turn that setting off but there's
16:28 - nothing I can do about it
16:30 - um
16:31 - so uh I want to talk about the nature
16:33 - field let me make a list of things so I
16:35 - want to update you on coding train
16:37 - schedule and summer
16:42 - um and I want to update you on nature of
16:44 - code
16:46 - and then I want to review
16:48 - some ITP projects
16:51 - and we are on a time crunch here this
16:54 - stream will promptly shut down in about
16:57 - an hour and if YouTube's live redirect
17:00 - feature works it will send you right
17:03 - over to the actual ITP live stream
17:06 - um oops no that's not what I was going
17:08 - to move it if you look at this video's
17:10 - description there should be a link to
17:12 - the ITP live stream which is a separate
17:15 - YouTube event on a separate Channel
17:16 - what's figma I am not qualified to
17:19 - answer that question somebody in the
17:21 - chat feel free to answer what is figma I
17:23 - will take your questions about
17:25 - processing P5 creative code the coding
17:29 - train nature of code all that stuff
17:31 - which you can ask in the chat all right
17:34 - uh thank you Ellery chainan for
17:38 - answering that question about figma all
17:41 - right what do I want to look at first
17:43 - all right let's just let's Dive Right In
17:45 - and I'll take questions as we go but let
17:48 - me give you some updates about the
17:50 - coding train itself so uh if you I
17:54 - haven't done a live stream probably I
17:55 - think I did the the last one was the
17:57 - January uh speed run
18:00 - I can't remember if I covered this at
18:03 - all but if you haven't
18:04 - taken the time to look at the new coding
18:06 - Train website now is a wonderful
18:08 - opportunity for you to do so I will soon
18:11 - be releasing about a five minute video
18:14 - about the new coding Train website
18:17 - um but just to cover it a little bit
18:19 - right now here it is uh thank you to the
18:22 - wonderful Folks at DSi Design Systems
18:25 - International who designed this site uh
18:27 - thank you to the tremendous efforts of
18:29 - the coding train Community
18:32 - um to name just a few who have been very
18:34 - active recently uh Kathy depalm and
18:38 - Francis who have been doing a tremendous
18:41 - amount of work fixing bugs and expanding
18:43 - the content of the channel uh the
18:46 - website that is also a shout out to
18:50 - um Klein who is an IMA student who built
18:53 - this overall structure for uh this
18:56 - showcase page which I want to come and
18:58 - look at in a bit more detail in a minute
19:00 - so um
19:02 - what uh this is where you can find the
19:05 - archive of the history of the coding
19:06 - train not every single video that's on
19:09 - the channel is on the website if there
19:11 - is a video that's on the channel That
19:13 - should be on the website uh please
19:16 - um there is a wonderful process by which
19:18 - you can contribute but what do I mean
19:20 - why does a video have a page on the
19:23 - website well if I go to what is the more
19:26 - a popular series from the coding train
19:28 - like the challenges you'll see that
19:30 - every challenge I think there might be
19:32 - one missing still coding Challenge
19:34 - number 40. every challenge has its own
19:36 - page here if I were to pick one I'm
19:39 - actually just going to pick this one
19:40 - that's featured right now the 3D terrain
19:42 - and go to it the reason for this is
19:45 - there is a lot I'm just amused by the
19:48 - thumbnail
19:49 - um there's a lot of metadata associated
19:51 - with each and every video that is not
19:54 - easily covered by the YouTube interface
19:57 - and so if you are looking for the code
20:00 - example it's right here uh description
20:02 - other references other related videos
20:05 - credits for the video as well as
20:08 - projects this is now the passenger
20:10 - showcase for this which are all the
20:12 - projects that other folks have made some
20:14 - of these are just so lovely
20:17 - um and they're I think they're in a
20:18 - random Order each time so if we refresh
20:21 - the page yet you can see they're in a
20:22 - random Order each time as well as some
20:25 - other related challenges of related
20:26 - topics so this is my attempt along with
20:31 - DSI and the larger coding train
20:33 - Community to
20:35 - you know I have over a thousand videos
20:37 - on the channel and so to have a kind of
20:39 - One-Stop shopping place where you can
20:42 - find the videos as well as all of the
20:44 - metadata and and code that goes along
20:46 - with those videos so and dpom
20:50 - um in the member chat as you put wrote
20:53 - new with giant quotes around it because
20:56 - uh yeah the website that I don't know
20:59 - how new it is anymore it's new to me ah
21:01 - lovely a72 is saying I am coming to Tish
21:04 - this year well I hope to get to meet you
21:07 - in person please stop by the fourth
21:09 - floor uh that's where I am
21:12 - um and so you know just just to look I
21:15 - just want to go back to the challenges
21:16 - page for a second oh actually no no let
21:18 - me pause pause time out and just let me
21:21 - go to the track space so I'm showing you
21:23 - these are the challenges which are
21:25 - videos which are essentially a single
21:27 - project made in a particular video
21:30 - um if I go to the tracks page this is
21:34 - where I am cataloging videos that exist
21:39 - as a sequence well as a let's let's just
21:42 - use the word collection so a track you
21:44 - can think of it as a sequence and some
21:46 - of them are the main tracks which are
21:47 - written right here our sequences so if
21:49 - for some reason you just came out of
21:52 - nowhere and are watching me right now on
21:53 - the internet and wondering boy I wish I
21:56 - could just start from the total
21:58 - beginning I've never coded before and I
22:00 - want to learn that is what this main
22:03 - track code programming with P5 would be
22:06 - you can click into here all the videos
22:10 - um all the videos are here if I go to
22:12 - any given one very old thumbnail the
22:15 - code is here as well as you know
22:16 - showcase projects that people have made
22:18 - so this would be your playlist your
22:21 - track your collection your sequence your
22:23 - course whatever you want to call it for
22:25 - learning to code with P5
22:28 - um there are other ones uh sort of this
22:30 - one deals with node and working with
22:32 - apis a little bit about git and GitHub
22:35 - so machine learning nature of code I'm
22:37 - going to come talk about more but there
22:39 - are also these Side Tracks which are
22:41 - loose collections of videos so if you
22:43 - ever wanted to learn about super shapes
22:45 - all of the super shape videos are right
22:48 - here ah this polar coordinates is not
22:51 - explicitly a super shape video but it is
22:53 - a necessary math that comes up in the
22:57 - Super ellipse uh this uh and all of
23:00 - these other particular videos
23:02 - along with the mandelbub is in here okay
23:04 - great and then if I uh backtrack here we
23:07 - can see there's some games algorithmic
23:08 - botany et cetera et cetera et cetera
23:10 - okay so that is the uh that's pretty
23:14 - much the website
23:16 - um there are lots of other things here
23:17 - like these guides if you want to like
23:19 - learn about submitting to the Showcase
23:21 - or helping maintain the website getting
23:23 - started is there
23:26 - um I forgot to I did forget to say Happy
23:27 - Mother's Day happy Mother's Day
23:31 - um and
23:33 - that okay so what did I want to show
23:36 - next here right my mind was going
23:38 - somewhere
23:40 - well let's look at some showcase
23:41 - projects
23:42 - because there's been some new ones first
23:44 - of all it seems that we have a showcase
23:47 - project from Kai who is nine years old
23:50 - so first let's everybody round of
23:52 - applause
23:53 - see if this works a round of applause
23:57 - for
23:58 - taking me way too long to figure out if
24:00 - my soundboard still works
24:02 - and of course it didn't work you know
24:04 - what my I'm using this software called
24:06 - loopback and it's right now causing me
24:09 - all sorts of issues
24:12 - there we go all right there's the
24:15 - Applause
24:17 - thank you it's not for me it's for Kai
24:20 - uh so Kai created this project called
24:23 - cave generation with Perla noise based
24:26 - off of the 10 print video let's take a
24:29 - look at this
24:32 - oh cool ah I see so what I I'm kind of
24:35 - guessing here because I didn't make this
24:37 - or I haven't looked at the code but what
24:39 - this to me looks like is
24:43 - um oh and Sesame Street gang is asking
24:45 - what's ITP I made so I did cover that a
24:47 - little bit already but I will come back
24:48 - to that
24:49 - um looks like here 10 print is a
24:52 - particular Graphics pattern that emerges
24:55 - this maze-like pattern when you randomly
24:57 - draw a line diagonally in one of two
25:01 - directions like think of an X pick
25:03 - randomly whether you're drawing this
25:04 - line from the X or this line over a grid
25:07 - so it looks like what Kai has done here
25:09 - is instead of drawing a line has drawn a
25:12 - square with two different colors and I
25:16 - it's called I'm again I'm speculating
25:17 - but uh it's called cave generation
25:19 - because through Randomness you end up
25:22 - getting these pockets of empty uh like
25:26 - like the lighter spots to me or like
25:28 - empty spaces inside the cave where you
25:30 - could walk around and the darker spots
25:31 - of the walls of the game now but I don't
25:33 - think this is pure Randomness because it
25:37 - looks like there is a bit of smooth
25:38 - uniform quality here which is probably
25:41 - coming from purlin noise and if you
25:43 - don't know what pearling noise is oh boy
25:45 - do I have news for you remember that
25:47 - whole thing about the tracks that I was
25:49 - showing on the website got a whole track
25:51 - all about what is Pearl and noise let's
25:52 - take a look at Kai's code see if I'm my
25:55 - speculation was at all correct and we
25:58 - can see here there are functions for
26:00 - drawing the backslash and forward slash
26:02 - which instead of a line is a rectangle
26:06 - and then aha exactly and the some kind
26:10 - of calculation related to purlin noise
26:12 - this is very interesting here
26:15 - the input into the noise is this
26:17 - mathematical equation based on the X Y
26:20 - location and then checking it against
26:23 - another call to noise that's super
26:25 - interesting way I have to think it's
26:27 - going to take me some time for my brain
26:28 - to unpack like what the quality of of uh
26:33 - the coin flipping essentially will come
26:37 - out of this way of comparing noise
26:40 - um but we can look someone is asking
26:42 - like I can now run this in P5 and if we
26:45 - wanted to look at what pure Randomness
26:47 - would look like and I don't know let me
26:49 - log in here as the coding train
26:52 - um so that we can save this
26:55 - and make some modifications so let's
26:58 - look at what it would be with pure
27:01 - Randomness so I can just comment out
27:03 - this if statement and say instead if
27:05 - random 1 is less than 0.5 which would be
27:08 - like the pure Randomness version of it
27:12 - and there you can see now
27:14 - oh interesting
27:16 - it looks like this spacing changed
27:22 - the spacing must oh oh the spacing's
27:25 - random each time okay I'm like why did
27:27 - the spacing change yeah so so some great
27:30 - questions happening in the um chat which
27:34 - is uh
27:36 - yes there's a noise so yeah uh just I
27:39 - don't know if I'm answering the question
27:40 - specifically but there is a function in
27:42 - P5 called noise now the term noise on
27:45 - its own really means Randomness but
27:48 - noise in P the random function uh in P5
27:51 - is for uniform Randomness and the noise
27:54 - function is for a smooth kind of
27:57 - Randomness referred to as purlin noise
27:58 - and if you want to learn more about this
28:01 - uh we're going to be talking about the
28:02 - nature of code in just a moment so thank
28:04 - you Kai this was fun this is great to
28:06 - see this project
28:07 - um a couple things I might note here
28:09 - Kai's probably not watching right now
28:10 - but um this frame rate this this of of
28:14 - 1000 is uh not something that
28:18 - um will really actually work
28:20 - um this is sort of like the frame rate I
28:22 - like to say that the argument to the
28:24 - frame rate is aspirational
28:26 - it is not actually setting the frame
28:29 - rate to a particular value
28:31 - it is saying like I want you if you can
28:34 - to run at this frame rate so uh in most
28:37 - cases like
28:39 - P5 I think the default frame rate it's
28:41 - going to Aspire to is 60 frames per
28:44 - second so changing it to 30 would make
28:46 - sense because you're saying like hey
28:47 - even if you could run faster don't just
28:50 - stick with 30 but if if there are other
28:53 - elements the speed of your computer or
28:54 - the things happening in the browser the
28:56 - amount of stuff you're drawing in the
28:57 - draw Loop are that like the the frame
29:00 - rate won't actually live up to its
29:02 - assignment and one thing that's
29:04 - interesting about what Kai's done here
29:06 - is this is generating a static image so
29:09 - I might actually suggest putting in draw
29:12 - a call to no Loop
29:14 - because the the this particular sketch
29:16 - just generates a static image there's no
29:19 - reason to draw it over and over again
29:23 - in which case and I'm wondering actually
29:25 - why
29:28 - oh because it's using noise but why is
29:31 - it not so this is interesting why is it
29:34 - not change changing this
29:37 - over and over again is I don't see a
29:40 - call to random seed
29:42 - a little confused here
29:44 - because this should be
29:49 - just curious what happens if I
29:52 - do this
29:54 - ah it's doing them one at a time ah so
29:56 - that makes sense
29:57 - uh there was this idea of animating it
30:00 - and this is kind of cool to see it do it
30:02 - this way and I you know we could I can
30:05 - now
30:07 - change that to 60 just to kind of max
30:09 - out the frame rate you can see it's
30:10 - running a little faster but why oh
30:15 - I think the reason why it wasn't
30:19 - um
30:20 - it it wasn't uh redoing it each time
30:24 - with a new random set of values is
30:27 - because it's moving This Global variable
30:30 - X and Y and once it gets to the end it
30:34 - doesn't reset back so one of the things
30:36 - I could if I wanted to I could say if Y
30:39 - is greater than height
30:41 - I could put this in
30:44 - here
30:45 - if Y is greater than height
30:48 - then now set y also back to zero
30:52 - and what this would do if we can make
30:54 - this run a little bit faster is and
30:57 - let's put it back to doing five thousand
30:59 - of them
31:01 - but let's just do 50.
31:03 - and we can see now it's doing 50 at a
31:06 - time and when it gets to the end it will
31:09 - come back sorry I haven't been keeping
31:11 - track of the chat I'm looking at the
31:12 - Discord
31:14 - uh
31:18 - uh okay as you can see it came back to
31:20 - the top there so just just to put a
31:21 - finer point on this let's make the
31:23 - spacing 30 hard-coded as 30 and let's
31:26 - make this just two and we can see now
31:30 - I've made a new version of Kai's code
31:32 - where when it gets to the bottom
31:35 - it will presumably as we wait
31:40 - because the sound is broken still comes
31:43 - back to the top and starts running over
31:44 - by the way let's just look at it um with
31:46 - the lines I'm curious to see
31:49 - and we'd have to change this to a stroke
31:54 - this is kind of this was not what I
31:56 - meant to do this happened by accident
31:57 - let's take out the rectangles
32:04 - and let's use the
32:06 - ground color for both
32:10 - so this is this is now uh the 10 print
32:13 - pattern so you can see I'm just backing
32:15 - into what the original example was and
32:17 - you can see how Kai now got to this new
32:20 - pattern one by changing the drawing
32:24 - two squares instead of lines whoops
32:28 - and then in addition writing a new
32:32 - algorithm for how the uh spots are
32:36 - picked
32:39 - and we can put the algorithm back in and
32:41 - you can see we get some pretty uh the
32:43 - different results
32:47 - um pyro axo Dragon says never knew you
32:50 - did live streaming yeah well
32:52 - unfortunately it's kind of I'm a little
32:54 - bit I was kind of struggling here
32:56 - because I used to do weekly live streams
32:58 - so the reason why you never knew I did
32:59 - live streaming is because this is only
33:01 - my this is my third live stream of the
33:03 - entire year
33:05 - and it is you know the middle of May so
33:08 - I would like to do more live streams I'm
33:12 - curious about where those artifacts in
33:14 - the pattern are coming from Unchained I
33:16 - wasn't sure I'm not 100 sure about your
33:18 - question because I was doing a lot of
33:20 - different things and may have missed
33:23 - um
33:24 - missed
33:26 - I'm looking at the time 120 I might have
33:28 - missed um the Spy I didn't I didn't
33:31 - catch your question at the moment when I
33:32 - was showing something on the screen so I
33:33 - don't know what it matches up to all
33:35 - right let me move back to the Showcase
33:36 - thank you Kai let's um let's look at um
33:43 - we've got let's look at this one so
33:45 - we've got a showcase project ah right
33:49 - okay so what's one of the things I
33:51 - should get this box hold on
33:54 - it's on my list I I know I just left the
33:56 - I left the camera view
33:58 - we can do a like
34:00 - we could do a little live unboxing today
34:02 - on the channel
34:04 - um so if you uh tuned into the coding
34:08 - train in
34:09 - 20
34:12 - 20 22
34:14 - I did a bunch of videos with my app a
34:18 - childhood Apple II plus computer and I
34:20 - would like to do more of them
34:22 - um and one of the things I wanted to do
34:25 - um is
34:26 - work with a Commodore 64. now the Apple
34:28 - II plus was a computer that I actually
34:31 - had and saved from my childhood I did
34:33 - have to order some replacement parts and
34:35 - things off of eBay to get it working
34:37 - again but it's pretty much the you know
34:40 - it's
34:42 - for all intents and purposes it's the uh
34:44 - it I like to think of it as my the
34:46 - literal childhood computer that I saved
34:48 - for all these years now I did not have a
34:49 - commodore 64.
34:51 - uh but I did find one off of eBay and I
34:54 - and I purchased it to make videos with
34:57 - it it's still sitting in the box like
34:59 - the ship I don't even want to tell you
35:00 - what the ship date on this is because
35:01 - it'll be much too embarrassing wow well
35:03 - let me just tell you that that the ship
35:05 - date is from 2022. very very late in
35:08 - 2022. so I'm just checking here my
35:11 - notifications oh
35:14 - um
35:16 - perfect okay I'm just looking at
35:18 - information about the ITP stream which
35:23 - is starting in 30 minutes and I actually
35:25 - just got a notification about that all
35:27 - right so uh Brooklyn humanist is
35:29 - starting IMA in a month coming in
35:32 - knowing nothing well guess what and real
35:34 - sickness is in the chat hello Enrique
35:37 - the artifacts came from not clearing the
35:39 - background you answered thank you I know
35:41 - there's other questions that I'm not
35:42 - getting to because I'm just off on a
35:44 - trigonometric tangent once again
35:47 - anyway
35:48 - um
35:49 - Brooklyn humanist great name
35:53 - um a today you will now know about IMA
35:55 - because if you stick around through me
35:57 - chatting a little bit about it and then
36:00 - if you watch the show and if you are in
36:03 - Brooklyn I would say go head over to the
36:05 - show in person anyway there's a
36:06 - Commodore 64 in here you gotta open it
36:08 - up maybe I'll open it up today if we
36:11 - have a little time but I'm going to keep
36:12 - moving
36:13 - um so I would love to click on this but
36:16 - um oh
36:18 - oh look at this they made a video for it
36:21 - this is amazing
36:24 - I had I didn't actually know there was
36:25 - an archive of this okay this is awesome
36:28 - we're gonna watch this how long is it
36:31 - four minutes and 16 seconds this is now
36:34 - this is now coding train reacts we're
36:36 - now I have a new channel it's called
36:38 - coding train reacts where the whole time
36:39 - I go like this
36:49 - I don't I don't react verbally I react
36:52 - with interpretive dance
36:57 - this is so cool I didn't realize there
37:00 - was a um
37:06 - video archive of it
37:22 - things
37:42 - Cody Trenton reacts by liking the video
38:00 - oh no I moved out of the way
38:06 - let me just get this comment in
38:22 - I I should really send the music out
38:26 - through the
38:27 - I don't know why this is not working
38:43 - there you go
38:49 - I don't know what's going on I don't
38:50 - know why it's not working Mike but okay
39:00 - okay
39:05 - fractal three
39:07 - let's skip to the end there fractal four
39:23 - fractal five all right thank you for
39:25 - this so that's really fantastic so you
39:27 - can find that so one of the other things
39:29 - that
39:30 - um nice about the passenger Showcase in
39:33 - case you weren't aware is if you click
39:36 - on a given oh no
39:37 - um how do I do that doesn't work from
39:39 - here oh no no I so we I forgot we didn't
39:41 - implement this I thought if you click on
39:43 - the author's name it'll take you to
39:45 - their all of theirs but I would actually
39:47 - just have to look for it here but if you
39:49 - search for a particular author we can
39:51 - see
39:52 - um that BTM 86 is only submitted uh this
39:56 - one but if I go to
39:58 - um
39:59 - Kathy for example who I know has
40:01 - submitted a lot of showcase projects uh
40:03 - so many beautiful ones we can see all of
40:05 - Kathy's submissions right there
40:08 - um and so yeah look at all these
40:11 - wonderful submissions we see a few
40:13 - different climate spirals came in from
40:14 - the climate spiral coating challenge
40:17 - um and look at all these some wave
40:19 - function collapse some more fractal
40:21 - trees so anyway the hope is here that
40:24 - one this is a way for you to share your
40:25 - work with the community but also for you
40:28 - to get inspired and see what other
40:29 - people are making so I think I'm good in
40:31 - terms of talking about the coding Train
40:34 - website
40:38 - um let's let me move on here for um to
40:41 - some other things because I'm short on
40:43 - time okay
40:45 - I'm gonna close this
40:47 - let me save this cave generation sketch
40:49 - that we were just looking at
40:52 - um all right so
40:55 - I did a stream I believe this was
40:57 - January 1st 2023 and I made this list I
41:03 - kind of went through and um
41:06 - on the left here that I'm standing in
41:08 - front of I went through and cataloged
41:10 - all of the things that I did for the on
41:13 - the coding train in 2022 which made me
41:16 - feel a little bit better because if I
41:17 - hadn't done very much and it was it was
41:19 - a long list and then I made a list of
41:21 - goals
41:23 - for uh 2023 and so thank you to depam
41:28 - who took this white board and put it
41:31 - into a markdown file and so I wanted to
41:33 - take you know maybe just about five
41:35 - minutes now uh because we are I have
41:38 - about a half an hour left before I'm
41:39 - going to send you over to ITP
41:42 - um and look through and see what I've
41:45 - got and what I might want to do next
41:47 - because
41:48 - I did not I was not able to
41:52 - allocate a lot of time to the coding
41:55 - train since the start of 2023 I returned
41:59 - back to teaching full-time at NYU but it
42:02 - is the summer now and I'd have a less
42:04 - busy in terms of
42:07 - travel and other types of things summer
42:10 - than I have had in the past so I'm
42:12 - hoping to in addition to enjoying the
42:14 - summer and spending time with family and
42:16 - friends which is something I hope you
42:17 - all will do
42:19 - um I hope to be able to catch up on some
42:21 - of these coding train projects as well
42:23 - as although I really should not be
42:25 - allowed to until I finish the nature of
42:27 - code book so I kind of maybe I might
42:30 - make a poll here uh just to sort of but
42:32 - I think what I really should be doing is
42:35 - I got a lot of work done on the nature
42:36 - of code book and my goal is to finish
42:38 - everything by I was I was going to say
42:40 - the end of May but I think the end of
42:41 - June is more realistic I probably
42:43 - shouldn't allow myself to do anything on
42:45 - the coding train until that book is
42:47 - completely 100 finished and published
42:51 - online and in the Publisher's hands for
42:53 - the print version which I will talk
42:55 - about in a bit
42:56 - but let's take some time to look at this
42:59 - list
43:01 - um okay
43:03 - yeah the list was ambitious so I did do
43:06 - a Pi Day coding challenge
43:11 - and
43:13 - um hold on let's look at
43:17 - what's on the channel actually
43:20 - oh and I did a soft body physics coding
43:22 - Challenge and a climate spiral so
43:26 - I do get to uh let's hit edit here and
43:30 - let's give myself some credit for some
43:32 - other
43:33 - things so I did
43:36 - a soft body physics challenge
43:43 - choose toxic Libs
43:46 - um and I did
43:49 - uh Pi Day
43:52 - and then which was
43:57 - buffon's needle
44:00 - and then I also did the climate spiral
44:04 - so I'm going to update that okay great
44:07 - so I have completed three challenges
44:11 - so that's not terrible given that my
44:14 - goal was to have 10 new coding Challenge
44:15 - videos for the year and I realized there
44:19 - was a time in my life where I was doing
44:21 - like three or four coding challenges per
44:24 - week
44:24 - I don't know how I did that sort of a
44:27 - different I had a different process then
44:28 - maybe I should go back to that I don't
44:30 - know but these this is a good list and I
44:33 - think it's a fine list to keep ah but I
44:36 - do want to add one to it
44:38 - so um I want to do the Wolfram
44:41 - Elementary
44:44 - CA
44:45 - so that is another one and if I do and
44:50 - priority wise I kind of like this order
44:53 - right now because I really wanted this
44:55 - this one I really would like to get the
44:57 - second part of wave function collapse
44:59 - done over the summer
45:01 - okay so that's good guests
45:04 - I want to do more with guests
45:07 - I've not made the time and space for it
45:10 - uh nebula so again today's stream is
45:14 - about the ITP show so I don't want to be
45:17 - too
45:19 - um
45:20 - off topic and promoting my own uh kind
45:24 - of coding train work too much but uh in
45:27 - case you're wondering what nebula is if
45:29 - you go to
45:30 - go.nebula.tv codingtrain
45:35 - um you will find my nebula page nebula
45:38 - is a independent Creator owned and
45:42 - maintained streaming service so if you
45:45 - think about uh your Netflix your Hulu
45:47 - your Amazon Prime your Macs nebula is
45:51 - just like any of those services but the
45:54 - content on nebula is
45:57 - um from you know education adjacent uh
46:02 - YouTubers
46:03 - um uh so it's something that you can
46:06 - sign up for to support the coding train
46:07 - I made a a whole uh
46:10 - I'm gonna see if this course on it uh
46:13 - with the Apple II plus computer so but
46:15 - again I don't want to promote this too
46:17 - much right now today I do want to
46:18 - promote it but another time would be
46:20 - more appropriate for that but I don't
46:22 - want to mention that because
46:25 - um I do have opportunities to create
46:28 - content exclusively for nebula and
46:31 - collaborate with nebula they have studio
46:33 - and production team to work on making
46:36 - things of a different quality and a
46:38 - different scope so if you have ideas for
46:41 - things that you think might work with
46:44 - that platform if you're a fan of nebula
46:46 - let me know I'd love to hear from you
46:48 - um but that's what's up that's what's on
46:50 - this list okay Apple II retro computing
46:53 - so I have not done any of these
46:56 - but this is something that I could
46:58 - return to this summer as well I don't
47:00 - know if I want to focus more on the
47:01 - coding challenges but I wanted to do a
47:05 - quick example on the Apple II for how
47:07 - you can play tones music I wanted to
47:09 - look at 6502 Assembly Language maybe
47:12 - more directly and then the four
47:14 - mentioned oh I hurt my back uh Commodore
47:17 - 64 which is in this box right now okay
47:21 - have not gotten to any of those things
47:23 - uh I want to do more live streams that's
47:26 - just on the list in general
47:28 - more nature of code videos uh well the
47:32 - book has to be completed first so this
47:34 - really shouldn't get a check here I'm
47:35 - going to uncheck it
47:37 - um I have recorded it by the way like if
47:41 - you wondered why you might want to join
47:43 - the coding train like I think if I go
47:45 - here under live you're going to see that
47:47 - like in case you don't believe me
47:50 - um
47:52 - where
47:54 - oh what
47:55 - where did these go
48:04 - so strange that they're not actually
48:06 - here
48:07 - did I just do these like longer ago I'm
48:09 - so confused I was expecting to see a
48:11 - million of these like members only
48:13 - streams for the
48:16 - um
48:17 - recording the processing videos and I'm
48:19 - I might just be looking at this in a
48:21 - weird wrong way but they're not there
48:22 - anyway
48:24 - back to the topic at hand which was here
48:28 - is I actually recorded about six hours
48:32 - five five hours ish of a new course
48:37 - about learning to program with
48:39 - processing using processing four the
48:42 - problem is
48:43 - um
48:44 - I haven't effectively been allocated or
48:48 - I just haven't finished all of the
48:49 - editing and post-production that goes
48:52 - with that so it became a much more
48:55 - complex project than I envisioned and I
48:59 - think when I I want to do the same for
49:01 - p5.js but when I redo those videos
49:06 - um I I think I like having them as
49:08 - separate videos because it's much easier
49:09 - for me to finish and complete a 10
49:12 - minute video and publish it and put it
49:14 - on YouTube then to put
49:17 - six hours worth of all the material into
49:20 - one video because
49:21 - uh everything has to be done you know
49:25 - before I can upload it so anyway that's
49:27 - coming
49:29 - um in the fall I will be teaching a
49:32 - class at NYU around uh
49:36 - yeah I must have oh maybe they're
49:38 - unlisted but I thought they would show
49:40 - up in my their unlisted not members only
49:43 - that's that motto motto 58 is correct
49:46 - um
49:47 - the Discord bot tutorials are coming
49:50 - this fall
49:51 - you know
49:52 - better late than never I suppose but
49:56 - um this fall I'm teaching a class called
49:58 - programming from A to Z which I should
50:00 - really think about a new name for that
50:01 - class because it sounds like it's a
50:04 - comprehensive beginner programming
50:06 - course but it's uh meant to be a play on
50:08 - words in that it's about programming
50:10 - with text so if you've watched any of my
50:12 - Markov chain or uh context-free grammar
50:16 - videos
50:18 - um some of the working with API stuff
50:22 - um those are the videos and content that
50:25 - goes with that course and in that course
50:27 - we do experiments making Bots and
50:30 - generating text for Bots I used to do
50:33 - Twitter I did some Mastodon I've been
50:36 - making some blue sky
50:37 - uh bought examples so I haven't I don't
50:40 - know what platform I'm going to use for
50:42 - the class in the fall to sort of see
50:43 - what the landscape is of social media
50:45 - platforms but a Discord bot is one that
50:47 - I'm pretty committed to doing and so I
50:49 - need to remake those videos to go along
50:51 - with the course
50:53 - um so but I'm also planning to do some
50:56 - content around uh language models uh and
51:00 - using Transformers whether I try to
51:03 - use some open source
51:05 - um like there's the wonderful Nano GPT
51:07 - repo that Andre carpathy made I believe
51:10 - if I'm getting that right where I could
51:12 - look at sort of training a Transformer
51:15 - model with my own smaller Text data set
51:17 - I feel quite conflicted around using
51:20 - large language models especially closed
51:22 - ones that you have to pay for on the
51:24 - channel but
51:25 - um I've been experimenting with the
51:26 - Llama which it which is actually an open
51:28 - source language model that meta has
51:31 - released there's of course chat GPT and
51:34 - the chat GPT API that I'm that many of
51:36 - you are probably familiar with so I I
51:38 - I've sort of trying to find where is the
51:43 - line like uh of appropriateness in terms
51:47 - of education and Outreach and empowering
51:50 - others to use these models but being
51:52 - aware of
51:55 - the biases that are involved in the sort
51:58 - of training of them
52:00 - um the harm that is the the sort of risk
52:04 - the safety issues around what these how
52:06 - these models can be used and abused as
52:09 - well as the in particular I'm talking
52:11 - about open AI here the sort of closed
52:13 - nature of the model so I'm still
52:14 - thinking about that if folks have
52:17 - thoughts or advice around how to handle
52:19 - that well in terms of video tutorials
52:22 - I'm all ears and fishy is talking about
52:25 - hugging face yeah hugging face is a
52:27 - wonderful so the two model repositories
52:29 - that have great that that in my eyes
52:32 - right now seem to have really excellent
52:33 - communities and resources around our
52:35 - hugging face and replicate and replicate
52:38 - I um
52:40 - has some nice hooks to train for
52:42 - training anyway I don't I don't want to
52:43 - get into that too much but that's what
52:44 - I've been looking at
52:46 - um okay
52:47 - NOC book we're coming to it is 140. uh
52:50 - other things the whistles were sent out
52:52 - that is done I'm gonna uncheck this
52:55 - because I have not published it this is
52:57 - a little five minute
52:59 - you know how like when you go to a
53:01 - wedding you have a year to give a
53:03 - present
53:04 - I think if you make a new website you
53:06 - have a year to release a video
53:08 - announcing the new website I think I'm
53:11 - still within that window I'm not
53:13 - entirely sure
53:14 - um I really want to work on the uh
53:19 - macro data refinement game that is
53:22 - inspired by the Apple TV show Severance
53:24 - I guess I might say right now that I in
53:27 - solidarity with the writer strike I am
53:30 - not going to work on that
53:33 - until there's a contract okay
53:35 - if you want the world is clamoring for
53:38 - me to continue working on my
53:41 - fan fiction computer program version of
53:45 - an obscure piece of software that's in
53:47 - the scene in an Apple TV Plus show I'm
53:51 - sure that's what's going to break break
53:53 - the
53:55 - break the dam here and get a contract
53:57 - signed to pay writers their fair share
54:02 - anyway
54:03 - I I will come back to that and I am
54:06 - making this summer I've absolutely got I
54:08 - got a put the put up or shut up here
54:11 - um I'm making a p5.js uh Port reboot
54:16 - version of the Oregon Trail original
54:18 - organ Trail game that I looked at and
54:20 - played on the Apple II Plus in a few
54:22 - live streams if you're interested in
54:24 - participating in making this
54:26 - it's it's out there there's a repo I
54:29 - started it just to let it linger slowly
54:31 - dying
54:33 - all right um 136 concurrent viewers
54:36 - light little lights for a Sunday here
54:38 - probably haven't haven't been making
54:39 - videos haven't been streaming by the way
54:41 - the the viewership activity on the
54:43 - channel is like at about 50 right now of
54:46 - what it has been or what it normally had
54:48 - been throughout the throughout 2022 I
54:50 - attribute that to my lack of making
54:53 - videos also um
54:55 - I don't know whether it's my uh whether
54:58 - there's just more competition whether
55:00 - it's my the topic Choice the sort of
55:02 - branding thumbnail title branding but
55:04 - the last two coding Challenge videos did
55:07 - not catch any of the algorithm YouTube
55:10 - algorithm waves that a lot of my code
55:11 - and Challenge videos have in the past
55:14 - um so in case you missed those you know
55:17 - feel free to check them out
55:19 - okay
55:20 - um all right
55:22 - 140. so let's take
55:25 - um I'm looking at my phone here because
55:27 - I've got a back Channel chat with the uh
55:30 - and with the NYU folks let's talk about
55:33 - the nature of code and this is all just
55:35 - good news
55:38 - um okay
55:40 - I mean I could brainstorm other things
55:41 - to add to this list or things that I
55:42 - might want to cut from it but let's
55:44 - let's talk about the nature of code
55:47 - okay so a couple things
55:51 - this semester
55:53 - at NYU I taught a undergraduate and
55:58 - graduate section of the class nature of
56:00 - code now if you're not familiar with
56:02 - what nature of code is
56:04 - I'm going to show you a website that you
56:05 - really should stay away from this is the
56:08 - actual public active nature of code
56:10 - website what is on it is it has a
56:14 - mechanism for you to download the book
56:18 - as a PDF ePub and Kindle
56:21 - you can slide this all the way down to
56:24 - zero and get it for free if you this is
56:28 - also a way for you to support the
56:30 - project if you wanted to if you have the
56:32 - capacity you can also uh
56:36 - um link to Amazon where you can purchase
56:41 - it I keep meaning to add um
56:44 - I've been using um Bookshop more
56:47 - recently
56:48 - which I did find it available on as well
56:52 - so you know support independent
56:54 - booksellers through Bookshop
56:57 - um is another possible way to get the
57:00 - book and then um
57:02 - the book itself is just online here as
57:05 - HTML CSS uh content that you can read
57:09 - for free online so why am I talking
57:10 - about this
57:11 - I started this project I would say
57:13 - probably in 2008 I think that's right
57:16 - someone would have to fact check this
57:17 - when I taught a version of this class
57:21 - um you know a lot of the material came
57:23 - out of other courses that I talked about
57:26 - and that I'd taken as a graduate student
57:28 - myself and other other work that I've
57:32 - written about in the acknowledgment so I
57:34 - want to just make sure I mention that
57:35 - and
57:37 - um you know probably around like five
57:39 - years later like maybe two thousand or
57:40 - even less like 2016 2017 I started
57:44 - thinking about updates to the book based
57:47 - on things that I had learned and thought
57:49 - that I could improve the changing
57:51 - landscape of machine learning and deep
57:53 - learning there's a chapter on neural
57:55 - networks that is you know woefully out
57:57 - of data
57:58 - quite possibly quite irrelevant now
58:01 - um as well as using p5.js for the uh
58:05 - just to make the book easier to interact
58:08 - with and use online so Java applets not
58:12 - being a thing anymore that you can
58:13 - easily run in the browser P5 is a nice
58:15 - choice for the book so uh I've been
58:18 - spinning my wheels for a really long
58:20 - time about updating it slowly a little
58:23 - bit here a little bit there
58:25 - and lots of people have helped me and
58:27 - this is a much longer story but what I
58:29 - want to go to now is I want to look at
58:32 - NOC book well so sorry on GitHub if I go
58:36 - to the nature of code and I realize I'm
58:38 - standing in front of a lot of this let
58:39 - me move this over if I go to the nature
58:41 - of code organization
58:44 - on GitHub you'll find a whole bunch of
58:47 - repositories the existing website the
58:51 - syllabus for the class I just taught but
58:54 - the one that I really want to highlight
58:56 - here is nature of code book 2023
58:59 - and I just want to validate that I have
59:01 - really been working on this by going to
59:05 - how do I find it um I think I have to
59:07 - click here insights let's just see
59:10 - and let's look uh what do I do like
59:13 - commits maybe would be a good one to
59:15 - look at
59:18 - um
59:19 - and no where's that graph
59:23 - let me just like contributors
59:25 - contributors maybe is what I mean to
59:26 - look at
59:29 - yeah so you can actually slow down
59:31 - because of the end of the semester but
59:34 - what I
59:36 - um there's been a lot of work on the
59:38 - book itself all happening I mean really
59:40 - in the last year
59:42 - so
59:43 - um
59:45 - so what do I mean by work so if I go to
59:50 - um here
59:51 - a couple things there have been
59:54 - um a whole bunch of people you can see
59:55 - them here under contributors um Jason
59:57 - gal most recently doing a ton of this
59:59 - work into building a whole new workflow
60:02 - for publishing the book which involves
60:05 - notion and
60:08 - um you know
60:09 - um and a whole build system to turn the
60:12 - book into a website and if I click over
60:16 - here you will now see
60:19 - uh prototype work in progress version of
60:22 - the new nature of code book and I want
60:25 - to say that basically all of these
60:26 - chapters are
60:29 - somewhere between 80 to 100 completed
60:32 - which is very very good news that's much
60:35 - further along than I have been at any
60:37 - point during this process so if I were
60:39 - to just look at one of them let's pick
60:42 - the vectors one
60:43 - and start to scroll through it uh you'll
60:47 - want to just point out a number of
60:48 - things one is the examples now well the
60:52 - I'm gonna I'm gonna just uh make this
60:54 - smaller so you can see it a bit more
60:55 - what it looks like the examples are
60:56 - embedded in here running in the browser
60:59 - um
61:00 - if I click on any given example it will
61:02 - take me right to the code in the web
61:05 - editor so this is what I'm talking about
61:06 - about the convenience we've got the
61:09 - written text
61:11 - um
61:12 - I want to see here if uh with new
61:16 - illustrations so these are all new
61:18 - illustrations that Zanna Marsh who is a
61:20 - colleague friend uh Alum of the ITP
61:23 - program has been working on
61:26 - um there's some really fun ones that
61:28 - you'll find throughout the book there is
61:32 - new uh math notation so the quality of
61:35 - the math notation that I'm using is much
61:37 - better using I think it's katex is what
61:40 - it's called
61:42 - um so again embedded examples and I can
61:44 - scroll through we can go to a different
61:47 - chapter just to kind of see some more
61:50 - sophisticated this is this is my new one
61:53 - of my new favorite things about the book
61:54 - is uh the target for all the steering
61:57 - examples is a strawberry because
62:02 - Berry so that makes me enormously happy
62:05 - so
62:07 - um so uh but as I get further on the
62:12 - chapters are a little less and less like
62:15 - there's still some work happening in the
62:17 - fractals chapter that needs to be
62:20 - finished
62:22 - um so this chapter is very much in
62:24 - progress here's kind of a fun
62:26 - illustration about factorial you can see
62:28 - the recursion examples so this is all
62:30 - available for you to read and look at
62:33 - online
62:34 - if you want to do so and if you are
62:37 - doing so
62:38 - and you have comments you notice typos
62:41 - mistakes broken examples
62:43 - what I would ask for you to do is file
62:46 - an issue here in the GitHub repository
62:49 - you at present cannot fix content in the
62:53 - book with a pull request even though all
62:56 - the content for the book is here and you
62:58 - could do a pull request to make an edit
63:00 - there
63:01 - I am doing the work of writing in notion
63:04 - database so these HTML files are
63:07 - auto-generated and I'm going to show you
63:09 - right now that process because I just
63:12 - did a lot of work on chapter nine
63:14 - evolutionary Computing but I did not
63:16 - update the website so let's make that
63:18 - happen I'm going to go here to actions
63:21 - I'm going to run so there's this action
63:23 - that if I run this workflow and I'm
63:26 - going to do it right now because it
63:27 - takes a bit of time looking at oh whoa
63:30 - we're almost ready to move into the ITB
63:32 - show this workflow will go and I I don't
63:35 - know if I can easily I'm afraid to open
63:36 - notion right now maybe I'll I will show
63:39 - that at a future time
63:42 - um but this process is now reading the
63:44 - notion API
63:47 - retrieving all of my writing from the
63:50 - notion API as Json and it's converting
63:53 - that Json into
63:56 - um the HTML files it is also if you can
63:59 - believe this and I really can't take any
64:01 - credit for this uh you can look you can
64:04 - look through the uh the people who have
64:06 - worked in the repo and all of this code
64:09 - um
64:10 - in addition it is grabbing any images so
64:13 - all of the figures and images and
64:15 - screenshots that are uploaded into
64:17 - notion come into the repo as well as all
64:19 - of the code so if I put a link to a P5
64:23 - web editor sketch in notion that web
64:26 - editor URL is gotten via the notion API
64:30 - and then we're using the P5 web editor
64:32 - API to get the code to create the embed
64:34 - that's on the page it's amazing
64:37 - um so if I look at that here we can see
64:40 - this is running the I'm just gonna see
64:43 - if we can get like the logs for it
64:46 - um you can see this is the lodge right
64:47 - now it's this is it just fetching all
64:49 - the notion content
64:51 - um so it's still and um and doing that
64:54 - um and thanks thanks fun Planet uh for
64:56 - putting
64:57 - um
64:57 - everything it and when this is done I
65:00 - really hope it finishes in time for me
65:02 - to show you it will auto generate a pull
65:04 - request which will uh that which I will
65:07 - then merge which will then rebuild and
65:09 - update the website so uh with Gatsby so
65:13 - um it's tremendous amount of work and
65:15 - time has gone into this and uh the
65:19 - reason why I I'm now finally a couple
65:21 - reasons why I'm finally getting this
65:22 - done
65:23 - one is uh thank you to
65:26 - um it some ITB students have been
65:28 - working with with me on this
65:30 - um as well as ITP alums and other
65:32 - volunteers
65:34 - um and teaching being teaching the class
65:37 - this semester kind of focused my energy
65:39 - onto it as well as and I'm excited to
65:43 - report that
65:44 - um
65:45 - I will be working with no starch
65:48 - just go to the to for the print version
65:51 - of the book so you might be asking this
65:53 - question like wait wait wait wait what's
65:54 - going on here
65:56 - the it was the original version of the
65:59 - book
66:00 - which is not here
66:02 - where is that did I close it I must have
66:05 - closed it let's put it here on the
66:06 - nebula page
66:08 - uh and I gotta keep an eye on the time
66:10 - here because I I think the ITP live
66:12 - stream has started but the actual it's
66:14 - just playing a placeholder video It's
66:16 - Gonna I gotta send you guys to there
66:17 - send everybody there too so the original
66:20 - book was self-published and this was
66:21 - very important to me
66:23 - um because I wanted to be Creative
66:25 - Commons licensed I wanted to be an open
66:27 - education platform you know it is an ex
66:30 - it was an expensive project for me to
66:32 - produce so the income from you know
66:35 - optional pay what you want online and
66:37 - the print book did help uh uh certainly
66:41 - uh broke even and uh probably over 10
66:43 - years has now well exceeded whatever I
66:45 - invested into it although I don't know
66:46 - if you count the time uh with what that
66:49 - would mean but um
66:52 - but there were there's a few issues with
66:54 - this one is one of the reasons why I
66:56 - self-published it was for that for the
66:58 - open education model
67:01 - um and no starch press is uh I've been
67:04 - uh chatting with them and talking with
67:06 - them is really on board with that so the
67:09 - book itself will still be the new
67:11 - version of the book will still be
67:12 - Creative Commons licensed and available
67:14 - for free online
67:16 - um the print version
67:19 - um print on demand is
67:21 - is a nice in theory and I think there's
67:23 - lots of good applications for it but I
67:25 - have a lot of issues with the quality
67:26 - the print quality of the book people
67:29 - were reporting you can see like right
67:30 - here uh on the website says uh problem
67:33 - with the quality of your print like I
67:36 - had to build a whole thing put a whole
67:37 - thing on the website that was like a
67:40 - separate page for to show like what the
67:42 - page should look like what people were
67:44 - seeing it as so that I could like keep
67:46 - track of this
67:49 - um and like you know kind of complain or
67:51 - try to get them a new version of the
67:52 - book
67:53 - um the company that I used for print on
67:56 - demand was acquired by Amazon so I kind
67:59 - of don't want to use it again because
68:01 - you know
68:03 - we all have to make decisions that work
68:05 - with our lives and I am going to have a
68:07 - book that's sold on Amazon and I do buy
68:09 - things off of Amazon but I don't like
68:12 - the all eggs in one basket I do want to
68:14 - support
68:16 - um all Alternatives and so by working
68:18 - with no starch I can have a higher
68:20 - quality book and I can have it
68:23 - um I can have more ways of Distributing
68:26 - it plus I have the editing support the
68:28 - project management support and they're
68:30 - putting me on a deadline so I have to
68:32 - finish this that's the morally the most
68:34 - important thing so I wanted to just give
68:36 - you those updates about it
68:38 - um if you want to follow along oh good
68:40 - this finish this oh it's it completed
68:43 - the job but I don't see a pull request
68:45 - yet oh it's there so if you want to
68:47 - follow along
68:49 - uh fun Planet posted the links in the
68:52 - chat uh please come and read uh if you
68:56 - want to contribute then
68:59 - come and visit the repository and the
69:03 - easiest the lowest barrier to entry for
69:05 - contributing is like filing an issue and
69:08 - even if you wanted to file an issue that
69:09 - just says like I support you working on
69:12 - this project it's okay that you're not
69:14 - live streaming or making a lot of videos
69:16 - because this project is important if you
69:18 - just want to say that and you're like
69:19 - that's a way of participating in the
69:21 - project but you can also leave comments
69:24 - um you can read through what's kind of
69:26 - outstanding
69:27 - um and that kind of thing okay
69:30 - so this is every print is unique and
69:33 - guaranteed to be one of a kind yeah okay
69:36 - that's nature of code which is a really
69:39 - nice segue
69:40 - uh to
69:42 - move back to what is the primary purpose
69:48 - of today
69:49 - uh which is
69:52 - the ITP IMA spring show so let's look at
69:55 - these projects is there a way to search
69:57 - and filter let's see
69:59 - can I search by Nature
70:03 - oh nature of code
70:05 - oh look at this so now we are now seeing
70:09 - all of the projects from the nature of
70:12 - code course which was my course and uh
70:16 - from the semester and the all of these
70:18 - wonderful students oh I'm so excited to
70:20 - see these projects there might be more
70:22 - that somehow didn't get tagged right but
70:24 - let's let's in the in the in five
70:27 - minutes we're going to send you over to
70:28 - the live stream there where they were
70:29 - actually the students will be walking
70:31 - around with the camera let me just get
70:33 - my chat with NYU going and make sure
70:38 - what is that sound a weird sound just
70:41 - started happening
70:42 - um
70:43 - oh I forgot to show oh there's so many
70:45 - things ah uh let me just find my uh chat
70:50 - here okay we are ready to go live
70:52 - whenever you wrap up they say okay I'm
70:55 - wrapping up
70:56 - um I'm wrapping up
70:59 - give five minutes okay five more minutes
71:01 - okay
71:02 - all right so first of all I kind of
71:05 - forgot
71:07 - just because I was here I forgot to show
71:09 - the sort of cool thing about this which
71:11 - is now it's running the tests so it
71:14 - can't it hasn't preview built it yet but
71:16 - you can now see here
71:18 - um all of the edits that I have made
71:23 - um in the book since the last time the
71:24 - site was published so you can see a lot
71:26 - of like code things that I've done and I
71:28 - actually did a lot of work on the
71:30 - genetic algorithms chapter
71:32 - so if you look here you can see in this
71:35 - pull request all the things that I've
71:37 - been updating and rewriting uh for the
71:39 - nature of code chapter so I just wanted
71:41 - to show that for the for the genetic
71:43 - algorithms chapter and then ah and it
71:45 - finished awesome so now it also built a
71:47 - preview on netlify
71:50 - so if I go here this would be now all
71:54 - the rewrites of the genetic algorithm
71:56 - chapter would be here and I can see
71:58 - already these new tables that I put in I
72:01 - have to fix these
72:02 - um are there and I am going to
72:05 - very excitedly emerge that what I
72:08 - usually do is I try to do uh chapter
72:10 - nine updates and more just change the
72:13 - title uh and I'm going to merge this
72:16 - okay
72:18 - okay so I just wanted to close the loop
72:21 - on that I forgot to mention that part of
72:22 - my nature of code book discussion all
72:25 - right now the Showcase all right so
72:27 - let's look um
72:30 - let's look at one of these uh I'm gonna
72:32 - look at uh uh I I I I'm like I'm like I
72:36 - can't pick
72:37 - I'll just click through all all six of
72:39 - them real fast oh come on that didn't
72:40 - let me ah
72:43 - no okay
72:46 - I feel like this will be a nice ending
72:48 - to this
72:48 - oh I see there's also
72:51 - oh no it got okay uh
72:54 - open why there's some kind of like
72:55 - JavaScript here that's not allowing me
72:57 - to open in a new in a new tab so let's
73:01 - let's let's pick a random number
73:02 - random.org
73:06 - uh let's pick a random number one
73:09 - through six
73:11 - one through six and that's one we'll
73:13 - look at from top one two three four five
73:15 - six all right
73:16 - three okay we're looking at number three
73:18 - which is wait a second here they're in a
73:21 - different order okay we're looking at
73:23 - Reformation the invisible surroundings
73:25 - by Ray
73:27 - um and
73:29 - sort of like a video here that I can
73:31 - play
73:32 - but
73:34 - there's an image here this is a I will
73:36 - just as I know about this project I will
73:37 - describe it this is a you know a data
73:40 - visualization of weather data and that's
73:43 - uh I think there's a much larger uh
73:46 - conceptual underpinning to this project
73:48 - idea that you can read all about in the
73:51 - description but you can see these are
73:52 - the kind of projects
73:54 - um that are in the show
73:57 - um and and so what I'm going to do now
73:58 - it's time
74:01 - uh it's time doing my last one minute uh
74:06 - transition over to you so what's going
74:10 - to happen if I've set this up correctly
74:12 - YouTube has twitch has like a raid
74:14 - feature for streaming on Twitch YouTube
74:16 - has it's so creatively named YouTube
74:19 - redirect so when I hit the end stream
74:23 - button on the my YouTube interface it's
74:25 - going to send you to the
74:28 - um ITP stream directly and so I am
74:32 - really excited for you to go there
74:33 - because there will be students who are
74:36 - walking around and live demoing all of
74:40 - the projects from the show it's going to
74:42 - happen uh
74:44 - today let me see if I go here to the
74:47 - live stream oh oh my God it's already up
74:50 - with sound uh the show itself is
74:53 - happening again today and tomorrow both
74:55 - of these will be live streamed tomorrow
74:58 - May 15th I will be there in person so
75:00 - you might see me wander across the live
75:02 - stream subscribe to the ITP Channel come
75:05 - back to the ITB stream tomorrow and it's
75:08 - and I'm going to send you there now so
75:09 - I'll be in the chat as soon as you're
75:12 - all sent there so ask questions say
75:14 - hello in the chat thank you for tuning
75:15 - in to this ITP uh pre-show I hope you
75:18 - enjoyed these coding train updates
75:20 - nature of code updates but it's time
75:22 - it's 2 p.m we're gonna head over there
75:25 - um and here we go let's see if this
75:26 - system works everybody you all ready for
75:28 - this
75:31 - okay that was embarrassing
75:33 - all right here we go I I uh here we go
75:37 - uh uh ah close close here comes I'm
75:40 - gonna hit end stream and I think you're
75:42 - being sent there uh thank you Silas for
75:44 - your nice comment all right here we go
75:46 - in three
75:48 - two one

Cleaned transcript:

thank you thank you foreign foreign foreign check one two this is my audio test if you can hear me let me know in the chat and enjoy seeing where everyone is from most recently we've got Catalonia Swedish and outer space all right I'm using this mic again and we'll be starting up in just a couple minutes thank you thank you foreign thank you foreign well I didn't realize that was going to happen I haven't used this setup in a little while I'm hoping you can all hear me as well as the music which is about to fade away in five four three two one and we're live I mean I already was live but now I'm really here and I'm looking at myself in my screen that's in front of me and looking at the camera lens and saying hello to all of you it's been a while uh the traditional greeting of course on the coding train is a train whistle I'm gonna just take a peek over in the chat that says now I hear you we see you okay um so I'm assuming it's all working I see ITP is in the chat saying choo choo the catchphrase of the coding Train choo choo so let me just stay right from the outright um this isn't your usual I don't I don't first of all I don't know what your usual coding train stream would be but whatever in your mind you think of as the usual coding train stream uh it is not what is happening today because today is a celebration of the end of the Academic Year here in New York City I'm not actually in New York City right now but I will be there tomorrow um I'm broadcasting from the outer skirts the country uh life The Wind and The Greenery is blowing the the wind is blowing The Greenery outside I don't know what I'm saying uh today is the ITP IMA uh spring show and if you've followed the coding train for you know what is now amounting to many many years I don't know if we've really gotten into double digits yet but um I would often do a live stream from the show itself and today is a little bit different I am doing a live stream from my studio my home studio and then I will be passing the mic I will be sending you all right into Brooklyn downtown Brooklyn New York to see the wonder that is the ITP IMA show and if you don't know what that is I will start talking about that with a bit more detail in a moment I'm seeing from the chat that we've got Japan Ireland Africa Tunisia this to me I know I say this often this is what I love about getting to do this Channel on YouTube is to be able to connect with and broadcast beam out right here from a garage in the Hudson Valley of New York all over the world to talk about creative coding and all the things the magical fun wonderful things you can do with code whether you are a beginner and this is your first time ever thinking about code or thinking about writing a line of code or watching the coding train or you've been here all along for however many years this train has been in service um it's been a little bit out of service this semester just I I do want to use this time to give you some updates about things that are happening in the coding train and particular about the nature of code book which is something I am actively working on we've got now Dominican Republic Syria Czech Republic Denmark and Korea uh out of that list I've only ever been to Denmark so I've definitely got to expand my world travel um all right so um this is also can be as much or little of an interactive stream as you like I'm keeping whenever I look over this way I am looking at the chat and if I catch a question there um you can I'll try to answer it as well as there are a few coding train moderators who are in the chat who can take a question and place it over here into the coding train member Discord so if you want access to that member Discord you can also join the coding train Channel but that's not what today is about I want to talk to you about ITP and Ima so um let me switch over here let's see if this button Works Cuba Netherlands Italy uh Basque Country okay I'm gonna press this I'm a little out of practice here so let's see um what's going on I can't find the button left here it is there we go okay I've made myself a little bit smaller I'm realizing I really need to go for a beard trim um and I've got the uh my browser opened up here okay so um you might know me from the coding train a YouTube channel where I uh live inside a little rectangle and awkwardly try to communicate with the rest of the world but most of my time is in fact spent at a teaching at a program at New York University uh there is a twoyear graduate program called ITP stands for interactive telecommunications program there is a fouryear undergraduate BFA IMA interactive media arts there is also a low Residency program which is a oneyear Master's which can be done mostly remote with a few inperson intensive intensives hopefully I'm getting this somewhat right and that is called the IMA lowres program so if any of those programs are of interest to you I would suggest heading on over to itp.nyu.edu and there's all sorts of more more and more all sorts of information there ah we see I see it now you've got ITP IMA which is undergraduate and then the IMA low Residency program oh there's also this thing called ITP Camp which I am really hoping to participate in this year we'll see if I can make that happen but this is a fourweek creative and Cooperative playground playground which is all happening in June so that's coming right up I think you can even still apply to participate in ITP Camp so why don't you use ARC as your default browser yeah that's a good question maybe I should I I accept your criticisms of my use of Google Chrome I use it frankly out of convenience uh oh wait a second here I'm like oh I have the okay I'm like why is my shirt red so okay so I know I know I just went off on a tangent welcome to the coding train where I talk about both uh trigonometric functions like sine cosine and tangent but mostly just go off on tangents all right um uh with love from Saturn okay so I have a new setup where I'm using a confidence monitor with this like reflective glass teleprompter setup So in theory if I wanted to use a teleprompter I could I clearly am not using a teleprompter right now otherwise it would make more sense and one of the things I turned on is like this setting that shows me if any of the pixels are peaking I think like the like my white balance or brightness those of you who are video people know what I'm talking about and my whole shirt has turned red uh which is what I'm seeing in the confidence minor but I look over here to see what's being broadcast to YouTube it still looks normal all right uh um all right so where was I yes talking about ITB so first of all it is about 1pm eastern time and if you happen to be in the New York City area you should just turn this off right now and head on over to 370 J Street uh which is in downtown Brooklyn all the Subways go there to go to the show in person let's switch on over to the show website which I can find at itp.nyu.edu show um so here you'll see the information about the actual inperson show today it's starting at 2PM so this is just me talking for about another hour and you know maybe I'll do a quick coding demo or something if we have time or if there's a topic that comes up um default Focus confirmation is what Andrew Dennis is telling me and thank you for your nice comment souvik um so um um today and tomorrow so you can if you can come in person um however don't just show up you need for in terms of the security system that way it works at NYU you'll need to go through and claim your tickets it's free but you need to make sure you enter the name and email address of each attendee um so I will be there tomorrow in person um and I'm not there in person today I'm doing this preshow all right so this is the information about the show now it looks like if I click over here I can see the show map wow what is this going to take where is this going to take me it's taking me to figma all right this is this is much to uh this is much too advanced for me right now but we can see the floor and where all the projects are ooh I wonder if we can look at some of the projects that's what that's one thing we could do during today's live stream uh previous shows show map projects let's go over here ah so now we're seeing all of the projects wonderful um one of the things I might do is look at the various projects that are part of uh the nature of code which is a course that I taught this semester and is a project a now I mean a well over 10year project um that is really bothering me that my shirt is red as I look I should probably turn that setting off but there's nothing I can do about it um so uh I want to talk about the nature field let me make a list of things so I want to update you on coding train schedule and summer um and I want to update you on nature of code and then I want to review some ITP projects and we are on a time crunch here this stream will promptly shut down in about an hour and if YouTube's live redirect feature works it will send you right over to the actual ITP live stream um oops no that's not what I was going to move it if you look at this video's description there should be a link to the ITP live stream which is a separate YouTube event on a separate Channel what's figma I am not qualified to answer that question somebody in the chat feel free to answer what is figma I will take your questions about processing P5 creative code the coding train nature of code all that stuff which you can ask in the chat all right uh thank you Ellery chainan for answering that question about figma all right what do I want to look at first all right let's just let's Dive Right In and I'll take questions as we go but let me give you some updates about the coding train itself so uh if you I haven't done a live stream probably I think I did the the last one was the January uh speed run I can't remember if I covered this at all but if you haven't taken the time to look at the new coding Train website now is a wonderful opportunity for you to do so I will soon be releasing about a five minute video about the new coding Train website um but just to cover it a little bit right now here it is uh thank you to the wonderful Folks at DSi Design Systems International who designed this site uh thank you to the tremendous efforts of the coding train Community um to name just a few who have been very active recently uh Kathy depalm and Francis who have been doing a tremendous amount of work fixing bugs and expanding the content of the channel uh the website that is also a shout out to um Klein who is an IMA student who built this overall structure for uh this showcase page which I want to come and look at in a bit more detail in a minute so um what uh this is where you can find the archive of the history of the coding train not every single video that's on the channel is on the website if there is a video that's on the channel That should be on the website uh please um there is a wonderful process by which you can contribute but what do I mean why does a video have a page on the website well if I go to what is the more a popular series from the coding train like the challenges you'll see that every challenge I think there might be one missing still coding Challenge number 40. every challenge has its own page here if I were to pick one I'm actually just going to pick this one that's featured right now the 3D terrain and go to it the reason for this is there is a lot I'm just amused by the thumbnail um there's a lot of metadata associated with each and every video that is not easily covered by the YouTube interface and so if you are looking for the code example it's right here uh description other references other related videos credits for the video as well as projects this is now the passenger showcase for this which are all the projects that other folks have made some of these are just so lovely um and they're I think they're in a random Order each time so if we refresh the page yet you can see they're in a random Order each time as well as some other related challenges of related topics so this is my attempt along with DSI and the larger coding train Community to you know I have over a thousand videos on the channel and so to have a kind of OneStop shopping place where you can find the videos as well as all of the metadata and and code that goes along with those videos so and dpom um in the member chat as you put wrote new with giant quotes around it because uh yeah the website that I don't know how new it is anymore it's new to me ah lovely a72 is saying I am coming to Tish this year well I hope to get to meet you in person please stop by the fourth floor uh that's where I am um and so you know just just to look I just want to go back to the challenges page for a second oh actually no no let me pause pause time out and just let me go to the track space so I'm showing you these are the challenges which are videos which are essentially a single project made in a particular video um if I go to the tracks page this is where I am cataloging videos that exist as a sequence well as a let's let's just use the word collection so a track you can think of it as a sequence and some of them are the main tracks which are written right here our sequences so if for some reason you just came out of nowhere and are watching me right now on the internet and wondering boy I wish I could just start from the total beginning I've never coded before and I want to learn that is what this main track code programming with P5 would be you can click into here all the videos um all the videos are here if I go to any given one very old thumbnail the code is here as well as you know showcase projects that people have made so this would be your playlist your track your collection your sequence your course whatever you want to call it for learning to code with P5 um there are other ones uh sort of this one deals with node and working with apis a little bit about git and GitHub so machine learning nature of code I'm going to come talk about more but there are also these Side Tracks which are loose collections of videos so if you ever wanted to learn about super shapes all of the super shape videos are right here ah this polar coordinates is not explicitly a super shape video but it is a necessary math that comes up in the Super ellipse uh this uh and all of these other particular videos along with the mandelbub is in here okay great and then if I uh backtrack here we can see there's some games algorithmic botany et cetera et cetera et cetera okay so that is the uh that's pretty much the website um there are lots of other things here like these guides if you want to like learn about submitting to the Showcase or helping maintain the website getting started is there um I forgot to I did forget to say Happy Mother's Day happy Mother's Day um and that okay so what did I want to show next here right my mind was going somewhere well let's look at some showcase projects because there's been some new ones first of all it seems that we have a showcase project from Kai who is nine years old so first let's everybody round of applause see if this works a round of applause for taking me way too long to figure out if my soundboard still works and of course it didn't work you know what my I'm using this software called loopback and it's right now causing me all sorts of issues there we go all right there's the Applause thank you it's not for me it's for Kai uh so Kai created this project called cave generation with Perla noise based off of the 10 print video let's take a look at this oh cool ah I see so what I I'm kind of guessing here because I didn't make this or I haven't looked at the code but what this to me looks like is um oh and Sesame Street gang is asking what's ITP I made so I did cover that a little bit already but I will come back to that um looks like here 10 print is a particular Graphics pattern that emerges this mazelike pattern when you randomly draw a line diagonally in one of two directions like think of an X pick randomly whether you're drawing this line from the X or this line over a grid so it looks like what Kai has done here is instead of drawing a line has drawn a square with two different colors and I it's called I'm again I'm speculating but uh it's called cave generation because through Randomness you end up getting these pockets of empty uh like like the lighter spots to me or like empty spaces inside the cave where you could walk around and the darker spots of the walls of the game now but I don't think this is pure Randomness because it looks like there is a bit of smooth uniform quality here which is probably coming from purlin noise and if you don't know what pearling noise is oh boy do I have news for you remember that whole thing about the tracks that I was showing on the website got a whole track all about what is Pearl and noise let's take a look at Kai's code see if I'm my speculation was at all correct and we can see here there are functions for drawing the backslash and forward slash which instead of a line is a rectangle and then aha exactly and the some kind of calculation related to purlin noise this is very interesting here the input into the noise is this mathematical equation based on the X Y location and then checking it against another call to noise that's super interesting way I have to think it's going to take me some time for my brain to unpack like what the quality of of uh the coin flipping essentially will come out of this way of comparing noise um but we can look someone is asking like I can now run this in P5 and if we wanted to look at what pure Randomness would look like and I don't know let me log in here as the coding train um so that we can save this and make some modifications so let's look at what it would be with pure Randomness so I can just comment out this if statement and say instead if random 1 is less than 0.5 which would be like the pure Randomness version of it and there you can see now oh interesting it looks like this spacing changed the spacing must oh oh the spacing's random each time okay I'm like why did the spacing change yeah so so some great questions happening in the um chat which is uh yes there's a noise so yeah uh just I don't know if I'm answering the question specifically but there is a function in P5 called noise now the term noise on its own really means Randomness but noise in P the random function uh in P5 is for uniform Randomness and the noise function is for a smooth kind of Randomness referred to as purlin noise and if you want to learn more about this uh we're going to be talking about the nature of code in just a moment so thank you Kai this was fun this is great to see this project um a couple things I might note here Kai's probably not watching right now but um this frame rate this this of of 1000 is uh not something that um will really actually work um this is sort of like the frame rate I like to say that the argument to the frame rate is aspirational it is not actually setting the frame rate to a particular value it is saying like I want you if you can to run at this frame rate so uh in most cases like P5 I think the default frame rate it's going to Aspire to is 60 frames per second so changing it to 30 would make sense because you're saying like hey even if you could run faster don't just stick with 30 but if if there are other elements the speed of your computer or the things happening in the browser the amount of stuff you're drawing in the draw Loop are that like the the frame rate won't actually live up to its assignment and one thing that's interesting about what Kai's done here is this is generating a static image so I might actually suggest putting in draw a call to no Loop because the the this particular sketch just generates a static image there's no reason to draw it over and over again in which case and I'm wondering actually why oh because it's using noise but why is it not so this is interesting why is it not change changing this over and over again is I don't see a call to random seed a little confused here because this should be just curious what happens if I do this ah it's doing them one at a time ah so that makes sense uh there was this idea of animating it and this is kind of cool to see it do it this way and I you know we could I can now change that to 60 just to kind of max out the frame rate you can see it's running a little faster but why oh I think the reason why it wasn't um it it wasn't uh redoing it each time with a new random set of values is because it's moving This Global variable X and Y and once it gets to the end it doesn't reset back so one of the things I could if I wanted to I could say if Y is greater than height I could put this in here if Y is greater than height then now set y also back to zero and what this would do if we can make this run a little bit faster is and let's put it back to doing five thousand of them but let's just do 50. and we can see now it's doing 50 at a time and when it gets to the end it will come back sorry I haven't been keeping track of the chat I'm looking at the Discord uh uh okay as you can see it came back to the top there so just just to put a finer point on this let's make the spacing 30 hardcoded as 30 and let's make this just two and we can see now I've made a new version of Kai's code where when it gets to the bottom it will presumably as we wait because the sound is broken still comes back to the top and starts running over by the way let's just look at it um with the lines I'm curious to see and we'd have to change this to a stroke this is kind of this was not what I meant to do this happened by accident let's take out the rectangles and let's use the ground color for both so this is this is now uh the 10 print pattern so you can see I'm just backing into what the original example was and you can see how Kai now got to this new pattern one by changing the drawing two squares instead of lines whoops and then in addition writing a new algorithm for how the uh spots are picked and we can put the algorithm back in and you can see we get some pretty uh the different results um pyro axo Dragon says never knew you did live streaming yeah well unfortunately it's kind of I'm a little bit I was kind of struggling here because I used to do weekly live streams so the reason why you never knew I did live streaming is because this is only my this is my third live stream of the entire year and it is you know the middle of May so I would like to do more live streams I'm curious about where those artifacts in the pattern are coming from Unchained I wasn't sure I'm not 100 sure about your question because I was doing a lot of different things and may have missed um missed I'm looking at the time 120 I might have missed um the Spy I didn't I didn't catch your question at the moment when I was showing something on the screen so I don't know what it matches up to all right let me move back to the Showcase thank you Kai let's um let's look at um we've got let's look at this one so we've got a showcase project ah right okay so what's one of the things I should get this box hold on it's on my list I I know I just left the I left the camera view we can do a like we could do a little live unboxing today on the channel um so if you uh tuned into the coding train in 20 20 22 I did a bunch of videos with my app a childhood Apple II plus computer and I would like to do more of them um and one of the things I wanted to do um is work with a Commodore 64. now the Apple II plus was a computer that I actually had and saved from my childhood I did have to order some replacement parts and things off of eBay to get it working again but it's pretty much the you know it's for all intents and purposes it's the uh it I like to think of it as my the literal childhood computer that I saved for all these years now I did not have a commodore 64. uh but I did find one off of eBay and I and I purchased it to make videos with it it's still sitting in the box like the ship I don't even want to tell you what the ship date on this is because it'll be much too embarrassing wow well let me just tell you that that the ship date is from 2022. very very late in 2022. so I'm just checking here my notifications oh um perfect okay I'm just looking at information about the ITP stream which is starting in 30 minutes and I actually just got a notification about that all right so uh Brooklyn humanist is starting IMA in a month coming in knowing nothing well guess what and real sickness is in the chat hello Enrique the artifacts came from not clearing the background you answered thank you I know there's other questions that I'm not getting to because I'm just off on a trigonometric tangent once again anyway um Brooklyn humanist great name um a today you will now know about IMA because if you stick around through me chatting a little bit about it and then if you watch the show and if you are in Brooklyn I would say go head over to the show in person anyway there's a Commodore 64 in here you gotta open it up maybe I'll open it up today if we have a little time but I'm going to keep moving um so I would love to click on this but um oh oh look at this they made a video for it this is amazing I had I didn't actually know there was an archive of this okay this is awesome we're gonna watch this how long is it four minutes and 16 seconds this is now this is now coding train reacts we're now I have a new channel it's called coding train reacts where the whole time I go like this I don't I don't react verbally I react with interpretive dance this is so cool I didn't realize there was a um video archive of it things Cody Trenton reacts by liking the video oh no I moved out of the way let me just get this comment in I I should really send the music out through the I don't know why this is not working there you go I don't know what's going on I don't know why it's not working Mike but okay okay fractal three let's skip to the end there fractal four fractal five all right thank you for this so that's really fantastic so you can find that so one of the other things that um nice about the passenger Showcase in case you weren't aware is if you click on a given oh no um how do I do that doesn't work from here oh no no I so we I forgot we didn't implement this I thought if you click on the author's name it'll take you to their all of theirs but I would actually just have to look for it here but if you search for a particular author we can see um that BTM 86 is only submitted uh this one but if I go to um Kathy for example who I know has submitted a lot of showcase projects uh so many beautiful ones we can see all of Kathy's submissions right there um and so yeah look at all these wonderful submissions we see a few different climate spirals came in from the climate spiral coating challenge um and look at all these some wave function collapse some more fractal trees so anyway the hope is here that one this is a way for you to share your work with the community but also for you to get inspired and see what other people are making so I think I'm good in terms of talking about the coding Train website um let's let me move on here for um to some other things because I'm short on time okay I'm gonna close this let me save this cave generation sketch that we were just looking at um all right so I did a stream I believe this was January 1st 2023 and I made this list I kind of went through and um on the left here that I'm standing in front of I went through and cataloged all of the things that I did for the on the coding train in 2022 which made me feel a little bit better because if I hadn't done very much and it was it was a long list and then I made a list of goals for uh 2023 and so thank you to depam who took this white board and put it into a markdown file and so I wanted to take you know maybe just about five minutes now uh because we are I have about a half an hour left before I'm going to send you over to ITP um and look through and see what I've got and what I might want to do next because I did not I was not able to allocate a lot of time to the coding train since the start of 2023 I returned back to teaching fulltime at NYU but it is the summer now and I'd have a less busy in terms of travel and other types of things summer than I have had in the past so I'm hoping to in addition to enjoying the summer and spending time with family and friends which is something I hope you all will do um I hope to be able to catch up on some of these coding train projects as well as although I really should not be allowed to until I finish the nature of code book so I kind of maybe I might make a poll here uh just to sort of but I think what I really should be doing is I got a lot of work done on the nature of code book and my goal is to finish everything by I was I was going to say the end of May but I think the end of June is more realistic I probably shouldn't allow myself to do anything on the coding train until that book is completely 100 finished and published online and in the Publisher's hands for the print version which I will talk about in a bit but let's take some time to look at this list um okay yeah the list was ambitious so I did do a Pi Day coding challenge and um hold on let's look at what's on the channel actually oh and I did a soft body physics coding Challenge and a climate spiral so I do get to uh let's hit edit here and let's give myself some credit for some other things so I did a soft body physics challenge choose toxic Libs um and I did uh Pi Day and then which was buffon's needle and then I also did the climate spiral so I'm going to update that okay great so I have completed three challenges so that's not terrible given that my goal was to have 10 new coding Challenge videos for the year and I realized there was a time in my life where I was doing like three or four coding challenges per week I don't know how I did that sort of a different I had a different process then maybe I should go back to that I don't know but these this is a good list and I think it's a fine list to keep ah but I do want to add one to it so um I want to do the Wolfram Elementary CA so that is another one and if I do and priority wise I kind of like this order right now because I really wanted this this one I really would like to get the second part of wave function collapse done over the summer okay so that's good guests I want to do more with guests I've not made the time and space for it uh nebula so again today's stream is about the ITP show so I don't want to be too um off topic and promoting my own uh kind of coding train work too much but uh in case you're wondering what nebula is if you go to go.nebula.tv codingtrain um you will find my nebula page nebula is a independent Creator owned and maintained streaming service so if you think about uh your Netflix your Hulu your Amazon Prime your Macs nebula is just like any of those services but the content on nebula is um from you know education adjacent uh YouTubers um uh so it's something that you can sign up for to support the coding train I made a a whole uh I'm gonna see if this course on it uh with the Apple II plus computer so but again I don't want to promote this too much right now today I do want to promote it but another time would be more appropriate for that but I don't want to mention that because um I do have opportunities to create content exclusively for nebula and collaborate with nebula they have studio and production team to work on making things of a different quality and a different scope so if you have ideas for things that you think might work with that platform if you're a fan of nebula let me know I'd love to hear from you um but that's what's up that's what's on this list okay Apple II retro computing so I have not done any of these but this is something that I could return to this summer as well I don't know if I want to focus more on the coding challenges but I wanted to do a quick example on the Apple II for how you can play tones music I wanted to look at 6502 Assembly Language maybe more directly and then the four mentioned oh I hurt my back uh Commodore 64 which is in this box right now okay have not gotten to any of those things uh I want to do more live streams that's just on the list in general more nature of code videos uh well the book has to be completed first so this really shouldn't get a check here I'm going to uncheck it um I have recorded it by the way like if you wondered why you might want to join the coding train like I think if I go here under live you're going to see that like in case you don't believe me um where oh what where did these go so strange that they're not actually here did I just do these like longer ago I'm so confused I was expecting to see a million of these like members only streams for the um recording the processing videos and I'm I might just be looking at this in a weird wrong way but they're not there anyway back to the topic at hand which was here is I actually recorded about six hours five five hours ish of a new course about learning to program with processing using processing four the problem is um I haven't effectively been allocated or I just haven't finished all of the editing and postproduction that goes with that so it became a much more complex project than I envisioned and I think when I I want to do the same for p5.js but when I redo those videos um I I think I like having them as separate videos because it's much easier for me to finish and complete a 10 minute video and publish it and put it on YouTube then to put six hours worth of all the material into one video because uh everything has to be done you know before I can upload it so anyway that's coming um in the fall I will be teaching a class at NYU around uh yeah I must have oh maybe they're unlisted but I thought they would show up in my their unlisted not members only that's that motto motto 58 is correct um the Discord bot tutorials are coming this fall you know better late than never I suppose but um this fall I'm teaching a class called programming from A to Z which I should really think about a new name for that class because it sounds like it's a comprehensive beginner programming course but it's uh meant to be a play on words in that it's about programming with text so if you've watched any of my Markov chain or uh contextfree grammar videos um some of the working with API stuff um those are the videos and content that goes with that course and in that course we do experiments making Bots and generating text for Bots I used to do Twitter I did some Mastodon I've been making some blue sky uh bought examples so I haven't I don't know what platform I'm going to use for the class in the fall to sort of see what the landscape is of social media platforms but a Discord bot is one that I'm pretty committed to doing and so I need to remake those videos to go along with the course um so but I'm also planning to do some content around uh language models uh and using Transformers whether I try to use some open source um like there's the wonderful Nano GPT repo that Andre carpathy made I believe if I'm getting that right where I could look at sort of training a Transformer model with my own smaller Text data set I feel quite conflicted around using large language models especially closed ones that you have to pay for on the channel but um I've been experimenting with the Llama which it which is actually an open source language model that meta has released there's of course chat GPT and the chat GPT API that I'm that many of you are probably familiar with so I I I've sort of trying to find where is the line like uh of appropriateness in terms of education and Outreach and empowering others to use these models but being aware of the biases that are involved in the sort of training of them um the harm that is the the sort of risk the safety issues around what these how these models can be used and abused as well as the in particular I'm talking about open AI here the sort of closed nature of the model so I'm still thinking about that if folks have thoughts or advice around how to handle that well in terms of video tutorials I'm all ears and fishy is talking about hugging face yeah hugging face is a wonderful so the two model repositories that have great that that in my eyes right now seem to have really excellent communities and resources around our hugging face and replicate and replicate I um has some nice hooks to train for training anyway I don't I don't want to get into that too much but that's what I've been looking at um okay NOC book we're coming to it is 140. uh other things the whistles were sent out that is done I'm gonna uncheck this because I have not published it this is a little five minute you know how like when you go to a wedding you have a year to give a present I think if you make a new website you have a year to release a video announcing the new website I think I'm still within that window I'm not entirely sure um I really want to work on the uh macro data refinement game that is inspired by the Apple TV show Severance I guess I might say right now that I in solidarity with the writer strike I am not going to work on that until there's a contract okay if you want the world is clamoring for me to continue working on my fan fiction computer program version of an obscure piece of software that's in the scene in an Apple TV Plus show I'm sure that's what's going to break break the break the dam here and get a contract signed to pay writers their fair share anyway I I will come back to that and I am making this summer I've absolutely got I got a put the put up or shut up here um I'm making a p5.js uh Port reboot version of the Oregon Trail original organ Trail game that I looked at and played on the Apple II Plus in a few live streams if you're interested in participating in making this it's it's out there there's a repo I started it just to let it linger slowly dying all right um 136 concurrent viewers light little lights for a Sunday here probably haven't haven't been making videos haven't been streaming by the way the the viewership activity on the channel is like at about 50 right now of what it has been or what it normally had been throughout the throughout 2022 I attribute that to my lack of making videos also um I don't know whether it's my uh whether there's just more competition whether it's my the topic Choice the sort of branding thumbnail title branding but the last two coding Challenge videos did not catch any of the algorithm YouTube algorithm waves that a lot of my code and Challenge videos have in the past um so in case you missed those you know feel free to check them out okay um all right 140. so let's take um I'm looking at my phone here because I've got a back Channel chat with the uh and with the NYU folks let's talk about the nature of code and this is all just good news um okay I mean I could brainstorm other things to add to this list or things that I might want to cut from it but let's let's talk about the nature of code okay so a couple things this semester at NYU I taught a undergraduate and graduate section of the class nature of code now if you're not familiar with what nature of code is I'm going to show you a website that you really should stay away from this is the actual public active nature of code website what is on it is it has a mechanism for you to download the book as a PDF ePub and Kindle you can slide this all the way down to zero and get it for free if you this is also a way for you to support the project if you wanted to if you have the capacity you can also uh um link to Amazon where you can purchase it I keep meaning to add um I've been using um Bookshop more recently which I did find it available on as well so you know support independent booksellers through Bookshop um is another possible way to get the book and then um the book itself is just online here as HTML CSS uh content that you can read for free online so why am I talking about this I started this project I would say probably in 2008 I think that's right someone would have to fact check this when I taught a version of this class um you know a lot of the material came out of other courses that I talked about and that I'd taken as a graduate student myself and other other work that I've written about in the acknowledgment so I want to just make sure I mention that and um you know probably around like five years later like maybe two thousand or even less like 2016 2017 I started thinking about updates to the book based on things that I had learned and thought that I could improve the changing landscape of machine learning and deep learning there's a chapter on neural networks that is you know woefully out of data quite possibly quite irrelevant now um as well as using p5.js for the uh just to make the book easier to interact with and use online so Java applets not being a thing anymore that you can easily run in the browser P5 is a nice choice for the book so uh I've been spinning my wheels for a really long time about updating it slowly a little bit here a little bit there and lots of people have helped me and this is a much longer story but what I want to go to now is I want to look at NOC book well so sorry on GitHub if I go to the nature of code and I realize I'm standing in front of a lot of this let me move this over if I go to the nature of code organization on GitHub you'll find a whole bunch of repositories the existing website the syllabus for the class I just taught but the one that I really want to highlight here is nature of code book 2023 and I just want to validate that I have really been working on this by going to how do I find it um I think I have to click here insights let's just see and let's look uh what do I do like commits maybe would be a good one to look at um and no where's that graph let me just like contributors contributors maybe is what I mean to look at yeah so you can actually slow down because of the end of the semester but what I um there's been a lot of work on the book itself all happening I mean really in the last year so um so what do I mean by work so if I go to um here a couple things there have been um a whole bunch of people you can see them here under contributors um Jason gal most recently doing a ton of this work into building a whole new workflow for publishing the book which involves notion and um you know um and a whole build system to turn the book into a website and if I click over here you will now see uh prototype work in progress version of the new nature of code book and I want to say that basically all of these chapters are somewhere between 80 to 100 completed which is very very good news that's much further along than I have been at any point during this process so if I were to just look at one of them let's pick the vectors one and start to scroll through it uh you'll want to just point out a number of things one is the examples now well the I'm gonna I'm gonna just uh make this smaller so you can see it a bit more what it looks like the examples are embedded in here running in the browser um if I click on any given example it will take me right to the code in the web editor so this is what I'm talking about about the convenience we've got the written text um I want to see here if uh with new illustrations so these are all new illustrations that Zanna Marsh who is a colleague friend uh Alum of the ITP program has been working on um there's some really fun ones that you'll find throughout the book there is new uh math notation so the quality of the math notation that I'm using is much better using I think it's katex is what it's called um so again embedded examples and I can scroll through we can go to a different chapter just to kind of see some more sophisticated this is this is my new one of my new favorite things about the book is uh the target for all the steering examples is a strawberry because Berry so that makes me enormously happy so um so uh but as I get further on the chapters are a little less and less like there's still some work happening in the fractals chapter that needs to be finished um so this chapter is very much in progress here's kind of a fun illustration about factorial you can see the recursion examples so this is all available for you to read and look at online if you want to do so and if you are doing so and you have comments you notice typos mistakes broken examples what I would ask for you to do is file an issue here in the GitHub repository you at present cannot fix content in the book with a pull request even though all the content for the book is here and you could do a pull request to make an edit there I am doing the work of writing in notion database so these HTML files are autogenerated and I'm going to show you right now that process because I just did a lot of work on chapter nine evolutionary Computing but I did not update the website so let's make that happen I'm going to go here to actions I'm going to run so there's this action that if I run this workflow and I'm going to do it right now because it takes a bit of time looking at oh whoa we're almost ready to move into the ITB show this workflow will go and I I don't know if I can easily I'm afraid to open notion right now maybe I'll I will show that at a future time um but this process is now reading the notion API retrieving all of my writing from the notion API as Json and it's converting that Json into um the HTML files it is also if you can believe this and I really can't take any credit for this uh you can look you can look through the uh the people who have worked in the repo and all of this code um in addition it is grabbing any images so all of the figures and images and screenshots that are uploaded into notion come into the repo as well as all of the code so if I put a link to a P5 web editor sketch in notion that web editor URL is gotten via the notion API and then we're using the P5 web editor API to get the code to create the embed that's on the page it's amazing um so if I look at that here we can see this is running the I'm just gonna see if we can get like the logs for it um you can see this is the lodge right now it's this is it just fetching all the notion content um so it's still and um and doing that um and thanks thanks fun Planet uh for putting um everything it and when this is done I really hope it finishes in time for me to show you it will auto generate a pull request which will uh that which I will then merge which will then rebuild and update the website so uh with Gatsby so um it's tremendous amount of work and time has gone into this and uh the reason why I I'm now finally a couple reasons why I'm finally getting this done one is uh thank you to um it some ITB students have been working with with me on this um as well as ITP alums and other volunteers um and teaching being teaching the class this semester kind of focused my energy onto it as well as and I'm excited to report that um I will be working with no starch just go to the to for the print version of the book so you might be asking this question like wait wait wait wait what's going on here the it was the original version of the book which is not here where is that did I close it I must have closed it let's put it here on the nebula page uh and I gotta keep an eye on the time here because I I think the ITP live stream has started but the actual it's just playing a placeholder video It's Gonna I gotta send you guys to there send everybody there too so the original book was selfpublished and this was very important to me um because I wanted to be Creative Commons licensed I wanted to be an open education platform you know it is an ex it was an expensive project for me to produce so the income from you know optional pay what you want online and the print book did help uh uh certainly uh broke even and uh probably over 10 years has now well exceeded whatever I invested into it although I don't know if you count the time uh with what that would mean but um but there were there's a few issues with this one is one of the reasons why I selfpublished it was for that for the open education model um and no starch press is uh I've been uh chatting with them and talking with them is really on board with that so the book itself will still be the new version of the book will still be Creative Commons licensed and available for free online um the print version um print on demand is is a nice in theory and I think there's lots of good applications for it but I have a lot of issues with the quality the print quality of the book people were reporting you can see like right here uh on the website says uh problem with the quality of your print like I had to build a whole thing put a whole thing on the website that was like a separate page for to show like what the page should look like what people were seeing it as so that I could like keep track of this um and like you know kind of complain or try to get them a new version of the book um the company that I used for print on demand was acquired by Amazon so I kind of don't want to use it again because you know we all have to make decisions that work with our lives and I am going to have a book that's sold on Amazon and I do buy things off of Amazon but I don't like the all eggs in one basket I do want to support um all Alternatives and so by working with no starch I can have a higher quality book and I can have it um I can have more ways of Distributing it plus I have the editing support the project management support and they're putting me on a deadline so I have to finish this that's the morally the most important thing so I wanted to just give you those updates about it um if you want to follow along oh good this finish this oh it's it completed the job but I don't see a pull request yet oh it's there so if you want to follow along uh fun Planet posted the links in the chat uh please come and read uh if you want to contribute then come and visit the repository and the easiest the lowest barrier to entry for contributing is like filing an issue and even if you wanted to file an issue that just says like I support you working on this project it's okay that you're not live streaming or making a lot of videos because this project is important if you just want to say that and you're like that's a way of participating in the project but you can also leave comments um you can read through what's kind of outstanding um and that kind of thing okay so this is every print is unique and guaranteed to be one of a kind yeah okay that's nature of code which is a really nice segue uh to move back to what is the primary purpose of today uh which is the ITP IMA spring show so let's look at these projects is there a way to search and filter let's see can I search by Nature oh nature of code oh look at this so now we are now seeing all of the projects from the nature of code course which was my course and uh from the semester and the all of these wonderful students oh I'm so excited to see these projects there might be more that somehow didn't get tagged right but let's let's in the in the in five minutes we're going to send you over to the live stream there where they were actually the students will be walking around with the camera let me just get my chat with NYU going and make sure what is that sound a weird sound just started happening um oh I forgot to show oh there's so many things ah uh let me just find my uh chat here okay we are ready to go live whenever you wrap up they say okay I'm wrapping up um I'm wrapping up give five minutes okay five more minutes okay all right so first of all I kind of forgot just because I was here I forgot to show the sort of cool thing about this which is now it's running the tests so it can't it hasn't preview built it yet but you can now see here um all of the edits that I have made um in the book since the last time the site was published so you can see a lot of like code things that I've done and I actually did a lot of work on the genetic algorithms chapter so if you look here you can see in this pull request all the things that I've been updating and rewriting uh for the nature of code chapter so I just wanted to show that for the for the genetic algorithms chapter and then ah and it finished awesome so now it also built a preview on netlify so if I go here this would be now all the rewrites of the genetic algorithm chapter would be here and I can see already these new tables that I put in I have to fix these um are there and I am going to very excitedly emerge that what I usually do is I try to do uh chapter nine updates and more just change the title uh and I'm going to merge this okay okay so I just wanted to close the loop on that I forgot to mention that part of my nature of code book discussion all right now the Showcase all right so let's look um let's look at one of these uh I'm gonna look at uh uh I I I I'm like I'm like I can't pick I'll just click through all all six of them real fast oh come on that didn't let me ah no okay I feel like this will be a nice ending to this oh I see there's also oh no it got okay uh open why there's some kind of like JavaScript here that's not allowing me to open in a new in a new tab so let's let's let's pick a random number random.org uh let's pick a random number one through six one through six and that's one we'll look at from top one two three four five six all right three okay we're looking at number three which is wait a second here they're in a different order okay we're looking at Reformation the invisible surroundings by Ray um and sort of like a video here that I can play but there's an image here this is a I will just as I know about this project I will describe it this is a you know a data visualization of weather data and that's uh I think there's a much larger uh conceptual underpinning to this project idea that you can read all about in the description
