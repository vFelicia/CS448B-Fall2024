00:00 - oh hello part three of pleating the data
00:06 - supposedly oh it's a lot of work just
00:10 - dealing with data is a whole project
00:12 - unto itself it's I've been here for like
00:14 - 72 hours straight I haven't even looked
00:17 - at tension flow yes I'm just looking at
00:19 - my digna and all I'm doing is color
00:21 - classification all right I kid I kid a
00:24 - little bit but it's true it's true so
00:25 - this is the third video I what I if you
00:27 - if you watched the previous two I
00:29 - started trying to visualize what the
00:31 - data looked like and kind of examine are
00:32 - there certain users that I should filter
00:34 - out that's bad data maybe I should just
00:36 - leave it all in there anyway I'm trying
00:38 - to build a model that looks at the color
00:41 - and classifies it into one of these
00:45 - buckets and this is my crowd-sourced
00:47 - system that allows people to look at
00:48 - colors and click on one of these bucket
00:51 - so that's a little bit about like human
00:52 - perception what does the I sort of see
00:55 - in terms of RGB color alright so the
00:59 - code base that I'm starting with is from
01:01 - the previous video I'm just connecting
01:02 - to the firebase database and I am
01:05 - looping through and looking at each
01:07 - record one at a time each record has a
01:09 - user ID which is anonymous it has an R a
01:11 - G a B and a label so I determined you
01:16 - know not somewhat loosely I didn't you
01:18 - know I really need to spend more time
01:19 - and more thoughtful about this there's
01:21 - extra comma here that these are the
01:23 - three users that I would like to filter
01:25 - out so what I want to do in this video
01:27 - by the end of it let's have a JSON file
01:30 - that I can print if I wanted to I'm not
01:34 - going to print it hold in my virtual
01:36 - hands these are my real hands and use
01:40 - that to actually build a machine
01:42 - learning model from so all I need to do
01:45 - if I want to filter these out this is
01:47 - what I did is I made an object that just
01:49 - has those three user IDs as keys
01:52 - arbitrarily with a value of true and
01:54 - then what I can do is I could say if ret
01:59 - if if filter if filter does not include
02:06 - this records user ID and so let's just
02:09 - say let ID equal record user
02:14 - if it's not in the filter let's make a
02:20 - let's say all data is a big array and
02:24 - actually what I'm going to do is I'm
02:26 - going to make it an object you'll see
02:28 - why in a second that has a I'm just
02:32 - gonna call it like entries which is an
02:34 - array then I'm going to say all data dot
02:38 - entries dot push that record so what I
02:43 - want to do is I want to look at every
02:45 - single data point chen i'm begin there's
02:48 - some nice higher-order function i could
02:49 - do this in one line of code but i'm
02:51 - doing this very manually i'm gonna look
02:53 - at every record I'm gonna check the user
02:55 - ID if as long as that is it one of my
02:57 - user IDs that I'm filtering out I'm
02:59 - gonna put it in my all data dot entries
03:01 - array and then I'm going to say save
03:06 - JSON color data JSON all data now this
03:14 - is a p5 function that will then put this
03:17 - JSON file into my downloads directory
03:19 - and I could be doing this a node in the
03:20 - server side there's no reason we have
03:22 - client-side code doing this but that's
03:24 - what I'm doing right now so let's run
03:26 - this and see what happens this is my
03:29 - download data script okay a index up is
03:34 - not a function firebase huh
03:36 - I don't know save JSON okay so this may
03:39 - be let's look at maybe it's actually
03:41 - goes like this the data and then the
03:44 - file name I think that's what it's yes
03:48 - there we go so we can see right here
03:50 - this is downloaded now I can take a look
03:52 - at this file I can open that file up and
04:00 - we can see there we go here is my data
04:03 - set hi this was the surest video ever so
04:06 - now I have this data set do I wanna sew
04:10 - things that I need to do is I need to
04:11 - normalize the data set and I need to
04:13 - assign the labels numeric values because
04:17 - I'm going to need that for what I want
04:21 - to do with tensorflow j/s mm-hmm so I
04:24 - mean I think I'm gonna
04:26 - to reshape the data and turn it into
04:30 - tensors I'll do that in the next video
04:33 - as well just keep sequencing this so you
04:36 - know maybe you could be more thoughtful
04:38 - about I don't know what I'm trying to
04:40 - give you an exercise to do at the end of
04:41 - this video I got nothing for you
04:42 - but you could build an interface for
04:44 - this where you could maybe you could
04:46 - port this to like a server-side script
04:48 - maybe you could save it to a CSV file
04:50 - those are some things you could try but
04:52 - in the next video we're going to do I'm
04:53 - gonna actually start working with
04:54 - tensorflow gjs I need to turn all of
04:57 - these things into tensors because
04:59 - tensors are the thing that I need to to
05:04 - create to train my machine learning
05:06 - model goodbye
