With timestamps:

00:02 - okay this is the last introductory video
00:04 - before we get into the actual stuff - 
it really is the
00:08 - exciting part where you're going to look
at examples, start writing your own code,
00:13 - start making stuff, coming up with your
ideas, trying things out -
00:16 - before you start making things, I just
want to give you an overview
00:19 - as to what my plan is for all these
videos, so
00:23 - there's a key thing here -
pick up some energy back here, run in
00:28 - place, run in place - okay
00:29 - there's a key thing here. 
I want these videos to cover
00:32 - the fundamentals of computation, 
the fundamental building blocks
00:36 - of computer programming,
00:38 - and really, there is a short list of
things that you need to know and
00:42 - understand, there are these core 
elements that will go across
00:44 - any type of software development, 
creative coding,
00:48 - computer science, whatever 
you want to call it,
00:51 - writing code on your computer,
and really actually
00:55 - three categories, so, any computer
program that runs
01:00 - needs to have data associated with it,
right, it needs to store information about
01:04 - itself, colors, you know,
01:07 - sometimes I wish I didn't do this but
just to think about
01:12 - game programming for a second
01:13 - if you were creating the game 
Space Invaders
01:16 - you may need to keep track of the space
ship's position on the screen,
01:20 - which level is the game on,
01:23 - what's the current players score, 
there are elements data
01:27 - that a computer program needs to keep in
mind as it's running, and this is actually
01:30 - one of the first things
01:32 - we will learn about which is
this concept of a variable
01:35 - this thing that stores data.
01:37 - In addition, I'm gonna go out over here, in
addition to this idea of a variable which
01:43 - individual piece of data - is an
01:47 - Okay, don't worry, everything's okay, there's
a floor, and I just dropped the cap -
01:51 - in addition to a variable which is
an individual piece of data
01:53 - we're also going to learn about
01:55 - something called an array, which we
could also think of
01:58 - as a list, so what about a list of data
02:01 - instead of like a spaceship as an
individual location, what if there are
02:05 - 10 enemies on screen
02:06 - could we have a list of enemy locations? So
any computer program needs to store data
02:11 - we're gonna learn about variables and arrays. The
other thing that we need to really
02:15 - learn about is this idea of control. How
do we control the flow
02:20 - of a computer program, how do we
control the path by which it takes,
02:24 - right, if the spaceship - 
I wish I could think of
02:28 - something less violent - 
shoots its laser
02:32 - and hits the enemy its score goes up, 
right, how do we control that,
02:37 - how do we control that process,
02:40 - if the player dropped a seed and a
flower blooms,
02:45 - that's a nicer way of thinking about it, so,
02:47 - we want to look at this idea of
conditionals, conditional logic,
02:51 - if statements, if this condition is met
02:55 - then the program executes this
instruction, alright,
02:59 - that's something we're gonna look at.
Another control structure we're gonna
03:02 - is a loop, right, this idea repeating
03:05 - if we have 100 enemy spaceships,
03:08 - do we want to have a hundred lines of
code - draw spaceship one
03:12 - draw space ship two, draw space ship three - 
no, we want to have this loop
03:16 - draw every spaceship, for every spaceship
03:19 - draw it on the screen, so this is this
idea, really simple, these are these
03:24 - fundamentals, we're gonna have
03:25 - a set of videos about each one of these -
how do we deal with a variable,
03:29 - how do we deal with a conditional ,how do we
deal with a loop, how do we deal with an array
03:37 - thinking about
03:32 - but another thing that's going to be
very primary to this video series is
03:39 - organizing, I want to say organization,
03:42 - thinking about how you organize your
code, so
03:45 - when we first start we're gonna be
reading very simple instructions,
03:49 - line, fill, which is set a color,
03:52 - rectangle, ellipse, just for drawing stuff
on the screen
03:56 - but as we write larger and larger
programs we need to encapsulate
04:00 - ideas into kinda their own mini-programs in
04:03 - a way, so, the two kind of key principles
04:06 - of organization that we're going to look at is how
to write a function,
04:10 - what if we figure out a nice way of drawing
04:14 - a flower pattern on the screen, right,
04:17 - I can't draw, this is a flower, right,
04:20 - if we figure out how to draw a flower
and we want to have 10 flowers on the screen
04:24 - are we gonna rewrite all the code for
drawing a flower 10 times, maybe that was
04:29 - a hundred lines of code just to get this
pattern,
04:31 - could we just take this entire idea of a
flower and put it in its own function
04:36 - so that anytime you want a flower on
screen we have a new command so to speak
04:40 - we can just say
04:41 - "flower", and even more than this idea of
functions,
04:44 - a key principle we wanna look at is objects,
04:47 - object-oriented programming. This, to me,
04:50 - is one of the ways that I really
started to feel comfortable
04:54 - writing software,
04:55 - is once I got to the point of learning
object-oriented programming
04:58 - and understanding something and the
screen treating at in this way we look
05:03 - at the world,
05:03 - this is an object, this object had data
associated with it,
05:07 - its color is black, it is a dry erase
marker, that may be a
05:13 - piece of data, rather than a permanent
marker, and it has functionality,
05:17 - this thing I could say draw, I could take
its cap on and off, right,
05:21 - remove cap, add cap, so this idea of taking
something like a flower
05:25 - and turning into an object
05:26 - there's data about this flower, how big
how small is it, what color is it,
05:30 - and it might have functionality, it could
grow, the pedals could fall,
05:34 - so this idea of something happening in a
computer graphics application
05:38 - being packaged up into this object. Now
this sounds very theoretical and grand,
05:42 - or perhaps confusing right now,
05:45 - but we're going to get into the details of how to
05:47 - take a program which has variables
and conditionals and loops and all this logic and
05:51 - all this data and how to organize it 
into a way that we can just say
05:55 - "hey, there are seed objects and there
are flower objects and there is grass
05:59 - objects and therefore
06:00 - if we were creating some kind of garden
simulation,
06:04 - for example. So these are all the things
we want to learn.
06:07 - In some programming courses,
06:11 - something like object-oriented
programming might be something that comes
06:13 - very very late in the game, almost
at the very end or
06:16 - perhaps in like a second semester even as
an advanced topic,
06:19 - but we're going to get to objects
06:21 - pretty quickly because I want that to be
a fundamental way
06:24 - that we look at creating examples and
creating projects in Processing, so
06:28 - this is kinda, this is the list of
fundamentals, right,
06:32 - these are kind of computer science
fundamentals,
06:35 - I use the word computer science
06:36 - I, like, "demerit!", my goal is to
06:39 - never mention the term computer science in
any these videos, anyway, I'll go
06:44 - off on that ran or tangent, not rant, 
I don't like "rant",
06:47 - but anyway, edit this out please,
somebody, okay,
06:50 - so these are the fundamentals, the things
06:53 - that will transfer to any programming language 
and environment, these are
06:58 - the kind of core elements, we want to understand
these in great detail,
07:01 - without any fear or sadness, we just want to
feel happy and comfortable about all these things
07:06 - and start to practice
07:07 - writing programs,
07:09 - but once we get through this I also want to
take a look at
07:14 - some applications, so what are some types
of things that one might do, for example
07:19 - I really wanna look at images, 
how do we load images
07:23 - and draw images to the screen, how do we read
07:25 - the pixels of an image and manipulate
and do image processing, how do we do the
07:30 - kinds of things that might happen
07:32 - in a piece software like Photoshop, how do we 
write that stuff from scratch
07:35 - with code, what happens if we use a
moving image like a camera
07:39 - or a video, can we do things like
computer vision,
07:42 - how do we write
software that can find somebody's face,
07:47 - how do we write software that can track
the skeleton, the human body, with the Kinect
07:51 - so I wanna have a set of
videos about
07:55 - images and pixels. 
I also want to look at
07:58 - data as a topic, so what does it
mean to load data into a program
08:04 - what are the kinds of ways
of loading data, there's
08:07 - plain text, and XML, and JSON,
08:11 - and there are all sorts of
08:14 - data classes in Processing that allow
you to load data, parse data,
08:18 - and draw stuff based on that data, so what
does it mean to connect to,
08:22 - you know, data that's local versus data
that on a server,
08:25 - I wanna look at a whole set examples,
what does it mean to work with text,
08:30 - strings, what does it mean to read a
novel and count all the words
08:34 - in that novel, to do a concordance, so I
wanna have a set of videos that
08:39 - deal with data, and I haven't 
made these videos yet,
08:42 - so I totally don't know exactly what we're gonna do,
we could think about,
08:45 - what about 3D graphics, so I guess what I meant
08:48 - is like topics, so this video series is going to
08:51 - start with the fundamentals, all the
fundamental tools of computation, and in there
08:56 - we're also going to have to learn about
08:58 - pixels and drawing and color and shape,
some basic computer graphic stuff, but
09:02 - really we're going to focus on these
fundamental core concepts of computation,
09:06 - and from there, once we have all this bag of tricks
09:09 - we're going to reinforce those ideas, do
them over and over again,
09:12 - practice with them
09:13 - through a set of topics: 
images, pixels, data,
09:16 - 3D graphics, I could come up
with some others
09:20 - but is a pretty good starting point right now.
09:23 - Integration with the web, perhaps,
what is this landscape
09:28 - of, could we do Processing on the web,
there's this thing called Processing.js,
09:32 - which is JavaScript,
09:33 - we might try to look at that at
some point in the video series.
09:35 - So I think I'm kind of done 
with talking about this but
09:39 - just to kind of like walk through the
order, this is gonna help me, you can stop,
09:43 - I'm just gonna organize my own
thoughts, and
09:45 - I'm gonna keep recording, why not, right,
this might be a bad idea,
09:49 - okay, so, we're in the intro
09:53 - videos right now, so we're kind of going to be done
with the intro videos
09:57 - and actually we're gonna, I guess there's 
something right before that which is the basics
10:01 - of drawing in Processing, which we're going 
to start with, I'll call this like
10:05 - "1", this will be "2", once we get through the
basics of drawing,
10:08 - we're going to look at variables, 
that'll be the sort of
10:12 - videos called number three, 
then, this would be like
10:15 - if this were a course, if you were
taking a class,
10:19 - if this were anything other than just me
in this weird room rambling,
10:23 - then this would be like week one,
week two, week three, and in fact these
10:28 - videos are intended to go along with
this course that I am teaching here which is
10:31 - divided into weeks, and this would
really actually be week one,
10:35 - intro and drawing,
10:36 - so I'll keep that, so this
would be variables,
10:39 - then we're going to look at
conditionals and loops,
10:44 - after that we will get
10:48 - to arrays, I think I got this right,
10:51 - and then after that we will look at
functions, after that we will look at
10:56 - objects. So it's kind of like half a semester,
11:00 - six weeks, this is grossly accelerated
in many ways,
11:05 - you need a lifetime to really master all this stuff,
11:08 - I need lots more time myself, but this will be
11:13 - a kind of six-week or six video sections
11:17 - through all these topics, and again 
after that, seven
11:20 - would be images, eight would be data, maybe
I'll do that in a different order,
11:24 - nine would be 3D graphics, so
11:26 - we'll kinda get to all this stuff.
11:29 - Okay, so this hopefully gives you a
nice overview,
11:33 - I've kind of wrapped up this introductory
stuff, I feel like these were
11:37 - kind of challenging videos to make in the
sense that they're very
11:41 - kinda, it's less kind of how-to and
looking at stuff step-by-step and more
11:46 - just kinda rambling through general
concepts, and I feel like I missed so many
11:49 - things I meant to say,
11:50 - so someday I may go back and add things in
11:52 - or write some stuff in the
descriptions but if something is missing
11:57 - or something is confusing you,
11:58 - please, at this point I guess your way
to interact is to use the comments,
12:02 - write a comment, ask a question there
and we could start with a
12:06 - dialogue that way,
12:07 - although the videos may end up also
somewhere else embedded
12:11 - into some sort of site that has them as well.
12:13 - Okay, so that's that so I will see you
12:17 - another time, I thank you, I bid you
12:20 - "adieu," apparently I'm getting into 
some French stuff in these videos
12:24 - okay, au revoir!

Cleaned transcript:

okay this is the last introductory video before we get into the actual stuff it really is the exciting part where you're going to look at examples, start writing your own code, start making stuff, coming up with your ideas, trying things out before you start making things, I just want to give you an overview as to what my plan is for all these videos, so there's a key thing here pick up some energy back here, run in place, run in place okay there's a key thing here. I want these videos to cover the fundamentals of computation, the fundamental building blocks of computer programming, and really, there is a short list of things that you need to know and understand, there are these core elements that will go across any type of software development, creative coding, computer science, whatever you want to call it, writing code on your computer, and really actually three categories, so, any computer program that runs needs to have data associated with it, right, it needs to store information about itself, colors, you know, sometimes I wish I didn't do this but just to think about game programming for a second if you were creating the game Space Invaders you may need to keep track of the space ship's position on the screen, which level is the game on, what's the current players score, there are elements data that a computer program needs to keep in mind as it's running, and this is actually one of the first things we will learn about which is this concept of a variable this thing that stores data. In addition, I'm gonna go out over here, in addition to this idea of a variable which individual piece of data is an Okay, don't worry, everything's okay, there's a floor, and I just dropped the cap in addition to a variable which is an individual piece of data we're also going to learn about something called an array, which we could also think of as a list, so what about a list of data instead of like a spaceship as an individual location, what if there are 10 enemies on screen could we have a list of enemy locations? So any computer program needs to store data we're gonna learn about variables and arrays. The other thing that we need to really learn about is this idea of control. How do we control the flow of a computer program, how do we control the path by which it takes, right, if the spaceship I wish I could think of something less violent shoots its laser and hits the enemy its score goes up, right, how do we control that, how do we control that process, if the player dropped a seed and a flower blooms, that's a nicer way of thinking about it, so, we want to look at this idea of conditionals, conditional logic, if statements, if this condition is met then the program executes this instruction, alright, that's something we're gonna look at. Another control structure we're gonna is a loop, right, this idea repeating if we have 100 enemy spaceships, do we want to have a hundred lines of code draw spaceship one draw space ship two, draw space ship three no, we want to have this loop draw every spaceship, for every spaceship draw it on the screen, so this is this idea, really simple, these are these fundamentals, we're gonna have a set of videos about each one of these how do we deal with a variable, how do we deal with a conditional ,how do we deal with a loop, how do we deal with an array thinking about but another thing that's going to be very primary to this video series is organizing, I want to say organization, thinking about how you organize your code, so when we first start we're gonna be reading very simple instructions, line, fill, which is set a color, rectangle, ellipse, just for drawing stuff on the screen but as we write larger and larger programs we need to encapsulate ideas into kinda their own miniprograms in a way, so, the two kind of key principles of organization that we're going to look at is how to write a function, what if we figure out a nice way of drawing a flower pattern on the screen, right, I can't draw, this is a flower, right, if we figure out how to draw a flower and we want to have 10 flowers on the screen are we gonna rewrite all the code for drawing a flower 10 times, maybe that was a hundred lines of code just to get this pattern, could we just take this entire idea of a flower and put it in its own function so that anytime you want a flower on screen we have a new command so to speak we can just say "flower", and even more than this idea of functions, a key principle we wanna look at is objects, objectoriented programming.
