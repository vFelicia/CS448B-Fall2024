00:00 - well welcome to a second video about
00:02 - using matter KS so in the previous video
00:04 - I kind of ended with this which is just
00:06 - a simple demonstration of falling
00:09 - rectangles landing on a ground I want to
00:12 - do two things in this video to expand on
00:14 - our sort of knowledge and sense of what
00:15 - matter dot J's can do I want to change
00:17 - these falling rectangles into circles
00:21 - and I want to change the way that the
00:23 - boundary works in that I want to make
00:27 - the this bottom boundary I want to be
00:29 - able to put it at an angle and maybe put
00:30 - a bunch of them so there's one of the
00:31 - matter J as examples is essentially this
00:33 - let's just go to the website because I'm
00:35 - going to need I'm gonna need the
00:37 - documents open the documentation open so
00:39 - at some point here one will come let's
00:43 - wait for it hey no that's not it
00:49 - maybe that was it I think it's not there
00:52 - look at all these demonstrations I there
00:53 - it is this one I want to kind of make
00:55 - this that one you see that one so let's
00:57 - so what do I need to do so first of all
00:59 - I did this sort of terrible thing where
01:01 - this bottom thing which I'm calling a
01:03 - boundary or the floor was kind of hard
01:05 - coded so let's fix that and there's
01:09 - going to be some redundancy here but I'm
01:10 - going to live with the redundancy I'm
01:11 - going to make another JavaScript file
01:13 - called boundary is that's the right
01:16 - place and then I'm not going to forget
01:18 - this time in index.html I'm going to add
01:21 - another reference to boundary Jas now
01:27 - what I want to do is this ground
01:29 - variable instead of creating the body
01:32 - right here I want to say new boundary
01:35 - which is my own thing and I'm going to
01:39 - use those same arguments 200 height
01:42 - amendment get rid of options and then
01:44 - what I'm going to add under options is
01:51 - in the boundary object whoops where's
01:55 - that boundary object oh it says box here
01:57 - wait wait wait Ayya box this needs to
01:59 - save it hungry and I'm going to add is
02:03 - static true so by definition this idea
02:08 - of a boundary I mean boundary probably
02:09 - wrong word but is going to be something
02:11 - that doesn't move that's
02:13 - inflexible that in one place in the code
02:15 - okay so now I should then be able to say
02:20 - and let's make it a different color
02:23 - the boxes are kind of like a white
02:26 - outline and a gray interior just so we
02:29 - see that it's something different
02:30 - let's give it a white outline and a I
02:33 - don't look afraid to use color Oh a
02:38 - black dark a black interior okay so
02:42 - everything should be the same right now
02:43 - I'm going to change things about boxes
02:45 - versus boundaries but now if I make the
02:48 - ground the boundary then I should be
02:50 - able to just say I don't need any of
02:51 - this down here I can just say ground dot
02:53 - show so if I ever changed the way the
02:55 - boundary works then I don't have to
02:58 - worry about that so let's see so this
03:00 - still works exactly the same way and you
03:04 - know I'm like annoyed with the fact that
03:06 - the outline is bleeding off the edge
03:08 - here so I'm going to kind of for no good
03:11 - reason
03:12 - change this to like you know what I'm
03:14 - actually going to do is I'm going to go
03:15 - into boundary and not have it have a
03:17 - stroke so I'm going to say I'm not going
03:19 - to have any outline to that color I'm
03:21 - gonna say no stroke okay there we go
03:23 - this is more like rolling okay so we're
03:24 - in good shape now here's the thing I
03:25 - want to demonstrate a problem that
03:27 - happened in the previous video so I'm
03:29 - going to change right now having engine
03:32 - I'm not going to say engine update in a
03:36 - in draw I'm going to go back to having
03:39 - engine run in setup so this will up with
03:43 - engine not update I'm manually telling
03:46 - the physics system to move ahead a
03:48 - moment of time every time through draw
03:50 - which is kind of good like move ahead
03:52 - draw move ahead draw with engine run
03:54 - it's going to run on its own behind the
03:56 - scenes separate from how I'm drawing
03:58 - you'll actually see stuff appear to be
04:00 - moving faster because there's going to
04:01 - it's going to the engine is going to be
04:03 - running at 60 frames per second where my
04:05 - actual draw would might be less so let
04:07 - me just do that still works fine but you
04:10 - know I don't know what's Benny way I
04:13 - feel like I have more control but what I
04:14 - want to show you the issue is if I now
04:17 - change the that boundary at the bottom
04:20 - to something like it's only like three
04:21 - pixels you can
04:25 - see that sub stuff is working but let me
04:27 - go up here look sometimes the the
04:29 - rectangles like fall through the bottom
04:31 - do you see that one oh I always had to
04:33 - find it it fell through and we wanted to
04:35 - get another one ah come on happen bug
04:40 - there you go you think some of them are
04:42 - falling through so the reason why this
04:44 - is happening is because there aren't
04:46 - enough time steps the mo it's checking
04:49 - where the object is then it moves it and
04:51 - checks again and it's actually jumped
04:53 - over the obstacle so there are there's a
04:56 - number of ways we could fix this number
04:57 - ones the way I fix is just like okay
04:59 - just make the ground thicker and now
05:02 - this problem can't happen and so that's
05:05 - one way of fixing it but there's
05:09 - actually a there's I'm going to put ng
05:11 - update back into the draw loop if you
05:15 - look in the documentation which I showed
05:16 - yesterday there are a variables here
05:18 - there are arguments you can pass through
05:20 - about time steps and Leah Peru on
05:23 - Twitter the creator of the matter dot
05:26 - J's library wrote to me and said the
05:27 - issue of skipping is best solved like
05:30 - you did by using thicker floor or a
05:32 - smaller time step or multiple updates
05:35 - per step so that's something you could
05:37 - do but the AB rewrites there is a
05:39 - feature called continuous collisions
05:41 - that I am working on that solves the
05:43 - issue for any time step so that's coming
05:45 - forward so that was great to hear that
05:47 - it's so wonderful to like to consider
05:48 - all about the physics engine and have
05:50 - the creator of the open source a library
05:52 - way in and provide feedback so thank you
05:54 - for that Leah brew on Twitter okay so
05:57 - now let's keep going with this the next
05:58 - thing I want to demonstrate is I want to
06:00 - see if I can turn that obstacle at an
06:02 - angle so let's look at the boundary
06:06 - objects so this is where I'm creating
06:08 - the rectangle object and it's the
06:11 - variables in this body so what I'm just
06:12 - going to do is I'm going to say
06:14 - console.log this dot body let's look at
06:20 - what some of the properties are and
06:22 - here's a property angle so this leads me
06:24 - to believe that I could most likely just
06:26 - set the angle to a value and it would
06:28 - change it so let's try that let's try
06:31 - saying something like this dot angle
06:34 - equals pi divided by four
06:37 - which is about 45 degrees in radians
06:39 - right pi divided by 2 is 90 degrees so
06:41 - let's do that hmm no what am I missing
06:46 - Oh oh I'm just being silly
06:50 - it's this dot body angle so when I say
06:52 - this dot angle
06:54 - this dot this dot this dot leg line
06:57 - adding a property called angle to my
06:59 - boundaries but remember my boundary
07:01 - object is simply a wrapper really for
07:03 - the matter a s body object so I need to
07:07 - say this dot body angle and that should
07:09 - success for me there we go so now we can
07:12 - see whoa weird stuff happening crazy
07:16 - weird stuff happening is there an
07:19 - initial angle can I do this is this
07:21 - better if I just set it as an option at
07:25 - the beginning let's try that ah there we
07:31 - go okay so it looks like this is so
07:35 - these are the classic things that
07:36 - happens with physics engine I violated
07:38 - the laws of physics by just setting its
07:40 - angle directly the only reason it's
07:42 - angle would change is if a force
07:44 - something was probably added to it that
07:47 - instigated though I'm not looking at the
07:49 - chat so so I have a feeling that you
07:53 - just can't set the angle directly unless
07:55 - you kind of work with the mechanics of
07:57 - how the physics engine is behind the
07:59 - scene so if I want to change its angle
08:01 - while it's running I need to maybe apply
08:02 - an angular velocity or angular force to
08:05 - have a turn so that's nice to see that
08:06 - that's fixed so let's let's add a bunch
08:10 - of these let's go to sketch KS and let's
08:15 - save our because call it boundaries is
08:17 - an array and what I'm going to do is I'm
08:22 - going to create a I'm going to create a
08:27 - bunch of them let's let's say boundaries
08:34 - boundaries dot push so let me just push
08:37 - this boundary now here's the thing I
08:41 - want to give it an angle so let me give
08:43 - it an angle like the new boundary also
08:46 - has an angle of PI / 4 so I can go into
08:48 - the bow
08:49 - three object and change add another
08:53 - argument like a for angle and put that
08:57 - in here and so what I want now is to
09:02 - let's make it like PI divided by let's
09:05 - just you know PI divided let's just
09:07 - let's just put some values in like 0.3
09:10 - so it's at a slight angle let's not make
09:11 - it so tall 50 let's so let's see here
09:16 - and let's and then what I want to do is
09:21 - here say for VAR i equals 0 i want to
09:25 - render all of the boundaries to do i for
09:35 - some reason today is the day where my
09:36 - codes lines of code are so long and
09:38 - going off the edge boundary Sasha so
09:41 - let's see what I've got going on you're
09:42 - have some errors sketch j/s line 20 what
09:45 - did I not do correctly here up so I got
09:47 - these semicolon in the wrong place a
09:50 - matter Dutch as new type of undefined
09:53 - sketch 22000 I don't need to add it here
09:59 - I wonder if that also caused the problem
10:02 - because I added it twice but because it
10:05 - gets added the thing that I did is added
10:06 - here so I don't need that other that's
10:07 - been a mistake that's been in the code
10:09 - and let's see here ok so we can see here
10:12 - this is working I've got a boundary
10:14 - there and so now let's add some other
10:16 - one let's add another one at a height
10:21 - divided by 2 and let's have it go the
10:24 - other angle the other direction so now
10:26 - and let's make these shorter with times
10:31 - 0.6 over I cannot get hard code values
10:34 - in and so now oh and let's move this one
10:36 - over whoops let's like move this to 250
10:42 - 150 so you get the idea
10:44 - oh no that's not really let's turn let's
10:46 - make this one you know what what's the
10:49 - size let's make this one 300 let's make
10:51 - this one 200 let's make this negative
10:54 - point sorry let's make this I'm sure I
10:56 - could make a clever loop there we go
10:58 - this is kind of what
10:59 - looking to do but I want this one now to
11:00 - be much higher up which this bottom one
11:03 - this is the higher up one let's make
11:06 - that even higher up and let's make this
11:08 - than just like 20 here okay so you can
11:11 - see what I'm trying to do here I'm
11:12 - trying to create a system like now the
11:15 - friction is quite high look how much the
11:18 - friction is causing these things to stop
11:20 - so let's at least fix that in the
11:22 - boundary the friction is 0.3 I can't
11:24 - remember
11:24 - is it zero is no friction or a lot of
11:27 - friction that looks like they're sliding
11:31 - more or less I can't tell let's go to
11:33 - the box and you also give it no friction
11:36 - there we go so now that's no friction
11:39 - but maybe I want a little bit of
11:41 - friction and maybe I want a little bit
11:43 - of friction on each and then also what I
11:47 - said I want to do is I wanted to change
11:48 - the rectangles that's really a lot of
11:51 - friction you can play around opposed
11:53 - values
11:55 - what if it's 0 on the boundary right
12:01 - look at all that friction look I really
12:06 - wasn't really no friction with zero yeah
12:10 - what I'm going to do is I am going to
12:13 - now also I want to change those
12:15 - rectangles into circles because why not
12:17 - so I'm going to go into the box and I
12:21 - could change the name of it from box but
12:23 - really what I want to do is change this
12:24 - to circle and I have a guess that what
12:28 - Circle wants is maybe XY lips XY radius
12:34 - so XY radius I'm going to change that in
12:37 - sketch to just make when I click the
12:40 - mouse to add one with a single radius
12:45 - and then I am going to change the way
12:51 - that I draw it to be an ellipse with an
12:57 - R instead of a wh so let's do that and
13:01 - here we go
13:04 - what am I missing sketch they asked line
13:05 - 30 and I boxes dot push
13:12 - push new box now sex amounts why this
13:16 - closes randomest I need another
13:18 - parentheses there and here we go
13:21 - now it looks like my size is on so let's
13:25 - go look at the documentation it's kind
13:26 - of working we can see the circles are
13:28 - like hitting the there they're kind of
13:32 - like above the actual they're actually
13:35 - above the actual boundary so let's go to
13:38 - the matter J s documentation let's go to
13:42 - bodies let's look for circle X Y radius
13:47 - I know what the problem is I was right
13:50 - all along
13:50 - but P 5 doesn't expect a radius it
13:54 - expects a diameter so all I need to do
13:56 - to fix this is actually where I'm
13:58 - drawing and let me call this circle just
14:01 - to be consistent and in sketch AF I'm
14:05 - going to now call this a circle and I'm
14:08 - going to change this to new circle and
14:12 - I've got to go through a circle stop
14:14 - length and change this to circles and
14:18 - now what I need to do I'm going to leave
14:19 - this as box just for right now I need to
14:22 - say this dot R times 2 and now look
14:28 - sketch a line 30 I missed one reference
14:31 - up circles dot push so we can see there
14:36 - we go now these are kind of large so I
14:38 - know it let me just change this between
14:40 - 5 and 10 and I'm also going to do a
14:43 - mouse dragged so now I can do is just we
14:47 - add a lot of circles and we can see I
14:50 - mostly have that demo we had before and
14:52 - actually I'm kind of along the way of
14:54 - almost creating a kind of liquid
14:56 - simulation because you can imagine if
14:58 - you were to change the way the behaviors
15:00 - of these kind of work make these really
15:02 - really tiny you would almost have
15:04 - something that has a kind of like
15:05 - liquidy like quality to it okay so now I
15:07 - have done is I did a second video where
15:09 - I showed you a bit more about how I can
15:11 - have two different kinds of objects of
15:12 - static ones we looked at circled it kind
15:15 - of played around with friction a little
15:16 - bit so hopefully this helps you be a bit
15:18 - more about using
15:19 - is and in the next video we're going to
15:21 - show you is how to actually have the
15:23 - mouth interact with this so I can kind
15:25 - of drag these objects around and toss
15:27 - them and I'm going to look at a concept
15:28 - called a constraint for that okay see
15:30 - you soon
15:32 - [Music]
15:38 - you

Cleaned transcript:

well welcome to a second video about using matter KS so in the previous video I kind of ended with this which is just a simple demonstration of falling rectangles landing on a ground I want to do two things in this video to expand on our sort of knowledge and sense of what matter dot J's can do I want to change these falling rectangles into circles and I want to change the way that the boundary works in that I want to make the this bottom boundary I want to be able to put it at an angle and maybe put a bunch of them so there's one of the matter J as examples is essentially this let's just go to the website because I'm going to need I'm gonna need the documents open the documentation open so at some point here one will come let's wait for it hey no that's not it maybe that was it I think it's not there look at all these demonstrations I there it is this one I want to kind of make this that one you see that one so let's so what do I need to do so first of all I did this sort of terrible thing where this bottom thing which I'm calling a boundary or the floor was kind of hard coded so let's fix that and there's going to be some redundancy here but I'm going to live with the redundancy I'm going to make another JavaScript file called boundary is that's the right place and then I'm not going to forget this time in index.html I'm going to add another reference to boundary Jas now what I want to do is this ground variable instead of creating the body right here I want to say new boundary which is my own thing and I'm going to use those same arguments 200 height amendment get rid of options and then what I'm going to add under options is in the boundary object whoops where's that boundary object oh it says box here wait wait wait Ayya box this needs to save it hungry and I'm going to add is static true so by definition this idea of a boundary I mean boundary probably wrong word but is going to be something that doesn't move that's inflexible that in one place in the code okay so now I should then be able to say and let's make it a different color the boxes are kind of like a white outline and a gray interior just so we see that it's something different let's give it a white outline and a I don't look afraid to use color Oh a black dark a black interior okay so everything should be the same right now I'm going to change things about boxes versus boundaries but now if I make the ground the boundary then I should be able to just say I don't need any of this down here I can just say ground dot show so if I ever changed the way the boundary works then I don't have to worry about that so let's see so this still works exactly the same way and you know I'm like annoyed with the fact that the outline is bleeding off the edge here so I'm going to kind of for no good reason change this to like you know what I'm actually going to do is I'm going to go into boundary and not have it have a stroke so I'm going to say I'm not going to have any outline to that color I'm gonna say no stroke okay there we go this is more like rolling okay so we're in good shape now here's the thing I want to demonstrate a problem that happened in the previous video so I'm going to change right now having engine I'm not going to say engine update in a in draw I'm going to go back to having engine run in setup so this will up with engine not update I'm manually telling the physics system to move ahead a moment of time every time through draw which is kind of good like move ahead draw move ahead draw with engine run it's going to run on its own behind the scenes separate from how I'm drawing you'll actually see stuff appear to be moving faster because there's going to it's going to the engine is going to be running at 60 frames per second where my actual draw would might be less so let me just do that still works fine but you know I don't know what's Benny way I feel like I have more control but what I want to show you the issue is if I now change the that boundary at the bottom to something like it's only like three pixels you can see that sub stuff is working but let me go up here look sometimes the the rectangles like fall through the bottom do you see that one oh I always had to find it it fell through and we wanted to get another one ah come on happen bug there you go you think some of them are falling through so the reason why this is happening is because there aren't enough time steps the mo it's checking where the object is then it moves it and checks again and it's actually jumped over the obstacle so there are there's a number of ways we could fix this number ones the way I fix is just like okay just make the ground thicker and now this problem can't happen and so that's one way of fixing it but there's actually a there's I'm going to put ng update back into the draw loop if you look in the documentation which I showed yesterday there are a variables here there are arguments you can pass through about time steps and Leah Peru on Twitter the creator of the matter dot J's library wrote to me and said the issue of skipping is best solved like you did by using thicker floor or a smaller time step or multiple updates per step so that's something you could do but the AB rewrites there is a feature called continuous collisions that I am working on that solves the issue for any time step so that's coming forward so that was great to hear that it's so wonderful to like to consider all about the physics engine and have the creator of the open source a library way in and provide feedback so thank you for that Leah brew on Twitter okay so now let's keep going with this the next thing I want to demonstrate is I want to see if I can turn that obstacle at an angle so let's look at the boundary objects so this is where I'm creating the rectangle object and it's the variables in this body so what I'm just going to do is I'm going to say console.log this dot body let's look at what some of the properties are and here's a property angle so this leads me to believe that I could most likely just set the angle to a value and it would change it so let's try that let's try saying something like this dot angle equals pi divided by four which is about 45 degrees in radians right pi divided by 2 is 90 degrees so let's do that hmm no what am I missing Oh oh I'm just being silly it's this dot body angle so when I say this dot angle this dot this dot this dot leg line adding a property called angle to my boundaries but remember my boundary object is simply a wrapper really for the matter a s body object so I need to say this dot body angle and that should success for me there we go so now we can see whoa weird stuff happening crazy weird stuff happening is there an initial angle can I do this is this better if I just set it as an option at the beginning let's try that ah there we go okay so it looks like this is so these are the classic things that happens with physics engine I violated the laws of physics by just setting its angle directly the only reason it's angle would change is if a force something was probably added to it that instigated though I'm not looking at the chat so so I have a feeling that you just can't set the angle directly unless you kind of work with the mechanics of how the physics engine is behind the scene so if I want to change its angle while it's running I need to maybe apply an angular velocity or angular force to have a turn so that's nice to see that that's fixed so let's let's add a bunch of these let's go to sketch KS and let's save our because call it boundaries is an array and what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a I'm going to create a bunch of them let's let's say boundaries boundaries dot push so let me just push this boundary now here's the thing I want to give it an angle so let me give it an angle like the new boundary also has an angle of PI / 4 so I can go into the bow three object and change add another argument like a for angle and put that in here and so what I want now is to let's make it like PI divided by let's just you know PI divided let's just let's just put some values in like 0.3 so it's at a slight angle let's not make it so tall 50 let's so let's see here and let's and then what I want to do is here say for VAR i equals 0 i want to render all of the boundaries to do i for some reason today is the day where my codes lines of code are so long and going off the edge boundary Sasha so let's see what I've got going on you're have some errors sketch j/s line 20 what did I not do correctly here up so I got these semicolon in the wrong place a matter Dutch as new type of undefined sketch 22000 I don't need to add it here I wonder if that also caused the problem because I added it twice but because it gets added the thing that I did is added here so I don't need that other that's been a mistake that's been in the code and let's see here ok so we can see here this is working I've got a boundary there and so now let's add some other one let's add another one at a height divided by 2 and let's have it go the other angle the other direction so now and let's make these shorter with times 0.6 over I cannot get hard code values in and so now oh and let's move this one over whoops let's like move this to 250 150 so you get the idea oh no that's not really let's turn let's make this one you know what what's the size let's make this one 300 let's make this one 200 let's make this negative point sorry let's make this I'm sure I could make a clever loop there we go this is kind of what looking to do but I want this one now to be much higher up which this bottom one this is the higher up one let's make that even higher up and let's make this than just like 20 here okay so you can see what I'm trying to do here I'm trying to create a system like now the friction is quite high look how much the friction is causing these things to stop so let's at least fix that in the boundary the friction is 0.3 I can't remember is it zero is no friction or a lot of friction that looks like they're sliding more or less I can't tell let's go to the box and you also give it no friction there we go so now that's no friction but maybe I want a little bit of friction and maybe I want a little bit of friction on each and then also what I said I want to do is I wanted to change the rectangles that's really a lot of friction you can play around opposed values what if it's 0 on the boundary right look at all that friction look I really wasn't really no friction with zero yeah what I'm going to do is I am going to now also I want to change those rectangles into circles because why not so I'm going to go into the box and I could change the name of it from box but really what I want to do is change this to circle and I have a guess that what Circle wants is maybe XY lips XY radius so XY radius I'm going to change that in sketch to just make when I click the mouse to add one with a single radius and then I am going to change the way that I draw it to be an ellipse with an R instead of a wh so let's do that and here we go what am I missing sketch they asked line 30 and I boxes dot push push new box now sex amounts why this closes randomest I need another parentheses there and here we go now it looks like my size is on so let's go look at the documentation it's kind of working we can see the circles are like hitting the there they're kind of like above the actual they're actually above the actual boundary so let's go to the matter J s documentation let's go to bodies let's look for circle X Y radius I know what the problem is I was right all along but P 5 doesn't expect a radius it expects a diameter so all I need to do to fix this is actually where I'm drawing and let me call this circle just to be consistent and in sketch AF I'm going to now call this a circle and I'm going to change this to new circle and I've got to go through a circle stop length and change this to circles and now what I need to do I'm going to leave this as box just for right now I need to say this dot R times 2 and now look sketch a line 30 I missed one reference up circles dot push so we can see there we go now these are kind of large so I know it let me just change this between 5 and 10 and I'm also going to do a mouse dragged so now I can do is just we add a lot of circles and we can see I mostly have that demo we had before and actually I'm kind of along the way of almost creating a kind of liquid simulation because you can imagine if you were to change the way the behaviors of these kind of work make these really really tiny you would almost have something that has a kind of like liquidy like quality to it okay so now I have done is I did a second video where I showed you a bit more about how I can have two different kinds of objects of static ones we looked at circled it kind of played around with friction a little bit so hopefully this helps you be a bit more about using is and in the next video we're going to show you is how to actually have the mouth interact with this so I can kind of drag these objects around and toss them and I'm going to look at a concept called a constraint for that okay see you soon you
