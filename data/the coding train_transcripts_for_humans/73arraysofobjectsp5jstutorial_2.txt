00:00 - okay so now I've made two videos one
00:04 - just about what is an array in the
00:06 - syntax of an array and the other video
00:08 - looking at how to use a loop to iterate
00:10 - over every element in that array and in
00:12 - this video I want to unlock this great
00:16 - power to you which is how to take an
00:18 - object and duplicate that object many
00:21 - times into an array so first this is
00:23 - viscera again just to revisit this is
00:25 - what I'm talking about how would you
00:26 - make an example like this happen and you
00:28 - know each one of these objects it needs
00:30 - to have a position on the screen it
00:32 - needs an X Y it needs to have a speed
00:34 - like how fast is it moving along the y
00:36 - axis it needs to have some functionality
00:37 - like move along the y axis like check if
00:39 - it hit the bottom so each one of these
00:41 - needs its own set of properties and its
00:43 - own set of functionality and that's what
00:45 - I covered in a previous video how to put
00:48 - a function into an object and so we have
00:50 - an example of that here right this is a
00:52 - bubble object let me just actually take
00:54 - a moment to review over here just that
00:55 - syntax so if I have an object like var
00:59 - bubbled an object is a collection of
01:03 - name value pairs an object has
01:06 - properties each property has a name then
01:10 - there is a colon then there is the value
01:13 - and typically we think of these all
01:15 - right you think I think of these as what
01:19 - do I think of just as like numbers right
01:21 - it has an X and it's number is 100 and
01:24 - it has a Y and it's number is 50 but in
01:28 - addition to having these properties just
01:31 - be like simple variables with values an
01:33 - object can have a the name could be a
01:36 - function like the name can be something
01:39 - like display sorry and the value can be
01:41 - a function tripping over my words here
01:43 - right so in it this is what makes
01:45 - objects really powerful it's not just a
01:48 - collection of numbers or data or strings
01:50 - or colors it's also the ability to use
01:52 - those properties in execute some code
01:55 - with those properties so for example if
01:57 - I want to have a display property I
01:59 - might want that to be a function now
02:02 - it's important to us this function is
02:03 - not being executed this is just the
02:06 - definition of the bubble object and the
02:08 - display function is a function that
02:10 - could be executed
02:11 - later and if that function were to be
02:14 - executed it would draw an ellipse act
02:16 - and this is the tricky thing your
02:19 - instinct might be to write bubble dot x
02:21 - right because the way that you access
02:23 - properties of an object is by the name
02:26 - of the object dot the name of the
02:27 - property and then you get the value back
02:29 - but here because I'm inside the object
02:32 - there's a special JavaScript keyword
02:34 - that you can use to refer to the name of
02:37 - the object the specific object this
02:39 - object what I want to do is refer to
02:41 - right here this particular object guess
02:43 - what the keyword is this might think of
02:46 - it as me I am the bubble my ex that type
02:50 - of thing so this X and this Y and this
02:52 - is probably one of the things it might
02:55 - mean for me I just forget to type that
02:57 - all the time and sometimes things don't
02:59 - work so as like an error message so it's
03:00 - really important that you remember to
03:01 - type that so this is the syntax we're
03:04 - starting with and if you see over here
03:05 - it's basically exactly the same syntax I
03:08 - happen to have a bit more sophistication
03:09 - here I have both a display function and
03:11 - a move function and then if I come down
03:15 - here you can see aha in draw the bubble
03:19 - moves the bubble is displayed so I don't
03:21 - have any of this code anymore just in
03:23 - the wind like I don't have variable
03:25 - flying around and I don't have you know
03:27 - lots of code and draw I've had bay this
03:29 - mini program this bubble and now I've
03:31 - gotten a drop so that was a quick little
03:33 - couple minute review of objects in
03:35 - syntax but the point of this is not just
03:36 - to be happy about this object I want to
03:39 - make more than one so obvious certainly
03:42 - a strategy to make more than one would
03:43 - be copy-paste this whole thing but this
03:45 - is not good strategy and I could change
03:48 - the number and change something this is
03:49 - not going to sustain you very long it's
03:51 - not the worst thing to practice with
03:52 - when you're first getting started make a
03:54 - couple objects instead what I want to do
03:57 - is I want to say var bubbles equals
04:02 - bracket bracket I want to have an array
04:05 - of bubbles and I want to put objects in
04:09 - those bubbles so now one thing I didn't
04:12 - actually mention in my previous video is
04:13 - normally not normally but in the
04:16 - previous example I said make an array
04:17 - and put these numbers in it put this
04:19 - text in it
04:19 - this is actually an empty array so I'm
04:22 - starting the array is empty one of the
04:24 - interesting is about
04:25 - script is if the array is empty and you
04:27 - just assign something to the first spot
04:29 - and then assign swing to the second spot
04:31 - then just sciencing the third spot
04:32 - javascript will just like I'm going to
04:34 - figure out what you're doing I'll just
04:35 - make the array the right size for what
04:36 - you're putting in it so I could quickly
04:38 - do something like this bring this object
04:41 - definition into setup and say bubbles
04:46 - index 0 equals that object so now oh my
04:50 - god the blue the scary the blob is back
04:53 - I got to fix that my green screen set
04:54 - because blob takes over once a while and
04:56 - tries to eat me and I don't want it to
04:58 - because I don't want to make more videos
04:59 - I I guess I do I mean I don't know if I
05:04 - should but um
05:05 - so what was I saying yes index 0 so I've
05:08 - put an object into the first spot in the
05:10 - array the array now has a bubble object
05:13 - in it and actually I could say print
05:16 - line bubbles just to take a look at it
05:18 - and you can see UPS I forgot that I have
05:23 - this extra code in here a little comment
05:25 - out for a second print line bubbles and
05:27 - you can see there it is there's the
05:29 - array it's got one object in it now I
05:32 - can adjust note a weird little nuance to
05:34 - JavaScript you know what if I decided
05:36 - like I'm gonna put this in the fourth
05:38 - spot index three zero one two three
05:41 - you know I haven't put anything the
05:42 - first spot or the second spot or the
05:43 - third spot what like what's going to
05:44 - happen so if I do that you'll notice
05:46 - that JavaScript it just wants to do just
05:49 - wants to like figure out what you mean
05:51 - and what are you trying to do let me try
05:53 - to guess something and strangely enough
05:54 - it made an array with four elements in
05:56 - it but the first three are null so
05:58 - javascript is a lot of flexibility and
06:00 - how you assign things into an array I
06:02 - can't think of a good reason why you
06:03 - would do this you're sort of asking for
06:05 - trouble you're going to run into errors
06:06 - later when you try to access a value
06:07 - that has null high high blue blob but
06:11 - but it's important to realize that
06:14 - JavaScript into an array so let's go
06:17 - back to putting it in the zero spot and
06:19 - then what do I need to do well down here
06:23 - what I want to do is not I don't have an
06:26 - individual variable named bubble anymore
06:28 - get a little closer in here what I want
06:31 - to do is say ah move the zero element of
06:34 - the array move this display the zero
06:37 - element
06:37 - so now I just want to refer to the array
06:40 - and the specific object in the array but
06:43 - so let's run this and you can see we
06:45 - have exactly what we had before this
06:47 - single object moving around the screen
06:49 - so I haven't used the power of objects
06:51 - and arrays yet I'm just taking that
06:52 - single object and put it in the first
06:55 - spot in an array and I can make a little
06:57 - bit of an improvement down here to draw
06:59 - even though there's only one thing in
07:01 - the array you know maybe it would be
07:03 - good for future use later to have a
07:05 - little loop where I just check the and I
07:09 - look through the length of the array
07:11 - right and this picks up from the
07:13 - previous video the previous video I loop
07:15 - through every number to set I look
07:18 - through every number in an array to set
07:21 - the width of an ellipse here right and
07:24 - now I'm going to do is say no matter how
07:27 - many bubbles are in this array go from
07:29 - zero to the length of the array up by
07:31 - one each time use that value as the
07:33 - index move and display all the bubble
07:35 - objects so this it doesn't matter if
07:37 - there's five or ten or two this loop
07:40 - will always apply this logic move or
07:42 - display to every object in the array and
07:44 - there we go there's only one I only put
07:48 - one object in the array so how do I put
07:50 - the second object in the array okay well
07:52 - I could copy paste this and say bubbles
07:54 - index one but there's got to be a better
07:57 - way right what I can do instead is why
08:01 - not put a loop around this I don't know
08:05 - how many times should I loop four times
08:08 - and then write what I can do is what I
08:15 - can do is now as I'm looping 0 1 2 3 I'm
08:19 - going to put an object in the zero spot
08:22 - put an object in the one spot so this
08:24 - same code that made that individual
08:26 - object I can reuse that multiple times
08:28 - one time two times so now the array by
08:31 - the way if I say print line bubbles here
08:36 - you can see look at that there are four
08:39 - objects in the array and they're all all
08:42 - four hopefully I won't get eaten by the
08:43 - blue mass there are all four moving
08:45 - around the screen I don't know I can
08:47 - make 400 of them that's a lot of bubbles
08:50 - look at that there
08:51 - kind of starting in the center what
08:53 - could I do differently well one thing I
08:56 - can do is give them a random starting
08:57 - value between zero and the width I could
09:03 - give them a random starting value Y
09:04 - value between zero and height so one
09:06 - thing that you can also know is in
09:07 - addition to having functions as
09:09 - properties or values as properties you
09:12 - can execute code that evaluates to a
09:14 - value it's a little bit weird because
09:16 - like this has code in it and that has
09:18 - coded it the difference is random is
09:20 - being executed right now and evaluating
09:21 - to a number that's being assigned to X
09:23 - here this code is not being executed
09:25 - right now it's being defined as
09:27 - something in a function that could be
09:28 - executed later when is it executed its
09:31 - executed down here when I loop through
09:33 - all the elements of the array so if I
09:34 - run this you can see there's my four
09:37 - hundred bubbles and we can see this down
09:39 - here is like this is this is what
09:41 - actually is in that array so I'm going
09:43 - to take that printout it's not
09:44 - particularly useful to look at it in the
09:45 - console there anymore but you can see I
09:47 - can I could I could just go crazy now
09:49 - and I could make four thousand of them
09:51 - because now one thing is important to
09:53 - realize is there's a limit to how much
09:55 - you can draw in p5 and how like fast
09:58 - it's going to run so that sketch is now
09:59 - running very slowly because it's trying
10:01 - to draw 4,000 circles every frame but
10:03 - what's amazing about this is I haven't
10:05 - changed anything in the code but this
10:07 - number this is the only number that
10:10 - controls how many objects are on the
10:13 - screen so why changing this is the this
10:15 - is the amazing power of the reuse of
10:17 - modularity and reusability of objects so
10:19 - this program is modular in that there is
10:21 - this object that has these parts its
10:23 - properties its functions I know which
10:25 - part to edit when I wanted to change how
10:27 - it looks or change how it moves and it's
10:29 - reusable this single block of code is
10:31 - being used four times or 400 times to
10:34 - make many objects and all I need to do
10:35 - down here is loop through all the
10:38 - objects and say apply the same command
10:41 - to all them move all of them display all
10:44 - them now you'll notice that the editor
10:46 - here the p5 editor has this little like
10:48 - yellow highlighted line number so look
10:50 - what's I'm afraid to look at it I'm
10:52 - going to I'm going to look at it you
10:54 - let's do this together
10:55 - oh it says don't make functions within a
10:59 - loop so I've upset the editor I'm very
11:01 - sorry but it it's like complaining that
11:03 - might
11:04 - my JavaScript is in proper style the
11:07 - truth of the matter is that maybe this
11:08 - is a bad idea for an hour but at the
11:09 - same time it works this is a great way
11:11 - to practice but the thing is here this
11:14 - maybe could be improved in the sense
11:17 - that setup code like has all this code
11:20 - in it and this bubble is very simple
11:22 - what if this bubble got more and more
11:23 - complex so in the next video what I want
11:26 - to do is look at a technique for taking
11:29 - the way this object is made and taking
11:31 - it out of here and putting it in
11:32 - something called a constructor function
11:34 - here I'm just literally making the
11:36 - bubble object but what if I had this
11:38 - other function whose job it was to make
11:41 - bubble objects for me and I could just
11:43 - call that function anywhere from in the
11:45 - code and I would just I would be able to
11:47 - just say make a new bubble and setup and
11:49 - again life is just about making your
11:52 - code short it's really not about that
11:53 - life is about like people and
11:54 - relationships most I could code doesn't
11:57 - really matter but you know it's I you
11:58 - know I guess you can use it for
12:01 - something I'm using it for something
12:02 - talking to a camera about it okay so I
12:04 - just I just think the same lame joke in
12:08 - every video you're tolerating it this
12:10 - video is now over should be cut off okay
12:14 - so that's what I want to do in the next
12:16 - video I want to look at how can we work
12:18 - with this thing called a constructor
12:20 - function which is perhaps a bit more
12:22 - typical what you'll see in a lot of the
12:24 - examples on the p5 website if you look
12:26 - at other types of examples of making
12:27 - objects with JavaScript you might see
12:29 - this style in other places as well okay
12:31 - so if you watch the end of this video I
12:34 - thank you and I will see you in the next
12:37 - one or or I mean I'll see myself in the
12:39 - next one I guess okay

Cleaned transcript:

okay so now I've made two videos one just about what is an array in the syntax of an array and the other video looking at how to use a loop to iterate over every element in that array and in this video I want to unlock this great power to you which is how to take an object and duplicate that object many times into an array so first this is viscera again just to revisit this is what I'm talking about how would you make an example like this happen and you know each one of these objects it needs to have a position on the screen it needs an X Y it needs to have a speed like how fast is it moving along the y axis it needs to have some functionality like move along the y axis like check if it hit the bottom so each one of these needs its own set of properties and its own set of functionality and that's what I covered in a previous video how to put a function into an object and so we have an example of that here right this is a bubble object let me just actually take a moment to review over here just that syntax so if I have an object like var bubbled an object is a collection of name value pairs an object has properties each property has a name then there is a colon then there is the value and typically we think of these all right you think I think of these as what do I think of just as like numbers right it has an X and it's number is 100 and it has a Y and it's number is 50 but in addition to having these properties just be like simple variables with values an object can have a the name could be a function like the name can be something like display sorry and the value can be a function tripping over my words here right so in it this is what makes objects really powerful it's not just a collection of numbers or data or strings or colors it's also the ability to use those properties in execute some code with those properties so for example if I want to have a display property I might want that to be a function now it's important to us this function

function and then if I come down here you can see aha in draw the bubble moves the bubble is displayed so I don't have any of this code anymore just in the wind like I don't have variable flying around and I don't have you know lots of code and draw I've had bay this mini program this bubble and now I've gotten a drop so that was a quick little couple minute review of objects in syntax but the point of this is not just to be happy about this object I want to make more than one so obvious certainly a strategy to make more than one would be copypaste this whole thing but this is not good strategy and I could change the number and change something this is not going to sustain you very long it's not the worst thing to practice with when you're first getting started make a couple objects instead what I want to do is I want to say var bubbles equals bracket bracket I want to have an array of bubbles and I want to put objects in those bubbles so now one thing I didn't actually mention in my previous video is normally not normally but in the previous example I said make an array and put these numbers in it put this text in it this is actually an empty array so I'm starting the array is empty one of the interesting is about script is if the array is empty and you just assign something to the first spot and then assign swing to the second spot then just sciencing the third spot javascript will just like I'm going to figure out what you're doing I'll just make the array the right size for what you're putting in it so I could quickly do something like this bring this object

the array by the way if I say print line bubbles here you can see look at that there are four objects in the array and they're all all four hopefully I won't get eaten by the blue mass there are all

I could make four thousand of them because now one thing is important to realize is there's a limit to how much you can draw in p5 and how like fast it's going to run so that sketch is now running very slowly because it's trying to draw 4,000 circles every frame but what's amazing about this is I haven't changed anything in the code but this number this is the only number that controls how many objects are on the screen so why changing this is the this is the amazing power of the reuse of modularity and reusability of objects so this program is modular in that there is this object that has these parts its properties its functions I know which part to edit when I wanted to change how it looks or change how it moves and it's reusable this single block of code is being used four times or 400 times to make many objects and all I need to do down here is loop through all the objects and say apply the same command to all them move all of them display all them now you'll notice that the editor here the p5 editor has this little like yellow highlighted line number so look what's I'm afraid to look at it I'm going to I'm going to look at it you let's do this together oh it says don't make functions within a loop so I've upset the editor I'm very sorry but it it's like complaining that might my JavaScript is in proper style the truth of the matter is that maybe this is a bad idea for an hour but at the same time it works this is a great way to practice but the thing is here this maybe could be improved in the sense that setup code like has all this code in it and this bubble is very simple what if this bubble got more and more complex so in the next video what I want to do is look at a technique for taking the way this object is made and taking it out of here and putting it in something called a constructor function here I'm just literally making the bubble object but what if I had this other function whose job it was to make bubble objects for me and I could just call that function anywhere from in the code and I would just I would be able to just say make a new bubble and setup and again life is just about making your code short it's really not about that life is about like people and relationships most I could code doesn't really matter but you know it's I you know I guess you can use it for something I'm using it for something talking to a camera about it okay so I just I just think the same lame joke in every video you're tolerating it this video is now over should be cut off okay so that's what I want to do in the next video I want to look at how can we work with this thing called a constructor function which is perhaps a bit more typical what you'll see in a lot of the examples on the p5 website if you look at other types of examples of making objects with JavaScript you might see this style in other places as well okay so if you watch the end of this video I thank you and I will see you in the next one or or I mean I'll see myself in the next one I guess okay
