06:06 - here we are back on the coding train it
06:09 - is B I'm back baby
06:14 - doing this a lot like streaming and then
06:17 - not for several months and then having a
06:19 - big thing where I'm packed so don't get
06:21 - too excited because I might just do this
06:22 - again a couple of months
06:24 - ah so nice to see all of you I mean I
06:27 - don't really get to see all of you but I
06:29 - feel your presence there uh if this is
06:31 - your first time tuning in oh my goodness
06:33 - welcome hi my name is Dan and you are
06:37 - watching the coding drain the coding
06:39 - train is a YouTube channel it's as if I
06:42 - have a script in front of me and yet I
06:44 - don't I just have a view of myself
06:47 - um uh new glasses by the way I don't
06:51 - know if anyone noticed that I'm wearing
06:52 - new glasses uh I have a new prescription
06:55 - new progressive lenses I've gotten quite
06:58 - a bit older since the last time you saw
07:00 - me and my vision is really um I'm really
07:02 - struggling actually I think that I might
07:04 - need a specific set of glasses for using
07:07 - the computer
07:08 - I'm sure this is what everyone is
07:10 - interested in hearing about
07:12 - uh let me see if I'm just looking over
07:16 - this way because I've got my monitor to
07:18 - the left I'm just looking at the chat to
07:20 - see that everybody is there yep
07:24 - um I have the um
07:27 - supporter member whatever you want to
07:29 - call it Discord chat right over here to
07:32 - my right so
07:34 - um I see Simon is typing dot dot dot
07:38 - Simon writes it is indeed a channel on
07:41 - the YouTube website on the internet that
07:43 - is correct
07:45 - all right so what is the coding training
07:48 - what is happening today what is
07:50 - happening for the coding train in the
07:52 - future I saw a few people in the chat
07:55 - just say uh I just stopped in to say
07:57 - hello thank you hello
08:00 - um should we try a different pair of
08:01 - glasses we've got a few different pairs
08:03 - here
08:05 - let's try this pair
08:07 - there's the same prescription I just I
08:09 - just got two two new pairs this is the
08:12 - sort of new style
08:13 - this is more like my old glasses
08:16 - this is one
08:19 - this is two oh should we put a poll how
08:22 - do I how do I do a poll why do I have
08:24 - got to come over here uh to this
08:26 - computer
08:27 - uh let's see start a poll uh
08:33 - one or two
08:35 - one or two
08:37 - ask your community okay the poll is now
08:42 - running oh I can't see the chat this is
08:45 - one this is like you everybody this is
08:46 - the I coding train welcome to the eye
08:49 - doctor this is one
08:53 - this is two now again this looks these
08:56 - aren't my um old glasses they're
08:58 - different but they look much more like
08:59 - my old ones I think I see better with
09:01 - these the same prescription just
09:03 - different uh different glasses maker
09:07 - this is one
09:10 - and this is two okay I think I'm seeing
09:12 - better with two right now so looks like
09:15 - one is kind of winning though in the
09:17 - poll one is up up to 52 percent
09:21 - um all right
09:23 - don't you have bifocals bifocals uh asks
09:26 - uh fishy
09:28 - uh bifocals I have progressives yes and
09:31 - so what progressives do if you don't
09:33 - know again this is clearly what everyone
09:36 - is tuning in for
09:37 - Welcome to the coding drain is when I
09:40 - look at that through the top of my
09:42 - glasses it's for distance and when I
09:44 - look through the bottom it progresses
09:47 - the lens progresses down for reading if
09:50 - I don't have progressives I cannot read
09:52 - at all however the computer to me is in
09:55 - the middle of those distances it's kind
09:58 - of like not far it's not close like
10:00 - reading and so I feel like with my
10:02 - progressives having trouble like seeing
10:05 - the computer I can pull it up here so
10:07 - you see what I'm looking at let's make
10:09 - sure everything's working yes oh no no
10:10 - no no we don't that's like the oldest do
10:13 - not go to that link
10:17 - sponsor link that was I mean you could
10:19 - go there sorry I don't I don't mean
10:20 - don't but it's just not not no official
10:23 - connection anymore right now during this
10:26 - stream I hate by the way when I have to
10:27 - make myself smaller that my hands get
10:29 - cut off
10:31 - if I uh could redesign the studio I
10:33 - would try to have like a really wide
10:35 - shot that is actually what you're seeing
10:36 - not just the camera shot trunk down all
10:39 - right
10:40 - uh two is winning now boy it's really
10:43 - close though
10:45 - uh the new style one is subtler
10:49 - uh I prefer to stare over the top of my
10:52 - glasses in a judgy manner
10:55 - yes
10:57 - all right
10:58 - um I made a list of things that I want
11:00 - to talk about today today is mostly
11:03 - going to be a update and hang out with
11:05 - the community Stream So if you were here
11:08 - for a specific coding tutorial that's
11:11 - not necessarily going to happen it's not
11:13 - going to happen however I will be
11:15 - updating you just to get this out of the
11:16 - way real quick on things like the nature
11:18 - of code book where I will show some new
11:20 - examples and talk about them so there is
11:23 - some learning that I have planned uh I
11:26 - will also be talking about uh the ml5.js
11:30 - library
11:31 - um and some updates about that oh I want
11:33 - to talk about
11:35 - um
11:35 - processing four
11:37 - and my uh updated tutorial series about
11:40 - that making a note I want to look at the
11:43 - coding Train website and some new things
11:45 - that have appeared uh and look at
11:48 - through some pull requests merge them
11:49 - look at some showcase projects ah I want
11:52 - to talk about the memberships
11:54 - let me just let me also get another
11:56 - thing out of the way here and by the way
12:00 - um if Simon says I feel you've already
12:02 - redesigned the studio enough I know
12:04 - that's why I'm not going to just saying
12:05 - I could
12:07 - um one they're gonna show it again yes
12:10 - the poll is still there
12:13 - this is one I actually prefer this style
12:16 - I think but right now these glasses are
12:18 - like a little smudged so it's a little
12:20 - blurry for me this is one and this is
12:24 - two let's go with one but let's see if
12:27 - we can clean them
12:28 - I have I have some of those like lens
12:30 - cleaners somewhere in here but I'm just
12:31 - going to use my t-shirt also how do I
12:33 - look just without glasses
12:37 - by the way I cannot wink with this eye
12:39 - my kids like to make fun of me because I
12:42 - I cannot like this is me trying to wink
12:44 - with my right eye
12:48 - oh it's been a long summer oh I'm so
12:51 - happy to be back here live streaming I
12:53 - mean to be honest I'm kind of tired I
12:55 - got I'm old I'm tired I don't know what
12:58 - I'm doing with my life
13:00 - um but I I think that one of the things
13:02 - that brings me tremendous Joy is sharing
13:06 - my love and enthusiasm for what I like
13:10 - to Now call artisanal handcrafted code
13:13 - with the world through YouTube so let's
13:17 - do that okay what was I saying ah so I
13:19 - want to say something right off the bat
13:20 - which is that um
13:23 - I still can't tell the difference that's
13:25 - Walter
13:27 - um uh thank you to everyone who supports
13:31 - the coding train and especially now
13:35 - given that you haven't seen anything new
13:38 - from me since
13:40 - may I think like the entire summer and
13:44 - so
13:45 - um so one uh if that's not what you're
13:48 - happy if you're not happy about that
13:50 - please it's fine like you don't need to
13:52 - support the coding train I'm doing my
13:54 - thing but you know if you want something
13:55 - different this is not what I meant to
13:57 - say what I meant to say is I've actually
13:58 - been working very hard I've also been
14:01 - taking some time and kind of regrouping
14:03 - and lots of other stuff going on but I
14:05 - have been working quite a bit on two
14:07 - projects that have no uh that don't have
14:10 - a lot of visible progress
14:12 - so those of you who are supporting the
14:14 - coding Train by watching old videos
14:17 - sharing videos on social media some of
14:20 - you have signed up through YouTube
14:21 - membership or GitHub sponsorship maybe
14:24 - some of you signed up to nebula which is
14:26 - a streaming service for creators that I
14:29 - am a part of all of those things I just
14:33 - appreciate so much especially during
14:35 - this time where I'm not actively
14:37 - publishing new things that support is
14:41 - really making it possible for me to have
14:43 - spent a lot of the summer working on
14:45 - these two larger projects that I'll talk
14:47 - about today one is the nature of code
14:48 - book lots of updates about that all good
14:51 - news I I feel like I didn't want I
14:55 - didn't want to have a stream until I
14:56 - could really confidently say that I have
14:59 - made significant progress with the book
15:01 - which is a lot of ways let me stream
15:02 - this week no I don't really have a lot
15:04 - to say I haven't really gotten over this
15:06 - hump yet and then this uh which and then
15:09 - another the nature of code many of you
15:11 - might be familiar with although
15:12 - certainly I hope there's viewers are
15:13 - never even heard of the project today
15:15 - because then I get to show you about it
15:16 - show about it to you and then also
15:21 - um I have been working on a reboot of my
15:24 - intro decoding series with processing
15:27 - it's a little over five hours of
15:29 - material so uh and the reason why I mean
15:33 - in olden times my previous practice has
15:36 - been as I'm working on it publish new
15:39 - parts of it so if it's five hours of
15:41 - video uh maybe that's every video is 15
15:44 - minutes that's five times four that's 20
15:46 - videos maybe I'm publishing one or two
15:48 - per week as I'm finishing them up so
15:51 - this time I am going to publish it as
15:54 - one five hour long video on YouTube with
15:57 - time codes and annotations we'll see how
15:59 - that goes but that's why it's been uh
16:02 - that's why there's been kind of a dearth
16:04 - uh of stuff also like I'm just kind of
16:08 - I don't know like I don't know how I
16:10 - used to do I don't know how I used to do
16:11 - it all teach Family Travel coding train
16:16 - it's I've been struggling
16:19 - um just kind of balancing and juggling
16:21 - things and project management I'm not
16:23 - very good at it
16:24 - um so I hope
16:27 - um that maybe this fall can be a bit of
16:28 - a reset button nature of code project
16:30 - can be completed the learning processing
16:33 - five hour video could be completed I can
16:35 - go back to some of these other things on
16:37 - my list all right
16:39 - um all right also the Apple episodes was
16:41 - a bit of a Direction but that was quite
16:43 - a while ago now looks like glasses two
16:46 - is at 52 percent
16:49 - um all right I'm seeing some nice
16:52 - comments in the chat the project
16:54 - management yes uh ah let's do something
16:57 - fun this is totally random but um this
16:59 - is sitting in front of me so
17:02 - um uh let me switch to it's gonna be a
17:05 - live unboxing of a project called time
17:07 - since launch this is a completely
17:09 - spontaneous right now because I just saw
17:11 - it this is not planned but um okay so
17:14 - I'm gonna I'm gonna tell you about this
17:15 - uh artwork that I have uh purchased so
17:18 - first of all
17:19 - let me shout out some friends of mine I
17:22 - mean I don't know it's okay if they
17:24 - don't want to be friends with me I just
17:25 - some some some people in an organization
17:27 - that I really admire which is uh sfpc
17:32 - uh let's see school let's see if we find
17:34 - it uh the school for poetic computation
17:36 - ah no this is the new website sorry
17:39 - about that so no official anything here
17:41 - I'm just oh you can't see it so let me
17:43 - go back to it
17:45 - wrong wrong button all right so school
17:47 - for provided computation is an
17:49 - experimental School in New York City
17:50 - supporting interdisciplinary study and
17:52 - art code hardware and critical theory
17:53 - it's a place for Learning and unlearning
17:55 - so first of all I teach at a behemoth
18:00 - of a essentially corporate University
18:02 - NYU uh there are many wonderful things
18:05 - about my job uh first and foremost would
18:07 - be the students
18:09 - um I think that probably the uh worst
18:12 - thing about my job is the cost of
18:13 - tuition and you know we could get into I
18:15 - I could be here all day talking about
18:17 - all the things in between and so I
18:20 - really admire and want to support
18:21 - organizations that are experimenting
18:25 - um in educational practices outside of
18:28 - the sort of corporate Behemoth
18:30 - universities like NYU and um you know
18:33 - there's obviously a lot more to schools
18:34 - around the world there's State schools
18:36 - in the U.S public universities there are
18:39 - schools around the world that are have
18:41 - different funding models and uh um but
18:44 - you know I I have this wonderful job
18:46 - that I am very grateful for that I
18:48 - really enjoy but I also um have
18:51 - conflicted feelings about it that's not
18:52 - what I wanted to talk about today the
18:54 - reason I have this is because sfbc did a
18:56 - fundraiser uh where there were different
18:59 - things you could buy there was a coding
19:01 - train uh train whistle in the shop I
19:03 - don't know if you happen to be watching
19:05 - uh uh and happen to have purchased it
19:09 - if so say hi in the chat and one of the
19:11 - things that I got is an artwork from
19:13 - some friends of mine and also alums of
19:16 - the program where I teach uh cwm
19:20 - let me see if I want to make sure I get
19:22 - the name right let's see if I can find
19:25 - their Studio
19:26 - uh
19:28 - uh here we go CW and T
19:32 - uh and this is their project time since
19:35 - launch which you could get your own I
19:37 - mean I got it through a fundraiser
19:39 - um and it is I'm going to read to you
19:42 - from the description
19:43 - time since launch is a single use long
19:47 - scale launch clock use it to Mark the
19:50 - beginning of your personal Epoch wow
19:53 - this feels very like a very big deal
19:55 - right now that I'm doing this
19:56 - time since launch counts up to one
19:59 - million days
20:01 - by one million random numbers book and I
20:03 - would pull this book out it's got the
20:05 - processing Community catalog on it too
20:06 - but it's holding up uh it's holding up
20:09 - my iPad that I could see the Discord
20:11 - chat and Joseph says nice I'm a fan of
20:14 - cwnt by the way
20:16 - um if you're writing something in the
20:18 - member supporter chat which I'll guess
20:20 - I'll talk about when I get to the
20:21 - membership program I might read it out
20:23 - loud so if you don't want me to for any
20:26 - reason
20:28 - um maybe don't put it there or just like
20:30 - say like please don't read this or
20:31 - something uh okay time since launch has
20:34 - marked thousands of moments around the
20:35 - world has been used to celebrate
20:36 - marriages business launches births
20:38 - graduations habit changes career changes
20:40 - or just to elevate an arbitrary Tuesday
20:41 - to awesome sets so this is more in the
20:44 - category of arbitrary Tuesday to awesome
20:47 - status I guess I could have used it for
20:49 - like um
20:51 - I should have used it so one thing is I
20:53 - I should have used it I recently turned
20:54 - 50. you know I'm not asking for any like
20:57 - birthday wishes but that felt like a big
21:00 - thing and a lot of you might be thinking
21:02 - geez you're old and yeah although you
21:05 - know
21:06 - in some circles that's young try being a
21:09 - faculty member at a large corporate
21:11 - University 50. I'm like spring chicken
21:14 - how that hurt okay
21:18 - um
21:20 - once launched there's no reset option
21:23 - use caution when taking time since
21:25 - launch out of the box be wary of letting
21:27 - your kids or friends fiddle with it
21:29 - prior to launch the batteries included
21:31 - last for 150 plus years
21:35 - backup capacitors temporarily keep time
21:37 - since launch counting during a battery
21:39 - change at launch your moment zero is
21:42 - forever burned into the electronics I'm
21:44 - feeling really anxious about this right
21:46 - now oh my God
21:50 - uh yeah by the way if you're in the
21:52 - YouTube chat you can write please don't
21:54 - read this but I'm going to read it so
21:55 - the YouTube chat you don't get to like
21:57 - uh I'm gonna if you're typing in the
21:59 - YouTube chat I might read it live I mean
22:00 - I I don't mean to be aggressive I mean
22:03 - isn't the most friendly loving way
22:05 - towards you I can't possibly manage like
22:08 - somebody putting a a private message in
22:10 - the public YouTube chat for this live
22:11 - stream that they don't want me to read
22:13 - loud most likely I'm not going to see
22:14 - your message to be honest I mean
22:16 - sometimes I go I mean I'm a weirdo who
22:18 - sometimes will go back and look at the
22:19 - chat from a live stream because I'm
22:20 - curious to see if I miss something
22:22 - interesting but for the most part while
22:24 - I'm live streaming I'm not able to
22:27 - follow the entire chat I wanted to have
22:29 - um
22:30 - right and it's 200 000 random numbers
22:33 - it's one million random digits well
22:35 - that's one million random numbers if the
22:37 - numbers are randomly zero through nine
22:39 - Simon okay
22:41 - if something goes wrong with your time
22:43 - since launch as long as the main chip is
22:45 - physically intact your Epoch can be
22:47 - restored okay
22:49 - storage all right there's a lot more
22:51 - information time since launch.com let's
22:53 - go to that
22:55 - I feel like what better time to launch
22:59 - this than
23:00 - since I
23:02 - I live streamed on the coding train
23:10 - um
23:12 - on an arbitrary
23:15 - Saturday
23:18 - there we go well how do you do that
23:20 - heart thing is that a heart
23:22 - okay wait do I I want to hit start oh no
23:25 - this is just like oh start
23:28 - oh I see you can make your own time
23:30 - since launch just on a website thingy
23:34 - order a physical cop right so I have the
23:36 - physical version
23:37 - so
23:40 - um I'm gonna unbox this now I have not
23:42 - opened this
23:43 - maybe I will switch back to this view so
23:47 - you can see it a little bit better
23:49 - I want to be very careful with this how
23:51 - does it open oh it's got like some very
23:55 - mechanically challenged
23:57 - I have
23:58 - some slight arthritis in this finger
24:00 - which makes it I have to by the way my
24:02 - kids are now like basically teenagers
24:04 - and it's an amazing thing that happens
24:06 - in life now as you get older and my kids
24:08 - are getting older I need need them to
24:10 - help me like open the jar you know it
24:12 - used to be me now Daddy Yankee please
24:15 - open this for me that's the little
24:17 - babies and that was a little bit weird
24:19 - that voice they didn't sound like that
24:22 - um okay so I took off these
24:24 - I'm gonna be very careful oh wow this is
24:26 - beautiful
24:28 - um I don't know that wow okay so I don't
24:31 - know how well you can see this with the
24:32 - green screen I'm gonna go over here to
24:35 - the Whiteboard oh dear that camera is
24:38 - off
24:39 - why did that happen
24:43 - turn this camera on it's possible that
24:46 - the battery
24:48 - I just thought that I might be able to
24:49 - give you a better close-up look at it uh
24:52 - through this camera there we go
24:56 - although I don't think this camera is on
24:57 - auto focus
24:59 - so it's going to be very blurry look at
25:01 - me trying to like highlight this
25:03 - beautiful I could change it to like auto
25:04 - focus but I stand back here you can sort
25:08 - of see this is probably giving you a
25:09 - really nice view of how beautiful this
25:12 - is made
25:14 - so and I don't know if you can see
25:18 - um there is a uh one of those like uh
25:21 - what seven segment displays here which I
25:24 - assume will show the counter once I get
25:26 - it started so single use so how do I
25:30 - start it let me come back here
25:37 - um come back here okay
25:39 - I could also one thing I could do is
25:41 - there's a
25:42 - well this camera is autofocus so I
25:45 - wonder if let me see if I walk around
25:47 - here
25:49 - I could also just show the raw view with
25:51 - the yeah uh there we go this should work
25:53 - pretty well
25:55 - um I mean the light is kind of shiny but
25:57 - now you're getting a nice view of it you
25:59 - can see the batteries it's absolutely
26:02 - beautifully constructed
26:04 - um
26:05 - I love it okay
26:08 - all right coming back around
26:12 - so now we have to figure out
26:14 - how to open this how to start it are
26:17 - there instructions single use
26:23 - help me I don't know
26:27 - let's see look at the box here
26:32 - single use
26:34 - are there instructions does anybody know
26:43 - I mean there's like this little sticker
26:45 - there so I assume I take that off it
26:47 - says single use
26:50 - do I take the top off
26:53 - do I turn this
26:56 - I'm going to take off this label that
26:58 - says single use I assume I'm supposed to
27:00 - take that off
27:04 - um
27:05 - are there instructions online
27:09 - let me go back to here
27:13 - uh
27:15 - let's go okay
27:30 - well I can get a wall mount for it
27:33 - I don't have a wall mount
27:41 - well this feels like oh pull the pin to
27:44 - initiate the timer got it pull the pin
27:47 - there it is look here's a little video
28:06 - okay
28:09 - everybody ready for this
28:15 - okay ready
28:18 - by the way I have uh if you're wondering
28:20 - what's going on here uh some of you
28:22 - might remember that I was in a bicycle
28:23 - accident a bunch of years ago and I have
28:25 - multiple surgeries on my elbow so in
28:28 - case you're wondering what's going on
28:30 - okay uh okay here we go oh drum roll
28:33 - good idea
28:35 - um
28:46 - I did it
28:50 - I'm so cool look it's counting can you
28:53 - see it
28:57 - by the way if
29:00 - bark this time down in history you were
29:03 - here for this moment
29:06 - so cool
29:08 - so I'm just going to consider that this
29:11 - is marking
29:12 - the time of my first live stream since
29:15 - turning 50. that'll make that like a
29:18 - thing
29:19 - it's
29:21 - um okay
29:23 - uh all right uh there we go
29:28 - or or Orion sending you were here Alka
29:31 - it's so nice to see you in the chat like
29:33 - old friends I mean a lot of you that
29:35 - I've never met in person
29:37 - um but I I consider you old friends of
29:39 - people who have been sort of following
29:41 - me and participating in live streams for
29:43 - many many years I will I will work on
29:45 - fixing this up later look at this pen
29:47 - it's like uh uh there I'm gonna put it
29:49 - back in
29:51 - um and I'm gonna just
29:52 - um
29:53 - I'm gonna put this if I put it here can
29:56 - you watch it during the Stream
29:58 - yeah so now you can oh so this will by
30:01 - the way this would be a nice they always
30:02 - have on during my like streams or videos
30:04 - maybe to Mark time okay so let's put
30:07 - this off to the side
30:09 - all right let's get back to some of the
30:11 - business at hand because um so I'm gonna
30:14 - be here uh
30:16 - um no longer than noon I would love to
30:19 - finish sooner
30:21 - it's my last weekend before the semester
30:24 - starts now you might be saying like you
30:26 - could have streamed all summer what's
30:27 - wrong with you I mean on the last
30:28 - weekend before school starts sorry I was
30:30 - working on these two big projects which
30:32 - I will talk about today
30:34 - um all right let's come back to here and
30:35 - let's start digging into some of these
30:37 - things
30:39 - um I think I can probably turn off the
30:41 - poll now
30:43 - um
30:44 - yeah oh Bartos is a young young man of
30:48 - 46. okay let's how do I end this poll
30:51 - end poll because all right so let me get
30:55 - the chat back up here sorry for my arm
30:57 - disappearing
30:59 - um
31:01 - uh okay
31:04 - um
31:04 - all right so we've covered the glasses
31:10 - um put this over here
31:13 - um all right so I haven't done anything
31:15 - on my list because I did a whole thing
31:16 - about the time since lunch
31:19 - uh so I'll put that on my list and check
31:21 - it off
31:22 - time since launch
31:25 - and then future plans
31:28 - so I'm checking one thing off my list
31:31 - okay so things that I have maybe let's
31:35 - start with the code um
31:37 - you know the title of this video says
31:39 - nature of code or this live stream so
31:42 - maybe I should start with that how do
31:43 - people feel about me just starting right
31:45 - off the bat with nature of code maybe
31:46 - that makes the most sense
31:54 - harshi I am so glad you are here too
31:57 - Hershey says so glad to be here
32:00 - and Simon Says classic Dan spends the
32:03 - first 30 minutes of the stream not
32:05 - talking about anything on the list
32:07 - by the way uh again I think I meant to
32:10 - say this if any of you are in the member
32:12 - chat on Discord which I have over here
32:15 - and you see a meaningful or interesting
32:19 - question in the YouTube chat that I
32:21 - maybe miss or don't see which will be
32:23 - most of them please copy paste it with
32:25 - the YouTube person's name into the
32:27 - Discord chat
32:29 - progress let's hear about it okay so
32:32 - first a little bit of History here
32:38 - let's start off here so this is if you I
32:42 - I I expect that if you search online for
32:45 - nature of code the first thing that's
32:47 - going to come up is this web page right
32:50 - here so this is uh the active live
32:55 - published version of the nature of code
32:57 - book the nature of code is a project I
33:00 - mean in some ways I would say I started
33:02 - it in two thousand
33:04 - two
33:06 - but uh so like 22 years ago or 21 years
33:09 - ago whatever the however the math is but
33:12 - um
33:13 - I didn't uh the first time I think that
33:16 - I ever called it the nature of code
33:18 - because I'm talking about my Learning
33:19 - Journey really started in 2002 but the
33:22 - first time I ever called it nature of
33:24 - code was 2008.
33:26 - um media's 2006 somewhere in there when
33:29 - I taught a class called nature of code
33:32 - and one of the things I I don't want to
33:34 - I'll be here all day if I go through
33:36 - everything but one of the things I would
33:38 - encourage you to read if you want the
33:40 - full story is this acknowledgment
33:42 - section which talks about
33:44 - um the class that I took in Spring 2003
33:47 - like so maybe that's the date that I
33:48 - should have given
33:49 - um 20 years ago a class taught by James
33:53 - 2 called Dynamic bodies there's some
33:55 - other references and a little bit of the
33:57 - history in this acknowledgment so then
34:00 - in 2012 and by the way this link goes to
34:03 - Nowhere buy from create space where does
34:05 - it take you now
34:07 - yeah it CreateSpace is now Kindle Direct
34:09 - Amazon bought them so
34:11 - um
34:13 - uh in 2012
34:15 - um the material that I had been
34:17 - accumulating over many years teaching
34:19 - this class I put into a book the book
34:23 - was self-published
34:25 - um it's still it's available right now I
34:27 - don't I don't suggest please don't buy
34:28 - it right now please wait but I mean if
34:31 - you can't help I mean you could buy it
34:32 - twice whatever you want but if you can't
34:34 - help it of course you could
34:36 - um is available
34:37 - um through I originally self-published
34:39 - it through a company called CreateSpace
34:41 - after a number of years Amazon acquired
34:43 - that company so essentially it's now
34:44 - it's self-published through Amazon which
34:46 - I do not love which is one of the
34:48 - reasons why I uh I'm making a big change
34:50 - with nature of code two it's not called
34:53 - nature of CO2 it's just nature of code
34:54 - again I don't know what to call it
34:56 - anyway
34:57 - um so in self-publish and for free
35:00 - online so uh you can read it uh this is
35:03 - the um original version of the book The
35:05 - the examples are all uh processing code
35:08 - so you'll see this like Java syntax
35:11 - um if you don't know what processing is
35:12 - well boy do I have a whole video series
35:15 - for you that's about to come out but um
35:17 - and so uh probably I don't know anywhere
35:20 - in the last five to seven years it's
35:24 - like I'm gonna make a new version of the
35:25 - book so many people sent me good
35:27 - feedback
35:28 - um in particular this neural networks
35:30 - chapter I can't even like bear to read
35:33 - some of this stuff it's so out of date
35:35 - and weird and like not in line with the
35:38 - world of machine learning and neural
35:40 - networks today
35:41 - um so I was slowly inch by in updating
35:46 - the book over a many years and at some
35:49 - point I was like I gotta get it done and
35:51 - then I wasted another year and they're
35:53 - like I really had to get into it I
35:54 - wasted another year then I had a
35:56 - sabbatical and I'm like oh I'm really
35:57 - gonna get it done and I made some
35:59 - progress actually over the sabbatical
36:01 - quite a bit of progress but I didn't
36:03 - finish and so it's been a struggle to
36:06 - try to do coding train and work on this
36:08 - project in parallel and so this summer
36:10 - at a certain point without any Fanfare
36:12 - or announcements I just kind of made a
36:13 - mental decision like you know what
36:16 - no coding train I'm not allowed to make
36:20 - do any live streams make any videos
36:22 - until I have finished
36:24 - a final draft of the nature of code
36:28 - second so I don't want to call the
36:30 - second edition because I don't I know
36:31 - what to call it the new nature of code
36:34 - and so I'm here also I think we could
36:37 - use this to Mark the occasion I would
36:39 - have liked to have like maybe marked its
36:41 - publishing or something because I don't
36:43 - I'm not here to say it's done
36:45 - it's not done there's a lot of work left
36:47 - for me to do but what I am here to say
36:49 - to you is I have written an entire every
36:54 - single chapter now has a finished draft
36:56 - so there is an entire first draft and
36:59 - most of the chapters are essentially
37:01 - done but the reason why I say that is
37:03 - I'm still doing some editing and
37:04 - updating some examples there's some
37:06 - placeholder illustrations think just
37:08 - only thing left to do is go back and
37:10 - fill the gaps and fix things and edit so
37:13 - the announcement here today is that
37:15 - there is a full version that you can
37:17 - read online today of the new nature of
37:20 - code and if you're reading it online
37:22 - today you still have the opportunity to
37:25 - provide feedback and and help towards
37:28 - the final version that will go into the
37:30 - print version of the book now I have
37:33 - also another even more not anymore in
37:36 - parallel also exciting announcement
37:38 - where does this go goes here
37:40 - to make
37:44 - um
37:46 - ah Jesus Oh G suddenly is in the chat
37:49 - okay great so Jesus thank you Kathy uh
37:52 - who wrote us who transferred this
37:54 - comment over I remember your nature of
37:56 - code class in 2006. Jason first of all
37:59 - Jason wonderful student from IP uh that
38:03 - I've kept in touch with over the years
38:04 - I'm so thrilled that you're in the chat
38:06 - I didn't see your message but thank you
38:07 - Kathy for transferring that over do you
38:10 - recall it's two thousand when you took
38:12 - the class in 2006 was that the first
38:14 - time I taught it that would that would
38:16 - match my memory but I'd have to go back
38:19 - and look and see in NYU records if there
38:22 - was an earlier
38:23 - uh version of the class I definitely
38:25 - taught it very early on my first class I
38:27 - ever taught at NYU was
38:29 - um sorry I have this thing that I'm
38:31 - standing on because it helps my back it
38:33 - got old
38:35 - um and it just slid away and I was
38:37 - standing on the hard floor I'm Barefoot
38:38 - see wearing shorts suffer ah there we go
38:41 - okay oh that also hurt
38:43 - um
38:44 - what was I even talking about uh uh like
38:47 - the first class I ever taught at NYU was
38:49 - 2004.
38:51 - um so 2006 would be about right uh it
38:54 - was 2007. ah 2007. okay
38:58 - um okay
38:59 - anyway so let me show you the new draft
39:01 - uh so right now it is on uh well let me
39:05 - go to GitHub so if you're looking for
39:09 - where everything is oh I was going to
39:11 - talk about the print version
39:13 - sorry
39:14 - let me talk about the print version
39:16 - I'm thrilled to announce
39:19 - um
39:20 - that I am partnering with no starch
39:23 - press which is a wonderful
39:25 - um I do have a misspelling of my name
39:27 - though
39:27 - [Laughter]
39:29 - I guess I better let them know no C no C
39:32 - in Chipman I mean there are other people
39:34 - that would be a very a normal way to
39:37 - spell the name uh for whatever reason
39:39 - when uh my answers that's something
39:43 - sounds like that was a long time ago but
39:45 - not even more than like you know in the
39:47 - in the um
39:49 - when would the shipment to come through
39:53 - um I think in in the early 20th century
39:57 - like first of all I can't believe like
39:59 - talk about the 20th century like it was
40:01 - so long ago like I graduated from
40:02 - college in 20th century but anyway uh
40:06 - for whatever reason when um things got
40:08 - transcribed at Ellis Island uh no C was
40:11 - put in my version of shift man which
40:12 - means boat Man by the way uh from the
40:15 - German that's from what I understand
40:16 - anyway that's not what it's here I am
40:18 - here to tell you that the nature of code
40:20 - uh book The Print version will be
40:24 - available through no star address so
40:26 - first of all just to be very clear
40:28 - nothing has changed in terms of the
40:30 - licensing of the book it is still open
40:33 - source create a Commons non-commercial
40:35 - so that means it is a freely available
40:38 - the entire thing under the Creative
40:39 - Commons license the only restriction is
40:42 - you can't print and sell your own
40:44 - version of the book so a non you can't
40:46 - use it for commercial purposes I mean
40:48 - you can use the uh that doesn't go for
40:50 - the code examples and the concepts the
40:52 - code examples are uh MIT license or
40:55 - whatever kind of much more of license I
40:58 - would choose to use so that if you use
40:59 - one of the code examples in an artwork
41:01 - or a commercial project and a place
41:03 - where you're working that of course is
41:04 - allowed I just mean the content of the
41:06 - book is not something that you can
41:07 - resell
41:10 - um so um but I in order to one is um
41:14 - well first of all no starch is fantastic
41:17 - to work with it's I think the primary
41:19 - reason why I'm actually getting it done
41:20 - because they assigned an editor of the
41:22 - project they're doing technical review
41:23 - they've given me a deadline like all the
41:26 - LA the deadline actually for everything
41:27 - else that I need to do is October 1st
41:29 - so I don't um even the the draft is done
41:32 - of all the chapters but I do and
41:34 - everything else has to be done by
41:35 - October 1st so this is happening and the
41:38 - book The Print book will be available in
41:40 - print in 2024. this is something you
41:43 - could do today uh to support the project
41:45 - if you want
41:47 - um you can uh order it now one thing
41:49 - I'll just say I'm thrilled for people to
41:51 - order the Early Access ebook
41:55 - um if you want to support the project
41:56 - that way I don't see a strong like me
41:59 - personally I wouldn't do that because a
42:02 - I'm only paying for it if I really want
42:04 - to have the print version because to be
42:06 - honest
42:07 - ebook is available for free online right
42:09 - now
42:10 - I mean it's not as like a PDF document
42:12 - that you would have to pay for it
42:14 - through here although if you're uh if
42:17 - you are
42:19 - um
42:19 - what's the word I'm looking for where
42:21 - everybody is good at figuring things out
42:24 - if you are come on someone help me with
42:26 - this word this is what happens when you
42:27 - get old I can't pull out like words I
42:28 - used to use all the time not ambitious
42:31 - if you're
42:32 - uh somebody will help me with this word
42:34 - I don't know why I can't think of it ah
42:35 - this is driving me crazy uh teaching
42:37 - interactable saying I'm teaching physics
42:40 - using p5.js at a university in southern
42:42 - Chile thanks to you amazing I hope this
42:45 - book is a helpful resource I hope that
42:47 - once this gets done I can do we can do
42:49 - translations of it so especially if you
42:52 - are somebody who speaks another language
42:55 - um and is interested in helping to
42:58 - publish a translation of the book in
43:00 - another country in another language
43:02 - don't get in touch right now with me in
43:04 - touch with me after October 1st
43:06 - uh not tech savvy not eager not
43:09 - ingenious
43:10 - like
43:12 - oh there's a word I'm looking for Intent
43:15 - no I don't know maybe it doesn't exist I
43:17 - shouldn't
43:18 - technically inclined no you're
43:21 - um
43:22 - okay somebody will get it uh the link to
43:25 - pre-order is uh nostarch.com nature Dash
43:29 - code it's right up here I'll put all
43:31 - these links will end up in the chat so
43:35 - um but uh certainly if you want to
43:36 - pre-order the print book um go go ahead
43:39 - it's going to be longer than 536 Pages
43:41 - by the way that last chapter 10 which I
43:44 - think I need to break into two chapters
43:45 - got very long bored Frugal no
43:49 - um I want to say like
43:52 - God this is gonna drive me
43:55 - written by coding Train YouTube Star
43:58 - I'm a star baby
44:02 - um uh also misspelling of my name
44:06 - um learn from an expert I'm an expert
44:07 - and a star these are not ways that I
44:10 - would ever refer to myself but I'm fine
44:12 - you know you got to sell books somehow
44:14 - uh so this is happening uh placeholder
44:17 - cover uh pragmatic Pro industrious
44:21 - resourceful yes resourceful I think is
44:24 - what I'm looking for if you're
44:25 - resourceful yes that's the word I think
44:27 - I was looking for uh the print paperback
44:30 - on Amazon right now entertainment is the
44:32 - oh let's see it might actually be
44:34 - available for pre-order on Amazon let's
44:36 - take a look
44:38 - I don't know how this works just yet
44:43 - so this version is the 2012 version you
44:47 - know if you purchase it it's not a total
44:50 - loss in the sense that
44:53 - um
44:54 - uh I receive royalties from it so you're
44:57 - supporting me the book content is still
45:00 - uh
45:03 - I would say uh most of it a lot of it is
45:05 - the same or it would be value but but I
45:07 - certainly would suggest don't don't buy
45:08 - it
45:09 - um now the question is can we find
45:13 - uh well so maybe somebody who's
45:14 - resourceful we just use that word over
45:16 - and over again can find if the there is
45:19 - a pre-order on Amazon for the new
45:21 - version but at present it might only be
45:24 - available through no starch
45:27 - um
45:27 - I don't know about International so
45:30 - Joseph is actually asking about
45:31 - International I mean no starch certainly
45:33 - distributes their book internationally
45:36 - uh State Province country looks I see no
45:40 - reason why not all of the countries are
45:42 - here uh hello to Tomas uh G Sun Li I
45:46 - hope to get a chance to translate the
45:47 - new nature code book into Korean yes
45:48 - let's talk about that uh I would love
45:51 - that
45:53 - um
45:55 - but again I I can't I can't even bring
45:58 - allow myself to think about that until
45:59 - I'm done so now if so I talked about how
46:02 - you could pre-order it now everything
46:04 - for the book currently is in this GitHub
46:09 - repo so actually the entire content the
46:13 - entire draft of text of everything is
46:16 - just here in these like HTML files
46:20 - um and you can also find information
46:23 - around how the book is organized I'm
46:27 - using notion which is something I would
46:29 - like to do some videos about at some
46:31 - point
46:32 - um you know I follow Thomas Frank who is
46:34 - like the world's leading expert on
46:36 - notion I would love to do a
46:38 - collaboration about how the how I've
46:40 - done this book publishing with notion
46:43 - um or just be inspired by him you can
46:46 - actually
46:47 - build the PDF yourself uh if again if
46:51 - you're a resourceful and want to try
46:52 - running
46:53 - um you might be missing a few things
46:56 - like I am using a licensed font for the
46:59 - PDF so that font is not in the repo so
47:02 - when you build the PDF it might be a
47:04 - different font
47:06 - um
47:07 - and so but what's more important for me
47:10 - to show you is if you see this link
47:13 - right here uh we'll take you to and I
47:15 - know it's a second edition I I think I'm
47:17 - not supposed to say second edition it's
47:19 - just like a
47:21 - I don't know I don't know how it's going
47:22 - to work but this is the current draft of
47:25 - the book and I believe if I click this
47:28 - by this book it'll take you to the
47:30 - pre-order page so this is the link right
47:33 - here I'm sorry for its sort of
47:34 - clunkiness that you should all
47:36 - eventually this will just be at
47:38 - natureofcode.com but until it's finished
47:41 - it's going to live at this preview link
47:43 - and thank you alga for putting it here
47:45 - in the chat
47:47 - um
47:49 - okay uh all right so
47:52 - um so a couple things that I'll point
47:54 - out one is uh the what I call the
47:58 - introduction in the previous book is now
48:00 - chapter zero Randomness if you could
48:03 - come up with a better title for that I'm
48:05 - open to changing it because
48:08 - um
48:09 - yeah I don't know what what the title of
48:11 - that should be I could also just call it
48:12 - numbers but that didn't really seem to
48:15 - work
48:16 - um so uh I'm gonna just like you can see
48:19 - here uh the book design so Jason gal uh
48:23 - hello shout out has been who's an Alum
48:25 - of ITP who has been working on this
48:27 - project with me for probably over a year
48:28 - now and and many other people have
48:30 - contributed
48:31 - um uh that I'm that I'm not mentioning
48:34 - here as well and I'll try to as I
48:36 - remember mention everybody but has
48:37 - worked on this whole build process so
48:40 - this is the current website design the
48:42 - website I'm kind of not as worried about
48:44 - right now because I have in I have the
48:47 - rest of my life however long I live
48:50 - counting through time I can work on
48:53 - refining and improving the website but
48:55 - the PDF the print version has to get
48:56 - locked in you know in the next month or
48:58 - so but um if you scroll through you'll
49:01 - see this design of the book you'll see
49:03 - the code is now uh JavaScript
49:07 - um I plan to maintain uh processing
49:10 - versions of all the examples so you can
49:12 - read the book and you know in a fantasy
49:14 - land I might like have a little button
49:15 - here that I can just click a button and
49:17 - it has the book in processing but I
49:20 - don't have time to implement that right
49:21 - now
49:22 - um you can see that the examples are
49:25 - running right here on the page and then
49:28 - you can click this button that takes you
49:30 - right to the example in the P5 web
49:31 - editor look at the code run it there so
49:34 - that's a wonderful
49:36 - um there's new illustrations that Zanna
49:38 - Marsh is working on
49:40 - um and yeah so you know I could keep
49:43 - going through this but you can basically
49:44 - see what the book looks like
49:48 - um let me click through the chapters
49:50 - vectors it's pretty much the same as the
49:54 - first edition just with updates and
49:56 - improvements uh forces pretty much the
49:59 - same updates and improvements
50:01 - oscillation pretty much the same updates
50:04 - and improvements particle systems pretty
50:07 - much the same updates and improvements I
50:10 - mean there's been significant work on
50:12 - each of these chapters I don't mean to
50:13 - minimize that but
50:15 - um I want to get to where there's much
50:17 - more substantial changes uh autonomous
50:20 - agents uh pretty much the same I would
50:22 - say that uh this last section
50:25 - um has had uh has some new uh new
50:29 - examples
50:31 - um one of the things actually if
50:32 - somebody wants to work on um you know
50:34 - Jason is working on all this stuff so if
50:36 - you really wanted to work on this please
50:37 - open an issue so that there's not
50:39 - redundant work but some of these
50:40 - examples run very slow on the page not
50:43 - because they actually run slow but
50:46 - because the web the web page loads many
50:50 - many many many any examples so there's
50:52 - many canvases all running on this page
50:55 - so they run very slow there is I believe
50:57 - lazy loading meaning that the sketches
51:00 - don't load until you scroll to them but
51:03 - once I've scrolled all the way to the
51:04 - bottom they don't unload further up so
51:07 - things start to run quite slow so if
51:10 - anyone wants to help with optimizing
51:12 - that lazy loading that's uh that's
51:14 - something that I'm looking for help with
51:16 - yes new cover art Joseph I have yet to
51:19 - figure out
51:21 - who's doing that and how I'm doing that
51:23 - I have a lot of different people like
51:24 - who work on coding train illustrations
51:26 - who work on the book illustrations book
51:27 - design so I have the uh somebody who did
51:30 - the original cover design so I have to
51:31 - figure that out
51:33 - um
51:34 - but um but yeah so that's one sort of
51:36 - major issue with the book but you can
51:39 - see there's a new section on the quad
51:41 - tree example I'm referencing a lot of
51:44 - coding train videos a new sign and
51:46 - cosign lookup table example so there's a
51:48 - bunch of new things in all the chapters
51:50 - I'm just highlighting here in a Time
51:51 - series now
51:52 - physics libraries this chapter has had a
51:56 - major rewrite because the original
52:00 - version of the book If I go to here and
52:02 - go to physics libraries uh is mostly
52:06 - about a physics Library called box 2D
52:08 - which is a wonderful
52:13 - um
52:13 - a physics library that I would encourage
52:16 - everyone to continue to use it's just
52:18 - quite involved and a little tricky to
52:21 - use in JavaScript so I have been using
52:24 - more recently a JavaScript library
52:26 - called matter.js
52:29 - um which
52:31 - um
52:33 - is now the sort of Base Library for this
52:35 - chapter I also am still using toxic Libs
52:38 - which is in the chapter and then I also
52:40 - want to give
52:41 - a major shout out here to
52:45 - see if I can find it P5
52:51 - yes so I also you know I you know if I'm
52:55 - being completely honest here and thank
52:57 - you to Quinton who I believe I owe some
53:00 - emails or Discord messages back to who's
53:02 - been very patient with me
53:05 - um P5 play is an incredible library
53:09 - for uh P5 specifically that was
53:13 - initiated by Paulo
53:15 - predicini and is currently led by Ashley
53:17 - one of the work one of the huge things
53:20 - that Quentin has done from the way I
53:21 - understand it with P5 play is added
53:24 - rigid body collisions all built on top
53:27 - of box 2D so in many ways I think you
53:30 - could make a really really strong case
53:32 - for why this whole chapter should just
53:33 - be written in P5 play but there's just
53:36 - not the state of
53:38 - play if you will of where I was when
53:40 - working on this so Quentin has very
53:43 - generous in answering my questions and
53:44 - porting all of the examples that are in
53:47 - this chapter to P5 play so
53:50 - um
53:50 - so yeah so I also wanted to mention P5
53:52 - play and when the book gets finished and
53:55 - released
53:57 - um
53:58 - uh expected to be able to see uh through
54:00 - Clinton's hard work version of all the
54:02 - examples with P5 play Okay so this
54:06 - chapter is about the physics libraries
54:08 - uh Southern automata is a chapter of
54:11 - fractals is a chapter evolutionary
54:13 - communism is a chapter I'm just looking
54:15 - at the time here we're already at almost
54:17 - 11 o'clock and I'm only on item number
54:20 - one on my list so I gotta move through
54:22 - some things here
54:25 - um
54:26 - um
54:27 - there's a need for intersection
54:29 - observers on sleeping and waking them
54:31 - would be really nice yeah lots of
54:33 - lots of things okay
54:35 - um neural networks
54:36 - this chapter
54:39 - is where I have spent the most amount of
54:41 - time just in the last couple months so
54:43 - this chapter is is almost a complete
54:46 - rewrite and I'm going to just go through
54:48 - the table of contents for it
54:51 - um if we have time I wanted to demo some
54:53 - of the examples maybe I oh when I get to
54:55 - ml5 that's what I'll do the examples are
54:57 - now using the ml5 library I will demo
54:59 - those examples when I get to that on my
55:01 - list so let's go through the table of
55:03 - contents
55:05 - um
55:05 - first section is just about the sort of
55:09 - background in history of artificial
55:11 - neural networks I start code wise with
55:15 - making a perceptron so for me sometimes
55:17 - something that I really like to do is
55:21 - go back to the origin of an algorithm
55:24 - that's used today in
55:27 - really large scale and complicated ways
55:31 - so for me like if you're you know just
55:33 - to pull out an example out of thin air
55:36 - if you're using chat GPT
55:39 - chat GPT the text generate through chat
55:41 - GPT is coming from a large language
55:44 - model which is a Transformer
55:45 - architecture of a massive neural network
55:48 - of many many neurons and connections and
55:51 - all sorts of sophisticated learning and
55:53 - out and activation algorithms that have
55:55 - that is the result of you know now what
55:58 - is
55:59 - we can't do the math the 70 close to 70
56:02 - years of research and probably longer if
56:04 - I'm probably getting that wrong but to
56:06 - understand it to me I like to go all the
56:08 - way back to what is the unit the single
56:13 - foundational element inside of these
56:15 - large-cal systems and that is a neuron
56:17 - and in 1957 at the Cornell aeronautical
56:20 - laboratory the perceptron the idea of a
56:23 - perceptron the simplest neural network
56:24 - one neuron with inputs and outputs that
56:27 - was uh that that history of that
56:29 - research can be traced back to to
56:33 - um to that work and so the code example
56:35 - goes through how to build and the theory
56:38 - and practice of a single perceptron so
56:41 - that's a large portion of the chapter
56:43 - and it finishes with this example that
56:46 - looks at classifying dots in a
56:48 - two-dimensional space above or below a
56:51 - line using a perceptron
56:53 - okay
56:56 - uh
56:57 - so walnuts asks
57:00 - uh I'm hesitating to answer your name to
57:03 - answer your question here but walnuts
57:06 - asks why is the library why are the
57:07 - libraries ending with five P5 ml5 uh
57:11 - anybody know I know the answer let's see
57:13 - if somebody knows I can answer it in the
57:15 - chat but then I'll answer it if nobody
57:16 - knows
57:17 - uh okay but I'm gonna keep going here
57:20 - uh then um I go into a little bit of
57:24 - theory about why a single perceptron
57:26 - can't do very much and the concept
57:28 - behind a multi-layered perceptron
57:31 - but then this is where I make a huge
57:34 - skip forward so I want to go I go in the
57:37 - chapter I go through the theory
57:40 - um and algorithm behind the sort of like
57:41 - nuts and bolts the base Foundation of
57:44 - what a neural network is but then I jump
57:46 - to ml5 which is a machine learning
57:49 - library which has neural networks baked
57:52 - into it so I could just say make a new
57:54 - neural
57:55 - give it this data
57:57 - train it look at the output so that's
58:00 - where the chapter pivots and I go
58:02 - through and I explain uh
58:05 - class of classification and regression I
58:08 - look at the sort of M the idea of mnist
58:10 - in neural networks these are all
58:12 - placeholder illustrations as you can see
58:15 - so if you have ideas or thoughts about
58:17 - and this is borrowed from uh Hogan's
58:20 - material just as a sort of reference
58:22 - point for when I actually do the work
58:24 - with xanna to create the illustrations
58:26 - you can see my like chicken scratch here
58:28 - so I go through code and uh one of the
58:33 - first example I make is a simple gesture
58:36 - classifier
58:38 - uh
58:40 - ah okay oh I love a wire reference well
58:43 - thank you for the wire reference
58:45 - Crossing I've got so first of all no no
58:48 - no no no no no no no no no there's a
58:50 - definite misconceptions here in the chat
58:52 - which I want to correct processing
58:56 - is an active project it's funny that you
58:59 - would think like that's interesting to
59:00 - make that theory like oh there's
59:01 - processing four and P5 no no that's just
59:04 - a coincidence that processing happens to
59:06 - be on version four and P5 is called P5
59:08 - is only on version 1.7 so there's the
59:11 - version numbers and then there's the
59:12 - actual name so so far nobody's gotten it
59:15 - let's see uh chapter 10 is not available
59:18 - in the Early Access PDF Jason but that's
59:20 - going to be remedied like
59:22 - on Monday uh so that that that will be
59:25 - remedied uh um I just I finished the
59:29 - draft like literally like two days ago
59:30 - so I haven't generated the PDF and given
59:32 - it to no Starship not HTML5 although
59:34 - that's interesting well it's gonna be a
59:37 - while somebody's gonna get this
59:38 - uh so Joseph's got it in the Discord so
59:43 - um
59:44 - and Kate k uh okay we
59:47 - which I really work hard to pronounce
59:49 - Steve I never do it right asks any plans
59:52 - on including stuff about chat gbt in the
59:54 - book so I mention generative Ai and new
59:58 - architectures and make the connection to
60:01 - those uh Concepts and those those modern
60:04 - techniques but I'm not going through
60:05 - that in detail in the book I do have
60:07 - plans to do more educational materials
60:09 - around generative Ai and Transformer
60:12 - models and working with ml5 but for the
60:14 - nature of code book you'll see I'm kind
60:16 - of limited in scope
60:18 - um
60:19 - uh okay so so Joseph has got it in so
60:22 - Joseph wins as the coding train sticker
60:24 - whatever I mean it's not actually nobody
60:26 - wins anything I'm just saying you know
60:28 - uh
60:29 - um alka's now got it but I'll wait for
60:32 - it to come from somebody uh in the
60:35 - YouTube chat we'll see or um
60:37 - all right so uh I look at building
60:40 - machine learning model and this is the
60:41 - example uh
60:44 - all the way through
60:47 - um
60:48 - where it's trainable you could see like
60:49 - also this computer this is not my
60:52 - current laptop this is my old
60:55 - um
60:57 - 2019 MacBook Pro I still just use it for
61:00 - as like my now it's now it's just like
61:02 - permanently sitting on this desk for
61:04 - live streaming it's also struggling I
61:07 - think here to run some of these things
61:09 - but okay so here's the gesture
61:11 - classifier so it already ran um but
61:13 - basically I can make a gesture and it
61:16 - classifies it and we can see like if I
61:18 - do this I got right like how much down
61:22 - so I want to make a point here which is
61:25 - that of course you don't need neural
61:27 - networks to do this you could just like
61:30 - use some if statements and some math to
61:33 - evaluate like which way what angle is
61:35 - the heading of the vector
61:37 - um but I like to have an example
61:40 - that kind of that's very uh obvious and
61:43 - trivial so that you can see all the
61:44 - steps so you could do something more
61:46 - complex and that's like what some of the
61:48 - exercises are here so the exercise here
61:51 - which I hope take a solution for is you
61:53 - know my gesture is just a start point
61:55 - and an end point but what if it is a
61:57 - sequence of points what if I could have
61:59 - like a figure eight gesture versus a
62:00 - circle gesture and that kind of thing
62:02 - start classifying shapes so
62:04 - um and what if I use the hand pose model
62:06 - so um so there's that
62:09 - um then
62:10 - now here's the thing that I would love
62:12 - to hear feedback from all right so Karen
62:15 - got it
62:18 - uh oh coded design program being
62:20 - launched at your school Stig that's
62:21 - wonderful so I'd love to hear more about
62:23 - that
62:23 - um I still have a shout out to Stig in
62:27 - the audience who is was one of the
62:30 - organizers of processing Community Day
62:31 - in Copenhagen uh by the way there's a PC
62:34 - Taiwan that's happening I think the
62:37 - first week PCD by the way is processing
62:40 - Community day which is something that
62:42 - anybody can run one of their own it's a
62:43 - way of organizing an event for your your
62:46 - community around processing and creative
62:48 - coding
62:49 - um
62:51 - so
62:52 - um and and in case you're wondering
62:54 - what's in the box
62:55 - what's in the box it is a um
63:00 - authentic Danish train whistle from the
63:02 - 1950s I believe
63:07 - um lovely little sound there
63:09 - um
63:10 - so ah but I wanted to say that there's
63:12 - PCD Taiwan is happening I don't know the
63:14 - exact date but I think I'm speaking
63:16 - remotely I will be in Taiwan just for
63:18 - like 10 or 15 minutes so tune in for
63:20 - that next time I'll be appearing online
63:22 - oh I also wanted to mention I was on a
63:24 - podcast recently about AI so let me come
63:26 - back to that I'm making a note here
63:28 - all right so ah
63:31 - So currently it's chapter 10.
63:35 - and uh and chapter 10 I make a pivot to
63:39 - the concept of reinforcement learning
63:41 - and specifically neuro Evolution which
63:43 - is like a Twist on reinforcement
63:45 - learning
63:46 - it's really long I think it's about if I
63:48 - in the print PDF I think it's about 70
63:50 - pages right now
63:52 - so I'm curious any of you who just are
63:55 - looking through this today or anytime
63:57 - the next few days love to hear from you
63:58 - I think that should be two chapters it
64:01 - was originally supposed to be two
64:02 - chapters but I was having such writer's
64:04 - block and it was such a mental hurdle to
64:07 - get this thing done and I was like let
64:08 - me just make it one chapter and I'll add
64:10 - something about neuro Evolution on the
64:11 - end
64:12 - but then once I went to do that my
64:14 - neural Evolution section became really
64:16 - quite long so I think maybe now I can go
64:19 - back now that I've written the draft and
64:20 - break into the two chapters but I'd love
64:22 - to hear about that from you one thing
64:23 - that I'm struggling with which also uh
64:26 - suggestions would be great and by the
64:27 - way if you're wondering like how do you
64:28 - give me these suggestions join the
64:30 - cutting train Discord
64:33 - um yes
64:34 - and and K weakbond is making a very good
64:37 - point neuro evolution is not really
64:39 - reinforcement it's not reinforcement
64:40 - learning and um I would love for you to
64:42 - read this over and I make that point and
64:45 - and and make a transition to it but um
64:49 - I would love to any feedback you have
64:51 - about if I did that off you know in an
64:53 - accurate way the book is is having a
64:55 - technical review process which people
64:57 - are being paid uh one person is being
64:59 - paid to read over it but but I I welcome
65:02 - additional uh technical review
65:05 - um I I don't wanna I don't want to take
65:08 - advantage of people's generosity in time
65:09 - but certainly feedback as well okay
65:11 - oh point zero you made the January 2023
65:14 - pull request I did I'm sorry about that
65:17 - let me I'm not good at managing this
65:19 - let's can you tag me in Discord and
65:21 - maybe we can chat about this I just
65:23 - gotta remember to go back and look at
65:24 - that
65:25 - um okay so this will probably get broken
65:28 - out into a separate chapter
65:30 - um one thing that I'm struggling with is
65:31 - I I have like this ecosystem project at
65:34 - the end of every chapter
65:36 - prompt and it makes a lot of sense what
65:39 - to put at the end of the neuro Evolution
65:41 - section but if I don't get to neural
65:43 - Evolution I don't know what to put here
65:45 - but anyway
65:48 - um
65:50 - the counter thingy was initialized yes
65:52 - you can see it over here right now but I
65:54 - guess the light makes sense you can't
65:56 - read the time
65:57 - maybe now you can see it okay so going
65:59 - through uh these are not these are
66:02 - placeholders the actual uh we'll have
66:04 - new illustrations made uh for the book
66:07 - um but I go through the game Flappy Bird
66:09 - I talk about evaluating the game Flappy
66:12 - Bird in terms of features like the
66:16 - position of the bird its velocity its
66:18 - distance to the next pipe the location
66:20 - of the pipes and then I look at how a
66:22 - neural network can use those features to
66:25 - decide whether to flap its wings or not
66:27 - I look at how you can do that in ml5 and
66:32 - then
66:32 - build a neuro Evolution example so first
66:36 - of all I just create the Flappy Bird
66:38 - clone
66:40 - which I'm going to attempt to play here
66:41 - clicking the mouse it's running so slow
66:43 - so this is me playing it by clicking the
66:45 - mouse and then I go through how to do it
66:49 - with neuro Evolution
66:51 - um and all the ml5 stuff it's a lot of
66:55 - stuff here and then you'll see here this
66:57 - is neuro Evolution uh
67:00 - um
67:02 - so I'm seeing comments in the chat
67:05 - um
67:06 - and I'm not able to answer all them so
67:07 - sorry about that so uh
67:10 - right I do not go into so Dominique is
67:13 - asking a question about the specifics of
67:15 - reinforcement learning don't get into it
67:17 - into the book
67:18 - yeah so
67:21 - goodness my iPad with this chat
67:25 - um okay I would love to just like I I
67:28 - realized in life I can't do it all
67:31 - this like system I have or like trying
67:35 - to hold this iPad in place it's not
67:36 - really working very well all right then
67:38 - I'm just gonna get through this quickly
67:40 - then I look back smart Rockets is one of
67:42 - the examples in
67:44 - um in chapter nine with for genetic
67:47 - algorithms and I make a neural network
67:49 - version of it and then I'm really
67:51 - excited about then I do as neuro
67:53 - Evolution steering example there's a lot
67:56 - of examples there's a cat here I talk
67:58 - about sensors I look at how to like
68:01 - build sensors into a
68:05 - um like a little creature that can like
68:07 - you know that they sensors light up when
68:09 - it gets close to an another shape and
68:12 - then I kind of have this final example
68:15 - where I can speed up time here and these
68:17 - agents evolve to learn to effectively
68:21 - use their sensors to find and eat this
68:23 - food so let's see if I can run this for
68:25 - a little while
68:26 - well sometimes they all die out
68:28 - and I did something to uh I did
68:30 - something to the example which didn't
68:31 - make it in yet where you can add more
68:33 - but I can just reset so I'm still
68:36 - fine-tuning the parameters of this
68:39 - so uh so I think they're all going to
68:41 - die out again
68:43 - it's funny of course I'm having bad luck
68:44 - here while
68:46 - uh streaming maybe this one is going to
68:49 - lift come and clone yourself you're
68:50 - doing so well just clone yourself yes
68:53 - yes okay that was great so it made a lot
68:56 - of them and they're really quite good
68:57 - now so I can slow this back down and see
69:00 - that basically they use their sensors to
69:03 - be able to detect the food and they stay
69:05 - on the food eating uh until it's gone
69:07 - and then they wander around but they've
69:09 - learned this Behavior essentially
69:11 - through the process of neuro Evolution
69:13 - so this is like when I first thought
69:16 - about the nature of code in like 2006 or
69:18 - whatever this is kind of the example
69:20 - that I was dreaming of making and I
69:22 - finally got through finishing this
69:23 - chapter and have it here so I love neuro
69:26 - Evolution
69:27 - um I should also shout out David ha
69:32 - who is a um
69:35 - let me go here to uh his website
69:39 - otoro.net who has done a ton of work uh
69:44 - in uh I mean this is like a huge
69:46 - inspiration to me
69:48 - um let's see below machine learning
69:50 - projects I think you can find here yeah
69:52 - a lot of all the papers on uh you can
69:56 - see how similar a lot of these are to
69:57 - what I'm doing
69:59 - uh you can see directly like inspiration
70:01 - coming from here Hardware accelerated
70:03 - neuro Evolution so if you want to go
70:06 - even further this stuff um you can look
70:08 - at David ha's uh work as well
70:12 - um okay
70:14 - so that's really just about everything I
70:16 - have to say in nature of code oh one
70:18 - more one important thing here uh 1110
70:20 - geez
70:21 - 50 minutes here for the rest of my list
70:23 - but the main topic I want to talk about
70:25 - was nature of code so first of all if
70:27 - you are teaching this fall and want to
70:30 - use the new nature of code
70:32 - um please be in touch you could just
70:33 - don't need to be in touch because it's
70:34 - just there but I would love to hear from
70:36 - you
70:37 - uh and then you know if you're teaching
70:40 - in the spring and using the nature of
70:42 - code maybe your students maybe you could
70:44 - order the book for your University or
70:46 - School bookstore just saying okay
70:49 - um then
70:53 - uh okay
70:55 - um
70:58 - I think I'm wrapping this up oh yeah I
71:00 - remember what I want to say so let's say
71:03 - here's an important thing let's say
71:04 - you're reading the book
71:06 - and you have a comment you want to make
71:09 - uh uh a suggestion so first of all
71:12 - proceed with some level of understanding
71:15 - that I'm really trying to get this done
71:17 - and I I've put Blood Sweat tears over
71:20 - many many years into this it's I've
71:22 - dragged it out more than I could ever
71:24 - possibly drag it out so I am I don't
71:27 - want to say taking shortcuts but I'm the
71:30 - Kill Your Darlings I think is the uh is
71:32 - it Hemingway or
71:34 - Alan Ginsburg whoever made that phrase I
71:37 - having to kill my darlings which which
71:40 - is a phrase that sort of means like I
71:41 - just sure it would be great to include
71:43 - more about reinforcement learning in the
71:45 - book or use a different physics library
71:48 - in chapter six or uh include an
71:52 - additional example I just can't do that
71:53 - so if you have
71:55 - uh you know so what I'm looking for is
71:57 - more feedback about parts that are
71:59 - especially confusing things that are
72:01 - really but clear mistakes in terms of
72:04 - like how I'm describing math the math
72:06 - and physics Concepts
72:08 - um and typos and and that kind of thing
72:11 - um you can probably ignore like things
72:13 - like oh the figure number is wrong I
72:15 - mean eventually at some point I need
72:16 - that feedback but you know it's in copy
72:19 - editing and that kind of stuff hasn't
72:20 - gone but unfortunately right now you
72:23 - cannot pull request fixes
72:26 - even though the content is in here
72:29 - um and you could make a pull request to
72:31 - this HTML file that is like all of them
72:33 - the content of chapter three but this is
72:36 - actually coming for motion so this is an
72:38 - automated process where these HTML files
72:41 - are built from notion dot pages that I'm
72:43 - writing into so your best path
72:47 - for uh offering suggestions or
72:50 - Corrections is to open an issue
72:53 - and my preference would be that you open
72:55 - it sounds like uh
72:57 - uh individual issues
72:59 - for uh for different comments so rather
73:04 - than like here's one issue with like 100
73:06 - comments about the book I mean again
73:08 - you're giving up your time to do this so
73:11 - if that's the way you want to do it
73:12 - that's like I'm not going to stop you
73:14 - but for me it's easier to then see the
73:16 - issue go and make the fix manually and
73:18 - notion myself and then close the issue
73:21 - and it's just keep project management
73:22 - wise helps me keep track of the book so
73:24 - I just wanted to make that clear to
73:26 - anybody uh watching okay
73:30 - uh all right so uh let me answer the
73:33 - question about the fives so processing
73:36 - when it originally was invented the URL
73:39 - processing was not available so it was
73:42 - called processing with two Prof
73:45 - processing with two fives and I believe
73:47 - if you go to that URL it will still take
73:50 - you to the current processing website so
73:52 - Prosper fiving was kind of the it was an
73:56 - alternate name for processing it was
73:57 - often written that way so P5 used the
74:00 - five from the original processing as an
74:02 - homage uh to processing so that's where
74:05 - the five comes from in ml5 the five is
74:08 - there just to say that this library is
74:10 - meant to be used with P5
74:14 - okay uh Simon yeah the moving left thing
74:17 - um
74:18 - is uh is related to the way that I'm
74:21 - initializing the neural network weights
74:23 - and
74:24 - I could do something to get around that
74:26 - but in the end they kind of like learn
74:28 - how to move backwards they still tend to
74:32 - like have a moving to the left
74:33 - trajectory but I didn't I couldn't
74:36 - figure out an elegant way to talk about
74:38 - that and fix that in the book maybe if I
74:41 - add to chapter 11.
74:42 - yeah so that's that's um yeah
74:46 - okay
74:47 - ah MB lab yeah that's is asking about um
74:51 - first of all I haven't taken a break and
74:53 - I'm talking continuously I need a moment
74:56 - to breathe
75:00 - while I think about the next topic
75:02 - [Music]
75:27 - [Music]
75:42 - okay
75:46 - all right I'm gonna go right down on my
75:49 - list
75:50 - and talk about
75:54 - um
75:54 - coding training website and membership
75:56 - program any questions about
76:00 - uh
76:01 - um oh yeah so
76:03 - um so I haven't all I would love to make
76:05 - a series all about git and Version
76:07 - Control high priority on my list of
76:09 - things to go back and do again
76:11 - uh realistically when I would get to it
76:13 - I don't know uh some things about the
76:15 - old videos are still useful and apply
76:18 - they're quite out of date
76:20 - um but you could try it
76:21 - uh I mean yeah I would love to love to
76:24 - do that
76:25 - um an interactive also says it was
76:27 - helpful to them in the last week so
76:29 - that's that's nice to hear
76:31 - um but yeah I rebooting old things is
76:34 - is what I'm doing and my first priority
76:36 - was learning to code with processing
76:40 - I think my second priority is updating
76:41 - some old P5 tutorials and then probably
76:44 - my third would either be the ml5 videos
76:48 - or GitHub getting GitHub those would be
76:50 - kind of but you know I'm slow to get to
76:52 - things these days okay so let's talk
76:54 - about the coding Train website so this
76:58 - is not new anymore uh designed created
77:01 - and designed by Design Systems
77:02 - International uh put together by so many
77:04 - people from the community
77:07 - um
77:09 - um uh that um so
77:12 - I took a little break to pause there and
77:14 - I I just realized like wow I'm tired I'm
77:16 - exhausted from and all this energy and
77:18 - excitement about nature of code and now
77:20 - that I finished going through that I'm
77:21 - feeling a little bit like uh
77:25 - tired okay
77:27 - um so coding Train website so if you're
77:29 - brand new to the channel this is your
77:31 - place to start
77:33 - this is where those tracks that I've
77:36 - been referencing of like oh you want to
77:38 - learn to code from scratch oh yeah
77:40 - here's a p5.js track
77:42 - uh you want to learn a little bit more
77:44 - about git and GitHub for poets if you
77:46 - want to learn about I just called it
77:48 - that because it's not trying to be
77:49 - non-technical and we use a poem I use a
77:51 - poem as the sort of like canonical
77:53 - example tracing through
77:55 - um but this is the one that's kind of
77:56 - old and out of date I mean look
77:58 - look at that beautiful young face there
78:01 - in those glasses
78:03 - there's like no gray in that beard
78:05 - amazing
78:08 - oh
78:11 - Memories by the corner of
78:16 - okay I got a little dizzy singing there
78:19 - okay
78:20 - um so this is your place to get started
78:21 - now most people come to find the coding
78:24 - train through the challenges
78:26 - the challenges are single videos where I
78:30 - work through a particular project a lot
78:33 - of them are mathematical algorithms that
78:36 - I am attempting to visualize you know
78:38 - probably like a prime example of that is
78:40 - something like uh the heart curve and if
78:44 - you look at that you'll find uh the
78:47 - video
78:48 - um some
78:49 - this one's in two parts so there's two
78:51 - parts timestamps uh the code examples
78:55 - here so I can click here and I can find
78:57 - the code example which is right there
78:59 - and then
79:03 - I don't know if that's the appropriate
79:05 - use of that term of the website the
79:06 - passenger showcase so the passenger
79:08 - showcase is the place where you can
79:11 - submit and thank you to Kathy who I see
79:14 - has some submissions here who has been
79:16 - doing a lot of work in helping to curate
79:18 - the Showcase
79:20 - um it's where you can submit your own
79:22 - versions so I'm I'm going through this
79:24 - quickly because I can get now to the
79:27 - Showcase page in the Showcase page and
79:29 - by the way uh is where you'll see all of
79:32 - the projects
79:33 - um in uh reverse chronological order so
79:36 - we can look and you know the idea of the
79:38 - coding train uh you know Raphael uh
79:41 - decorville
79:42 - does an amazing job of this with his
79:44 - weekly creative coding challenges and
79:46 - streaming every week and looking at
79:48 - everybody's work I aspire to be like
79:50 - that I haven't been able to keep up with
79:52 - it
79:52 - I want it I would like to if I can get
79:55 - back into the habit of live streaming
79:56 - more often every week go through some
79:58 - recent submissions but I'll just do that
80:00 - now we can see here's one from uh Pana
80:03 - or sorry Tamaki uh Pana go around by
80:07 - Tamaki
80:08 - komatsuzaki which I guess is this I
80:11 - don't know if this is like a known
80:12 - character or a creation of an original
80:15 - character but you can see if I had to
80:17 - guess this is maybe from like my polar
80:19 - coordinates video
80:21 - let's see uh from no 3.6 graphing sine
80:25 - wave so we can go here we can see ah
80:27 - this is the video that this project was
80:29 - made with and you can see it's the only
80:31 - showcase project with that video now the
80:33 - thing that's really exciting that's new
80:35 - and a huge thanks to deepam who uh if
80:38 - I'm missing somebody apologies I think
80:41 - depalm did the bulk of this work
80:44 - um
80:44 - and depalm remind me if I'm pronouncing
80:47 - your name correctly uh if I go to the
80:50 - guides and I want to talk about the
80:52 - membership guide this is something brand
80:54 - new also if I go to the passenger
80:57 - showcase guide this is the submission
81:00 - form where you can submit a project now
81:03 - you can submit your project through
81:06 - GitHub uh with a pull request and Kathy
81:09 - noted to me that it's a little confusing
81:10 - how to do that and I should spend some
81:11 - time going over how to do that but I
81:13 - might have to cut that for time yeah
81:16 - thanks for reminding me
81:19 - we'll play this song in the background
81:20 - is it really loud
81:26 - [Music]
81:36 - I really messed that up because
81:40 - [Music]
81:51 - okay just enjoy this for a moment
81:54 - [Music]
82:01 - auto-tune and the internet was
82:03 - successful
82:07 - all right
82:10 - all right thanks for that reminder
82:14 - where was I ah
82:17 - so one of the thing uh the last time you
82:21 - might have looked at this if you haven't
82:22 - looked at in a while you could only
82:24 - submit
82:26 - showcase projects for the coding
82:28 - challenges through the website you could
82:30 - otherwise do it through a pull request
82:32 - in a somewhat convoluted process and I
82:35 - need to update the tutorial for how to
82:37 - do that to clarify that process but now
82:41 - you can actually pick which track you
82:45 - want your project to go with so for
82:48 - example there are some videos this is
82:50 - left unfinished because I'm focusing on
82:52 - the writing somebody I'll get back to it
82:54 - for example if I go to Nature of code
82:56 - this will now populate with all of the
82:59 - nature of code videos so if I have made
83:02 - a Project based on the arrive steering
83:04 - video then this is where I can submit it
83:07 - title of the project URL an image your
83:10 - name your website your email is optional
83:13 - and I'm not I don't believe I'm store
83:15 - I'm not storing it anywhere I think to
83:19 - fact check this but um
83:21 - I am
83:23 - um it gets used to link to your GitHub
83:26 - account so you can get because it this
83:28 - automates a pull request so if you put
83:30 - in your email associated with a GitHub
83:32 - account in that field then you will get
83:35 - uh tagged as the uh creator of those
83:39 - commits on GitHub and then social media
83:42 - handles are nice because again I we I
83:44 - haven't kept up with this
83:46 - um uh Katie Chan who runs Cody train
83:48 - social media accounts currently
83:51 - um uh is we'll get back in the habit of
83:54 - this hopefully but we like to tag people
83:55 - on social media about their passenger
83:57 - showcase submissions okay so that is up
84:01 - so I think Kathy I'm sorry I know you
84:03 - um mentioned this there is some
84:06 - information about how you can do this
84:08 - process through a pull request but it is
84:11 - a little it's changed a little bit let
84:12 - me see if I I don't need part of me is I
84:14 - don't even know how this works but let's
84:16 - look I think the challenge is that is
84:19 - finding where the file goes
84:22 - so on the website
84:26 - uh
84:27 - [Music]
84:28 - uh under videos maybe yeah I think like
84:30 - so for example I think if you wanted to
84:32 - do it through a pull request and you're
84:34 - doing nature code
84:35 - and I forgot what one I said but like if
84:38 - and you have to like find the video yeah
84:41 - so it's just like tricky you just have
84:43 - to like uh find the path of where the
84:46 - markdown file
84:48 - um for the video is which can be a
84:51 - little bit tricky you've probably a
84:52 - little bit of detective work it requires
84:54 - you to be
84:56 - resourceful today's word of coding train
84:59 - is brought to you by today's word of the
85:01 - day resourceful
85:04 - did it did it pop up here and like was
85:06 - there an animation and a sound effect no
85:09 - I guess it only happens when I hire
85:11 - people to do that in post-production
85:13 - okay
85:15 - um so so this is where you would want to
85:17 - put that manually you just have to
85:19 - create the Json file in an image file so
85:21 - I kind of went over it but I glossed
85:22 - over it okay let's get to the next and
85:26 - give me a second here I totally forgot
85:28 - just give me can you bear with me for a
85:30 - second here polar to coordinate let's
85:32 - play a different song Pearl and noise
85:33 - song
85:34 - so this is random oh that's very loud
85:37 - pearly noise that is in the core random
85:40 - algorithm the actual random algorithm
85:42 - itself those numbers aren't related at
85:45 - all you pick like okay
85:49 - seven six one nine four eight nine two
85:54 - one three I pick nine a lot apparently
85:55 - but with pearly noise I might pick
85:57 - numbers like this two three I had some
86:00 - slides to show you I don't have them
86:05 - six seven five six seven I have them
86:07 - available in Discord well this is like
86:10 - I'm opening Discord it's hard but it's
86:12 - like updated
86:14 - [Music]
86:16 - I could read random numbers
86:20 - the issue is how to add this oh add the
86:24 - Showcase
86:27 - Kathy is clarifying for me something
86:31 - um really important which is
86:33 - uh uh I'll just say it um which is that
86:36 - if you want to add a showcase project
86:39 - for a video that doesn't have any that
86:43 - are part of it already then you have to
86:46 - create that showcase folder which is a
86:48 - little bit tricky but uh just get in
86:51 - touch tag me or tag station manager
86:53 - maybe or engineer on Discord which are
86:57 - um people who can help uh answer your
86:59 - questions about how to do this stuff
87:00 - okay
87:02 - uh Discord now I have to log in it's
87:05 - going to give me a QR code yes so just
87:07 - bear with me one more minute
87:15 - log in I'm in
87:20 - I'm gonna look for my direct messages
87:21 - here
87:23 - and
87:26 - just give me a second
87:29 - oh I should have done this in advance
87:31 - I'm so sorry everybody
87:36 - one
87:39 - this oh this is probably not worth it
87:41 - but I'm gonna do it anyway
87:44 - yeah you can listen to the song again
87:48 - [Music]
87:50 - with curly noise I might pick numbers
87:53 - like this
87:54 - three four three four five six five four
87:58 - five six seven five six seven five
88:01 - purling noise that is purling noise so
88:03 - this is hurling noise that is
88:06 - so this is hurling noise that is
88:09 - hurling noise so this is hurling noise
88:11 - that is hurling noise this is this is
88:13 - hurling noise that is hurling so this is
88:14 - hurling noise that is hurling
88:23 - noise
88:29 - [Music]
88:31 - apparently but with pearly noise I might
88:33 - pick numbers like this two three four
88:36 - three four five six five four five
88:40 - [Music]
88:44 - okay
88:47 - I'm back to you
88:51 - uh
88:53 - uh there we go all right
88:55 - so
88:57 - uh the other thing that is new on the
88:59 - website that I wanted to talk about is
89:01 - coding train
89:02 - um for lack of a better term membership
89:05 - or support
89:06 - so
89:08 - um this is always tricky for me to talk
89:10 - about or think about a coding train is
89:12 - not not a full-time coding trained
89:14 - YouTuber person I do not rely on uh
89:18 - crowdfunding uh and other revenue from
89:21 - ads for my primary source of income I
89:25 - have a full-time job with benefits as a
89:27 - at New York University so I really
89:30 - hesitate to ask people to support the
89:33 - coding trade that said I'd spend a
89:36 - tremendous amount of time on the coding
89:37 - train and at any given time they're
89:39 - anywhere between like two and ten people
89:42 - working on projects uh that I hire to do
89:46 - things like animation video editing on
89:48 - the nature of code book I've been
89:50 - investing a lot of funds into for
89:53 - illustrations
89:55 - um you know I will hopefully recoup a
89:56 - lot of that through royalties from the
89:57 - book but it's all out of pocket right
89:59 - now uh building the website doing design
90:02 - so those of you who are who want to or
90:06 - are able to support the coding train
90:09 - um it helps so and it I kind of you know
90:13 - honestly like I try to budget to
90:14 - basically Break Even sometimes I come
90:17 - out a little bit ahead sometimes I come
90:19 - out a little bit
90:20 - um a little bit under
90:22 - um I you know I'm trying to get better
90:23 - at accounting so I actually just hired a
90:25 - bookkeeper so that's where some of the
90:28 - funds go to as well
90:30 - um so but I have not done a great job at
90:34 - uh
90:36 - keeping up with the benefits and perks
90:39 - and rewards if you will of subscribing
90:42 - to various things like get up
90:44 - sponsorships and YouTube memberships so
90:47 - over the last over this summer I've been
90:49 - meeting with Katie Chan who helped run
90:51 - the social media accounts and and uh
90:53 - Jason uh hegland who has designed a lot
90:56 - of the logos and and and and makes a lot
90:58 - of the like stickers and things like
91:00 - that and we have worked to
91:03 - streamline and consolidate uh and
91:06 - clarify the ways that you can support
91:08 - the coding train and what types of
91:11 - things you get access to for doing so I
91:13 - want to just kind of go through a little
91:15 - bit of that right now if you'll indulge
91:17 - me doesn't interest you because you
91:19 - click away you put me in the background
91:22 - whatever it's fine so hopefully this
91:24 - will just take a few minutes
91:26 - um I will on the website there is now
91:28 - under guides this membership guide which
91:31 - hopefully explains all of this
91:35 - um and I'm going to show you these
91:36 - images that Katie worked on that'll go
91:37 - on Instagram
91:39 - I've tried to use as many train puns as
91:42 - possible in here
91:44 - so please enjoy that
91:48 - um
91:49 - I cannot confirm or deny the use of any
91:52 - AI large language models to help me
91:54 - brainstorm Fun Train puns
91:57 - but where am I going here uh membership
92:01 - okay
92:02 - so let's let's go through these
92:06 - okay membership announcement
92:10 - [Music]
92:16 - and not as exciting as you might think
92:18 - but still pretty exciting okay
92:20 - um
92:22 - oh my God a computer system what are the
92:24 - changes so the main thing is I am trying
92:27 - I'm only going to have like two levels
92:29 - there's different ways you know buying
92:31 - the nature of code book is a way of
92:33 - supporting the coding train I know that
92:35 - there's like super chats and all sorts
92:38 - of other things and uh I I would say
92:41 - also
92:42 - um donating to the processing Foundation
92:44 - is another way to support the work that
92:45 - I'm doing uh it's you know
92:47 - uh in indirectly I suppose or maybe in a
92:51 - way that's more needed like I I always
92:53 - say like if you're going to support one
92:55 - or the other like support the processing
92:56 - Foundation
92:58 - um but uh I tried to simplify and so
93:00 - there's only like two levels so you know
93:01 - if you have I'm only thinking I think it
93:04 - was two levels
93:06 - so uh uh passenger or conductor so most
93:09 - platforms have five dollars a month or
93:10 - ten dollars a month the and I'm trying
93:12 - to streamline what the uh rewards are so
93:15 - for uh the five dollar a month um uh
93:18 - passengers
93:19 - um is access to uh some uh unlock some
93:22 - Discord channels it is a public open
93:24 - Discord server but there are some member
93:26 - only channels
93:27 - um the rewards I used to do them
93:30 - piecemail so when somebody signs up I
93:33 - would send them a sticker pack and I
93:35 - would get behind and those of you who
93:37 - were owed the train whistles like waited
93:38 - like two years to get them those have
93:41 - been sent out so now the way it's going
93:43 - to work is once a year I'm gonna send
93:46 - out a coding train sticker path to
93:48 - everybody
93:49 - so any for every year that you're a
93:52 - member once a year are going to post a
93:54 - form in Discord tag everybody post you
93:57 - know communicate on all the platforms so
93:59 - I'm not collecting people's addresses
94:00 - and information when they sign up once a
94:04 - year I'm gonna say hey if you're a
94:05 - member and you want the sticker pack
94:07 - enter your information into this form
94:09 - it's all going to go out that mailing
94:11 - will probably go out by the end of
94:13 - September that's a goal we've ordered
94:15 - all the stickers
94:16 - um so now is a good time to sign up
94:18 - because if you sign up you're gonna
94:19 - you're gonna get that sticker pack
94:20 - pretty soon if you've been a member for
94:22 - five years you're going to get it if you
94:23 - remember for one year you're gonna get
94:24 - it everybody again everybody gets a
94:26 - sticker pack who signs up
94:28 - um and I decided to give out stickers
94:30 - for free to people in person and events
94:32 - and things when I can obviously I would
94:34 - love to in an Ideal World I would just
94:35 - mail stickers to everybody but that's
94:36 - not realistic
94:38 - okay and then uh I haven't done these in
94:41 - quite a while but sometimes when I'm
94:43 - recording videos that I'm not doing as
94:45 - part of a live stream uh there will be
94:48 - behind the scenes and Q a sessions for
94:50 - smaller groups so those are the main
94:52 - perks but uh
94:54 - in the end what I'm saying is
94:57 - do not sign up
94:59 - for these I'm trying to give these out
95:02 - but sign up only if you feel like you
95:04 - have the capacity and want to
95:06 - um yeah and then the only thing
95:08 - different is I will I'm able to like
95:11 - produce more than just stickers if you
95:14 - sign up for a little bit more
95:16 - um so I I think we're doing I mean I
95:19 - guess I I don't know if it's meant to be
95:20 - a surprise or not but I'm doing a like
95:23 - um like us I don't know what to call it
95:25 - like an uh
95:27 - I actually don't even know what it is
95:28 - but it's a special more like physical
95:30 - enamel pin like lanyard type thing with
95:32 - like a uh you can and a lanyard coding
95:35 - train lanyard thing that might be like a
95:37 - ticket a train ticket design like try to
95:39 - do something special every year like
95:41 - this custom laser etched train whistle
95:43 - uh for the 10 a month okay great
95:46 - I don't want to belabor this too much so
95:49 - existing members nothing changes uh but
95:53 - hopefully this is good news because you
95:55 - get you're gonna get something every
95:56 - year
95:57 - um wrote some more about why
96:00 - um mostly the thing that I want to say
96:01 - is like if
96:02 - you feel like hey I signed up a while
96:05 - ago and I never even got you know if you
96:07 - have any questions about this this is
96:08 - your email address
96:10 - that you can write to and now the sort
96:13 - of ways you can support so
96:15 - I've decided to take the approach of
96:18 - like huh I'm just gonna like offer up
96:20 - whatever platforms exist
96:22 - um some platforms have specific things
96:25 - that you get for that specific platform
96:26 - honestly my favorite one at present is
96:29 - GitHub sponsors so if you go to
96:32 - github.com codingtrain I think there is
96:36 - a sponsor button here which has
96:40 - uh these levels that you can and um the
96:44 - reason why is the GitHub uh takes I
96:46 - think the least amount of fees
96:48 - from it
96:50 - um
96:50 - uh and it seems like a nice system but
96:52 - YouTube membership is might be the one
96:54 - you want because if I post anything
96:57 - that's like a Members Only video on
96:59 - YouTube or you get the badges and things
97:02 - G suddenly just
97:04 - well I have to do my old my old thing
97:07 - how did I do this I used to do this the
97:10 - live stream
97:12 - Jason Lee
97:15 - you have just just climbed aboard the
97:18 - passenger car of the coding train
97:20 - welcome
97:21 - [Music]
97:22 - [Applause]
97:24 - for your membership you get
97:26 - [Music]
97:28 - don't let you get a little badge a
97:31 - little dot a little purple purple dot
97:33 - next to your name if this wasn't all
97:36 - like like very
97:38 - you know if I could manage to do this I
97:40 - might like pull this out and read you a
97:41 - random number but you know all that
97:43 - stuff thank you for joining
97:45 - um so these are the platforms that exist
97:48 - um you can look at them there's links to
97:50 - them I also want to mention that uh
97:52 - nebula like there's a lot I have more to
97:54 - say about nebula because uh when I get
97:56 - to my uh processing updates
98:00 - um
98:04 - um so I I I'm I'm uh one uh there's a
98:08 - question which one gives you the most
98:09 - money I think it's GitHub sponsors
98:11 - I think GitHub sponsors just I don't
98:13 - know if they still have this promotion
98:15 - for a while they weren't taking any fees
98:16 - and they were matching I don't think
98:18 - they're doing that anymore that was like
98:19 - when they first started GitHub sponsors
98:22 - um
98:24 - yeah
98:26 - um so but I'm gonna talk nebula is
98:28 - another way of supporting the coding
98:30 - train that is really incredible and you
98:31 - get a lot of stuff nebula is an
98:33 - incredible streaming service that
98:37 - um is part of uh that is a new company
98:39 - independent streaming uh independent
98:41 - creators it has a show called jet lag
98:43 - that I'm obsessed with
98:46 - um so many amazing channels that I could
98:48 - name that are on the nebula platform and
98:50 - you can sign up and I
98:52 - um so that is a way of supporting the
98:55 - coding train I don't at present have all
98:58 - of these things linked if honestly you
99:00 - ask me to choose what I think you should
99:02 - do I would say sign up for nebula
99:03 - through my link that's I might not get
99:05 - the most money from that but that's my
99:07 - most favorite way for people to support
99:08 - the coding train because I'm really
99:10 - excited about nebula and want to do more
99:12 - with nebula but I will be talking about
99:14 - soon away I will be um
99:18 - posting my processing video series on
99:21 - nebula as an exclusive first so if
99:24 - that's something you're really
99:25 - interested in and want to look at it in
99:27 - advance of it going to YouTube
99:29 - um Netflix thing you want to sign up for
99:31 - and when it's ready I'll talk more about
99:32 - that in a live stream okay
99:36 - oh on GitHub organizations have a six
99:38 - percent fee
99:39 - so what do individuals had because I
99:41 - switched over to an organization from an
99:44 - individual but six percent is I mean
99:47 - YouTube takes uh 30 I think
99:51 - I think it's 30 percent
99:52 - that's a lot more than six percent okay
99:56 - um all right and then all the details
99:59 - are here at thecodingtrain.com
100:00 - membership okay
100:05 - oh deep Palm okay great back to one
100:08 - thing so that's about the membership
100:09 - stuff that's all I want to say about
100:10 - that if you have questions I'm happy to
100:12 - answer but I don't want to spend too
100:13 - much time on that it's not my priority
100:16 - um okay I want to go back to the um the
100:19 - guides
100:21 - and go to the passenger showcase guy oh
100:23 - no I'm gonna go to the uh tracks so
100:26 - let's go into
100:28 - um
100:30 - code program with P5 and I believe like
100:33 - shapes and drawing maybe has a bunch of
100:34 - Passenger showcase oh no how does it not
100:36 - have any passenger showcase projects
100:39 - color maybe interesting
100:41 - I guess these beginner projects it's
100:43 - sort of new that you could do this well
100:45 - let's get random
100:48 - yeah random has a bunch of Passenger
100:49 - showcase projects so one of the things
100:52 - that I didn't realize thank you to
100:53 - deepam who pointed this out is if I
100:55 - click submit to the Showcase here first
100:58 - of all don't you love that the
101:00 - the buttons cycle through and you hover
101:02 - over them they they like cycle through
101:04 - like all sorts of different colors
101:07 - yeah look at that it's like cycling
101:08 - through rainbow colors I love that so
101:10 - much okay
101:12 - um so if I click on this it Auto
101:15 - populates
101:17 - Auto popular
101:22 - [Music]
101:25 - oh no populace
101:28 - [Music]
101:31 - that makes me so happy
101:32 - okay
101:34 - cutting Train website membership
101:37 - showcase
101:40 - all right I have to get back to my
101:41 - family and the weekend in about 15
101:43 - minutes
101:45 - things left on my list
101:50 - some of these are like things I can
101:51 - mention in just a minute let me maybe
101:52 - I'll go through those
101:54 - and then come back to
101:57 - ml5 towards the end
102:01 - oh great zero percent
102:04 - oh percent on GitHub sponsors that's
102:06 - very helpful
102:07 - zero percent fee
102:13 - but honestly like I really to me the
102:16 - membership program is more about
102:17 - building Community I mean sure like who
102:20 - we don't why give dollar fifty to Google
102:23 - when it the dollar fifty could go to me
102:24 - I suppose but
102:26 - um if you really enjoy
102:29 - um the uh having the sort of perks and
102:32 - features on the YouTube membership stuff
102:33 - you should feel free to do that okay
102:38 - all right now
102:42 - what what do I want to do so let me come
102:44 - back to ml5
102:48 - I'm thinking about what I want to okay
102:49 - uh
102:51 - all right let's talk about
102:53 - um
102:54 - I don't know if anyone's watching okay
102:58 - you know I should maybe I should do Emma
103:00 - I'm going back what I said maybe I
103:02 - should look at ml5 right now
103:04 - and then uh I'll just go through quick
103:06 - things at the end okay let's do that
103:10 - okay so what's happening with the ml5
103:13 - project
103:14 - so um I've worked on a lot of different
103:17 - open source projects over the years most
103:19 - notably uh processing and uh then
103:23 - working on helping to start the
103:24 - processing Foundation
103:26 - um these days my focus in terms of the
103:29 - actual open source work that I'm doing
103:31 - is mostly on this project and the reason
103:34 - that is
103:35 - um well for the processing Foundation
103:36 - has expanded and there's a lot of people
103:37 - working on P5 and processing now and
103:40 - lots of announcements and things to come
103:42 - there
103:43 - um
103:44 - but for me uh I have this is something
103:47 - that I'm actively working on for my
103:49 - teaching at NYU I'm able to apply for
103:52 - funding and work with NYU students to
103:54 - build out this Library so that's become
103:56 - kind of my uh research if you will work
104:00 - while at my day job at NYU the ml5
104:03 - project
104:04 - it also is tied to that chapter 10 of
104:07 - nature of code so I've been investing a
104:09 - lot of time over the summer in this
104:10 - project so there's lots of announcements
104:12 - about ml5 to come I'm not going to
104:15 - really necessarily get into everything
104:17 - but what I wanted to point out to you is
104:19 - if you go to the GitHub
104:21 - you might notice that there is this repo
104:25 - called ml5 Next Gen
104:28 - so proceed with caution this is not
104:30 - ready for prime time there's no release
104:32 - of this
104:34 - um that's ready and documented if you
104:36 - are teaching with ml5 and you have class
104:39 - next week you know nothing has changed
104:42 - for you but if you want to take a sneak
104:44 - peek and poke around and follow what's
104:45 - going on
104:47 - um this is the repo for you so let's
104:50 - just see I don't know how far I'm gonna
104:53 - get with this
104:55 - I I've been working on this a ton but on
104:59 - my uh work laptop not on this streaming
105:02 - laptop so I don't know what's going to
105:05 - happen when I try to uh run this but
105:08 - let's
105:09 - let's first like what version of node am
105:12 - I running
105:13 - 17.3 so that might be a problem do I
105:17 - have NVM yes
105:19 - so I want to use NVM so NVM by the way
105:22 - so by the way if you are a beginner
105:24 - programmer or you just kind of wandered
105:26 - in here from who knows where I'm about
105:28 - to do some stuff that's a little bit
105:31 - beyond probably where you are in your
105:33 - journey
105:35 - um so feel free to follow along but be
105:38 - aware uh um you know I have and I can
105:42 - help if you join the Discord or you ask
105:43 - some questions the community will
105:45 - hopefully help answer what's going on
105:46 - here but um essentially like just as a
105:50 - reminder if you go to thecodingtrain.com
105:52 - and get started with code those would be
105:54 - where some of the beginner tutorials
105:55 - which would ramp you up towards the sort
105:58 - of place where I am right now but right
105:59 - now I'm going to do something which is
106:00 - high degree of difficulty which is
106:02 - attempt to follow some instructions
106:04 - about how to build an open source
106:06 - Library uh for and see if I could run it
106:10 - in a testing way so this um so NVM is a
106:15 - particular tool that stands for node
106:17 - version manager node is a way of running
106:19 - JavaScript code sort of on your computer
106:22 - and developing web applications and
106:24 - different things you know outside of P5
106:27 - and the world of the web
106:28 - our clients at the world of the web
106:30 - browser I should say so if you want to
106:32 - try to follow along here the first thing
106:34 - you would need to do is install NVM I'm
106:36 - skipping that step then I would need to
106:39 - go to a terminal
106:40 - and make sure I have the correct version
106:43 - of node that's compatible with ml5 let's
106:45 - try doing that and I wouldn't be
106:47 - surprised if I don't get all the way
106:48 - through with this but let's see if an
106:50 - error comes up okay
106:52 - so now uh and I think it's having me use
106:56 - that version so if I type node version
106:58 - yeah I'm actually already using that
107:01 - version so I don't even need to uh say
107:04 - uh use 18 but
107:07 - I could do that I'm still in 18.
107:11 - um okay now the next thing I need to do
107:13 - is install a global package Dash G is
107:18 - for a couple called yarn what is yarn
107:22 - your
107:24 - crochet but here in my artisul
107:27 - handcrafted code I think I'm going to
107:30 - Rebrand the coding strain to artisanal
107:32 - handcrafted coding train
107:35 - um
107:38 - um yarn is what is known as a package
107:41 - manager and if you've used a patch
107:44 - manager before
107:45 - probably used npm because that's node
107:49 - package manager but yarn is a different
107:51 - one that's maybe a little more recent
107:53 - new I mean it's probably not that new
107:55 - anymore people love it and there are
107:58 - some aspects of ml5 that require yarn so
108:00 - install yarn
108:04 - uh
108:07 - okay did that work
108:10 - so now I should be able to say ah so now
108:12 - I need to clone this repo hopefully
108:14 - that's going to work so I'm going to
108:16 - grab and by the way um you can use
108:19 - GitHub desktop I'm finding it more maybe
108:22 - that more and more people are using
108:23 - GitHub desktop maybe I should do some
108:24 - tutorials with GitHub desktop there's a
108:27 - GitHub command line interface
108:29 - Etc but I'm using this particular way of
108:32 - authenticating into my account when
108:34 - working with GitHub but you probably if
108:37 - you're going to be following exactly
108:38 - what I'm doing you're not an owner of
108:39 - ml5 so you probably need to use this
108:41 - particular URL
108:43 - this will only work if you own or have
108:45 - access to ml5 and so I'm going to say
108:47 - git clone the next gen repo
108:51 - okay so now uh if I look at the desktop
108:55 - I should have a folder called
108:58 - ml5 next 10 and it's got a lot of stuff
109:01 - in it
109:02 - so I want to CD change directory there
109:06 - and then I can go and by the way this is
109:11 - not something anybody needs to do when
109:14 - working with ml5 this is a process for
109:17 - developing ml5 and would be required now
109:19 - if you want to test the new version
109:22 - but soon won't be so
109:25 - I'm going to run this command yarn does
109:27 - that is that just the generic yarn
109:29 - install I don't have to say install I
109:30 - guess of everything yeah so now this is
109:32 - installing all of the other dependencies
109:35 - and things so ml5 Library depends on all
109:39 - these other packages and things so now
109:41 - the the working on a project with
109:44 - JavaScript with the node ecosystem is
109:46 - entering into a world of a million
109:49 - different libraries and dependencies and
109:51 - packages and functionalities and as you
109:53 - can see one of the things that's getting
109:55 - installed is all this tensorflow stuff
109:57 - so tensorflow is Google's open source
110:01 - machine learning library that ml5 is uh
110:03 - most of ml5 is built on top of okay so
110:06 - now I should be able to say yarn start
110:11 - and
110:13 - it's gonna build the library run a web
110:16 - server and open up a web page
110:20 - open up a web page
110:22 - open up a web page
110:24 - of the current examples
110:27 - so oh did I not merge
110:32 - oh shiftman okay so it's okay I'm gonna
110:36 - I'm gonna show you something even more
110:37 - crazy in a moment
110:42 - um
110:42 - but let's just start here so first of
110:45 - all you can run
110:47 - um any of these examples so I'm going to
110:48 - show you an example that I made recently
110:50 - with the new uh ml5 and
110:53 - um this is by the way this model was
110:56 - created and brought in by
110:58 - um
111:00 - uh Peter Lynn
111:04 - um and let's see if this works
111:07 - so look at this by the way okay
111:10 - if you're like me
111:13 - and you're an old timer
111:15 - and you are learning creative coding in
111:17 - like 2001
111:20 - and uh and you and somebody said is your
111:23 - homework assignment make a
111:26 - Graphics application that tracks your
111:28 - index and thumb and draws a circle where
111:32 - they are I mean you would have spent
111:35 - year the next full year of your life
111:37 - trying to figure that out now we just
111:39 - have in the web browser on the internet
111:42 - it's running a machine learning model
111:44 - that makes a prediction about your hand
111:46 - and draws something in real time at like
111:49 - 60 frames per second like this is insane
111:51 - the world we live in and by the way
111:54 - foreign
111:55 - now here's an exercise for you can you
111:57 - make it so that it shows two of them
111:59 - could you make it so that I can throw
112:02 - one so many possibilities here so just
112:04 - to be clear this is using a hand pose
112:06 - model
112:09 - um and the Hand pose model uh gets all
112:12 - of these points for both hands look at
112:14 - that that's amazing
112:16 - um but that simple example shows you a
112:18 - little bit more easily I do it so this
112:19 - is coming soon
112:22 - um there's an example that shows how to
112:23 - do it with a single image
112:26 - um I think that's bomani's hand Bomani
112:28 - uh did a ton of work on the ml5 project
112:31 - for many for a number of years uh thank
112:33 - you to Bomani and more examples now
112:36 - um
112:38 - I can't remember if the post post
112:40 - detection is a new model I I don't have
112:42 - time to get into everything about this
112:45 - um okay
112:48 - so now what do I want to do okay so
112:51 - here's something else I gotta do I'm
112:52 - gonna hit Ctrl C here and I'm gonna say
112:55 - git fetch because my uh neural network
112:59 - examples that I was demonstrating to you
113:03 - as part of the nature of code are part
113:06 - of ml5 but they're in a different branch
113:07 - so I think if I type git branch
113:12 - come on isn't that going to fetch me all
113:14 - the branches
113:15 - do I have to say like verbose or
113:17 - something
113:19 - no
113:20 - anyway well let me look on the ml5 uh
113:24 - pull requests
113:26 - it's this pull request the neuro
113:28 - Evolution one that I'm working on that's
113:30 - the branch name
113:35 - okay I don't know why get fetched didn't
113:37 - bring all the brands in somebody can
113:38 - probably tell me but it switched me to
113:41 - the neuro Evolution branch
113:43 - and I can pull down all of the code for
113:47 - that uh maybe because I already fetched
113:49 - it was up to date I have no idea but now
113:51 - I'm going to run yarn start again
113:54 - I'm rebuilding the library but from the
113:58 - branch and what is the branch well my
114:00 - GitHub video series actually does go
114:02 - through that but it's essentially my
114:04 - like parallel track version of the
114:06 - library that I'm working on and when I'm
114:08 - finished it's happening it's a branch
114:10 - because it's like here's the ml5 project
114:13 - and it's going that way and I'm going to
114:15 - Branch off for a little while to work on
114:16 - my own neural Evolution examples and
114:18 - when I'm done I'm going to merge that
114:20 - Branch back in into the ml5 project but
114:23 - now we should see yes
114:25 - we should see more neuro-evolution
114:28 - examples
114:29 - like the neural Evolution steering
114:32 - example
114:34 - and let's just run this one for a little
114:36 - bit what you'll see here is the
114:40 - um a neural network is learning to
114:44 - calculate a steering Force to follow
114:47 - this dot that's moving with a purlin
114:49 - noise random walk so this slider just
114:52 - speeds up time so that I can run through
114:54 - many many many generations you know I've
114:56 - done 22 Generations now if I slow it
114:58 - back down you know you can see that the
115:01 - most of the agents are much better at
115:03 - following the dot now one of the things
115:05 - you might be wondering here is like
115:07 - about it looks like they're kind of
115:08 - doing a bad job
115:10 - and to some extent they are
115:12 - um you know it might get better over
115:13 - time I'm sure I could tweak different
115:15 - properties and parameters to improve it
115:17 - but my goal with these examples is not
115:20 - actually to have these agents do a
115:24 - perfect job of following this dot I want
115:27 - them to appear lifelike and have this
115:30 - sort of like improvisational sort of
115:33 - quality to how they move and feel really
115:35 - alive so
115:37 - um
115:38 - so that's uh that's kind of the goal of
115:41 - these examples and you'll see here the
115:43 - neuro Evolution steering example during
115:46 - the um which sensors example which is
115:49 - the one that I was going over
115:50 - um this has some more uh it's a little
115:53 - bit further along than nature of code
115:54 - one has a restart button
115:56 - um so if it runs out you can restart
116:00 - let's see if we can let's see if we can
116:02 - get some good ones going
116:05 - we can get lucky
116:08 - yeah
116:10 - so this one by the way you'll see
116:12 - doesn't have Generations because in this
116:14 - one so one of the things that I mean
116:16 - this again merits a longer discussion
116:17 - and I'm running out of time here what
116:20 - two minutes left uh but I'll probably
116:22 - run a little bit over as I always do
116:25 - um
116:27 - in all of my other evolutionary examples
116:30 - the entire population lives for a fixed
116:34 - period of time and then I start over a
116:37 - new
116:39 - what this one is doing is ah
116:46 - welcome toothless XD you have
116:49 - successfully interrupted Vicky Mid
116:52 - thought mid-stream talking about this
116:54 - coding example and join the coding
116:57 - welcome aboard thank you support
117:02 - [Music]
117:05 - the farm goes on
117:07 - oh great thank you uh thank you gray DHD
117:13 - um
117:13 - um thank you for the really kind
117:15 - comments that is very sweet
117:17 - um and I really appreciate the support
117:20 - um okay so uh what's Happening Here is
117:25 - these agents
117:27 - die out slowly over time unless they're
117:30 - able to eat the food if they eat the
117:33 - food it boosts their health back up
117:34 - which you can see based on their size
117:38 - so as they die they fade out and get
117:40 - smaller
117:41 - and so
117:43 - um and then every moment in time there's
117:46 - a chance they have to reproduce now I
117:49 - could do something where as they come
117:50 - into contact with each other
117:52 - they reproduce and make a little baby
117:55 - creature
117:56 - and oh that should be the exercise and
117:58 - they could even like sense each other
118:00 - and that that could be part of their
118:02 - what they have to learn to do both eat
118:04 - the food and
118:05 - and bait but that's not what's happening
118:07 - right now they just they're just like a
118:08 - probability factor a very low
118:10 - probability that they'll clone
118:11 - themselves with some mutations and one
118:14 - of the things that I'm really trying to
118:15 - do with this is figure out
118:20 - um how to find strike a balance so I'm
118:23 - going to hit restart I hate just I'm
118:24 - gonna hit restart and you know the
118:29 - amount of food is fixed whenever they
118:31 - finish and and here they die out so in a
118:34 - lot of cases like they just don't
118:36 - randomly
118:38 - mutate their neurons and find enough
118:40 - food and they all die out but after I
118:43 - run this a few times
118:45 - you know I will often find that one or
118:48 - two of them start to really do well at
118:51 - finding the food and then reproduce
118:52 - themselves a bunch of times and then we
118:55 - get the situation of overpopulation
118:58 - but at some point there's a limited
119:00 - amount of food so that overpopulation
119:02 - should balance itself out so that's one
119:04 - of the things I'm really interested in
119:05 - it's not something that I've captured
119:07 - perfectly and Jason Stevens I have to
119:10 - reply to your email
119:15 - I was thrilled to receive your email
119:18 - Jason Stevens well the ITP alums are
119:22 - showing out in full force today Jason
119:24 - Stevens also a former student in an
119:26 - earlier incarnation of nature of code a
119:29 - wonderful artist in his own right please
119:32 - check out their work and uh thanks so
119:35 - it's actually I'm sorry I haven't
119:36 - replied your email I'm I'm not good at
119:38 - that but I am I'm good at but but I I it
119:42 - was really cool to I read the whole
119:44 - thing I just didn't I should just
119:45 - replies that I read the whole thing it's
119:46 - so cool I'll say more later
119:49 - um but I'm doing it now
119:50 - um okay but you can see how the
119:52 - population has exploded
119:55 - um and it's kind of running pretty slow
119:58 - but it won't explode much more than this
120:00 - because at a certain point there's a
120:01 - limited amount of resources what I was
120:03 - saying is I want you
120:06 - the viewer of this channel the person
120:09 - learning to you know if you if you feel
120:12 - so inclined read the entire nature of
120:14 - code books you don't have to you read
120:16 - the parts of it that you're interested
120:16 - in whatever I want you to try to make
120:19 - your own version of this and think about
120:21 - how to you know basically code the
120:24 - universe
120:25 - into this you know uh so what can you do
120:29 - to expand beyond what I'm doing here I
120:30 - would love that that makes me that would
120:32 - I'd be so excited to see that okay
120:35 - all right ml5 that's all I got to say
120:37 - about elma5 stay tuned for more about
120:39 - that
120:41 - all right let me run through some quick
120:43 - things in the fall I will be teaching at
120:46 - NYU ITP uh programming from A to Z
120:50 - uh let's see that is the class I am
120:53 - teaching
120:54 - if you want to follow along a bit there
120:57 - should be a new if it's not I haven't
120:59 - done any work on this at all
121:03 - um other than post it
121:06 - uh there should be
121:09 - this is so unnecessary for me to show I
121:11 - should have just mentioned this anyway
121:13 - there's there's a syllabus that I'm
121:14 - working on for this class one of the
121:16 - main things about this class there is
121:17 - another new member
121:19 - there's another new member I think that
121:20 - just joined that I missed the Little Dot
121:23 - a little Little Dot
121:25 - Thank you new member with a little dot
121:27 - I'll look and figure out who that is
121:28 - later it's yes a course about
121:30 - programming with text not a beginner
121:32 - course
121:34 - um I should maybe that was a bad name
121:35 - for it but um
121:38 - Discord bot examples are going to get
121:40 - updated and if I can get my act together
121:42 - this fall I will be recording new
121:44 - Discord bot tutorials so stay tuned for
121:47 - that
121:48 - the Oregon Trail project
121:54 - let's see if I can get this to come up
121:56 - I spelled Oregon wrong sorry for that
122:01 - GitHub
122:03 - it's on GitHub
122:05 - oh there it is it probably was the first
122:07 - one I just
122:09 - um
122:09 - this is a project I still really want to
122:11 - do
122:11 - uh and I noticed that there was a pull
122:14 - request oh wait
122:16 - is there another repo for this because I
122:18 - got some pull request notifications
122:21 - very recently
122:23 - and I don't see them here did they get
122:26 - merged two days ago oh it was closed I
122:29 - don't know I'm confused but I saw some
122:32 - oh maybe this was an issue that was open
122:34 - yeah this was anyway I still want to
122:36 - work on this I haven't had any time to
122:38 - get back to it I don't know when I will
122:39 - uh if anybody wants to help maintain
122:43 - this repo and push it Forward uh
122:47 - file an issue and and raise your hand
122:49 - but uh I don't imagine that that
122:52 - interests anybody as much as it does me
122:53 - okay so I wanted to mention that
122:56 - come back to processing okay uh so I
123:00 - don't know how to give you a sneak peek
123:01 - of this hold on I will I'm gonna give
123:03 - you a sneak peek
123:04 - let me just go back to here I'm going
123:05 - back into my Discord
123:13 - generate dot Collective
123:19 - generate.collective thank you you have
123:21 - climbed aboard the coding train and you
123:24 - will be receiving you will be seeing
123:30 - where did I share this I shared it in
123:33 - the oh I showed it in the main Discord
123:36 - okay hold on
123:40 - [Music]
123:42 - where's sorry I'm trying to get to my
123:44 - Discord uh
123:48 - oh Jack I see your message in Discord
123:51 - let's try to figure out a way to get you
123:53 - the book
123:54 - um Jack is writing that in Iran there's
123:56 - no way to buy the book
123:57 - there's no access to global payment and
123:59 - shipping uh let's sidebar when I'm done
124:02 - with the book sidebar is that a word my
124:05 - brain's melted let's
124:07 - wait till I'm done with the book but
124:09 - then get in touch with me I will I would
124:11 - love to send you one myself if I can if
124:13 - it comes to that let's see if we can
124:14 - figure that out
124:15 - uh no one should be locked out of the
124:17 - nature of code if they want so uh if
124:20 - you're not in the Discord this is what
124:22 - you're missing
124:24 - me
124:25 - uh so this is a screenshot of the video
124:28 - series that is coming out uh it's about
124:31 - five hours of material there's the table
124:32 - of contents it is a celebration of the
124:35 - new processing four that um I know that
124:38 - Ben fry and Sam pottinger and lots of
124:40 - other people Rafael De Corville have put
124:42 - in a lot of time and effort
124:44 - um two
124:45 - um and so I wanted to when that all that
124:48 - work has been happening over the last
124:49 - year I'm way behind I wanted to have
124:51 - this out when processing four was
124:52 - released clearly that didn't happen but
124:54 - this new set of tutorials so if you're a
124:56 - teacher of beginners
124:58 - um who uh is using processing for your
125:01 - curriculum or in any context this will
125:03 - be this will replace
125:06 - what is currently
125:09 - um
125:11 - on
125:13 - sorry hold on
125:18 - uh on YouTube
125:21 - here so these are the video the versions
125:24 - of I basically made new versions of all
125:26 - these videos that I made like over 10
125:28 - years ago as you can see by the change
125:31 - in hair color but otherwise I'm kind of
125:33 - the same
125:38 - maybe in 10 years can we do another one
125:41 - of these or I'm like over here I'm sure
125:44 - someone could use some generative AI to
125:45 - age me and just keep making that then
125:47 - you can go back backwards Benjamin
125:49 - Button style okay
125:51 - um
125:52 - so I wanted to mention that's coming out
125:54 - ah but that will be just so you know my
125:57 - plan is
125:59 - Go
126:00 - nebula.tv slash coding train
126:04 - my plan is to first publish those videos
126:09 - on the nebula streaming platform
126:12 - so
126:15 - um
126:16 - there's a few reasons for that one is
126:19 - it's a good way for me to promote nebula
126:21 - and generate some revenue for the
126:23 - channel by having people sign up for
126:25 - nebula as part of the launch of that new
126:27 - series
126:28 - also when I upload something to YouTube
126:30 - I can't ever make any changes
126:34 - so nebula is a platform that I am part
126:37 - of the Creator the Creator community
126:39 - that owns and operates uh nebula and uh
126:43 - I don't I'm not gonna redo the video in
126:46 - any significant way but if you know it's
126:48 - five hours of material I think they're
126:49 - going to be small mistakes and things in
126:50 - it so if I upload it to nebula and
126:52 - people are watching and learning from
126:53 - there and I find little mistakes and
126:55 - things I can correct those and replace
126:57 - the video file on negla so I want to
126:59 - have like a few weeks to be able to do
127:01 - that and then upload it to YouTube now
127:04 - nebula is a paywall
127:06 - um you won't be able to see so you could
127:08 - sign up now if you want but I'll be
127:09 - promoting this when the video is ready
127:12 - um
127:13 - I also by the way have some exclusive
127:15 - content like this other course about
127:17 - coding with the Apple II and you know
127:19 - there's so much wonderful other stuff on
127:22 - nebula so
127:24 - um but uh what was I gonna say uh
127:28 - if you are a teacher and you want to be
127:33 - able to use this video series with your
127:35 - students this fall
127:36 - uh and you know it's not there's no way
127:39 - for you to like have your students like
127:40 - buy you know I'm not asking to tell your
127:42 - students to buy nebula that would be uh
127:44 - that wouldn't be appropriate I don't
127:46 - think so
127:48 - um get in touch with me maybe help at
127:50 - thecodingtrain.com because I'm also
127:52 - happy to allow preview access of the
127:56 - video series to uh students in different
128:00 - contexts but but you know it won't be
128:01 - that long the whole thing's going to be
128:02 - on YouTube and available uh for free
128:04 - okay
128:07 - um
128:09 - so that's that's what I wanted to say
128:12 - about that
128:13 - um so I'm gonna hit I'm gonna check that
128:15 - off ah let me mention something
128:19 - um just because I was on a podcast
128:20 - recently so I'd like to plug it
128:22 - let me see uh post show Recaps
128:26 - dot com slash strike I think
128:30 - well that's just the RSS feed so this is
128:32 - the RSS feed
128:35 - that's really helpful uh let's just go
128:37 - to postshowrecaps.com
128:42 - um so post your Recaps is a um
128:45 - podcast network of
128:47 - uh
128:48 - uh podcast about television and
128:51 - different things
128:52 - and they cover all sorts of different
128:54 - shows I'm just like a fan and a listener
128:56 - and you probably you may remember me
128:59 - from the podcast about Severance but I
129:02 - was a guest on it a couple times that I
129:03 - made all these different uh projects
129:06 - related to the Apple TV Plus show uh
129:08 - Severance but they are also doing a
129:10 - podcast series about let's see
129:14 - uh the current
129:16 - writers strike well the entertainment uh
129:21 - strike stag after a strike the WJ strike
129:23 - I'm just looking for a page that has
129:25 - called strike up
129:27 - strike up something
129:29 - [Music]
129:30 - strike up the podcast
129:32 - break up the conversation there it is so
129:34 - there's a feed for strike up the
129:36 - conversation which is poached
129:37 - showrecaps.com strike but um I was the
129:41 - guest
129:42 - and I guess if I keep going down through
129:45 - this you'll see on we talked about sort
129:48 - of generative AI with the host Dr Amanda
129:50 - who is doing an incredible job so I'm
129:53 - plugging this because I was on it but
129:54 - not really for you to listen to the
129:55 - episode with me uh I don't know if I
129:58 - said anything that useful or interesting
129:59 - about AI mostly because I because I was
130:02 - when I was asked to be on the podcast I
130:03 - started listening to the previous
130:04 - episodes and they're really incredible
130:06 - and interesting with great guests uh
130:08 - Michael chernus is one that I'll
130:10 - highlight let's see if I can find it
130:12 - um who is a an actor who is in I think
130:15 - uh Spider-Man movies and this and
130:18 - Severance and really talked about the
130:21 - rate it must be a way for me to filter
130:22 - this by only I think a terrible job
130:25 - um so
130:27 - but you can also go to uh twitter.com
130:30 - does twitter.com still work
130:34 - uh Dr Amanda R I think
130:37 - um is Dr Amanda's social media where
130:41 - um you will find Oh weird Twitter does
130:44 - this thing if you're not logged in it
130:46 - doesn't show you their actual tweets
130:48 - it's showing me other stuff anyway
130:53 - okay just really ruined I mean not that
130:55 - Twitter was that great to begin with to
130:57 - be perfectly honest it had a lot of
130:58 - problems but it's a lot worse now
131:02 - anyway so if you listen to that
131:05 - let me know I'd be curious to hear I I
131:07 - said how I did I can't listen I watch my
131:10 - videos back sometimes because I have to
131:11 - but a podcast stuff I can't listen back
131:13 - to I don't know why okay so I wanted to
131:15 - make that and then future plans so let's
131:18 - finish today first of all questions
131:20 - don't forget the time yes 12 15. it's
131:23 - okay I'm barely let me just check my
131:24 - phone make sure there's no like
131:27 - you know the kitchen is on fire kind of
131:30 - messages
131:31 - I mean I think I would have heard about
131:32 - that through other
131:34 - ways time to revive the Mastodon server
131:36 - yeah
131:38 - um
131:40 - so boy I'm tired so let's talk about
131:43 - future plans I have this running list
131:45 - that uh dipomsem started uh at least
131:49 - it's still 2023 Simon likes I don't know
131:51 - if Simon's still watching but Simon
131:53 - likes to point out how I make these
131:54 - lists and never follow up on them but
131:56 - we're gonna check some things off
131:58 - so I did get to these challenges I gotta
132:02 - do this is next
132:03 - on my list I'm hoping to get to this
132:07 - um
132:09 - let's do this I am doing a live stream
132:12 - more nature of code
132:14 - uh okay I can't check this off yet but
132:17 - this still get a check once it's
132:19 - published it'll get a check
132:22 - uh I made a new video about the coding
132:24 - Train website
132:26 - I want to work on the
132:28 - software for the severance TV show it's
132:30 - called MDR macro data refinement
132:32 - uh uh in the Oregon Trail
132:35 - that's it I'm only checking off one more
132:37 - thing almost checking this off so this
132:39 - is my running list is there anything
132:41 - else I want to add to this
132:43 - so what's what do I need to do next
132:48 - so first of all there won't be another
132:50 - live stream until at least
132:54 - kind of two weeks from now I have a very
132:57 - busy first next week is the first is
132:59 - orientation NYU then I have the first
133:00 - week of teaching so the next two weeks
133:02 - uh are completely packed for me so I
133:05 - wanted to make sure I'm really progress
133:07 - the last minute here today was really
133:09 - like the last day I could do a live
133:11 - stream before I start the fall semester
133:12 - so that's why I'm here today
133:14 - over the next two weeks before I do a
133:16 - next live stream I want to finish the
133:19 - nature keep working finish the nature
133:20 - code book and finish and hopefully have
133:22 - at least released on nebula the learning
133:24 - processing series
133:26 - those are the two priorities for me
133:28 - right now then I want to get back to
133:30 - this and I guess I should star some
133:33 - things
133:35 - because let's start what I want to do
133:37 - next
133:39 - so Discord bot
133:42 - tutorials I've got to start because I
133:45 - really want to do those next
133:47 - any P5 yes tutorials I want to do next
133:50 - because I'm teaching intro to P5 this
133:52 - fall
133:53 - and the processing
133:55 - intro series will be done I guess I
133:56 - could put a star there because I need to
133:58 - work on those
133:59 - nature of code book
134:01 - I could put ml5 there but I can only
134:03 - star so many things and then I want to
134:06 - make sure I'm continuing to do coding
134:07 - challenges so Wolfram Elementary CA and
134:11 - I think what I'm doing now just so you
134:12 - know is I'm I'm not doing the cutting
134:14 - challenges during my live streams
134:17 - but I do broadcast the recording
134:19 - sessions for them so that's one reason
134:21 - why you might want to sign up for any of
134:23 - the membership things
134:24 - um uh I will be posting about those in
134:27 - Discord okay I think that's it
134:30 - starting those things updating the gist
134:32 - uh that's it I have this song that I
134:35 - used forever as my like outro song
134:38 - [Music]
134:40 - um so
134:42 - uh I'm gonna let that play for about two
134:45 - minutes
134:46 - if you have questions post them in the
134:48 - chat or comments post them P5 geometry I
134:51 - know what that refers to
134:53 - uh but it's probably something that I
134:55 - want to take a look at so we can add
134:57 - that to the Future that future goals for
134:59 - sure
135:01 - um so yeah sorry I've run out of steam
135:03 - here
135:05 - I've been doing this for
135:07 - 14
135:08 - 623 seconds
135:10 - this is my
135:15 - wow I really can't operate my favorite
135:16 - time it's launched time since my first
135:19 - live stream back after turning 50 slash
135:22 - first live stream where I talk about the
135:23 - draft miniature code
135:26 - um
135:29 - we need you in Python
135:32 - maybe someday I mean it would be fun to
135:34 - do like a series like maybe I could just
135:37 - do this as a live stream of like kind of
135:39 - like uh
135:40 - non-python I mean this would be like a
135:42 - good click bait sort of thing like
135:43 - JavaScript programmer learns python or
135:46 - something like that I could do that as a
135:47 - one-off I like that idea
135:49 - foreign
135:51 - [Music]
135:56 - thanks everybody for tuning in this is I
135:58 - really feel glad I mean one thing that's
136:00 - looking at my analytics like people
136:02 - still watch the coding screen no I
136:03 - haven't published anything new
136:05 - I think since at least May can't
136:06 - remember when maybe the website video
136:08 - came out after then let's look
136:17 - still a minute left on my summer
136:20 - oh I forgot YouTube changed something oh
136:22 - no there's no.com
136:26 - oh by the way
136:28 - logo Rebrand for the coding train there
136:31 - it is
136:32 - we'll stuck that in there
136:34 - you'll see it's here too little little
136:36 - catchphrase traveling with a world of
136:38 - code
136:39 - artisanal handcrafted code that's my new
136:43 - country
136:44 - oh yeah I gotta talk to Jason about that
136:46 - okay uh but if you have ideas for a
136:48 - catchphrase or thoughts about this logo
136:50 - let me know
136:52 - um last thing or two months ago so you
136:55 - can see the
136:57 - uh the last video was two months ago
137:00 - before that was four months ago the last
137:02 - live was three months ago there's very
137:04 - little stuff if you look at my Analytics
137:08 - I'm it's like less than half of what it
137:12 - usually is it's going way way way way
137:14 - way down so I really uh it goes to show
137:16 - that you really need to keep fresh and
137:18 - new content online but people are still
137:20 - watching
137:21 - um the videos so I'm pleased here with
137:23 - that okay if you ever want to post a
137:25 - video about more
137:26 - um
137:27 - so I saw on my song ran out but I'm
137:30 - gonna look Boutique code if you will
137:32 - um
137:33 - geometry coding challenges open
137:35 - Frameworks Arduino gaming okay so the
137:38 - bunch of there's a bunch of questions
137:40 - I'll answer
137:41 - um Arduino open Frameworks all things I
137:43 - would love to do on the channel
137:45 - I just I have this list of things to get
137:46 - to I don't know how to prioritize or
137:49 - whatever but absolutely those are things
137:51 - I would love to do
137:52 - probably not going to happen soon
137:54 - because I just other things I want to
137:55 - get to
137:57 - um
137:58 - do you ever want to post a video about
137:59 - more advanced stuff Ray tracing sounds
138:01 - is a different yeah so I would like to
138:04 - do in the if you look at my coding
138:06 - challenges there is a fairly wide
138:09 - variety of things some of which are
138:11 - quite
138:13 - uh quick and easy
138:16 - well I'm looking at some more
138:17 - sophisticated like the prime spiral I
138:19 - would sort of maybe categorize as fairly
138:21 - beginner friendly it's you know very
138:24 - little code uh just to look at
138:26 - calculating prime numbers and draw this
138:28 - spiral pattern with them a note where
138:30 - they appear on the number line in a
138:31 - spiral whereas the wave function
138:34 - collapse algorithm is very sophisticated
138:37 - and involved in this video it's close to
138:39 - an hour long uh the Mandel bulb is quite
138:43 - uh elaborate sophisticated
138:44 - three-dimensional fractal this video is
138:48 - you know pretty long so I like to do a
138:51 - balance
138:53 - um so it would be great and thank you
138:55 - Bruno for your nice comments
138:58 - 666 sorry you missed the start as soon
139:00 - as I hit stop this will be available in
139:03 - the archive so I'm gonna go uh thanks
139:05 - everyone for tuning in I'm just checking
139:06 - the Discord chat thanks Alka thanks
139:09 - everybody for watching thank you to all
139:11 - of you the new people who joined the
139:12 - membership today those of you who just
139:14 - watched if you share things from the
139:17 - coding train on social media if you
139:18 - contribute to the passenger showcase if
139:21 - you read the nature of code all those
139:23 - things uh support the work that I'm
139:25 - doing and I really really appreciate it
139:27 - so you won't see me for at least another
139:28 - two weeks this is what I was going to
139:30 - mention
139:31 - the days my teaching schedule is
139:35 - Wednesday Thursday Friday
139:36 - Tuesday I probably need to be doing a
139:38 - lot of prep so this fall Monday is
139:41 - probably my coding Train Day or a
139:43 - weekend live stream but I think Monday
139:45 - is going to be better so I hope to do
139:47 - either every week what I would like to
139:50 - do is every week you know assuming the
139:51 - nature of code book is done
139:53 - so that really has to happen first so
139:55 - there might not be anything to lock
139:57 - first because that's my deadline for
139:58 - that but as soon as the nature of code
140:00 - book is done I would like to spend every
140:02 - Monday either live streaming or
140:04 - recording more video tutorials like
140:06 - Discord bot or coding challenges so hold
140:09 - me to that friends in the Discord and
140:13 - um hold me to also the fact that the
140:15 - member sticker mailing should go out end
140:17 - of September early October those are
140:19 - things that I am really hoping to do and
140:21 - ask me about those remind me about those
140:23 - but be aware that I am still I didn't
140:26 - allow myself to live stream until I had
140:29 - a full draft in the nature of code book
140:31 - which I now have I think I probably
140:34 - shouldn't allow myself to live stream
140:35 - until I have turned in the finished
140:39 - shaft to the publisher and the deadline
140:41 - for that is October 1st okay goodbye
140:44 - everybody
140:45 - uh hope to see you again soon on social
140:48 - media
140:50 - Discord YouTube all the places the
140:54 - streets of New York City
140:55 - the Wilderness of the Hudson Valley I
140:58 - don't have any travel plans anytime
140:59 - otherwise so those are the places I'll
141:01 - be
141:02 - uh goodbye
141:05 - and goodbye as always I always forget
141:07 - that this dot this stock I don't have a
141:09 - new out animation

Cleaned transcript:

thank you thank you foreign foreign foreign golly I hope it's working because the timer says 20 seconds left thank you thank you foreign here we are back on the coding train it is B I'm back baby doing this a lot like streaming and then not for several months and then having a big thing where I'm packed so don't get too excited because I might just do this again a couple of months ah so nice to see all of you I mean I don't really get to see all of you but I feel your presence there uh if this is your first time tuning in oh my goodness welcome hi my name is Dan and you are watching the coding drain the coding train is a YouTube channel it's as if I have a script in front of me and yet I don't I just have a view of myself um uh new glasses by the way I don't know if anyone noticed that I'm wearing new glasses uh I have a new prescription new progressive lenses I've gotten quite a bit older since the last time you saw me and my vision is really um I'm really struggling actually I think that I might need a specific set of glasses for using the computer I'm sure this is what everyone is interested in hearing about uh let me see if I'm just looking over this way because I've got my monitor to the left I'm just looking at the chat to see that everybody is there yep um I have the um supporter member whatever you want to call it Discord chat right over here to my right so um I see Simon is typing dot dot dot Simon writes it is indeed a channel on the YouTube website on the internet that is correct all right so what is the coding training what is happening today what is happening for the coding train in the future I saw a few people in the chat just say uh I just stopped in to say hello thank you hello um should we try a different pair of glasses we've got a few different pairs here let's try this pair there's the same prescription I just I just got two two new pairs this is the sort of new style this is more like my old glasses this is one this is two oh should we put a poll how do I how do I do a poll why do I have got to come over here uh to this computer uh let's see start a poll uh one or two one or two ask your community okay the poll is now running oh I can't see the chat this is one this is like you everybody this is the I coding train welcome to the eye doctor this is one this is two now again this looks these aren't my um old glasses they're different but they look much more like my old ones I think I see better with these the same prescription just different uh different glasses maker this is one and this is two okay I think I'm seeing better with two right now so looks like one is kind of winning though in the poll one is up up to 52 percent um all right don't you have bifocals bifocals uh asks uh fishy uh bifocals I have progressives yes and so what progressives do if you don't know again this is clearly what everyone is tuning in for Welcome to the coding drain is when I look at that through the top of my glasses it's for distance and when I look through the bottom it progresses the lens progresses down for reading if I don't have progressives I cannot read at all however the computer to me is in the middle of those distances it's kind of like not far it's not close like reading and so I feel like with my progressives having trouble like seeing the computer I can pull it up here so you see what I'm looking at let's make sure everything's working yes oh no no no no we don't that's like the oldest do not go to that link sponsor link that was I mean you could go there sorry I don't I don't mean don't but it's just not not no official connection anymore right now during this stream I hate by the way when I have to make myself smaller that my hands get cut off if I uh could redesign the studio I would try to have like a really wide shot that is actually what you're seeing not just the camera shot trunk down all right uh two is winning now boy it's really close though uh the new style one is subtler uh I prefer to stare over the top of my glasses in a judgy manner yes all right um I made a list of things that I want to talk about today today is mostly going to be a update and hang out with the community Stream So if you were here for a specific coding tutorial that's not necessarily going to happen it's not going to happen however I will be updating you just to get this out of the way real quick on things like the nature of code book where I will show some new examples and talk about them so there is some learning that I have planned uh I will also be talking about uh the ml5.js library um and some updates about that oh I want to talk about um processing four and my uh updated tutorial series about that making a note I want to look at the coding Train website and some new things that have appeared uh and look at through some pull requests merge them look at some showcase projects ah I want to talk about the memberships let me just let me also get another thing out of the way here and by the way um if Simon says I feel you've already redesigned the studio enough I know that's why I'm not going to just saying I could um one they're gonna show it again yes the poll is still there this is one I actually prefer this style I think but right now these glasses are like a little smudged so it's a little blurry for me this is one and this is two let's go with one but let's see if we can clean them I have I have some of those like lens cleaners somewhere in here but I'm just going to use my tshirt also how do I look just without glasses by the way I cannot wink with this eye my kids like to make fun of me because I I cannot like this is me trying to wink with my right eye oh it's been a long summer oh I'm so happy to be back here live streaming I mean to be honest I'm kind of tired I got I'm old I'm tired I don't know what I'm doing with my life um but I I think that one of the things that brings me tremendous Joy is sharing my love and enthusiasm for what I like to Now call artisanal handcrafted code with the world through YouTube so let's do that okay what was I saying ah so I want to say something right off the bat which is that um I still can't tell the difference that's Walter um uh thank you to everyone who supports the coding train and especially now given that you haven't seen anything new from me since may I think like the entire summer and so um so one uh if that's not what you're happy if you're not happy about that please it's fine like you don't need to support the coding train I'm doing my thing but you know if you want something different this is not what I meant to say what I meant to say is I've actually been working very hard I've also been taking some time and kind of regrouping and lots of other stuff going on but I have been working quite a bit on two projects that have no uh that don't have a lot of visible progress so those of you who are supporting the coding Train by watching old videos sharing videos on social media some of you have signed up through YouTube membership or GitHub sponsorship maybe some of you signed up to nebula which is a streaming service for creators that I am a part of all of those things I just appreciate so much especially during this time where I'm not actively publishing new things that support is really making it possible for me to have spent a lot of the summer working on these two larger projects that I'll talk about today one is the nature of code book lots of updates about that all good news I I feel like I didn't want I didn't want to have a stream until I could really confidently say that I have made significant progress with the book which is a lot of ways let me stream this week no I don't really have a lot to say I haven't really gotten over this hump yet and then this uh which and then another the nature of code many of you might be familiar with although certainly I hope there's viewers are never even heard of the project today because then I get to show you about it show about it to you and then also um I have been working on a reboot of my intro decoding series with processing it's a little over five hours of material so uh and the reason why I mean in olden times my previous practice has been as I'm working on it publish new parts of it so if it's five hours of video uh maybe that's every video is 15 minutes that's five times four that's 20 videos maybe I'm publishing one or two per week as I'm finishing them up so this time I am going to publish it as one five hour long video on YouTube with time codes and annotations we'll see how that goes but that's why it's been uh that's why there's been kind of a dearth uh of stuff also like I'm just kind of I don't know like I don't know how I used to do I don't know how I used to do it all teach Family Travel coding train it's I've been struggling um just kind of balancing and juggling things and project management I'm not very good at it um so I hope um that maybe this fall can be a bit of a reset button nature of code project can be completed the learning processing five hour video could be completed I can go back to some of these other things on my list all right um all right also the Apple episodes was a bit of a Direction but that was quite a while ago now looks like glasses two is at 52 percent um all right I'm seeing some nice comments in the chat the project management yes uh ah let's do something fun this is totally random but um this is sitting in front of me so um uh let me switch to it's gonna be a live unboxing of a project called time since launch this is a completely spontaneous right now because I just saw it this is not planned but um okay so I'm gonna I'm gonna tell you about this uh artwork that I have uh purchased so first of all let me shout out some friends of mine I mean I don't know it's okay if they don't want to be friends with me I just some some some people in an organization that I really admire which is uh sfpc uh let's see school let's see if we find it uh the school for poetic computation ah no this is the new website sorry about that so no official anything here I'm just oh you can't see it so let me go back to it wrong wrong button all right so school for provided computation is an experimental School in New York City supporting interdisciplinary study and art code hardware and critical theory it's a place for Learning and unlearning so first of all I teach at a behemoth of a essentially corporate University NYU uh there are many wonderful things about my job uh first and foremost would be the students um I think that probably the uh worst thing about my job is the cost of tuition and you know we could get into I I could be here all day talking about all the things in between and so I really admire and want to support organizations that are experimenting um in educational practices outside of the sort of corporate Behemoth universities like NYU and um you know there's obviously a lot more to schools around the world there's State schools in the U.S public universities there are schools around the world that are have different funding models and uh um but you know I I have this wonderful job that I am very grateful for that I really enjoy but I also um have conflicted feelings about it that's not what I wanted to talk about today the reason I have this is because sfbc did a fundraiser uh where there were different things you could buy there was a coding train uh train whistle in the shop I don't know if you happen to be watching uh uh and happen to have purchased it if so say hi in the chat and one of the things that I got is an artwork from some friends of mine and also alums of the program where I teach uh cwm let me see if I want to make sure I get the name right let's see if I can find their Studio uh uh here we go CW and T uh and this is their project time since launch which you could get your own I mean I got it through a fundraiser um and it is I'm going to read to you from the description time since launch is a single use long scale launch clock use it to Mark the beginning of your personal Epoch wow this feels very like a very big deal right now that I'm doing this time since launch counts up to one million days by one million random numbers book and I would pull this book out it's got the processing Community catalog on it too but it's holding up uh it's holding up my iPad that I could see the Discord chat and Joseph says nice I'm a fan of cwnt by the way um if you're writing something in the member supporter chat which I'll guess I'll talk about when I get to the membership program I might read it out loud so if you don't want me to for any reason um maybe don't put it there or just like say like please don't read this or something uh okay time since launch has marked thousands of moments around the world has been used to celebrate marriages business launches births graduations habit changes career changes or just to elevate an arbitrary Tuesday to awesome sets so this is more in the category of arbitrary Tuesday to awesome status I guess I could have used it for like um I should have used it so one thing is I I should have used it I recently turned 50. you know I'm not asking for any like birthday wishes but that felt like a big thing and a lot of you might be thinking geez you're old and yeah although you know in some circles that's young try being a faculty member at a large corporate University 50. I'm like spring chicken how that hurt okay um once launched there's no reset option use caution when taking time since launch out of the box be wary of letting your kids or friends fiddle with it prior to launch the batteries included last for 150 plus years backup capacitors temporarily keep time since launch counting during a battery change at launch your moment zero is forever burned into the electronics I'm feeling really anxious about this right now oh my God uh yeah by the way if you're in the YouTube chat you can write please don't read this but I'm going to read it so the YouTube chat you don't get to like uh I'm gonna if you're typing in the YouTube chat I might read it live I mean I I don't mean to be aggressive I mean isn't the most friendly loving way towards you I can't possibly manage like somebody putting a a private message in the public YouTube chat for this live stream that they don't want me to read loud most likely I'm not going to see your message to be honest I mean sometimes I go I mean I'm a weirdo who sometimes will go back and look at the chat from a live stream because I'm curious to see if I miss something interesting but for the most part while I'm live streaming I'm not able to follow the entire chat I wanted to have um right and it's 200 000 random numbers it's one million random digits well that's one million random numbers if the numbers are randomly zero through nine Simon okay if something goes wrong with your time since launch as long as the main chip is physically intact your Epoch can be restored okay storage all right there's a lot more information time since launch.com let's go to that I feel like what better time to launch this than since I I live streamed on the coding train um on an arbitrary Saturday there we go well how do you do that heart thing is that a heart okay wait do I I want to hit start oh no this is just like oh start oh I see you can make your own time since launch just on a website thingy order a physical cop right so I have the physical version so um I'm gonna unbox this now I have not opened this maybe I will switch back to this view so you can see it a little bit better I want to be very careful with this how does it open oh it's got like some very mechanically challenged I have some slight arthritis in this finger which makes it I have to by the way my kids are now like basically teenagers and it's an amazing thing that happens in life now as you get older and my kids are getting older I need need them to help me like open the jar you know it used to be me now Daddy Yankee please open this for me that's the little babies and that was a little bit weird that voice they didn't sound like that um okay so I took off these I'm gonna be very careful oh wow this is beautiful um I don't know that wow okay so I don't know how well you can see this with the green screen I'm gonna go over here to the Whiteboard oh dear that camera is off why did that happen turn this camera on it's possible that the battery I just thought that I might be able to give you a better closeup look at it uh through this camera there we go although I don't think this camera is on auto focus so it's going to be very blurry look at me trying to like highlight this beautiful I could change it to like auto focus but I stand back here you can sort of see this is probably giving you a really nice view of how beautiful this is made so and I don't know if you can see um there is a uh one of those like uh what seven segment displays here which I assume will show the counter once I get it started so single use so how do I start it let me come back here um come back here okay I could also one thing I could do is there's a well this camera is autofocus so I wonder if let me see if I walk around here I could also just show the raw view with the yeah uh there we go this should work pretty well um I mean the light is kind of shiny but now you're getting a nice view of it you can see the batteries it's absolutely beautifully constructed um I love it okay all right coming back around so now we have to figure out how to open this how to start it are there instructions single use help me I don't know let's see look at the box here single use are there instructions does anybody know I mean there's like this little sticker there so I assume I take that off it says single use do I take the top off do I turn this I'm going to take off this label that says single use I assume I'm supposed to take that off um are there instructions online let me go back to here uh let's go okay well I can get a wall mount for it I don't have a wall mount well this feels like oh pull the pin to initiate the timer got it pull the pin there it is look here's a little video okay everybody ready for this okay ready by the way I have uh if you're wondering what's going on here uh some of you might remember that I was in a bicycle accident a bunch of years ago and I have multiple surgeries on my elbow so in case you're wondering what's going on okay uh okay here we go oh drum roll good idea um I did it I'm so cool look it's counting can you see it by the way if bark this time down in history you were here for this moment so cool so I'm just going to consider that this is marking the time of my first live stream since turning 50. that'll make that like a thing it's um okay uh all right uh there we go or or Orion sending you were here Alka it's so nice to see you in the chat like old friends I mean a lot of you that I've never met in person um but I I consider you old friends of people who have been sort of following me and participating in live streams for many many years I will I will work on fixing this up later look at this pen it's like uh uh there I'm gonna put it back in um and I'm gonna just um I'm gonna put this if I put it here can you watch it during the Stream yeah so now you can oh so this will by the way this would be a nice they always have on during my like streams or videos maybe to Mark time okay so let's put this off to the side all right let's get back to some of the business at hand because um so I'm gonna be here uh um no longer than noon I would love to finish sooner it's my last weekend before the semester starts now you might be saying like you could have streamed all summer what's wrong with you I mean on the last weekend before school starts sorry I was working on these two big projects which I will talk about today um all right let's come back to here and let's start digging into some of these things um I think I can probably turn off the poll now um yeah oh Bartos is a young young man of 46. okay let's how do I end this poll end poll because all right so let me get the chat back up here sorry for my arm disappearing um uh okay um all right so we've covered the glasses um put this over here um all right so I haven't done anything on my list because I did a whole thing about the time since lunch uh so I'll put that on my list and check it off time since launch and then future plans so I'm checking one thing off my list okay so things that I have maybe let's start with the code um you know the title of this video says nature of code or this live stream so maybe I should start with that how do people feel about me just starting right off the bat with nature of code maybe that makes the most sense harshi I am so glad you are here too Hershey says so glad to be here and Simon Says classic Dan spends the first 30 minutes of the stream not talking about anything on the list by the way uh again I think I meant to say this if any of you are in the member chat on Discord which I have over here and you see a meaningful or interesting question in the YouTube chat that I maybe miss or don't see which will be most of them please copy paste it with the YouTube person's name into the Discord chat progress let's hear about it okay so first a little bit of History here let's start off here so this is if you I I I expect that if you search online for nature of code the first thing that's going to come up is this web page right here so this is uh the active live published version of the nature of code book the nature of code is a project I mean in some ways I would say I started it in two thousand two but uh so like 22 years ago or 21 years ago whatever the however the math is but um I didn't uh the first time I think that I ever called it the nature of code because I'm talking about my Learning Journey really started in 2002 but the first time I ever called it nature of code was 2008. um media's 2006 somewhere in there when I taught a class called nature of code and one of the things I I don't want to I'll be here all day if I go through everything but one of the things I would encourage you to read if you want the full story is this acknowledgment section which talks about um the class that I took in Spring 2003 like so maybe that's the date that I should have given um 20 years ago a class taught by James 2 called Dynamic bodies there's some other references and a little bit of the history in this acknowledgment so then in 2012 and by the way this link goes to Nowhere buy from create space where does it take you now yeah it CreateSpace is now Kindle Direct Amazon bought them so um uh in 2012 um the material that I had been accumulating over many years teaching this class I put into a book the book was selfpublished um it's still it's available right now I don't I don't suggest please don't buy it right now please wait but I mean if you can't help I mean you could buy it twice whatever you want but if you can't help it of course you could um is available um through I originally selfpublished it through a company called CreateSpace after a number of years Amazon acquired that company so essentially it's now it's selfpublished through Amazon which I do not love which is one of the reasons why I uh I'm making a big change with nature of code two it's not called nature of CO2 it's just nature of code again I don't know what to call it anyway um so in selfpublish and for free online so uh you can read it uh this is the um original version of the book The the examples are all uh processing code so you'll see this like Java syntax um if you don't know what processing is well boy do I have a whole video series for you that's about to come out but um and so uh probably I don't know anywhere in the last five to seven years it's like I'm gonna make a new version of the book so many people sent me good feedback um in particular this neural networks chapter I can't even like bear to read some of this stuff it's so out of date and weird and like not in line with the world of machine learning and neural networks today um so I was slowly inch by in updating the book over a many years and at some point I was like I gotta get it done and then I wasted another year and they're like I really had to get into it I wasted another year then I had a sabbatical and I'm like oh I'm really gonna get it done and I made some progress actually over the sabbatical quite a bit of progress but I didn't finish and so it's been a struggle to try to do coding train and work on this project in parallel and so this summer at a certain point without any Fanfare or announcements I just kind of made a mental decision like you know what no coding train I'm not allowed to make do any live streams make any videos until I have finished a final draft of the nature of code second so I don't want to call the second edition because I don't I know what to call it the new nature of code and so I'm here also I think we could use this to Mark the occasion I would have liked to have like maybe marked its publishing or something because I don't I'm not here to say it's done it's not done there's a lot of work left for me to do but what I am here to say to you is I have written an entire every single chapter now has a finished draft so there is an entire first draft and most of the chapters are essentially done but the reason why I say that is I'm still doing some editing and updating some examples there's some placeholder illustrations think just only thing left to do is go back and fill the gaps and fix things and edit so the announcement here today is that there is a full version that you can read online today of the new nature of code and if you're reading it online today you still have the opportunity to provide feedback and and help towards the final version that will go into the print version of the book now I have also another even more not anymore in parallel also exciting announcement where does this go goes here to make um ah Jesus Oh G suddenly is in the chat okay great so Jesus thank you Kathy uh who wrote us who transferred this comment over I remember your nature of code class in 2006. Jason first of all Jason wonderful student from IP uh that I've kept in touch with over the years I'm so thrilled that you're in the chat I didn't see your message but thank you Kathy for transferring that over do you recall it's two thousand when you took the class in 2006 was that the first time I taught it that would that would match my memory but I'd have to go back and look and see in NYU records if there was an earlier uh version of the class I definitely taught it very early on my first class I ever taught at NYU was um sorry I have this thing that I'm standing on because it helps my back it got old um and it just slid away and I was standing on the hard floor I'm Barefoot see wearing shorts suffer ah there we go okay oh that also hurt um what was I even talking about uh uh like the first class I ever taught at NYU was 2004. um so 2006 would be about right uh it was 2007. ah 2007. okay um okay anyway so let me show you the new draft uh so right now it is on uh well let me go to GitHub so if you're looking for where everything is oh I was going to talk about the print version sorry let me talk about the print version I'm thrilled to announce um that I am partnering with no starch press which is a wonderful um I do have a misspelling of my name though [Laughter] I guess I better let them know no C no C in Chipman I mean there are other people that would be a very a normal way to spell the name uh for whatever reason when uh my answers that's something sounds like that was a long time ago but not even more than like you know in the in the um when would the shipment to come through um I think in in the early 20th century like first of all I can't believe like talk about the 20th century like it was so long ago like I graduated from college in 20th century but anyway uh for whatever reason when um things got transcribed at Ellis Island uh no C was put in my version of shift man which means boat Man by the way uh from the German that's from what I understand anyway that's not what it's here I am here to tell you that the nature of code uh book The Print version will be available through no star address so first of all just to be very clear nothing has changed in terms of the licensing of the book it is still open source create a Commons noncommercial so that means it is a freely available the entire thing under the Creative Commons license the only restriction is you can't print and sell your own version of the book so a non you can't use it for commercial purposes I mean you can use the uh that doesn't go for the code examples and the concepts the code examples are uh MIT license or whatever kind of much more of license I would choose to use so that if you use one of the code examples in an artwork or a commercial project and a place where you're working that of course is allowed I just mean the content of the book is not something that you can resell um so um but I in order to one is um well first of all no starch is fantastic to work with it's I think the primary reason why I'm actually getting it done because they assigned an editor of the project they're doing technical review they've given me a deadline like all the LA the deadline actually for everything else that I need to do is October 1st so I don't um even the the draft is done of all the chapters but I do and everything else has to be done by October 1st so this is happening and the book The Print book will be available in print in 2024. this is something you could do today uh to support the project if you want um you can uh order it now one thing I'll just say I'm thrilled for people to order the Early Access ebook um if you want to support the project that way I don't see a strong like me personally I wouldn't do that because a I'm only paying for it if I really want to have the print version because to be honest ebook is available for free online right now I mean it's not as like a PDF document that you would have to pay for it through here although if you're uh if you are um what's the word I'm looking for where everybody is good at figuring things out if you are come on someone help me with this word this is what happens when you get old I can't pull out like words I used to use all the time not ambitious if you're uh somebody will help me with this word I don't know why I can't think of it ah this is driving me crazy uh teaching interactable saying I'm teaching physics using p5.js at a university in southern Chile thanks to you amazing I hope this book is a helpful resource I hope that once this gets done I can do we can do translations of it so especially if you are somebody who speaks another language um and is interested in helping to publish a translation of the book in another country in another language don't get in touch right now with me in touch with me after October 1st uh not tech savvy not eager not ingenious like oh there's a word I'm looking for Intent no I don't know maybe it doesn't exist I shouldn't technically inclined no you're um okay somebody will get it uh the link to preorder is uh nostarch.com nature Dash code it's right up here I'll put all these links will end up in the chat so um but uh certainly if you want to preorder the print book um go go ahead it's going to be longer than 536 Pages by the way that last chapter 10 which I think I need to break into two chapters got very long bored Frugal no um I want to say like God this is gonna drive me written by coding Train YouTube Star I'm a star baby um uh also misspelling of my name um learn from an expert I'm an expert and a star these are not ways that I would ever refer to myself but I'm fine you know you got to sell books somehow uh so this is happening uh placeholder cover uh pragmatic Pro industrious resourceful yes resourceful I think is what I'm looking for if you're resourceful yes that's the word I think I was looking for uh the print paperback on Amazon right now entertainment is the oh let's see it might actually be available for preorder on Amazon let's take a look I don't know how this works just yet so this version is the 2012 version you know if you purchase it it's not a total loss in the sense that um uh I receive royalties from it so you're supporting me the book content is still uh I would say uh most of it a lot of it is the same or it would be value but but I certainly would suggest don't don't buy it um now the question is can we find uh well so maybe somebody who's resourceful we just use that word over and over again can find if the there is a preorder on Amazon for the new version but at present it might only be available through no starch um I don't know about International so Joseph is actually asking about International I mean no starch certainly distributes their book internationally uh State Province country looks I see no reason why not all of the countries are here uh hello to Tomas uh G Sun Li I hope to get a chance to translate the new nature code book into Korean yes let's talk about that uh I would love that um but again I I can't I can't even bring allow myself to think about that until I'm done so now if so I talked about how you could preorder it now everything for the book currently is in this GitHub repo so actually the entire content the entire draft of text of everything is just here in these like HTML files um and you can also find information around how the book is organized I'm using notion which is something I would like to do some videos about at some point um you know I follow Thomas Frank who is like the world's leading expert on notion I would love to do a collaboration about how the how I've done this book publishing with notion um or just be inspired by him you can actually build the PDF yourself uh if again if you're a resourceful and want to try running um you might be missing a few things like I am using a licensed font for the PDF so that font is not in the repo so when you build the PDF it might be a different font um and so but what's more important for me to show you is if you see this link right here uh we'll take you to and I know it's a second edition I I think I'm not supposed to say second edition it's just like a I don't know I don't know how it's going to work but this is the current draft of the book and I believe if I click this by this book it'll take you to the preorder page so this is the link right here I'm sorry for its sort of clunkiness that you should all eventually this will just be at natureofcode.com but until it's finished it's going to live at this preview link and thank you alga for putting it here in the chat um okay uh all right so um so a couple things that I'll point out one is uh the what I call the introduction in the previous book is now chapter zero Randomness if you could come up with a better title for that I'm open to changing it because um yeah I don't know what what the title of that should be I could also just call it numbers but that didn't really seem to work um so uh I'm gonna just like you can see here uh the book design so Jason gal uh hello shout out has been who's an Alum of ITP who has been working on this project with me for probably over a year now and and many other people have contributed um uh that I'm that I'm not mentioning here as well and I'll try to as I remember mention everybody but has worked on this whole build process so this is the current website design the website I'm kind of not as worried about right now because I have in I have the rest of my life however long I live counting through time I can work on refining and improving the website but the PDF the print version has to get locked in you know in the next month or so but um if you scroll through you'll see this design of the book you'll see the code is now uh JavaScript um I plan to maintain uh processing versions of all the examples so you can read the book and you know in a fantasy land I might like have a little button here that I can just click a button and it has the book in processing but I don't have time to implement that right now um you can see that the examples are running right here on the page and then you can click this button that takes you right to the example in the P5 web editor look at the code run it there so that's a wonderful um there's new illustrations that Zanna Marsh is working on um and yeah so you know I could keep going through this but you can basically see what the book looks like um let me click through the chapters vectors it's pretty much the same as the first edition just with updates and improvements uh forces pretty much the same updates and improvements oscillation pretty much the same updates and improvements particle systems pretty much the same updates and improvements I mean there's been significant work on each of these chapters I don't mean to minimize that but um I want to get to where there's much more substantial changes uh autonomous agents uh pretty much the same I would say that uh this last section um has had uh has some new uh new examples um one of the things actually if somebody wants to work on um you know Jason is working on all this stuff so if you really wanted to work on this please open an issue so that there's not redundant work but some of these examples run very slow on the page not because they actually run slow but because the web the web page loads many many many many any examples so there's many canvases all running on this page so they run very slow there is I believe lazy loading meaning that the sketches don't load until you scroll to them but once I've scrolled all the way to the bottom they don't unload further up so things start to run quite slow so if anyone wants to help with optimizing that lazy loading that's uh that's something that I'm looking for help with yes new cover art Joseph I have yet to figure out who's doing that and how I'm doing that I have a lot of different people like who work on coding train illustrations who work on the book illustrations book design so I have the uh somebody who did the original cover design so I have to figure that out um but um but yeah so that's one sort of major issue with the book but you can see there's a new section on the quad tree example I'm referencing a lot of coding train videos a new sign and cosign lookup table example so there's a bunch of new things in all the chapters I'm just highlighting here in a Time series now physics libraries this chapter has had a major rewrite because the original version of the book If I go to here and go to physics libraries uh is mostly about a physics Library called box 2D which is a wonderful um a physics library that I would encourage everyone to continue to use it's just quite involved and a little tricky to use in JavaScript so I have been using more recently a JavaScript library called matter.js um which um is now the sort of Base Library for this chapter I also am still using toxic Libs which is in the chapter and then I also want to give a major shout out here to see if I can find it P5 yes so I also you know I you know if I'm being completely honest here and thank you to Quinton who I believe I owe some emails or Discord messages back to who's been very patient with me um P5 play is an incredible library for uh P5 specifically that was initiated by Paulo predicini and is currently led by Ashley one of the work one of the huge things that Quentin has done from the way I understand it with P5 play is added rigid body collisions all built on top of box 2D so in many ways I think you could make a really really strong case for why this whole chapter should just be written in P5 play but there's just not the state of play if you will of where I was when working on this so Quentin has very generous in answering my questions and porting all of the examples that are in this chapter to P5 play so um so yeah so I also wanted to mention P5 play and when the book gets finished and released um uh expected to be able to see uh through Clinton's hard work version of all the examples with P5 play Okay so this chapter is about the physics libraries uh Southern automata is a chapter of fractals is a chapter evolutionary communism is a chapter I'm just looking at the time here we're already at almost 11 o'clock and I'm only on item number one on my list so I gotta move through some things here um um there's a need for intersection observers on sleeping and waking them would be really nice yeah lots of lots of things okay um neural networks this chapter is where I have spent the most amount of time just in the last couple months so this chapter is is almost a complete rewrite and I'm going to just go through the table of contents for it um if we have time I wanted to demo some of the examples maybe I oh when I get to ml5 that's what I'll do the examples are now using the ml5 library I will demo those examples when I get to that on my list so let's go through the table of contents um first section is just about the sort of background in history of artificial neural networks I start code wise with making a perceptron so for me sometimes something that I really like to do is go back to the origin of an algorithm that's used today in really large scale and complicated ways so for me like if you're you know just to pull out an example out of thin air if you're using chat GPT chat GPT the text generate through chat GPT is coming from a large language model which is a Transformer architecture of a massive neural network of many many neurons and connections and all sorts of sophisticated learning and out and activation algorithms that have that is the result of you know now what is we can't do the math the 70 close to 70 years of research and probably longer if I'm probably getting that wrong but to understand it to me I like to go all the way back to what is the unit the single foundational element inside of these largecal systems and that is a neuron and in 1957 at the Cornell aeronautical laboratory the perceptron the idea of a perceptron the simplest neural network one neuron with inputs and outputs that was uh that that history of that research can be traced back to to um to that work and so the code example goes through how to build and the theory and practice of a single perceptron so that's a large portion of the chapter and it finishes with this example that looks at classifying dots in a twodimensional space above or below a line using a perceptron okay uh so walnuts asks uh I'm hesitating to answer your name to answer your question here but walnuts asks why is the library why are the libraries ending with five P5 ml5 uh anybody know I know the answer let's see if somebody knows I can answer it in the chat but then I'll answer it if nobody knows uh okay but I'm gonna keep going here uh then um I go into a little bit of theory about why a single perceptron can't do very much and the concept behind a multilayered perceptron but then this is where I make a huge skip forward so I want to go I go in the chapter I go through the theory um and algorithm behind the sort of like nuts and bolts the base Foundation of what a neural network is but then I jump to ml5 which is a machine learning library which has neural networks baked into it so I could just say make a new neural give it this data train it look at the output so that's where the chapter pivots and I go through and I explain uh class of classification and regression I look at the sort of M the idea of mnist in neural networks these are all placeholder illustrations as you can see so if you have ideas or thoughts about and this is borrowed from uh Hogan's material just as a sort of reference point for when I actually do the work with xanna to create the illustrations you can see my like chicken scratch here so I go through code and uh one of the first example I make is a simple gesture classifier uh ah okay oh I love a wire reference well thank you for the wire reference Crossing I've got so first of all no no no no no no no no no no no there's a definite misconceptions here in the chat which I want to correct processing is an active project it's funny that you would think like that's interesting to make that theory like oh there's processing four and P5 no no that's just a coincidence that processing happens to be on version four and P5 is called P5 is only on version 1.7 so there's the version numbers and then there's the actual name so so far nobody's gotten it let's see uh chapter 10 is not available in the Early Access PDF Jason but that's going to be remedied like on Monday uh so that that that will be remedied uh um I just I finished the draft like literally like two days ago so I haven't generated the PDF and given it to no Starship not HTML5 although that's interesting well it's gonna be a while somebody's gonna get this uh so Joseph's got it in the Discord so um and Kate k uh okay we which I really work hard to pronounce Steve I never do it right asks any plans on including stuff about chat gbt in the book so I mention generative Ai and new architectures and make the connection to those uh Concepts and those those modern techniques but I'm not going through that in detail in the book I do have plans to do more educational materials around generative Ai and Transformer models and working with ml5 but for the nature of code book you'll see I'm kind of limited in scope um uh okay so so Joseph has got it in so Joseph wins as the coding train sticker whatever I mean it's not actually nobody wins anything I'm just saying you know uh um alka's now got it but I'll wait for it to come from somebody uh in the YouTube chat we'll see or um all right so uh I look at building machine learning model and this is the example uh all the way through um where it's trainable you could see like also this computer this is not my current laptop this is my old um 2019 MacBook Pro I still just use it for as like my now it's now it's just like permanently sitting on this desk for live streaming it's also struggling I think here to run some of these things but okay so here's the gesture classifier so it already ran um but basically I can make a gesture and it classifies it and we can see like if I do this I got right like how much down so I want to make a point here which is that of course you don't need neural networks to do this you could just like use some if statements and some math to evaluate like which way what angle is the heading of the vector um but I like to have an example that kind of that's very uh obvious and trivial so that you can see all the steps so you could do something more complex and that's like what some of the exercises are here so the exercise here which I hope take a solution for is you know my gesture is just a start point and an end point but what if it is a sequence of points what if I could have like a figure eight gesture versus a circle gesture and that kind of thing start classifying shapes so um and what if I use the hand pose model so um so there's that um then now here's the thing that I would love to hear feedback from all right so Karen got it uh oh coded design program being launched at your school Stig that's wonderful so I'd love to hear more about that um I still have a shout out to Stig in the audience who is was one of the organizers of processing Community Day in Copenhagen uh by the way there's a PC Taiwan that's happening I think the first week PCD by the way is processing Community day which is something that anybody can run one of their own it's a way of organizing an event for your your community around processing and creative coding um so um and and in case you're wondering what's in the box what's in the box it is a um authentic Danish train whistle from the 1950s I believe um lovely little sound there um so ah but I wanted to say that there's PCD Taiwan is happening I don't know the exact date but I think I'm speaking remotely I will be in Taiwan just for like 10 or 15 minutes so tune in for that next time I'll be appearing online oh I also wanted to mention I was on a podcast recently about AI so let me come back to that I'm making a note here all right so ah So currently it's chapter 10. and uh and chapter 10 I make a pivot to the concept of reinforcement learning and specifically neuro Evolution which is like a Twist on reinforcement learning it's really long I think it's about if I in the print PDF I think it's about 70 pages right now so I'm curious any of you who just are looking through this today or anytime the next few days love to hear from you I think that should be two chapters it was originally supposed to be two chapters but I was having such writer's block and it was such a mental hurdle to get this thing done and I was like let me just make it one chapter and I'll add something about neuro Evolution on the end but then once I went to do that my neural Evolution section became really quite long so I think maybe now I can go back now that I've written the draft and break into the two chapters but I'd love to hear about that from you one thing that I'm struggling with which also uh suggestions would be great and by the way if you're wondering like how do you give me these suggestions join the cutting train Discord um yes and and K weakbond is making a very good point neuro evolution is not really reinforcement it's not reinforcement learning and um I would love for you to read this over and I make that point and and and make a transition to it but um I would love to any feedback you have about if I did that off you know in an accurate way the book is is having a technical review process which people are being paid uh one person is being paid to read over it but but I I welcome additional uh technical review um I I don't wanna I don't want to take advantage of people's generosity in time but certainly feedback as well okay oh point zero you made the January 2023 pull request I did I'm sorry about that let me I'm not good at managing this let's can you tag me in Discord and maybe we can chat about this I just gotta remember to go back and look at that um okay so this will probably get broken out into a separate chapter um one thing that I'm struggling with is I I have like this ecosystem project at the end of every chapter prompt and it makes a lot of sense what to put at the end of the neuro Evolution section but if I don't get to neural Evolution I don't know what to put here but anyway um the counter thingy was initialized yes you can see it over here right now but I guess the light makes sense you can't read the time maybe now you can see it okay so going through uh these are not these are placeholders the actual uh we'll have new illustrations made uh for the book um but I go through the game Flappy Bird I talk about evaluating the game Flappy Bird in terms of features like the position of the bird its velocity its distance to the next pipe the location of the pipes and then I look at how a neural network can use those features to decide whether to flap its wings or not I look at how you can do that in ml5 and then build a neuro Evolution example so first of all I just create the Flappy Bird clone which I'm going to attempt to play here clicking the mouse it's running so slow so this is me playing it by clicking the mouse and then I go through how to do it with neuro Evolution um and all the ml5 stuff it's a lot of stuff here and then you'll see here this is neuro Evolution uh um so I'm seeing comments in the chat um and I'm not able to answer all them so sorry about that so uh right I do not go into so Dominique is asking a question about the specifics of reinforcement learning don't get into it into the book yeah so goodness my iPad with this chat um okay I would love to just like I I realized in life I can't do it all this like system I have or like trying to hold this iPad in place it's not really working very well all right then I'm just gonna get through this quickly then I look back smart Rockets is one of the examples in um in chapter nine with for genetic algorithms and I make a neural network version of it and then I'm really excited about then I do as neuro Evolution steering example there's a lot of examples there's a cat here I talk about sensors I look at how to like build sensors into a um like a little creature that can like you know that they sensors light up when it gets close to an another shape and then I kind of have this final example where I can speed up time here and these agents evolve to learn to effectively use their sensors to find and eat this food so let's see if I can run this for a little while well sometimes they all die out and I did something to uh I did something to the example which didn't make it in yet where you can add more but I can just reset so I'm still finetuning the parameters of this so uh so I think they're all going to die out again it's funny of course I'm having bad luck here while uh streaming maybe this one is going to lift come and clone yourself you're doing so well just clone yourself yes yes okay that was great so it made a lot of them and they're really quite good now so I can slow this back down and see that basically they use their sensors to be able to detect the food and they stay on the food eating uh until it's gone and then they wander around but they've learned this Behavior essentially through the process of neuro Evolution so this is like when I first thought about the nature of code in like 2006 or whatever this is kind of the example that I was dreaming of making and I finally got through finishing this chapter and have it here so I love neuro Evolution um I should also shout out David ha who is a um let me go here to uh his website otoro.net who has done a ton of work uh in uh I mean this is like a huge inspiration to me um let's see below machine learning projects I think you can find here yeah a lot of all the papers on uh you can see how similar a lot of these are to what I'm doing uh you can see directly like inspiration coming from here Hardware accelerated neuro Evolution so if you want to go even further this stuff um you can look at David ha's uh work as well um okay so that's really just about everything I have to say in nature of code oh one more one important thing here uh 1110 geez 50 minutes here for the rest of my list but the main topic I want to talk about was nature of code so first of all if you are teaching this fall and want to use the new nature of code um please be in touch you could just don't need to be in touch because it's just there but I would love to hear from you uh and then you know if you're teaching in the spring and using the nature of code maybe your students maybe you could order the book for your University or School bookstore just saying okay um then uh okay um I think I'm wrapping this up oh yeah I remember what I want to say so let's say here's an important thing let's say you're reading the book and you have a comment you want to make uh uh a suggestion so first of all proceed with some level of understanding that I'm really trying to get this done and I I've put Blood Sweat tears over many many years into this it's I've dragged it out more than I could ever possibly drag it out so I am I don't want to say taking shortcuts but I'm the Kill Your Darlings I think is the uh is it Hemingway or Alan Ginsburg whoever made that phrase I having to kill my darlings which which is a phrase that sort of means like I just sure it would be great to include more about reinforcement learning in the book or use a different physics library in chapter six or uh include an additional example I just can't do that so if you have uh you know so what I'm looking for is more feedback about parts that are especially confusing things that are really but clear mistakes in terms of like how I'm describing math the math and physics Concepts um and typos and and that kind of thing um you can probably ignore like things like oh the figure number is wrong I mean eventually at some point I need that feedback but you know it's in copy editing and that kind of stuff hasn't gone but unfortunately right now you cannot pull request fixes even though the content is in here um and you could make a pull request to this HTML file that is like all of them the content of chapter three but this is actually coming for motion so this is an automated process where these HTML files are built from notion dot pages that I'm writing into so your best path for uh offering suggestions or Corrections is to open an issue and my preference would be that you open it sounds like uh uh individual issues for uh for different comments so rather than like here's one issue with like 100 comments about the book I mean again you're giving up your time to do this so if that's the way you want to do it that's like I'm not going to stop you but for me it's easier to then see the issue go and make the fix manually and notion myself and then close the issue and it's just keep project management wise helps me keep track of the book so I just wanted to make that clear to anybody uh watching okay uh all right so uh let me answer the question about the fives so processing when it originally was invented the URL processing was not available so it was called processing with two Prof processing with two fives and I believe if you go to that URL it will still take you to the current processing website so Prosper fiving was kind of the it was an alternate name for processing it was often written that way so P5 used the five from the original processing as an homage uh to processing so that's where the five comes from in ml5 the five is there just to say that this library is meant to be used with P5 okay uh Simon yeah the moving left thing um is uh is related to the way that I'm initializing the neural network weights and I could do something to get around that but in the end they kind of like learn how to move backwards they still tend to like have a moving to the left trajectory but I didn't I couldn't figure out an elegant way to talk about that and fix that in the book maybe if I add to chapter 11. yeah so that's that's um yeah okay ah MB lab yeah that's is asking about um first of all I haven't taken a break and I'm talking continuously I need a moment to breathe while I think about the next topic okay all right I'm gonna go right down on my list and talk about um coding training website and membership program any questions about uh um oh yeah so um so I haven't all I would love to make a series all about git and Version Control high priority on my list of things to go back and do again uh realistically when I would get to it I don't know uh some things about the old videos are still useful and apply they're quite out of date um but you could try it uh I mean yeah I would love to love to do that um an interactive also says it was helpful to them in the last week so that's that's nice to hear um but yeah I rebooting old things is is what I'm doing and my first priority was learning to code with processing I think my second priority is updating some old P5 tutorials and then probably my third would either be the ml5 videos or GitHub getting GitHub those would be kind of but you know I'm slow to get to things these days okay so let's talk about the coding Train website so this is not new anymore uh designed created and designed by Design Systems International uh put together by so many people from the community um um uh that um so I took a little break to pause there and I I just realized like wow I'm tired I'm exhausted from and all this energy and excitement about nature of code and now that I finished going through that I'm feeling a little bit like uh tired okay um so coding Train website so if you're brand new to the channel this is your place to start this is where those tracks that I've been referencing of like oh you want to learn to code from scratch oh yeah here's a p5.js track uh you want to learn a little bit more about git and GitHub for poets if you want to learn about I just called it that because it's not trying to be nontechnical and we use a poem I use a poem as the sort of like canonical example tracing through um but this is the one that's kind of old and out of date I mean look look at that beautiful young face there in those glasses there's like no gray in that beard amazing oh Memories by the corner of okay I got a little dizzy singing there okay um so this is your place to get started now most people come to find the coding train through the challenges the challenges are single videos where I work through a particular project a lot of them are mathematical algorithms that I am attempting to visualize you know probably like a prime example of that is something like uh the heart curve and if you look at that you'll find uh the video um some this one's in two parts so there's two parts timestamps uh the code examples here so I can click here and I can find the code example which is right there and then I don't know if that's the appropriate use of that term of the website the passenger showcase so the passenger showcase is the place where you can submit and thank you to Kathy who I see has some submissions here who has been doing a lot of work in helping to curate the Showcase um it's where you can submit your own versions so I'm I'm going through this quickly because I can get now to the Showcase page in the Showcase page and by the way uh is where you'll see all of the projects um in uh reverse chronological order so we can look and you know the idea of the coding train uh you know Raphael uh decorville does an amazing job of this with his weekly creative coding challenges and streaming every week and looking at everybody's work I aspire to be like that I haven't been able to keep up with it I want it I would like to if I can get back into the habit of live streaming more often every week go through some recent submissions but I'll just do that now we can see here's one from uh Pana or sorry Tamaki uh Pana go around by Tamaki komatsuzaki which I guess is this I don't know if this is like a known character or a creation of an original character but you can see if I had to guess this is maybe from like my polar coordinates video let's see uh from no 3.6 graphing sine wave so we can go here we can see ah this is the video that this project was made with and you can see it's the only showcase project with that video now the thing that's really exciting that's new and a huge thanks to deepam who uh if I'm missing somebody apologies I think depalm did the bulk of this work um and depalm remind me if I'm pronouncing your name correctly uh if I go to the guides and I want to talk about the membership guide this is something brand new also if I go to the passenger showcase guide this is the submission form where you can submit a project now you can submit your project through GitHub uh with a pull request and Kathy noted to me that it's a little confusing how to do that and I should spend some time going over how to do that but I might have to cut that for time yeah thanks for reminding me we'll play this song in the background is it really loud I really messed that up because okay just enjoy this for a moment autotune and the internet was successful all right all right thanks for that reminder where was I ah so one of the thing uh the last time you might have looked at this if you haven't looked at in a while you could only submit showcase projects for the coding challenges through the website you could otherwise do it through a pull request in a somewhat convoluted process and I need to update the tutorial for how to do that to clarify that process but now you can actually pick which track you want your project to go with so for example there are some videos this is left unfinished because I'm focusing on the writing somebody I'll get back to it for example if I go to Nature of code this will now populate with all of the nature of code videos so if I have made a Project based on the arrive steering video then this is where I can submit it title of the project URL an image your name your website your email is optional and I'm not I don't believe I'm store I'm not storing it anywhere I think to fact check this but um I am um it gets used to link to your GitHub account so you can get because it this automates a pull request so if you put in your email associated with a GitHub account in that field then you will get uh tagged as the uh creator of those commits on GitHub and then social media handles are nice because again I we I haven't kept up with this um uh Katie Chan who runs Cody train social media accounts currently um uh is we'll get back in the habit of this hopefully but we like to tag people on social media about their passenger showcase submissions okay so that is up so I think Kathy I'm sorry I know you um mentioned this there is some information about how you can do this process through a pull request but it is a little it's changed a little bit let me see if I I don't need part of me is I don't even know how this works but let's look I think the challenge is that is finding where the file goes so on the website uh uh under videos maybe yeah I think like so for example I think if you wanted to do it through a pull request and you're doing nature code and I forgot what one I said but like if and you have to like find the video yeah so it's just like tricky you just have to like uh find the path of where the markdown file um for the video is which can be a little bit tricky you've probably a little bit of detective work it requires you to be resourceful today's word of coding train is brought to you by today's word of the day resourceful did it did it pop up here and like was there an animation and a sound effect no I guess it only happens when I hire people to do that in postproduction okay um so so this is where you would want to put that manually you just have to create the Json file in an image file so I kind of went over it but I glossed over it okay let's get to the next and give me a second here I totally forgot just give me can you bear with me for a second here polar to coordinate let's play a different song Pearl and noise song so this is random oh that's very loud pearly noise that is in the core random algorithm the actual random algorithm itself those numbers aren't related at all you pick like okay seven six one nine four eight nine two one three I pick nine a lot apparently but with pearly noise I might pick numbers like this two three I had some slides to show you I don't have them six seven five six seven I have them available in Discord well this is like I'm opening Discord it's hard but it's like updated I could read random numbers the issue is how to add this oh add the Showcase Kathy is clarifying for me something um really important which is uh uh I'll just say it um which is that if you want to add a showcase project for a video that doesn't have any that are part of it already then you have to create that showcase folder which is a little bit tricky but uh just get in touch tag me or tag station manager maybe or engineer on Discord which are um people who can help uh answer your questions about how to do this stuff okay uh Discord now I have to log in it's going to give me a QR code yes so just bear with me one more minute log in I'm in I'm gonna look for my direct messages here and just give me a second oh I should have done this in advance I'm so sorry everybody one this oh this is probably not worth it but I'm gonna do it anyway yeah you can listen to the song again with curly noise I might pick numbers like this three four three four five six five four five six seven five six seven five purling noise that is purling noise so this is hurling noise that is so this is hurling noise that is hurling noise so this is hurling noise that is hurling noise this is this is hurling noise that is hurling so this is hurling noise that is hurling noise apparently but with pearly noise I might pick numbers like this two three four three four five six five four five okay I'm back to you uh uh there we go all right so uh the other thing that is new on the website that I wanted to talk about is coding train um for lack of a better term membership or support so um this is always tricky for me to talk about or think about a coding train is not not a fulltime coding trained YouTuber person I do not rely on uh crowdfunding uh and other revenue from ads for my primary source of income I have a fulltime job with benefits as a at New York University so I really hesitate to ask people to support the coding trade that said I'd spend a tremendous amount of time on the coding train and at any given time they're anywhere between like two and ten people working on projects uh that I hire to do things like animation video editing on the nature of code book I've been investing a lot of funds into for illustrations um you know I will hopefully recoup a lot of that through royalties from the book but it's all out of pocket right now uh building the website doing design so those of you who are who want to or are able to support the coding train um it helps so and it I kind of you know honestly like I try to budget to basically Break Even sometimes I come out a little bit ahead sometimes I come out a little bit um a little bit under um I you know I'm trying to get better at accounting so I actually just hired a bookkeeper so that's where some of the funds go to as well um so but I have not done a great job at uh keeping up with the benefits and perks and rewards if you will of subscribing to various things like get up sponsorships and YouTube memberships so over the last over this summer I've been meeting with Katie Chan who helped run the social media accounts and and uh Jason uh hegland who has designed a lot of the logos and and and and makes a lot of the like stickers and things like that and we have worked to streamline and consolidate uh and clarify the ways that you can support the coding train and what types of things you get access to for doing so I want to just kind of go through a little bit of that right now if you'll indulge me doesn't interest you because you click away you put me in the background whatever it's fine so hopefully this will just take a few minutes um I will on the website there is now under guides this membership guide which hopefully explains all of this um and I'm going to show you these images that Katie worked on that'll go on Instagram I've tried to use as many train puns as possible in here so please enjoy that um I cannot confirm or deny the use of any AI large language models to help me brainstorm Fun Train puns but where am I going here uh membership okay so let's let's go through these okay membership announcement and not as exciting as you might think but still pretty exciting okay um oh my God a computer system what are the changes so the main thing is I am trying I'm only going to have like two levels there's different ways you know buying the nature of code book is a way of supporting the coding train I know that there's like super chats and all sorts of other things and uh I I would say also um donating to the processing Foundation is another way to support the work that I'm doing uh it's you know uh in indirectly I suppose or maybe in a way that's more needed like I I always say like if you're going to support one or the other like support the processing Foundation um but uh I tried to simplify and so there's only like two levels so you know if you have I'm only thinking I think it was two levels so uh uh passenger or conductor so most platforms have five dollars a month or ten dollars a month the and I'm trying to streamline what the uh rewards are so for uh the five dollar a month um uh passengers um is access to uh some uh unlock some Discord channels it is a public open Discord server but there are some member only channels um the rewards I used to do them piecemail so when somebody signs up I would send them a sticker pack and I would get behind and those of you who were owed the train whistles like waited like two years to get them those have been sent out so now the way it's going to work is once a year I'm gonna send out a coding train sticker path to everybody so any for every year that you're a member once a year are going to post a form in Discord tag everybody post you know communicate on all the platforms so I'm not collecting people's addresses and information when they sign up once a year I'm gonna say hey if you're a member and you want the sticker pack enter your information into this form it's all going to go out that mailing will probably go out by the end of September that's a goal we've ordered all the stickers um so now is a good time to sign up because if you sign up you're gonna you're gonna get that sticker pack pretty soon if you've been a member for five years you're going to get it if you remember for one year you're gonna get it everybody again everybody gets a sticker pack who signs up um and I decided to give out stickers for free to people in person and events and things when I can obviously I would love to in an Ideal World I would just mail stickers to everybody but that's not realistic okay and then uh I haven't done these in quite a while but sometimes when I'm recording videos that I'm not doing as part of a live stream uh there will be behind the scenes and Q a sessions for smaller groups so those are the main perks but uh in the end what I'm saying is do not sign up for these I'm trying to give these out but sign up only if you feel like you have the capacity and want to um yeah and then the only thing different is I will I'm able to like produce more than just stickers if you sign up for a little bit more um so I I think we're doing I mean I guess I I don't know if it's meant to be a surprise or not but I'm doing a like um like us I don't know what to call it like an uh I actually don't even know what it is but it's a special more like physical enamel pin like lanyard type thing with like a uh you can and a lanyard coding train lanyard thing that might be like a ticket a train ticket design like try to do something special every year like this custom laser etched train whistle uh for the 10 a month okay great I don't want to belabor this too much so existing members nothing changes uh but hopefully this is good news because you get you're gonna get something every year um wrote some more about why um mostly the thing that I want to say is like if you feel like hey I signed up a while ago and I never even got you know if you have any questions about this this is your email address that you can write to and now the sort of ways you can support so I've decided to take the approach of like huh I'm just gonna like offer up whatever platforms exist um some platforms have specific things that you get for that specific platform honestly my favorite one at present is GitHub sponsors so if you go to github.com codingtrain I think there is a sponsor button here which has uh these levels that you can and um the reason why is the GitHub uh takes I think the least amount of fees from it um uh and it seems like a nice system but YouTube membership is might be the one you want because if I post anything that's like a Members Only video on YouTube or you get the badges and things G suddenly just well I have to do my old my old thing how did I do this I used to do this the live stream Jason Lee you have just just climbed aboard the passenger car of the coding train welcome for your membership you get don't let you get a little badge a little dot a little purple purple dot next to your name if this wasn't all like like very you know if I could manage to do this I might like pull this out and read you a random number but you know all that stuff thank you for joining um so these are the platforms that exist um you can look at them there's links to them I also want to mention that uh nebula like there's a lot I have more to say about nebula because uh when I get to my uh processing updates um um so I I I'm I'm uh one uh there's a question which one gives you the most money I think it's GitHub sponsors I think GitHub sponsors just I don't know if they still have this promotion for a while they weren't taking any fees and they were matching I don't think they're doing that anymore that was like when they first started GitHub sponsors um yeah um so but I'm gonna talk nebula is another way of supporting the coding train that is really incredible and you get a lot of stuff nebula is an incredible streaming service that um is part of uh that is a new company independent streaming uh independent creators it has a show called jet lag that I'm obsessed with um so many amazing channels that I could name that are on the nebula platform and you can sign up and I um so that is a way of supporting the coding train I don't at present have all of these things linked if honestly you ask me to choose what I think you should do I would say sign up for nebula through my link that's I might not get the most money from that but that's my most favorite way for people to support the coding train because I'm really excited about nebula and want to do more with nebula but I will be talking about soon away I will be um posting my processing video series on nebula as an exclusive first so if that's something you're really interested in and want to look at it in advance of it going to YouTube um Netflix thing you want to sign up for and when it's ready I'll talk more about that in a live stream okay oh on GitHub organizations have a six percent fee so what do individuals had because I switched over to an organization from an individual but six percent is I mean YouTube takes uh 30 I think I think it's 30 percent that's a lot more than six percent okay um all right and then all the details are here at thecodingtrain.com membership okay oh deep Palm okay great back to one thing so that's about the membership stuff that's all I want to say about that if you have questions I'm happy to answer but I don't want to spend too much time on that it's not my priority um okay I want to go back to the um the guides and go to the passenger showcase guy oh no I'm gonna go to the uh tracks so let's go into um code program with P5 and I believe like shapes and drawing maybe has a bunch of Passenger showcase oh no how does it not have any passenger showcase projects color maybe interesting I guess these beginner projects it's sort of new that you could do this well let's get random yeah random has a bunch of Passenger showcase projects so one of the things that I didn't realize thank you to deepam who pointed this out is if I click submit to the Showcase here first of all don't you love that the the buttons cycle through and you hover over them they they like cycle through like all sorts of different colors yeah look at that it's like cycling through rainbow colors I love that so much okay um so if I click on this it Auto populates Auto popular oh no populace that makes me so happy okay cutting Train website membership showcase all right I have to get back to my family and the weekend in about 15 minutes things left on my list some of these are like things I can mention in just a minute let me maybe I'll go through those and then come back to ml5 towards the end oh great zero percent oh percent on GitHub sponsors that's very helpful zero percent fee but honestly like I really to me the membership program is more about building Community I mean sure like who we don't why give dollar fifty to Google when it the dollar fifty could go to me I suppose but um if you really enjoy um the uh having the sort of perks and features on the YouTube membership stuff you should feel free to do that okay all right now what what do I want to do so let me come back to ml5 I'm thinking about what I want to okay uh all right let's talk about um I don't know if anyone's watching okay you know I should maybe I should do Emma I'm going back what I said maybe I should look at ml5 right now and then uh I'll just go through quick things at the end okay let's do that okay so what's happening with the ml5 project so um I've worked on a lot of different open source projects over the years most notably uh processing and uh then working on helping to start the processing Foundation um these days my focus in terms of the actual open source work that I'm doing is mostly on this project and the reason that is um well for the processing Foundation has expanded and there's a lot of people working on P5 and processing now and lots of announcements and things to come there um but for me uh I have this is something that I'm actively working on for my teaching at NYU I'm able to apply for funding and work with NYU students to build out this Library so that's become kind of my uh research if you will work while at my day job at NYU the ml5 project it also is tied to that chapter 10 of nature of code so I've been investing a lot of time over the summer in this project so there's lots of announcements about ml5 to come I'm not going to really necessarily get into everything but what I wanted to point out to you is if you go to the GitHub you might notice that there is this repo called ml5 Next Gen so proceed with caution this is not ready for prime time there's no release of this um that's ready and documented if you are teaching with ml5 and you have class next week you know nothing has changed for you but if you want to take a sneak peek and poke around and follow what's going on um this is the repo for you so let's just see I don't know how far I'm gonna get with this I I've been working on this a ton but on my uh work laptop not on this streaming laptop so I don't know what's going to happen when I try to uh run this but let's let's first like what version of node am I running 17.3 so that might be a problem do I have NVM yes so I want to use NVM so NVM by the way so by the way if you are a beginner programmer or you just kind of wandered in here from who knows where I'm about to do some stuff that's a little bit beyond probably where you are in your journey um so feel free to follow along but be aware uh um you know I have and I can help if you join the Discord or you ask some questions the community will hopefully help answer what's going on here but um essentially like just as a reminder if you go to thecodingtrain.com and get started with code those would be where some of the beginner tutorials which would ramp you up towards the sort of place where I am right now but right now I'm going to do something which is high degree of difficulty which is attempt to follow some instructions about how to build an open source Library uh for and see if I could run it in a testing way so this um so NVM is a particular tool that stands for node version manager node is a way of running JavaScript code sort of on your computer and developing web applications and different things you know outside of P5 and the world of the web our clients at the world of the web browser I should say so if you want to try to follow along here the first thing you would need to do is install NVM I'm skipping that step then I would need to go to a terminal and make sure I have the correct version of node that's compatible with ml5 let's try doing that and I wouldn't be surprised if I don't get all the way through with this but let's see if an error comes up okay so now uh and I think it's having me use that version so if I type node version yeah I'm actually already using that version so I don't even need to uh say uh use 18 but I could do that I'm still in 18. um okay now the next thing I need to do is install a global package Dash G is for a couple called yarn what is yarn your crochet but here in my artisul handcrafted code I think I'm going to Rebrand the coding strain to artisanal handcrafted coding train um um yarn is what is known as a package manager and if you've used a patch manager before probably used npm because that's node package manager but yarn is a different one that's maybe a little more recent new I mean it's probably not that new anymore people love it and there are some aspects of ml5 that require yarn so install yarn uh okay did that work so now I should be able to say ah so now I need to clone this repo hopefully that's going to work so I'm going to grab and by the way um you can use GitHub desktop I'm finding it more maybe that more and more people are using GitHub desktop maybe I should do some tutorials with GitHub desktop there's a GitHub command line interface Etc but I'm using this particular way of authenticating into my account when working with GitHub but you probably if you're going to be following exactly what I'm doing you're not an owner of ml5 so you probably need to use this particular URL this will only work if you own or have access to ml5 and so I'm going to say git clone the next gen repo okay so now uh if I look at the desktop I should have a folder called ml5 next 10 and it's got a lot of stuff in it so I want to CD change directory there and then I can go and by the way this is not something anybody needs to do when working with ml5 this is a process for developing ml5 and would be required now if you want to test the new version but soon won't be so I'm going to run this command yarn does that is that just the generic yarn install I don't have to say install I guess of everything yeah so now this is installing all of the other dependencies and things so ml5 Library depends on all these other packages and things so now the the working on a project with JavaScript with the node ecosystem is entering into a world of a million different libraries and dependencies and packages and functionalities and as you can see one of the things that's getting installed is all this tensorflow stuff so tensorflow is Google's open source machine learning library that ml5 is uh most of ml5 is built on top of okay so now I should be able to say yarn start and it's gonna build the library run a web server and open up a web page open up a web page open up a web page of the current examples so oh did I not merge oh shiftman okay so it's okay I'm gonna I'm gonna show you something even more crazy in a moment um but let's just start here so first of all you can run um any of these examples so I'm going to show you an example that I made recently with the new uh ml5 and um this is by the way this model was created and brought in by um uh Peter Lynn um and let's see if this works so look at this by the way okay if you're like me and you're an old timer and you are learning creative coding in like 2001 and uh and you and somebody said is your homework assignment make a Graphics application that tracks your index and thumb and draws a circle where they are I mean you would have spent year the next full year of your life trying to figure that out now we just have in the web browser on the internet it's running a machine learning model that makes a prediction about your hand and draws something in real time at like 60 frames per second like this is insane the world we live in and by the way foreign now here's an exercise for you can you make it so that it shows two of them could you make it so that I can throw one so many possibilities here so just to be clear this is using a hand pose model um and the Hand pose model uh gets all of these points for both hands look at that that's amazing um but that simple example shows you a little bit more easily I do it so this is coming soon um there's an example that shows how to do it with a single image um I think that's bomani's hand Bomani uh did a ton of work on the ml5 project for many for a number of years uh thank you to Bomani and more examples now um I can't remember if the post post detection is a new model I I don't have time to get into everything about this um okay so now what do I want to do okay so here's something else I gotta do I'm gonna hit Ctrl C here and I'm gonna say git fetch because my uh neural network examples that I was demonstrating to you as part of the nature of code are part of ml5 but they're in a different branch so I think if I type git branch come on isn't that going to fetch me all the branches do I have to say like verbose or something no anyway well let me look on the ml5 uh pull requests it's this pull request the neuro Evolution one that I'm working on that's the branch name okay I don't know why get fetched didn't bring all the brands in somebody can probably tell me but it switched me to the neuro Evolution branch and I can pull down all of the code for that uh maybe because I already fetched it was up to date I have no idea but now I'm going to run yarn start again I'm rebuilding the library but from the branch and what is the branch well my GitHub video series actually does go through that but it's essentially my like parallel track version of the library that I'm working on and when I'm finished it's happening it's a branch because it's like here's the ml5 project and it's going that way and I'm going to Branch off for a little while to work on my own neural Evolution examples and when I'm done I'm going to merge that Branch back in into the ml5 project but now we should see yes we should see more neuroevolution examples like the neural Evolution steering example and let's just run this one for a little bit what you'll see here is the um a neural network is learning to calculate a steering Force to follow this dot that's moving with a purlin noise random walk so this slider just speeds up time so that I can run through many many many generations you know I've done 22 Generations now if I slow it back down you know you can see that the most of the agents are much better at following the dot now one of the things you might be wondering here is like about it looks like they're kind of doing a bad job and to some extent they are um you know it might get better over time I'm sure I could tweak different properties and parameters to improve it but my goal with these examples is not actually to have these agents do a perfect job of following this dot I want them to appear lifelike and have this sort of like improvisational sort of quality to how they move and feel really alive so um so that's uh that's kind of the goal of these examples and you'll see here the neuro Evolution steering example during the um which sensors example which is the one that I was going over um this has some more uh it's a little bit further along than nature of code one has a restart button um so if it runs out you can restart let's see if we can let's see if we can get some good ones going we can get lucky yeah so this one by the way you'll see doesn't have Generations because in this one so one of the things that I mean this again merits a longer discussion and I'm running out of time here what two minutes left uh but I'll probably run a little bit over as I always do um in all of my other evolutionary examples the entire population lives for a fixed period of time and then I start over a new what this one is doing is ah welcome toothless XD you have successfully interrupted Vicky Mid thought midstream talking about this coding example and join the coding welcome aboard thank you support the farm goes on oh great thank you uh thank you gray DHD um um thank you for the really kind comments that is very sweet um and I really appreciate the support um okay so uh what's Happening Here is these agents die out slowly over time unless they're able to eat the food if they eat the food it boosts their health back up which you can see based on their size so as they die they fade out and get smaller and so um and then every moment in time there's a chance they have to reproduce now I could do something where as they come into contact with each other they reproduce and make a little baby creature and oh that should be the exercise and they could even like sense each other and that that could be part of their what they have to learn to do both eat the food and and bait but that's not what's happening right now they just they're just like a probability factor a very low probability that they'll clone themselves with some mutations and one of the things that I'm really trying to do with this is figure out um how to find strike a balance so I'm going to hit restart I hate just I'm gonna hit restart and you know the amount of food is fixed whenever they finish and and here they die out so in a lot of cases like they just don't randomly mutate their neurons and find enough food and they all die out but after I run this a few times you know I will often find that one or two of them start to really do well at finding the food and then reproduce themselves a bunch of times and then we get the situation of overpopulation but at some point there's a limited amount of food so that overpopulation should balance itself out so that's one of the things I'm really interested in it's not something that I've captured perfectly and Jason Stevens I have to reply to your email I was thrilled to receive your email Jason Stevens well the ITP alums are showing out in full force today Jason Stevens also a former student in an earlier incarnation of nature of code a wonderful artist in his own right please check out their work and uh thanks so it's actually I'm sorry I haven't replied your email I'm I'm not good at that but I am I'm good at but but I I it was really cool to I read the whole thing I just didn't I should just replies that I read the whole thing it's so cool I'll say more later um but I'm doing it now um okay but you can see how the population has exploded um and it's kind of running pretty slow but it won't explode much more than this because at a certain point there's a limited amount of resources what I was saying is I want you the viewer of this channel the person learning to you know if you if you feel so inclined read the entire nature of code books you don't have to you read the parts of it that you're interested in whatever I want you to try to make your own version of this and think about how to you know basically code the universe into this you know uh so what can you do to expand beyond what I'm doing here I would love that that makes me that would I'd be so excited to see that okay all right ml5 that's all I got to say about elma5 stay tuned for more about that all right let me run through some quick things in the fall I will be teaching at NYU ITP uh programming from A to Z uh let's see that is the class I am teaching if you want to follow along a bit there should be a new if it's not I haven't done any work on this at all um other than post it uh there should be this is so unnecessary for me to show I should have just mentioned this anyway there's there's a syllabus that I'm working on for this class one of the main things about this class there is another new member there's another new member I think that just joined that I missed the Little Dot a little Little Dot Thank you new member with a little dot I'll look and figure out who that is later it's yes a course about programming with text not a beginner course um I should maybe that was a bad name for it but um Discord bot examples are going to get updated and if I can get my act together this fall I will be recording new Discord bot tutorials so stay tuned for that the Oregon Trail project let's see if I can get this to come up I spelled Oregon wrong sorry for that GitHub it's on GitHub oh there it is it probably was the first one I just um this is a project I still really want to do uh and I noticed that there was a pull request oh wait is there another repo for this because I got some pull request notifications very recently and I don't see them here did they get merged two days ago oh it was closed I don't know I'm confused but I saw some oh maybe this was an issue that was open yeah this was anyway I still want to work on this I haven't had any time to get back to it I don't know when I will uh if anybody wants to help maintain this repo and push it Forward uh file an issue and and raise your hand but uh I don't imagine that that interests anybody as much as it does me okay so I wanted to mention that come back to processing okay uh so I don't know how to give you a sneak peek of this hold on I will I'm gonna give you a sneak peek let me just go back to here I'm going back into my Discord generate dot Collective generate.collective thank you you have climbed aboard the coding train and you will be receiving you will be seeing where did I share this I shared it in the oh I showed it in the main Discord okay hold on where's sorry I'm trying to get to my Discord uh oh Jack I see your message in Discord let's try to figure out a way to get you the book um Jack is writing that in Iran there's no way to buy the book there's no access to global payment and shipping uh let's sidebar when I'm done with the book sidebar is that a word my brain's melted let's wait till I'm done with the book but then get in touch with me I will I would love to send you one myself if I can if it comes to that let's see if we can figure that out uh no one should be locked out of the nature of code if they want so uh if you're not in the Discord this is what you're missing me uh so this is a screenshot of the video series that is coming out uh it's about five hours of material there's the table of contents it is a celebration of the new processing four that um I know that Ben fry and Sam pottinger and lots of other people Rafael De Corville have put in a lot of time and effort um two um and so I wanted to when that all that work has been happening over the last year I'm way behind I wanted to have this out when processing four was released clearly that didn't happen but this new set of tutorials so if you're a teacher of beginners um who uh is using processing for your curriculum or in any context this will be this will replace what is currently um on sorry hold on uh on YouTube here so these are the video the versions of I basically made new versions of all these videos that I made like over 10 years ago as you can see by the change in hair color but otherwise I'm kind of the same maybe in 10 years can we do another one of these or I'm like over here I'm sure someone could use some generative AI to age me and just keep making that then you can go back backwards Benjamin Button style okay um so I wanted to mention that's coming out ah but that will be just so you know my plan is Go nebula.tv slash coding train my plan is to first publish those videos on the nebula streaming platform so um there's a few reasons for that one is it's a good way for me to promote nebula and generate some revenue for the channel by having people sign up for nebula as part of the launch of that new series also when I upload something to YouTube I can't ever make any changes so nebula is a platform that I am part of the Creator the Creator community that owns and operates uh nebula and uh I don't I'm not gonna redo the video in any significant way but if you know it's five hours of material I think they're going to be small mistakes and things in it so if I upload it to nebula and people are watching and learning from there and I find little mistakes and things I can correct those and replace the video file on negla so I want to have like a few weeks to be able to do that and then upload it to YouTube now nebula is a paywall um you won't be able to see so you could sign up now if you want but I'll be promoting this when the video is ready um I also by the way have some exclusive content like this other course about coding with the Apple II and you know there's so much wonderful other stuff on nebula so um but uh what was I gonna say uh if you are a teacher and you want to be able to use this video series with your students this fall uh and you know it's not there's no way for you to like have your students like buy you know I'm not asking to tell your students to buy nebula that would be uh that wouldn't be appropriate I don't think so um get in touch with me maybe help at thecodingtrain.com because I'm also happy to allow preview access of the video series to uh students in different contexts but but you know it won't be that long the whole thing's going to be on YouTube and available uh for free okay um so that's that's what I wanted to say about that um so I'm gonna hit I'm gonna check that off ah let me mention something um just because I was on a podcast recently so I'd like to plug it let me see uh post show Recaps dot com slash strike I think well that's just the RSS feed so this is the RSS feed that's really helpful uh let's just go to postshowrecaps.com um so post your Recaps is a um podcast network of uh uh podcast about television and different things and they cover all sorts of different shows I'm just like a fan and a listener and you probably you may remember me from the podcast about Severance but I was a guest on it a couple times that I made all these different uh projects related to the Apple TV Plus show uh Severance but they are also doing a podcast series about let's see uh the current writers strike well the entertainment uh strike stag after a strike the WJ strike I'm just looking for a page that has called strike up strike up something strike up the podcast break up the conversation there it is so there's a feed for strike up the conversation which is poached showrecaps.com strike but um I was the guest and I guess if I keep going down through this you'll see on we talked about sort of generative AI with the host Dr Amanda who is doing an incredible job so I'm plugging this because I was on it but not really for you to listen to the episode with me uh I don't know if I said anything that useful or interesting about AI mostly because I because I was when I was asked to be on the podcast I started listening to the previous episodes and they're really incredible and interesting with great guests uh Michael chernus is one that I'll highlight let's see if I can find it um who is a an actor who is in I think uh SpiderMan movies and this and Severance and really talked about the rate it must be a way for me to filter this by only I think a terrible job um so but you can also go to uh twitter.com does twitter.com still work uh Dr Amanda R I think um is Dr Amanda's social media where um you will find Oh weird Twitter does this thing if you're not logged in it doesn't show you their actual tweets it's showing me other stuff anyway okay just really ruined I mean not that Twitter was that great to begin with to be perfectly honest it had a lot of problems but it's a lot worse now anyway so if you listen to that let me know I'd be curious to hear I I said how I did I can't listen I watch my videos back sometimes because I have to but a podcast stuff I can't listen back to I don't know why okay so I wanted to make that and then future plans so let's finish today first of all questions don't forget the time yes 12 15. it's okay I'm barely let me just check my phone make sure there's no like you know the kitchen is on fire kind of messages I mean I think I would have heard about that through other ways time to revive the Mastodon server yeah um so boy I'm tired so let's talk about future plans I have this running list that uh dipomsem started uh at least it's still 2023 Simon likes I don't know if Simon's still watching but Simon likes to point out how I make these lists and never follow up on them but we're gonna check some things off so I did get to these challenges I gotta do this is next on my list I'm hoping to get to this um let's do this I am doing a live stream more nature of code uh okay I can't check this off yet but this still get a check once it's published it'll get a check uh I made a new video about the coding Train website I want to work on the software for the severance TV show it's called MDR macro data refinement uh uh in the Oregon Trail that's it I'm only checking off one more thing almost checking this off so this is my running list is there anything else I want to add to this so what's what do I need to do next so first of all there won't be another live stream until at least kind of two weeks from now I have a very busy first next week is the first is orientation NYU then I have the first week of teaching so the next two weeks uh are completely packed for me so I wanted to make sure I'm really progress the last minute here today was really like the last day I could do a live stream before I start the fall semester so that's why I'm here today over the next two weeks before I do a next live stream I want to finish the nature keep working finish the nature code book and finish and hopefully have at least released on nebula the learning processing series those are the two priorities for me right now then I want to get back to this and I guess I should star some things because let's start what I want to do next so Discord bot tutorials I've got to start because I really want to do those next any P5 yes tutorials I want to do next because I'm teaching intro to P5 this fall and the processing intro series will be done I guess I could put a star there because I need to work on those nature of code book I could put ml5 there but I can only star so many things and then I want to make sure I'm continuing to do coding challenges so Wolfram Elementary CA and I think what I'm doing now just so you know is I'm I'm not doing the cutting challenges during my live streams but I do broadcast the recording sessions for them so that's one reason why you might want to sign up for any of the membership things um uh I will be posting about those in Discord okay I think that's it starting those things updating the gist uh that's it I have this song that I used forever as my like outro song um so uh I'm gonna let that play for about two minutes if you have questions post them in the chat or comments post them P5 geometry I know what that refers to uh but it's probably something that I want to take a look at so we can add that to the Future that future goals for sure um so yeah sorry I've run out of steam here I've been doing this for 14 623 seconds this is my wow I really can't operate my favorite time it's launched time since my first live stream back after turning 50 slash first live stream where I talk about the draft miniature code um we need you in Python maybe someday I mean it would be fun to do like a series like maybe I could just do this as a live stream of like kind of like uh nonpython I mean this would be like a good click bait sort of thing like JavaScript programmer learns python or something like that I could do that as a oneoff I like that idea foreign thanks everybody for tuning in this is I really feel glad I mean one thing that's looking at my analytics like people still watch the coding screen no I haven't published anything new I think since at least May can't remember when maybe the website video came out after then let's look still a minute left on my summer oh I forgot YouTube changed something oh no there's no.com oh by the way logo Rebrand for the coding train there it is we'll stuck that in there you'll see it's here too little little catchphrase traveling with a world of code artisanal handcrafted code that's my new country oh yeah I gotta talk to Jason about that okay uh but if you have ideas for a catchphrase or thoughts about this logo let me know um last thing or two months ago so you can see the uh the last video was two months ago before that was four months ago the last live was three months ago there's very little stuff if you look at my Analytics I'm it's like less than half of what it usually is it's going way way way way way down so I really uh it goes to show that you really need to keep fresh and new content online but people are still watching um the videos so I'm pleased here with that okay if you ever want to post a video about more um so I saw on my song ran out but I'm gonna look Boutique code if you will um geometry coding challenges open Frameworks Arduino gaming okay so the bunch of there's a bunch of questions I'll answer um Arduino open Frameworks all things I would love to do on the channel I just I have this list of things to get to I don't know how to prioritize or whatever but absolutely those are things I would love to do probably not going to happen soon because I just other things I want to get to um do you ever want to post a video about more advanced stuff Ray tracing sounds is a different yeah so I would like to do in the if you look at my coding challenges there is a fairly wide variety of things some of which are quite uh quick and easy well I'm looking at some more sophisticated like the prime spiral I would sort of maybe categorize as fairly beginner friendly it's you know very little code uh just to look at calculating prime numbers and draw this spiral pattern with them a note where they appear on the number line in a spiral whereas the wave function collapse algorithm is very sophisticated and involved in this video it's close to an hour long uh the Mandel bulb is quite uh elaborate sophisticated threedimensional fractal this video is you know pretty long so I like to do a balance um so it would be great and thank you Bruno for your nice comments 666 sorry you missed the start as soon as I hit stop this will be available in the archive so I'm gonna go uh thanks everyone for tuning in I'm just checking the Discord chat thanks Alka thanks everybody for watching thank you to all of you the new people who joined the membership today those of you who just watched if you share things from the coding train on social media if you contribute to the passenger showcase if you read the nature of code all those things uh support the work that I'm doing and I really really appreciate it so you won't see me for at least another two weeks this is what I was going to mention the days my teaching schedule is Wednesday Thursday Friday Tuesday I probably need to be doing a lot of prep so this fall Monday is probably my coding Train Day or a weekend live stream but I think Monday is going to be better so I hope to do either every week what I would like to do is every week you know assuming the nature of code book is done so that really has to happen first so there might not be anything to lock first because that's my deadline for that but as soon as the nature of code book is done I would like to spend every Monday either live streaming or recording more video tutorials like Discord bot or coding challenges so hold me to that friends in the Discord and um hold me to also the fact that the member sticker mailing should go out end of September early October those are things that I am really hoping to do and ask me about those remind me about those but be aware that I am still I didn't allow myself to live stream until I had a full draft in the nature of code book which I now have I think I probably shouldn't allow myself to live stream until I have turned in the finished shaft to the publisher and the deadline for that is October 1st okay goodbye everybody uh hope to see you again soon on social media Discord YouTube all the places the streets of New York City the Wilderness of the Hudson Valley I don't have any travel plans anytime otherwise so those are the places I'll be uh goodbye and goodbye as always I always forget that this dot this stock I don't have a new out animation never forget this stuff I'm gonna do this this dot this dot this start this Dot Song never forget the this Dot somebody could post that song for me I'm gonna say once again Here We Go sing it with me thank you autotune and the internet will fix that for me sing it with me coordinates importance unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what else is there yes kittens thank you very much kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice that look what I get I'm really losing my mind okay let's do it again kittens I feel just sort of like a nice feeling of ease what else is there unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes that was invalid syntax I forgot uh there was one other thing here that I think is important that I will use continuously over and over again all sorts of text generation analysis things that I will use continuously over and over again first thing I need to do is yes okay we're gonna do it kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and duskadonia
