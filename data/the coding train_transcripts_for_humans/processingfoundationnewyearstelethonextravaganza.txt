05:46 - because i don't have anything planned if
05:48 - you will uh indulge me and bear with me
05:51 - let me try to plan things and talk them
05:54 - through
05:55 - right now as i begin with this live
05:57 - stream so first of all if this is the
05:59 - first time you've ever tuned into the
06:00 - coding train welcome thank you i wore
06:03 - this special sweater for you it's not a
06:06 - processing sweater unfortunately but it
06:08 - is themed coating train themed uh i
06:11 - don't love that it's also a branded sort
06:13 - of thing but it's uh i believe this is
06:15 - like a chris minesweeper christmas tree

06:55 - don't know somebody will tell me
06:57 - so
06:57 - okay um usually i have a very as
07:01 - everybody knows who is a viewer of the
07:02 - coding train i usually have an
07:03 - incredibly well organized structured
07:06 - stream where i methodically go from
07:08 - segment to segment tutorial tutorial and
07:12 - everything is well documented and
07:13 - perfect
07:15 - today won't be like that at all it never
07:17 - is that way that was a joke um but
07:21 - today is a day of new year's resolutions
07:23 - for me uh the 2022 i'm hoping uh well
07:28 - will be a better year than 2021 and 2020
07:31 - and we don't need to go into we don't
07:32 - need to rehash
07:34 - how much this year uh
07:38 - was not so great uh for a variety of
07:41 - different reasons at different on
07:42 - different levels for all different
07:43 - people all over the world
07:45 - hopefully we can have a little moment of
07:47 - happiness and joy together in this
07:49 - virtual coding train online space today
07:52 - but i have some personally i have some
07:54 - exciting things that i'm really looking
07:55 - forward to in 2022 which is the ability
07:58 - to dedicate a lot more time to the
08:00 - coding train so if this is your first
08:02 - time tuning in
08:04 - welcome it's gonna take me a couple
08:06 - weeks to get my feet under me i'm still
08:08 - working on a new studio
08:09 - it's going to be solar-powered as of
08:11 - january 5th i'm that's the date where
08:14 - i'll be installing some solar panels
08:15 - here
08:17 - to power all of this equipment um i have
08:20 - as i've talked about a sabbatical from
08:23 - my teaching position my day job so to
08:25 - speak which will allow me more time to
08:28 - hopefully stream every week and produce
08:29 - more tutorials that's not what today is
08:31 - about but i just wanted to let you all
08:32 - know if you're just joining
08:35 - come on board
08:37 - i've said the water is warm but there's
08:38 - no water on the train the train is
08:40 - moving at a at a leisurely pace there's
08:42 - nice views out the windows comfy seats
08:45 - uh
08:46 - little laptops for everybody to code on
08:48 - i don't know
08:49 - where i'm going with this
08:51 - but i want to welcome you and i hope
08:53 - that we can spend a lot of time together
08:55 - being creative
08:56 - coding playing teaching learning from
08:59 - each other the best way to get involved
09:01 - with the coding train community is to
09:03 - join the discord but that's all i'm
09:05 - going to say because today
09:07 - is not about the coding trend i mean
09:09 - these things all blend together on some
09:10 - level but today is not about the coding
09:12 - train today
09:14 - is about
09:17 - the processing foundation i don't have a
09:20 - prop uh
09:22 - i feel like i need to hold something up
09:24 - uh the processing foundation is a heart
09:26 - my heart and soul
09:28 - it is a non-profit uh dedicated to uh
09:33 - that that dedicated to
09:35 - bringing coding to the world uh in
09:38 - creative and exciting ways we maintain
09:42 - different software platforms run various
09:44 - educational and community initiatives
09:46 - and there is a fundraiser going on right
09:49 - now
09:50 - um
09:52 - uh
09:52 - uh i see by the way i see i see i've
09:55 - seen names in the chat that i haven't
09:56 - seen in a long time
09:58 - and it's making me so so happy to see
10:00 - them um
10:01 - and so i'm gonna get to all the ways you
10:04 - can donate and pull up that page and i
10:06 - have a little like uh
10:08 - back
10:09 - channel dashboard thing where i can see
10:11 - if somebody donated and i have my
10:14 - ukulele and i have i'm hooked up to gpt
10:17 - 3 to generate me some lyrics so every
10:19 - time somebody donates
10:21 - i'm going to sing which is probably
10:24 - actually a reason why you shouldn't
10:25 - donate you won't want to donate but i
10:27 - don't know we'll see if it really goes
10:29 - the other way then i'm going to keep
10:31 - singing until you donate how about that
10:33 - um but um uh uh uh my guest my wonderful
10:36 - guest is um waiting in the wings and i
10:39 - wanna uh bring him on and get that out
10:40 - of the way so um every year when i do

12:20 - there are various rewards i will pull up
12:22 - that page and show you what there are
12:23 - what they are i'm planning to donate
12:25 - because there's a beautiful community
12:26 - catalog i would like to get but i want
12:28 - uh dorothy and other members of the
12:30 - processing team have come on to talk
12:32 - about processing um in the past uh and
12:35 - so i wanted you to get to hear from
12:37 - someone directly on the team and so i'm
12:39 - really excited that i have and i'm going
12:42 - to switch over here
12:44 - and now you're seeing me in a different
12:46 - camera and hopefully you're seeing sober
12:48 - and still hearing my audio saber will
12:49 - you say something just so i see if your
12:51 - audio is going through hey hey coding
12:53 - train all right so i can hear i can see
12:55 - sauber's audio going through everybody
12:58 - in the chat wants to see the cat um
13:00 - sovereign this is perfect timing i'm
13:02 - going to let you take it away for a
13:03 - couple minutes and talk about processing
13:06 - um i still can hear you i'm just going
13:08 - to go in and rescue the cat yeah do your
13:11 - thing
13:12 - take your time
13:13 - hey folks um
13:15 - great to be on a coding train and i'm
13:18 - going to talk a little bit about
13:20 - uh some of the work the foundation does
13:23 - the fundraising that it supports the
13:25 - programs it supports
13:27 - um
13:28 - and tell you um a little bit about what
13:31 - um what happens with these programs and
13:33 - then um you know see if there's
13:35 - questions or none so however much time
13:38 - dan needs to corral uh his cats um
13:42 - so uh let me introduce myself a little
13:44 - bit and then i'll share a little bit of
13:46 - a graphic that i have
13:49 - describing the programs
13:52 - so
13:53 - i'm cyber khan i'm a teacher in new york
13:56 - city i've been with the foundation for
13:58 - about three years
13:59 - i started as a community member um
14:02 - started uh hosting events um
14:05 - and then i'm back by the way
14:07 - hey dan how's the cat
14:09 - cat cat made it back
14:11 - i was gonna bring the cat but uh the way
14:13 - i was able to retrieve the cat is i
14:15 - walked over to her and she darted off
14:16 - back into the room where she's supposed
14:17 - to be and then i close the door so
14:19 - later we'll see maybe i can get a cat
14:21 - cam going sorry keep going i will by the
14:23 - way since you mentioned if people have
14:25 - questions i'll keep an eye on the chat
14:27 - you don't have to do that and if
14:28 - questions come up i'll note them down
14:30 - and um and ask you when when you're
14:33 - finished and apologies for not
14:34 - introducing you i'm glad you're
14:35 - introducing yourself thank you all good
14:37 - all right all good
14:41 - yeah so um education community director
14:43 - now processing foundation and
14:46 - uh what i do in that role is uh support
14:49 - educators in our community which is
14:51 - which is odd because almost you know
14:52 - most people in our community are sort of
14:54 - educators or students
14:57 - and then help put up some programs so i
14:59 - want to describe those uh dan's
15:01 - described them in the past uh quite a
15:03 - bit i'm sure dan will uh share more
15:05 - about it um and then there's lots of
15:07 - other programs that community members do
15:09 - too and the organization does too that
15:12 - are upcoming that um i don't have on
15:14 - this list so
15:16 - let me share
15:19 - my chrome
15:22 - oh
15:24 - you know what i have that error of like
15:26 - this is the first time you're trying to
15:28 - screen share on chrome
15:30 - uh on zoom so let me just give me one
15:33 - second let me let me deal with
15:36 - this issue
15:38 - i think i can
15:40 - not restart zoom and do this
15:44 - worst case scenario you can also oh no i
15:46 - see it
15:47 - you see it okay cool all right great
15:50 - um all right so let me just jump into it
15:52 - so uh processing foundation what are
15:54 - some of the programs uh that we do and
15:57 - that they're upcoming in 2022 which is
15:59 - why i wanted to come on and
16:02 - jump on with coding train today uh the
16:05 - reason i actually became part of the
16:06 - foundations that started this event and
16:09 - we've been doing it
16:11 - in person and virtual last couple of
16:13 - years
16:14 - and it's for educators and students
16:16 - mostly k-12
16:18 - oriented
16:20 - and what happens is kind of like what
16:22 - happens on the coding train but more
16:24 - like a 45 minute version of it here's a
16:26 - workshop on doing something fairly basic
16:30 - with creative coding so if you have any
16:32 - teachers or
16:33 - students that need that kind of uh slow
16:36 - pace uh this event might be for you and
16:38 - we're probably gonna do something in
16:40 - late
16:41 - actually that you can join
16:44 - uh so that's one of the programs that
16:45 - the foundation supports uh the second
16:47 - one is something that
16:49 - is maybe even more appropriate to share
16:51 - which is uh we support community members
16:54 - putting on their own events and they're
16:56 - called processing communities they've
16:58 - been happening for the past couple years
17:01 - you can organize one virtually or you
17:03 - know if you're able to do it in person
17:06 - and we're happy to help you um and i'll
17:08 - share the links for each of these types
17:10 - of events in the chat in a minute after
17:12 - i'm done talking you can also email us
17:14 - at this link at this email address below
17:17 - if you have questions about it
17:19 - there's a couple of more that are you
17:21 - might be interested in uh probably heard
17:23 - about them before but uh i'll love to
17:25 - remind you about them um
17:28 - if you're a coder and you are past high
17:32 - school and you're in some sort of
17:34 - post-secondary education uh like you're
17:36 - in
17:37 - uh college or grad school or in a some
17:40 - sort of coding boot camp or some sort of
17:42 - post secondary education you can come
17:45 - and contribute to the open source
17:47 - projects the foundation supports and
17:49 - this is through google
17:51 - and it runs through the summer and we've
17:53 - been part of it for a bunch of years and
17:56 - that's upcoming this year again
17:58 - and then the last thing that i had to
18:00 - share was um
18:02 - the foundation supports fellowships too
18:04 - for artists coders collectives and then
18:06 - more recently teachers
18:08 - and you uh conceive a project you
18:11 - execute it with us and
18:14 - these can be software but don't have to
18:15 - be software generally they're not
18:17 - software um
18:18 - and they're called fellowships and they
18:20 - also occur over the summer so this these
18:23 - are the four things that i could think
18:25 - of that are worth sort of sharing with
18:27 - you all and the last thing is a lot of
18:29 - this stuff to like see what community
18:31 - members are doing or saying about it uh
18:33 - the discourse is the link for that so
18:35 - those were the four things that i could
18:39 - think i'm trying to think of there's
18:40 - something big that i forgot um but oh
18:43 - the last thing i wanted to say was um
18:45 - you know just like dan's hoping to do a
18:47 - lot more
18:48 - in 2022 i'm hoping to do a lot more with
18:50 - my ninja especially with processing
18:52 - foundation
18:54 - thanks to all the fundraising that has
18:56 - happened recently and i think just like
18:57 - where the community is i think there's a
18:59 - lot more that you know we might have on
19:01 - this calendar uh in a year or so so i'm
19:04 - excited to see what other things we can
19:06 - sort of add to the list of things that
19:08 - we do every year
19:11 - that was it for me dan anything that i
19:14 - should talk about or mention
19:22 - i'm listening to you through the zoo so
19:24 - i couldn't hear you right
19:26 - yeah sorry i was actually muted in both
19:28 - places sorry about that right
19:30 - i'm i'm a little bit uh
19:32 - technically frazzled today no that was
19:34 - terrific
19:35 - um i don't have uh um
19:39 - i will what i'm gonna be sort of
19:40 - periodically pulling up different things
19:42 - from about processing during the stream
19:44 - i'll go to the foundation website i'm
19:45 - gonna show the donation page uh we're
19:47 - gonna i'm gonna code some stuff in p5 or
19:49 - processing so
19:51 - people will get to learn more about the
19:53 - work of the foundation and how to get
19:55 - started in coding if it's new to you i
19:57 - guess um
19:58 - the one thing i think that would be
19:59 - great for you to share just
20:01 - if people want to get in touch or have
20:02 - questions especially if they're teachers
20:04 - i know you do a lot you've done these
20:06 - sort of open office hours for um k
20:08 - through 12 teachers what's the best way
20:10 - to get in touch with you and or the
20:12 - processing foundation more general
20:14 - broadly
20:15 - yeah so that email foundation and
20:17 - processing is probably the general inbox
20:19 - and then my one is sauber processing.org
20:22 - yeah if you need help like if you're an
20:24 - educated you're like what do i do in my
20:26 - classroom or hey i run an after school i
20:28 - need help with curriculum or if it's
20:30 - something more serious like hey my
20:32 - district you know needs some
20:35 - support and we're interested in what you
20:36 - guys do
20:37 - uh those are all things i can help with
20:39 - and i would love to help with and i
20:40 - think in this coming year in the next
20:42 - few years we'll have a lot more ability
20:45 - to like sort of support people in that
20:47 - way so please do reach out especially if
20:49 - you reach out in the past and maybe we
20:50 - weren't able to do too much uh we might
20:53 - be able to do a little bit more and this
20:55 - time around so you know please don't
20:56 - hesitate to repeat
20:59 - a question you already asked us so yeah
21:01 - i'll put all the links in the chat i'll
21:02 - i'll hang out and uh it's just i just
21:05 - want to say it's such an awesome thing
21:06 - you know especially in the time of covet
21:08 - to like have the coding train as a place
21:10 - to hang out when there aren't too many
21:12 - other places uh tina hang out in person
21:16 - here we are again
21:17 - uh you and your community

27:37 - project created by casey reese and ben
27:40 - frye august 2001 um i did a live stream
27:44 - for the 20th celebration where i got an
27:46 - ibm thinkpad and tried to run the

28:42 - should be wearing i don't have one i

28:47 - york and i can run the heater in this
28:50 - garage and it's not very strong and it's
28:52 - very loud so um so it makes so i was
28:54 - running it this morning anyway
28:57 - stay tuned for a future live stream and
28:59 - one of the things i want to do in 2022
29:00 - is a lot of retro computing by the way
29:02 - interestingly enough it says on the back
29:04 - here and if you can read that
29:06 - auburn university at montgomery uh apple
29:09 - computer inc uh let's see what year
29:12 - uh this was assembled in taiwan
29:15 - um is there a year or anything on it i
29:18 - don't know 1999
29:20 - 1999 apple computer so this should be
29:23 - able to run the first mac version of
29:25 - processing which you know if we're
29:27 - really feeling ambitious i could try to
29:28 - hook this up today but that's probably
29:31 - not the best use of the live stream all
29:32 - right so
29:33 - um
29:39 - okay so back to this view now ah all c
29:43 - you're perfect all c year year all c or
29:46 - i
29:47 - asked what are the rewards this year i'm
29:49 - so glad you asked so if i click here
29:53 - you can see the various rewards
29:56 - um
29:57 - um and so for 25 oh no you can't see

30:17 - right here
30:18 - this the new website and the new
30:20 - identity was created by design systems
30:22 - international i talked a lot about that
30:24 - on previous live streams by the way
30:27 - they're just i don't know i'm just
30:28 - putting this out there you might be
30:30 - seeing a new coding train website
30:32 - sometime in 2022 and if you like the
30:35 - processing foundation website you're
30:37 - probably going to like the new coding
30:38 - frame website because you know
30:41 - i'll talk about it later later later
30:44 - but you can see uh i don't know which
30:46 - ones of these logos but p5 stickers
30:48 - processing android but this is just
30:49 - beautiful maybe we can do code something
30:52 - with this today
30:53 - um
30:55 - but i think what the most special thing
30:58 - is here under 75 now first of all to be
31:01 - clear this community catalog will be
31:04 - freely available to download for
31:06 - everybody if you want a printed hard
31:09 - copy version of it for 75 you'll receive
31:12 - a limited edition printed copy of the
31:14 - processing community catalog plus a pack
31:17 - of stickers and i just want to say there
31:19 - will be there just might there just
31:21 - might be some coding train stickers and
31:23 - some coding train stickers that are only
31:25 - available as part of this in that pack
31:28 - as well
31:29 - so first ever processing logo sticker
31:32 - and
31:34 - never before seen coding train with a
31:36 - processing logo together in one sticker
31:38 - possibly
31:40 - um so take a look at that um so but the
31:43 - community catalog is really i want to
31:45 - see where i can find some things to show
31:46 - you about it um
31:48 - and then oh so you can see these oh yeah
31:50 - look look at that there are the stickers
31:52 - never before no printing there you can

31:56 - don't got them i don't even have them
31:58 - but i hope to get them the processing
32:00 - community catalog so let's
32:03 - so you might have you know if you've
32:04 - been part of paying attention to the
32:06 - processing community um
32:09 - the to commemorate the 20th anniversary
32:11 - there was a call for community
32:13 - submissions to celebrate shared
32:15 - accomplishments
32:17 - and i believe the the catalog is
32:19 - something like
32:21 - um 700 pages somebody can correct me on
32:24 - that
32:26 - so this is a rendering of what it will
32:28 - look like with a 500 donation you'll
32:30 - receive the silver edition for a 75
32:32 - donation to receive the standard edition
32:34 - orange oh wait a second see i'm just
32:36 - going to donate so what i would like to
32:38 - do today is match any donations that
32:40 - come in up to five hundred dollars which
32:42 - seems like some sort of selfless act but
32:44 - it's a purely self
32:46 - because i i would be purchasing it
32:48 - anyway for myself because i really want
32:49 - to have the community catalog there is a
32:51 - coding train page that i made with the
32:53 - community coding train community that's
32:54 - in the catalog and i know many of people
32:56 - in the chat uh give a shout out in the
32:58 - chat if you are
33:01 - uh
33:02 - if you made a page for the catalog i
33:03 - would love to see your name and

33:16 - standard edition um this is a bit of a
33:18 - table of contents of what is in the

34:52 - the processing foundation
34:53 - uh youtube uh google covers all
34:56 - transaction fees for non-profit giving
34:59 - on the youtube platform
35:01 - however
35:02 - the processing foundation will not have
35:04 - any access to your information google

35:09 - you know whatever they've got on their
35:11 - back end so we cannot give you the
35:13 - rewards
35:15 - through your donation through the
35:17 - youtube button so we i encourage you and

35:22 - if you would like to receive the rewards
35:24 - i you
35:26 - i encourage you oh my goodness we hit
35:28 - the goal i was hoping we i mean i'm glad
35:31 - but i was kind of hoping we'd be like a
35:32 - little bit below the goal could we just
35:34 - change that goal to like i don't know 50
35:37 - 55 000 maybe i don't know but um

39:11 - and write their own version of lyrics
39:13 - for the song
39:14 - but you can go you can go right here
39:16 - right now to coding train on github
39:19 - slash ald lang sein train the chat just
39:22 - went very quiet it's making me nervous
39:27 - did everybody leave
39:30 - oh it was just like a delay oh everybody

41:32 - and alex 1999 says how are you do you
41:34 - feel better i do feel like i've been
41:35 - sick negative tests but i'm a little
41:38 - unsure
41:39 - i have many vaccines in me i don't want
41:41 - to get into it but it's been a rough
41:43 - like week where i was feeling very
41:45 - uneasy and
41:47 - anyway but i feel pretty good today um
41:49 - and i'm here live streaming with you so
41:51 - uh knock on wood um
41:54 - but we'll we'll see i'm still waiting on
41:56 - uh pcr test results um
41:59 - thank you i am 63 years of age retired
42:02 - my grandchildren are coming over and
42:03 - i'll teach what i learned today because
42:06 - retired 32 years is a knuckle tracker
42:09 - i look for i'm getting up there i mean
42:12 - uh i'm not retired and i um i don't know
42:15 - if i i would be amazed to be retired for
42:17 - 32 years but um i'm thinking about it i
42:20 - think maybe this is it i'm gonna retire
42:22 - after today although i think i think
42:23 - i've got i think i could there's room
42:25 - for improvement here so i don't think
42:27 - this should be my last live stream
42:31 - so
42:32 - um a new countdown every hour yeah so i
42:35 - was thinking some kind of new year's
42:38 - countdown
42:39 - in p5 or processing we could have
42:41 - fireworks go off the fireworks could be
42:43 - in the shape of the processing logo this
42:46 - is what i was thinking of programming
42:48 - today but i would like to um
42:50 - kind of collect
42:52 - uh
42:54 - cities around the world where current
42:57 - viewers
42:58 - are
42:59 - watching so there's some ways i could do
43:01 - this i think probably actually to be
43:03 - honest it would be easiest for me to
43:04 - just quickly
43:06 - create a quick google form
43:10 - and then put that out there so let me do
43:12 - that
43:13 - this is uh we're gonna we're gonna um
43:16 - i'm gonna do this real quick
43:18 - so i could go to my um
43:22 - youtube analytics i'm sorry i'm not
43:24 - chuck i'm logging into some things here
43:26 - uh
43:30 - um
43:32 - where where are we going here uh
43:35 - password manager
43:38 - here just listen to this quiet
43:43 - you're gonna be so tired of this song by
43:46 - the end of today
43:51 - [Music]
43:59 - oh my goodness one password don't fail
44:01 - me now not a sponsor
44:05 - 2022 lots of sponsorships open i should
44:08 - not be talking about sponsors today
44:13 - oh my god
44:18 - [Music]
44:35 - dollar sign
44:37 - u
44:38 - i
44:41 - asterisk ampersand
44:44 - one
44:46 - capital w
44:48 - oh my god did i just speak my password
44:50 - out out loud no i was getting my brain
44:53 - it's amazing i can read actual letters
44:55 - and say other ones at the same time
44:57 - [Music]
45:02 - okay
45:03 - new form
45:04 - [Music]
45:08 - any moment now
45:11 - uh
45:13 - where
45:14 - are you watching
45:20 - [Music]
45:25 - i guess there's no reason why i can't
45:26 - show this to you now
45:29 - country
45:31 - i'm short answer
45:34 - uh please answer only once
45:39 - um
45:42 - should i ask for your latitude longitude
45:44 - i don't think so time zone just in case
45:46 - that helps
45:47 - [Music]
45:56 - i think i'm only going to make country
45:57 - required
45:59 - [Music]
46:07 - okay i think we've had enough of this
46:09 - music now how do i do the thing
46:12 - where um
46:15 - manage our responses are collected or
46:17 - protected
46:19 - so like i think no no i definitely don't
46:21 - want to do this limit to one response
46:25 - all right well we'll see how that works
46:29 - send
46:31 - shorten url okay so this google form
46:34 - is about to go into
46:37 - uh
46:38 - the chat
46:41 - it's about to go into the chat do i have
46:43 - the live stream open somewhere
46:47 - um
46:49 - and here it goes
46:53 - so
46:54 - now you should see that google form in
46:56 - the chat i don't see it over here there
46:58 - we go
47:00 - um
47:05 - where are you watching
47:07 - all right i'm going to go back to here
47:08 - for a second while i quickly see if any
47:11 - responses come in
47:15 - not yet
47:16 - but also
47:19 - one thing i'm going to do is i'm quickly
47:20 - going to go yes bruno is saying can i
47:22 - check youtube analytics
47:24 - i can check youtube analytics but i
47:27 - don't believe that there's any way
47:29 - through i looked into this briefly
47:31 - yesterday that the api will give me
47:33 - real-time analytics on people who are
47:34 - watching i'm going to now look at just
47:38 - the countries and i'll show them to you
47:41 - i've watched in the last year
47:43 - so let's go to the last 365 days
47:47 - and audience
47:50 - and um
47:53 - top geographies see more
47:56 - so this i'm going to um
48:00 - i'm always a little bit
48:03 - averse to a little bit um so let me show
48:06 - this to you there's got to be a way i
48:07 - can download this so while we're waiting
48:10 - programming with time zones is horror
48:12 - well we're going to see how it goes all
48:13 - right where's my button all right so
48:15 - this uh in case you're curious this is
48:20 - december 31st 2020
48:23 - to december 30th 2021 the last 365 days
48:28 - if you've been curious as to
48:30 - who watches the coding train you can see
48:33 - the views
48:34 - in uh 17
48:36 - watch time uh us there right at the top
48:40 - india coming in at number two
48:43 - uh germany
48:44 - coming in at number three united kingdom
48:46 - canada brazil
48:48 - france australia netherlands italy
48:50 - poland indonesia russia spain turkey
48:52 - sweden vietnam south korea mexico
48:55 - philippines israel japan taiwan
48:56 - argentina belgium romania hong kong
48:58 - ukraine portugal switzerland denmark
49:00 - pakistan bangladesh thailand singapore
49:02 - south africa malaysia austria morocco
49:04 - hungary norway
49:06 - egypt
49:08 - czechia greece ireland colombia finland
49:11 - nepal new zealand and saudi arabia that
49:14 - is just the top 50 results use exports
49:18 - to view up to 500 results so i'm just
49:21 - constantly afraid of showing some
49:23 - private information
49:25 - um here
49:27 - so i'm going to look for where the
49:29 - export is now
49:31 - uh where do i where's the export button
49:36 - there's got to be an export button
49:40 - um more
49:42 - post playlist no how do i export it says
49:45 - i can export oh download
49:47 - ah there we go comma separated values
49:50 - great let's do that
49:52 - all right so maybe i'll use this rather
49:54 - than the google form
49:58 - i mean i'm basically redoing coding
50:00 - challenge that i did a coding challenge
50:02 - for 500 000 subscribers
50:05 - but that's okay
50:06 - totals chart data table data okay
50:10 - um is this going to give me more than
50:11 - 50.
50:20 - let's look at this data
50:22 - how do i
50:25 - current view
50:26 - please use exports to view up to 500.
50:32 - all right all right let's let me get out
50:34 - of this for a second oh i have 49
50:36 - responses
50:37 - um that's great
50:40 - all right so
50:42 - now um
50:44 - let's get into coding some stuff
50:54 - and let me check donor box
50:56 - because
50:58 - you know and let me check uh to see if
51:00 - we have any new lyrics come in is
51:02 - anybody writing lyrics for me
51:08 - all right we're gonna check donor box
51:09 - all right everybody let's see if another
51:11 - donation has come in
51:15 - i'm gonna hit refresh
51:17 - the last donation was cliff i think
51:19 - cliff deserves a song though
51:22 - we're gonna hit refresh
51:31 - kiffin gish
51:34 - all right
51:36 - time for another
51:38 - ald lang syne now this one's gonna be a
51:40 - little bit tricky first of all doesn't
51:42 - this seem out of tune to you let me tune
51:45 - let me tune this
51:47 - this is very important because as you
51:49 - know my singing
51:51 - is clearly perfect
51:53 - so it you know be such a tragedy if
51:55 - anything were slightly out of tune
52:00 - okay all right
52:05 - too sharp turned down
52:19 - too flat turn it tune up
52:30 - okay
52:36 - uh oh andrew did you donate but not
52:38 - write anything on the donation wall so
52:40 - i'm assuming if you're not appearing on
52:42 - the donation wall it's because you don't
52:44 - want me to shout out your name during a
52:46 - live stream i feel like putting your
52:49 - name on the wall is sort of opting in
52:51 - that's the best i can sort of think of
52:53 - but andrew if you did make a donation i
52:56 - um
52:57 - i have i believe in you i have faith
52:59 - this song is also dedicated to both
53:01 - kiffin and andrew now let's just check
53:04 - to see if maybe there's any issues or
53:06 - pull requests no nobody's written lyrics
53:08 - for me to sing how will i ever go on aha
53:12 - well um i've got my uh window open here
53:16 - to the open ai's gpd3
53:20 - uh model
53:21 - and this is the prompt um that i wrote
53:24 - so i'm gonna take this one out so we'll
53:27 - get a new one just fresh
53:30 - the prompt that i wrote for gpt three is
53:32 - i love to sing the song alden
53:35 - here are the lyrics
53:37 - here are the lyrics
53:42 - i wrote my own version of the lyrics
53:45 - that are computer science themed
53:48 - here they are
53:50 - now i'm going to
53:52 - i'm going to save this here save this as
53:53 - my preset and i'm going to hit generate
53:59 - oh no
54:00 - oh this is not going to
54:03 - should we should we
54:06 - why why why let's try again
54:10 - oh you know what i need to go up here
54:15 - ah there we go this looks better
54:18 - oh my god okay this is kind of awesome
54:22 - oh wow except i don't have the chords
54:24 - here hold on i think i probably know the
54:27 - chords but
54:29 - let me just open up two windows
54:32 - just so i can kind of
54:34 - see them
54:36 - over here
54:38 - uh
54:42 - can i
54:43 - oh this is so hard no no
54:48 - go get get rid of this thank you
54:50 - okay
54:53 - over here
54:56 - move this way
54:58 - this is all going to be fine in a moment
55:04 - shall shell
55:07 - all them shall the
55:10 - bites forget forget
55:12 - [Music]
55:15 - when they first met
55:18 - and
55:21 - [Music]
55:28 - oh no no no no no no oh wow i went boy
55:32 - okay wait i can make this work
55:34 - can the chords be ai generated no yeah
55:37 - the chords are ai generated in the sense
55:39 - that i am definitely artificially
55:41 - intelligent
55:42 - [Music]
55:46 - sure shall
55:48 - all the bites forget
55:53 - when
55:54 - they first met
55:57 - and the bits been friends
56:00 - air they forgot
56:04 - will
56:04 - for they forget
56:06 - those
56:07 - halcyon days
56:11 - yeah those halcyon days
56:27 - essence air bites had a
56:31 - name
56:32 - for bits before they schooled in bitwise
56:35 - ways
56:37 - the
56:38 - bite
56:39 - abode air bit swapping up bite
56:45 - was invented
56:47 - and long before words like gigabyte came
56:50 - along
56:54 - into this complimentary
56:59 - [Music]
57:05 - of memory and
57:09 - i can't i can't match it up this is
57:11 - terrible i'm the worst okay hold on
57:13 - let's just do the last two lines
57:24 - for all bits will take a cup of bitful
57:29 - joy
57:30 - and buy
57:32 - bites on bites well done a cup of bites
57:36 - [Music]
57:39 - thank you
57:41 - thank you
57:42 - thank you thank you see i i i don't know
57:45 - if people should donate
57:47 - uh
57:48 - i gotta work on this some more maybe
57:51 - i've maybe there's some ways i can
57:52 - improve my gpt3 prompt
57:57 - ah all c all c or i made a pull request
58:00 - okay let me have a look-see here uh make
58:03 - sure everything is copacetic
58:06 - um uh where do i go for that
58:10 - um we're going to
58:12 - [Music]
58:17 - oh
58:18 - oh my god what does that must become of
58:21 - my life
58:25 - pull request
58:26 - linux distros
58:30 - okay let's take a look at this one
58:37 - oh this is good
58:40 - this is great
58:41 - thank you all
58:43 - i'll see your eye the next donation
58:46 - i will be um
58:47 - doing this one now unfortunately i just
58:49 - realized i want to um
58:54 - i want to merge this pull request and
58:56 - for some reason i'm not signed in i need
58:58 - to factor this
59:01 - um okay
59:05 - you know you're watching a professional
59:07 - live streaming broadcast when the person
59:09 - who is hosting the broadcast has to go
59:11 - and log into their phone to find their
59:13 - two-factor authentication code to log
59:14 - into some website that they need to use
59:16 - for the live stream
59:23 - uh
59:24 - authenticator you know
59:26 - christmas worked better because i had a
59:28 - wide variety of songs to choose from
59:30 - there's only one new year's song that i
59:32 - can think of which is all like sign okay
59:34 - verify there we go so now uh let us
59:38 - merge in
59:39 - the linux distros version of the song
59:44 - which will be
59:48 - the absolute next version
59:52 - that i sing
59:55 - so all we need
59:58 - your coding flows a bit better than your
60:00 - singing
60:01 - is true and me i am so me
60:04 - so nice to see you it's been so long
60:08 - i'm still the same
60:10 - disaster as i've always been
60:12 - uh let's take a look
60:14 - uh at our donation page we're never
60:16 - going to get to coding if people keep
60:18 - donating
60:19 - um
60:20 - our last donation was from kip and gish
60:23 - and also andrew n
60:25 - i believe and i'm hitting refresh
60:28 - rodrigo cold
60:31 - okay looks like we're getting the linux
60:33 - distro version right now
60:36 - i wonder if i should just do this one
60:38 - with a backing track
60:40 - let's try that
60:42 - [Music]
61:22 - oh
61:24 - linux
61:26 - mint
61:28 - my dear
61:29 - [Music]
61:31 - owl pie
61:34 - linux
61:35 - will take
61:37 - booboo to mate
61:39 - [Music]
61:58 - [Music]
62:07 - eating in a live stream is a bad idea
62:08 - but this orange just looks so
62:10 - so delicious i was gonna eat this before
62:13 - i started to give me a little energy
62:15 - [Music]
62:18 - you know what would be good
62:21 - five nine
62:23 - seven seven one
62:26 - two
62:27 - eight nine
62:29 - eight
62:30 - one
62:31 - four zero three four one
62:37 - seven six
62:39 - five five eight seven
62:45 - zero zero
62:48 - five
62:49 - eight
62:53 - four
62:59 - five six six six one four four eight
63:00 - nine zero seven nine two five eight one
63:01 - two six four
63:04 - huh i don't even write me lyrics i have
63:06 - a book of random numbers
63:10 - um that was for the the that was for
63:12 - matia uh who i noticed in the chat said
63:15 - they made a donation um
63:17 - but that was before today but wanted a
63:19 - song so i let that one go a little bit
63:22 - more
63:23 - all right i'm not sure backing track
63:25 - ukulele uh i don't want to check i need
63:28 - a break i don't want to check any
63:29 - donations right now let's get started on
63:31 - coding something
63:33 - so i'm trying to think
63:35 - of
63:37 - how i want to do this
63:40 - so i could use your help here
63:43 - pie land sign
63:45 - uh
63:47 - i there's a couple options one is
63:50 - uh a web page just has cities and
63:52 - countdown timers
63:55 - uh it could actually be a map
63:57 - maybe i should make a map with little
63:59 - countdown timers on the map
64:01 - and then when they reach zero
64:04 - little fireworks go off should we do
64:06 - that
64:07 - um let's take a look just um through a
64:10 - history of the coding train and if i go
64:12 - into coding challenges
64:14 - and i go
64:16 - to visualizing 500 000 subscribers
64:20 - let's take a look at this project that i
64:22 - made
64:24 - this was done
64:27 - of course i'm not logged in oh great
64:29 - um
64:32 - this was done
64:35 - um
64:36 - saved over two years ago if we look at
64:38 - the video
64:43 - i should really like visualize the
64:45 - p5 or processing community this is from
64:48 - july 9 2018
64:51 - and if we run this code
64:53 - we'll see so this is a good starting
64:55 - point for us
64:57 - all right maybe uh in the interest of
64:59 - time
65:00 - um
65:01 - i it might make sense for me why did it
65:03 - just change colors that was interesting
65:08 - this is using this mappa library which
65:11 - wraps the leaflet
65:14 - wraps different
65:16 - other mapping libraries one of which
65:17 - called leaflet
65:21 - and i'm getting a sort of version of the
65:23 - map zero zero
65:25 - i'm loading subscribers geocsv let's see
65:28 - what that file looks like
65:30 - let's download this
65:32 - so one thing might be interesting to do
65:33 - is actually just um
65:36 - kind of re-run this with the data that i
65:38 - just
65:40 - created
65:43 - what does this data look like so let's
65:46 - let's go open visual studio i'm going to
65:48 - use visual studio code
65:52 - today and then i'll move stuff to the
65:54 - web editor so people can share it make
65:56 - tiny fireworks in the map only in the
65:58 - line of the time zone oh i like that
66:01 - ah we could watch the
66:03 - we could watch like this little line go
66:05 - by of the time zone and have little
66:07 - fireworks go off in it all right we're
66:08 - totally doing that that's going to be
66:10 - fun
66:12 - uh that's going to be fun
66:15 - all right
66:16 - so
66:17 - what am i in oh remember that
66:18 - autoencoder project
66:20 - let's close that out i need to get
66:22 - myself a little bit organized back here
66:25 - um
66:27 - um
66:28 - let's go to terminal here
66:32 - yeah sure update
66:43 - where did i download this
66:48 - um
66:49 - shoot
66:54 - probably under downloads yeah
66:56 - visualizing
66:58 - let's just take this
67:01 - let's
67:02 - go here
67:05 - so we're going to make an improvement
67:07 - off of this previous coding challenge
67:09 - which will save us
67:11 - a lot of time
67:15 - so i'm going to try to
67:18 - let's first make sure it runs
67:21 - i'm going to take the
67:23 - headers off just for a second
67:26 - um i'm gonna run a web server
67:30 - open it up
67:32 - get my javascript console
67:34 - okay
67:36 - so this looks good this is running just
67:38 - fine
67:40 - um and i'm sorry simon i see your
67:43 - comments here i'm sorry i'm not i have
67:45 - too many things open let me actually
67:47 - don't i think i don't need this
67:48 - dashboard open
67:50 - so i can see
67:52 - the um discord chat as well um
67:59 - you know one of the things that i'm
68:01 - thinking about doing in 2022 is uh doing
68:04 - some streaming on twitch uh once a week
68:06 - because the twitch
68:08 - platform has a much friendlier api
68:10 - features where i could do things like
68:12 - zach's suggestion maybe like
68:14 - have things happen based on like who's
68:16 - currently watching that kind of thing
68:18 - um all right okay
68:20 - so
68:23 - um so a couple things one let me go over
68:25 - here i just want to do some cleanup
68:31 - my i don't know if you can hear my
68:32 - children's loud noises
68:34 - i am going to
68:35 - get rid of
68:37 - p5 dom and p5 sound
68:40 - and i just want to make sure i have the
68:42 - newest version of the p5 library
68:45 - so i'm going to grab it
68:47 - from here
68:54 - uh all right so everything's still
68:55 - working i wanted to tell my children to
68:57 - keep it down but i'm not gonna be that
68:59 - guy today
69:00 - no it's fine i can i can i can power
69:03 - through this
69:04 - um it's very distracting
69:09 - you're a little bit loud in there
69:16 - um all right so let's take a look at
69:18 - this okay so we can delete
69:21 - the local versions of the p5 libraries
69:32 - and let's look and see what's happening
69:34 - in this sketch
69:37 - all right so we're loading this
69:40 - csv file called cert and i think i need
69:43 - to make the font a little bit bigger for
69:44 - people to be able to see let's go to 32.
69:49 - so this is a p5 sketch
69:51 - it has this it's making this instance of
69:54 - an object from this other library called
69:56 - mappa which is going to allow me to
69:58 - display that map i'll get to that
70:00 - this is some sort of configuration stuff
70:02 - for example i want the map to be
70:05 - centered at latitude longitude 0 with a
70:08 - zoom of 1.5 so if i change this to 0.5
70:11 - for example and went back and hit
70:13 - refresh you could see i'm zoomed further
70:15 - out but
70:17 - you know it's something that can be
70:18 - changed in real time
70:20 - um
70:22 - so but i'm going to go back to one
70:24 - and that looks good to me
70:27 - and we can kind of move things over but
70:29 - i guess that this is actually the view
70:31 - that i want to see but i'm not going to
70:32 - worry about that right now
70:34 - um
70:38 - that line will take we'll do we'll do a
70:40 - sped up version of it okay we'll do like
70:42 - a time lapse version uh um stop deleting
70:45 - my posts
70:47 - sorry about that uh says that line will
70:49 - take five hours to cross the atlantic
70:51 - yeah
70:52 - and i'm i'm i've got like 45 minutes
70:54 - here to go let's see what we can get to
70:56 - happen all right loading countries.json
70:59 - so countries
71:00 - is just a lookup table with a lat and
71:03 - longitude for every country
71:06 - and then the data itself
71:09 - is country name country id subscribers
71:12 - comments watch time
71:14 - minutes
71:15 - so let's first just try to get some new
71:18 - data
71:19 - so this is the new data that i just
71:21 - downloaded i don't know i've chart data
71:24 - table data totals i don't know what any
71:26 - of these things are
71:29 - but let's
71:32 - let's bring these in
71:35 - so let's look at uh
71:38 - actually it's a hole let me undo that no
71:40 - i won't let me make a uh
71:45 - organize this better make a folder
71:46 - called data
71:49 - this is the new data i'm just putting
71:51 - this in here
71:52 - okay
71:54 - just so i can see what it is so chart
71:57 - data is
71:59 - the date the geography and the number of
72:01 - views i don't understand what this is
72:09 - what
72:10 - oh this is
72:12 - oh it's per day
72:13 - wow that's insane
72:15 - so i could show a time lapse of people
72:17 - i'm like i'm off in a whole other
72:19 - project now but that's interesting chart
72:22 - data table data
72:24 - geography views average duration watch
72:26 - time hours total
72:29 - and i'm not sure i believe
72:31 - yeah
72:32 - i don't know what this
72:33 - oh
72:34 - what
72:36 - oh total u.s so this is what i want if i
72:39 - want totals
72:41 - of views
72:43 - and then just totals is
72:45 - just the total views per day oh that's
72:48 - interesting
72:49 - i mean i don't know what the what i
72:50 - where i'm wandering off into here but
72:52 - let's this is the this is
72:55 - this data i could use
72:57 - for
72:58 - the same exact
73:00 - graph but i want to do it a different
73:02 - way
73:06 - hmm i'm trying to think about this
73:09 - i could i could also go back to um if
73:11 - you'll bear with me i'm just going to go
73:13 - look at the spreadsheet where people
73:14 - entered where they are
73:16 - and um of the people currently watching
73:19 - which might be a little bit more
73:20 - exciting i just don't in case there's
73:22 - some trolling in there i want to
73:24 - just
73:26 - like scan through it there are 52
73:28 - responses
73:31 - so um let me repost that link in the
73:33 - chat
73:35 - so i also want i'm going to download
73:36 - this data in a moment i mean i could
73:38 - obviously connect to the
73:42 - connect to it in real time
73:45 - but i think i want to freeze it so hold
73:47 - on i'm coming back to the live stream
73:56 - where's the chat
74:03 - um
74:04 - okay
74:05 - oh
74:06 - all right so i think i just posted oh we
74:08 - got another donation we have to do
74:10 - another song
74:11 - i just posted the form so i think what
74:14 - i'm going to try to do actually first is
74:17 - put one dot for everybody currently
74:20 - watching so please if you don't mind you
74:23 - know on our system here as best as
74:25 - possible
74:26 - enter into the form just once please put
74:29 - a real city and country i'm going to
74:32 - look up the latitude longitude and time
74:33 - zone i think via some kind of api
74:37 - and we'll see how that goes
74:39 - so for example
74:41 - um i'm going to go so you can enter that
74:43 - stuff in i'm going to go back to my code
74:47 - and uh um just hold on i'm going to just
74:50 - take a one second break here
74:53 - while you're entering in that form
74:58 - [Music]
75:21 - okay
75:26 - so
75:27 - let's just say for the sake of argument
75:30 - that i have
75:35 - um i'm gonna i'm gonna not load any of
75:37 - this data just for a second
75:42 - so all i need is a lat and long
75:44 - to p to make something
75:47 - okay
75:50 - i want to go for more the one dot
75:53 - this dot yes this i could actually get
75:55 - the this dot image
75:57 - so
75:59 - if you don't mind letting me
76:02 - simplify this enormously
76:05 - because i think that'll also be more
76:06 - helpful for those of you who are just
76:07 - watching
76:09 - just right now
76:12 - so we're going to
76:15 - um
76:16 - i'm going to no
76:18 - i'm going to not have this normalizing
76:20 - code
76:22 - we're not going to go through any data
76:24 - just yet
76:25 - we're going to get a country
76:28 - like
76:29 - us
76:31 - i'm going to get the lat long for that
76:33 - country if it exists
76:39 - i'm going to
76:41 - not bother with the count
76:43 - i'm going to push 1
76:47 - we're going to get this i don't need
76:48 - this min max
76:50 - i'm not worrying about the
76:54 - diameter wait lat long
76:58 - the diameter is just going to be 20.
77:02 - just for right now
77:06 - what have i done wrong am i missing a
77:08 - bracket
77:12 - something is wrong let data oh this is
77:15 - an extra bucket
77:17 - right
77:19 - what's going on here
77:27 - country no no okay
77:32 - i'm just hard coding in a country
77:36 - drain map overlay canvas
77:39 - okay
77:40 - hard coding in a country
77:42 - i'm getting the lat long of that country
77:45 - if the lat long exists pushing it into
77:48 - an array
77:50 - and then
77:55 - i'm so confused
77:58 - oh i see this is like
78:00 - uh
78:04 - there we go
78:06 - this is what i'm doing that's the
78:07 - mistake
78:08 - okay
78:09 - now for every country it's not going to
78:11 - be this is not going to be a country
78:13 - anymore forever i'm just going to call
78:14 - this like
78:16 - a viewer
78:17 - of data
78:19 - map
78:20 - the viewer's latitude and longitude
78:23 - to pixels
78:26 - fill oh i see adds this weird frame
78:28 - count thing going
78:30 - fill
78:31 - zoom is the train map zoom scale
78:34 - draw a circle with the
78:36 - viewer's diameter times scale okay so if
78:40 - all goes according to plan
78:42 - this is a very very simple bit of code
78:45 - for me to just draw
78:49 - one dot on the country of the u.s
78:57 - okay cannot read properties of undefined
79:00 - reading us
79:07 - countries
79:11 - u.s there it is
79:19 - um okay country equals us
79:25 - console log
79:27 - lat long let's try this
79:33 - 28.
79:37 - oh i forgot to load
79:39 - i forgot i was commenting out loading
79:41 - the data but i need this data
79:46 - okay there we go look okay my one dot
79:49 - all right so
79:51 - now
79:52 - um
79:55 - let's just make this four
79:59 - okay
80:00 - so now what i can do is i'm going to go
80:03 - back to this google form that hopefully
80:06 - everybody had a chance i'm going to give
80:07 - everybody um i think we've had some
80:09 - donations so i can maybe do one more
80:11 - song i don't know i don't want to do any
80:12 - more songs
80:13 - let's get some momentum going here um
80:16 - i'm just going to go back and i'm
80:17 - checking that google form now
80:20 - uh oh i have 80 responses that's great
80:23 - and i'm just looking at it
80:25 - no bad words
80:27 - that i can see nothing obvious there
80:29 - could be some
80:30 - and by the way um
80:32 - it's interesting to see okay great all
80:34 - right so i'm gonna st
80:36 - i could i can re-download oh 81.
80:40 - so i'm going to download this data
80:42 - um i think i can show it to you um you
80:45 - know i will quickly move away
80:48 - if something appears
80:50 - unseemly in here um so
80:53 - um basically uh
80:56 - um
80:57 - hopefully i can manage
80:58 - with uh the like strange way all the
81:02 - data is formatted but we can see all
81:03 - these locations
81:05 - so let's now uh just download this
81:10 - and you know sometimes it makes it
81:11 - easier let's do download
81:15 - as a
81:16 - csv
81:18 - and i'll come back and redownload this
81:20 - later if more people are entering
81:24 - viewers csv
81:26 - so let me bring this in over here into
81:29 - data
81:30 - and we have timestamp city country
81:33 - so
81:34 - um
81:38 - where am i here so i want to load
81:44 - i'm going to call it viewer data
81:50 - viewer data equals load
81:55 - table
81:59 - um
82:01 - viewers.csv
82:05 - comma
82:06 - header
82:09 - and then like so i think the way that i
82:12 - go through this
82:16 - for i'm it's in the code
82:20 - i had it in here so let's take a look i
82:22 - can't remember the way that i go through
82:24 - a csv
82:26 - um
82:27 - for
82:29 - load table let row of youtube data dot
82:32 - rows okay
82:35 - let row of viewer
82:38 - data.rows
82:40 - and then let country
82:42 - i'm just going to do start with country
82:45 - equal
82:50 - row dot
82:53 - um
82:56 - row dot
82:58 - row.get
83:00 - and so i'm using the so
83:02 - what am i doing here
83:05 - p5 has a special function built into it
83:08 - called load table which will parse a csv
83:11 - file for you otherwise i'd have to like
83:13 - load it as text and use split and chop
83:15 - it up by commas and so i can use this
83:17 - kind of fancy low
83:18 - loop to look at every single row and
83:21 - then what i want to get out of every
83:22 - single row just for the moment
83:25 - is the country i actually want to use
83:28 - the city i'm going to get the city the
83:30 - city is what i want to use
83:32 - so let's just go straight for it get
83:37 - city
83:41 - and then i'm going to say console.log
83:43 - city
83:45 - and let's just see what happens
83:51 - okay
83:52 - looks like there's a problem loading
83:53 - your data file
83:57 - viewers.csv
83:58 - ah it is in a folder called data there
84:01 - we go
84:02 - great so we can see i've got a list of
84:04 - all these cities now
84:08 - so i should be able to
84:10 - how do i find the latitude longitude of
84:13 - a city
84:14 - there's got to be some nice api i can
84:16 - use to do that
84:18 - api
84:19 - lat long of city
84:22 - geocoding
84:24 - well this is an ad i probably shouldn't
84:26 - start with whatever was advertised to me
84:30 - smarty streets developers geocoding api
84:32 - google has one open weather map
84:36 - i've used this before
84:39 - um okay
84:42 - i need an api key i have an api key
84:47 - somebody in the chat tell me if you if
84:48 - you have a better one and q
84:52 - q one of the p5 leads of p5.js is in the
84:55 - chat hello um you deserve a song i'm
84:58 - going to check in a minute
85:02 - um
85:05 - sorry
85:06 - as i look at my phone to try to find my
85:08 - open weather map password i'm like i
85:10 - have all these notifications
85:12 - let's see if i have it shared
85:15 - saved see this is if i had a chance to
85:17 - prepare in advance
85:19 - open weather map i i have a password
85:23 - now the question is what email did i use
85:25 - i'm going to just click away from this
85:26 - while i try to
85:28 - log into this
85:29 - and see if i have a valid api key
85:33 - which you will all immediately have
85:35 - access to
85:37 - so this this api key is going to be no
85:39 - good
85:40 - uh i already forgot what i was typing
85:45 - remember me
85:47 - that was not
85:49 - i think i mistyped the password
86:01 - and that did not work but could it be
86:15 - no
86:17 - this is not going very well
86:20 - this is not going very well what i'm
86:22 - trying to do right now in case you just
86:24 - tuned in is i'm looking for an api that
86:27 - can if i can pass it a city name
86:30 - i can get
86:31 - a um if i can pass it a city name i can
86:34 - get a lat long value and i know that
86:36 - open weather map will do this and i
86:38 - should just create a new account
86:40 - so i'm going to go through the process
86:42 - of doing that
86:44 - and i'm going to show it to you to the
86:46 - extent
86:48 - that um
86:53 - i'll create a new one under my coding
86:55 - train email
86:57 - uh well i don't usually use google's
86:59 - password manager thing but let's
87:01 - use it right now
87:05 - um i'm kind of them very robotic
87:09 - account email already taken oh maybe
87:11 - that was the password
87:14 - this is such a failure this is what
87:18 - anybody else
87:20 - anybody else have uh um
87:24 - anybody anybody else has a a better um
87:27 - suggestion
87:29 - ah all right um
87:32 - g um
87:33 - la long
87:35 - city to lat long lookup table
87:40 - maybe there's a big json file i could
87:41 - download
87:43 - cities of the world in json
87:46 - cities
87:49 - it's 12.4 megabytes so that's a good
87:52 - sign
87:52 - oh look at this
87:54 - this is good i'm just gonna use a big
87:57 - giant file
87:59 - i mean
88:00 - we're going to have some issues with
88:01 - spelling errors but we're going to do
88:03 - our best
88:04 - okay
88:07 - all right so we're going to download
88:08 - this
88:11 - save this as cities.json
88:20 - okay so um
88:23 - we're going to load
88:26 - cities equals cities.json so we're doing
88:29 - this based off cities now
88:34 - and what i'm going to do now is also
88:36 - just say
88:39 - and if i look at cities how is it
88:40 - organized
88:42 - it's a big array
88:54 - so okay okay okay okay i know it's a big
88:56 - file you don't want to look at it so big
88:59 - um
89:04 - i did tell them to quiet down but they
89:06 - did not listen to me there's some
89:08 - chattering away happy on december 31st
89:10 - we're just all having a party no school
89:11 - today let's play play play loudly loud
89:14 - no no more out of the dad is trying to
89:16 - concentrate really hard on coding a
89:18 - really important project with some small
89:20 - amount of people watching
89:23 - is no good my city is not on there armor
89:26 - we will correct that for you so any
89:28 - cities that are missing from this file
89:29 - we will add in manually okay we can do
89:32 - that
89:33 - uh
89:34 - console.log
89:35 - city let's just make sure this is coming
89:37 - through
89:40 - uh
89:42 - data
89:46 - okay
89:48 - cities are coming through there's an
89:49 - error country is not being defined
89:53 - okay
89:55 - where
89:56 - oh
89:58 - okay let's take this out
90:02 - okay
90:05 - sketch 36
90:11 - so that's the viewer data how come this
90:13 - didn't come out
90:23 - console what i don't have this data it
90:25 - seems cities dot length
90:28 - undefined
90:31 - cities
90:32 - load json data cities
90:35 - let cities
90:42 - okay
90:43 - oh it's an object
90:46 - so it's not actually an array
90:50 - it is an array
90:52 - how come it didn't load it as an array
90:57 - and this is fine
91:03 - can i just do let
91:08 - city of cities
91:17 - oh no
91:20 - so this is not iterable
91:24 - all right i have an idea
91:33 - i'm going to put it in an object
91:38 - now i have to get all the way to the
91:39 - bottom which is going to be very hard
91:45 - there's a lot of cities this is crazy
91:47 - what i'm doing it's got to be a better
91:49 - way
91:50 - get to the bottom get to the bottom of
91:52 - this
91:56 - okay
91:58 - oh come back to me
92:01 - no
92:04 - that's not formatted correctly
92:06 - it really hates this 12 megabyte file
92:13 - what have i done
92:18 - can i just put it in
92:23 - make it the first
92:24 - ah
92:27 - shouldn't that work all right let's hold
92:29 - on
92:32 - okay
92:38 - see you later
92:43 - uh it is a big city's object array from
92:46 - cities me oh i could have done array
92:48 - from cities
92:49 - uh
92:50 - it's not 2022 yet max
92:54 - oh this is what a wonderful group of
92:56 - people in the chat watching me have a
92:58 - total meltdown here trying to just load
93:00 - a 12 megabyte json file which was
93:02 - probably a terrible idea in the first
93:03 - place because now i have to match up the
93:05 - way that you typed your city i know it's
93:07 - not a dictionary i'm going to make it
93:08 - into a dictionary that's what i'm trying
93:10 - to do okay hold on
93:13 - yeah i know it's not iterable i don't
93:15 - want to iterate it just yet
93:19 - for all the iterable
93:22 - okay
93:23 - just give me something here
93:26 - there we go look at that
93:28 - look at this
93:34 - [Music]
93:40 - i made it work the way i wanted it to
93:52 - once again i got a little bit dizzy
93:56 - oh i think i'm going to pull the muscle
93:58 - in my back
94:00 - all right everything's going to be fine
94:01 - everybody
94:02 - getting there it's a little kind of warm
94:04 - in here even though it's quite cold in
94:07 - temperature
94:08 - okay everyone so now
94:10 - um
94:13 - for uh four let city of cities dot
94:16 - cities
94:19 - this should work console log
94:22 - city
94:23 - there we go look at that look at that
94:25 - boom boom boom oh i'm console logging
94:27 - like 128 bazillion million cities this
94:29 - is terrible it's never going to end oh
94:32 - dear what have i done
94:34 - what have i done
94:36 - what have i done okay we got to the end
94:40 - what's that sound
94:42 - weird weird creaking hum
94:45 - what strange creature is roaming through
94:47 - the attic of this garage
94:50 - okay
94:50 - um all right now
94:53 - next up i want to make a lookup table so
94:56 - we're going to call this
94:58 - city lookup
95:00 - and make it an object
95:03 - so
95:07 - as i go through every city
95:10 - i want the name to be the thing that
95:13 - gets me the lookup
95:17 - um
95:19 - console.log oh but
95:21 - so um city dot name dot to lowercase so
95:26 - i definitely want to make everything to
95:27 - lower case that'll help a little bit
95:30 - okay those are all the cities to lower
95:32 - case
95:34 - um
95:36 - let name
95:38 - now we're going to i'm sure there's
95:40 - higher order array function magic that i
95:42 - could do to transform the array to like
95:45 - a lookup table object
95:46 - but i'm going to do it manually i'm
95:48 - going to say city lookup
95:53 - city lookup name equals that city
95:57 - so all of the metadata associated with
96:00 - the city i can get to just by its name
96:03 - this way when i go to the viewers
96:06 - and i get their city and i say to
96:11 - lowercase
96:13 - i should be able to now say console.log
96:17 - city and then console.log
96:20 - city lookup
96:23 - that city to see if i can get the
96:25 - metadata so let's see
96:28 - and then let me just put in a little
96:30 - like line breaky thing
96:33 - so out of the 80 or so values that i
96:35 - currently have of people watching two
96:38 - locale lower case thank you
96:42 - to locale lowercase i've never used that
96:45 - but i like that suggestion oh again
96:50 - just as i put that there and my i have a
96:52 - discord notification which is nothing to
96:53 - do with anything okay
96:55 - two lowercase we're gonna celebrate the
96:57 - new year i gotta check donations sink
96:58 - some old lang sign
97:00 - uh next year could be a rocket that goes
97:02 - from one city to the next one and get
97:04 - some fireworks at each city that's a
97:05 - great idea
97:08 - this i'm hoping is going to get
97:09 - somewhere at some point
97:14 - okay
97:16 - so holly springs we got
97:19 - stuttgart
97:20 - seville
97:22 - batumi
97:23 - sturbridge
97:24 - golden colorado hmm
97:27 - paris blacksburg so new delhi new delhi
97:30 - we got so some aren't working
97:35 - so why didn't it get bangalore
97:38 - let's see if we can figure this out like
97:39 - bangalore should 100 be in there
97:51 - is there another way it could be written
98:00 - that's my question
98:02 - so all right let's print out all the
98:04 - ones where it doesn't find anything oh
98:06 - we have a donation
98:08 - i'm gonna have to do a song has anybody
98:10 - written me more lyrics
98:12 - or do i have to use ai again because
98:16 - refresh here any pull request no
98:19 - really only two only two
98:22 - includes
98:24 - includes ah yes
98:27 - that's a good idea
98:29 - but first let me make a list
98:31 - of
98:32 - okay
98:36 - uh
98:38 - let me
98:39 - i'm gonna like make a list of everything
98:41 - that it doesn't have
98:55 - so this is only going to print out any
98:57 - that it couldn't found bangalore is now
99:00 - bengaluru thank you akshat so this is
99:03 - good to know so this we're going to do
99:05 - some data cleaning everybody
99:09 - all right
99:10 - so
99:11 - toronto
99:13 - and there goes the heater
99:15 - sometimes you just can't stop the heater
99:16 - from going on
99:18 - um
99:20 - so why is toronto not in there
99:25 - that seems crazy
99:31 - for ron
99:34 - toronto is there but why is there a
99:36 - toronto in the u.s
99:38 - that's weird
99:41 - there's a lot of toronto so that doesn't
99:43 - make any sense
99:47 - there's so many cities with the same
99:48 - name this is really going to be a
99:50 - problem
99:51 - all right let's go to um
99:55 - the uh the data here so let's
100:00 - so
100:00 - this should be bengaluru let's just
100:03 - check if bengaluru is in there
100:07 - yep
100:08 - so
100:09 - that we can fix
100:12 - bangalore should be bengaluru
100:23 - now we can fix
100:28 - okay now why did it is there was there
100:31 - like a space with toronto
100:37 - it's the first one which is a little
100:39 - weird
100:43 - salah north richland hills
100:46 - amman regai phoenix
100:52 - phoenix
100:56 - this is why i want to use an api now so
100:58 - it's there
100:59 - what did i miss
101:07 - this seems weird
101:10 - well i guess i should okay row get city
101:12 - to lower case data city look up city
101:20 - uh
101:41 - oh it got four
101:45 - it got four phoenix's
101:53 - i'm lost
101:57 - yeah good point
101:59 - oh i have a console ah
102:02 - i have that there no wonder
102:05 - oh my gosh
102:07 - no wonder thank you for that oh my
102:09 - goodness that was like the worst
102:12 - the worst error i don't know what to
102:14 - play for that
102:17 - all right
102:20 - okay
102:20 - so this makes more sense
102:23 - probably like accents we got some commas
102:26 - here so these are the cities that didn't
102:28 - work i bet you if i
102:30 - get rid of the common new york there
102:32 - we're gonna do a little bit more
102:37 - yeah we're gonna do a little bit more
102:38 - cleanup west niacc
102:42 - the problem is i really want to send it
102:44 - the full country because there's going
102:46 - to be some serious problems there
102:48 - um
102:50 - columbus i can fix
102:55 - um
102:56 - golden
102:59 - i can fix by taking out the state i mean
103:01 - that data is good data
103:08 - so i okay so i'm going to have to leave
103:11 - the fact that some of these don't work
103:13 - right now
103:15 - just to see if we can get to having the
103:18 - dots appear on the map
103:22 - okay
103:29 - let's see here so we're going back to
103:31 - the code
103:32 - so now
103:39 - so for each viewer
103:48 - so now
103:51 - i want to create
103:53 - a viewer
103:56 - oh i'm just going to say viewers
103:59 - dot push
104:03 - that data
104:07 - and then
104:14 - and then here
104:18 - oh i guess it's called data what did i
104:20 - call it
104:21 - no this should be viewers
104:24 - so each viewer
104:28 - gets the city data pushed into an array
104:31 - and then each viewer of viewers
104:34 - and i forget what
104:36 - the object looks like
104:38 - so let's just console.log viewer
104:41 - and then i'm going to say no loop
104:44 - and see if this works
104:46 - okay good
104:48 - so now
104:51 - why do i have a oh yeah country latitude
104:54 - longitude name so it's just
105:00 - l-a-t-l-n-g so this should actually
105:03 - still work l-a-t-o but this should be
105:05 - lng
105:09 - and
105:10 - um
105:12 - i don't have i'm just going to make
105:14 - everyone
105:15 - 16 pixels
105:19 - and that should work so let's see and
105:22 - then i'm going to take out the new loop
105:25 - see what happens
105:26 - okay
105:27 - this is currently
105:30 - why am i still console logging something
105:32 - oh yeah
105:38 - this in theory is a dot for everybody
105:41 - watching right now
105:44 - uh
105:48 - everybody who entered
105:50 - instead of reg
105:52 - regular okay so the problem is i need a
105:55 - better way of getting the latitude and
105:58 - longitudes
105:59 - but
106:00 - and also if two people are in the same
106:03 - place
106:04 - so a couple things i want to do i think
106:06 - i'd like to give everybody a little bit
106:08 - of random offset
106:11 - um
106:12 - and uh also give some alpha
106:15 - so let's
106:18 - just so we can see if there's more than
106:20 - one
106:21 - i think if i just do random seed
106:23 - five
106:29 - it should
106:33 - like where is the city that more than
106:35 - one person entered
106:42 - like if two people i don't know if
106:44 - somebody can tell me what city this is
106:45 - over here that maybe two people entered
106:49 - or it's just coincidentally like
106:52 - like were there a lot of new yorks
107:04 - this must be all the new york people the
107:07 - normal person donate
107:10 - okay can people see themselves
107:13 - is somebody is somebody a rally north
107:16 - carolina
107:17 - so i forgot what the point of doing this
107:19 - was oh we're gonna make little new
107:21 - year's fireworks and countdowns for all
107:23 - of these spots
107:25 - all right let's see
107:27 - everybody knowing now here's the thing
107:30 - if you do not see your dot here
107:33 - if you do not see your dot here
107:37 - what i would like you to do is re-enter
107:39 - to the google form
107:41 - so i'm going to do i'm going to check
107:42 - donations and do a song
107:44 - but i'm going to get everybody to
107:46 - re-enter their data
107:48 - so but now if you see your dot here you
107:51 - don't need to re-enter your data if you
107:53 - think that your dot isn't there if this
107:58 - is you if one of these is you
108:01 - um it's not showing up re-enter
108:04 - your city name
108:06 - matching
108:10 - uh whatever is in this
108:14 - so like montreal
108:16 - like why is
108:23 - ah because of the accent
108:26 - so montreal didn't show up because of
108:28 - the accent
108:31 - so i need the correct accent so i could
108:34 - correct some of these
108:35 - but if you're still watching
108:38 - um
108:39 - and that's if you're bangalore also
108:42 - please change it because i changed those
108:44 - mango manually so i'm going to
108:46 - re-download the data
108:49 - so let me
108:50 - repost the form
108:55 - no i don't want to share this i want to
108:56 - i want to share the form
108:58 - send the form
109:01 - so i'm going to post this form back to
109:03 - the chat
109:10 - we're going to get fireworks going
109:14 - you need to make it so you can edit your
109:15 - responses can i do that
109:18 - yes okay hold on
109:20 - that would be excellent okay
109:22 - uh settings
109:27 - allow response okay i have now allowed
109:29 - response editing
109:32 - so
109:32 - hopefully so you can either also edit
109:34 - your response
109:37 - edit your response you can see i have 90
109:39 - responses now
109:41 - or you can just re-enter it because
109:44 - if it failed it'll still fail and the
109:47 - correct one will come in okay
109:49 - so now i am going back
109:52 - to
109:53 - um
109:55 - the stream
109:58 - and i am
110:00 - oh yeah now oh the link to the city the

110:12 - so this is i'm also going to post this
110:14 - into the chat
110:17 - this is the list of the cities so you
110:20 - want to make sure your city name
110:23 - matches
110:25 - i could remove the accent that could be
110:26 - a way but let's try to match the accents
110:29 - okay everybody

118:21 - version control
118:23 - magic
118:26 - okay so viewers dash 2
118:29 - then goes to
118:31 - can i just like drag it into uh
118:34 - visual studio code
118:36 - oh where where are you no
118:39 - computer
118:42 - ah what is going on i don't know how to
118:44 - use a computer
118:46 - help
118:48 - finder where did you go oh my god you're
118:50 - the worst
118:53 - i cannot operate
118:55 - this machine i cannot operate it
118:58 - what has happened
119:01 - okay hold on there ah
119:04 - what just what
119:06 - viewers too
119:08 - your virgin my virgin control was too
119:10 - much for it viewers dash two
119:12 - sketch
119:16 - so we don't need this
119:18 - very simple sketch here
119:22 - viewers
119:24 - dash two
119:26 - so just to remind you
119:31 - i am loading
119:34 - the spreadsheet of all of the viewers
119:36 - who entered in their city their honest
119:39 - city of where they are with the precise
119:40 - spelling of the way that it also is in
119:42 - my giant json file of cities and
119:44 - latitude longitudes good this is the
119:46 - optimal absolute best way of doing this
119:48 - nobody could possibly come up with a
119:49 - better solution
119:52 - and then i am going to
119:54 - for every city that the viewer
119:56 - is i'm going to look up
119:59 - and put it into an array with the
120:01 - latitude and longitude then i'm going to
120:04 - find that latitude longitude convert it
120:05 - to a pixel location
120:07 - and draw it on a map
120:12 - and
120:13 - i'm gonna hit refresh
120:16 - and we're gonna see
120:18 - everybody's location
120:22 - this is looking pretty good do we have
120:23 - new zealand nobody from new zealand no
120:25 - australia
120:26 - alaska
120:28 - i really want to do like some hovering
120:30 - over
120:31 - we can see some clusters so here's
120:33 - everybody currently watching
120:36 - the live stream at the moment now
120:39 - we need to celebrate new year's for
120:41 - everybody
120:43 - so uh
120:48 - let's see where uh
120:52 - oh my god um where has it like
120:55 - like what see like what time it is in
120:58 - malaysia for example
121:02 - um
121:08 - oh my goodness
121:10 - happy new year
121:11 - malaysia
121:13 - happy new year ah
121:20 - man
121:21 - we missed it
121:23 - we missed it happy new year
121:25 - happy new year
121:28 - oh jason i wonder if your athens got put
121:31 - into greece
121:32 - because of my highly sophisticated
121:35 - system
121:39 - so
121:42 - these are the ones that aren't showing
121:43 - up
121:46 - because i
121:47 - need to correct them
121:49 - this still didn't show up
121:52 - i don't know why
121:53 - but montreal worked right
121:56 - so we're still missing some
121:59 - zurich maybe it has an accent in it st
122:01 - petersburg you think it's listed as it
122:03 - without the full worth saint i don't
122:05 - know
122:06 - anyway this is this is gonna have to do
122:09 - because
122:11 - i've got a lot of time here folks we're
122:13 - gonna make
122:14 - some fireworks happen okay
122:17 - we're gonna make some fireworks happen
122:23 - it just turned midnight in pakistan
122:28 - ah wait i'm seeing in the the discord
122:31 - chat string normalize replace
122:34 - we'll strip accents
122:36 - uh
122:41 - uh
122:41 - all right that's that so i'm i'm i'm
122:44 - gonna
122:45 - i'm gonna post this
122:47 - and hope um that people can help me make
122:49 - it work better but ultimately i should
122:50 - really be using a geocoding api which
122:53 - would probably let me put stuff in in
122:55 - much more arbitrary form i should have i
122:58 - should have probably
123:00 - spent a little longer with open weather
123:02 - map but
123:03 - we're going to go next to
123:09 - fireworks
123:12 - and
123:14 - we're going to
123:17 - grab
123:20 - this code
123:24 - oh are you kidding me
123:26 - oh that's the saddest thing i've ever
123:28 - seen i wrote this code so long ago it's
123:31 - not even using classes
123:33 - okay so hold on i probably hopefully
123:38 - corrected it
123:42 - in the web editor version because i i
123:44 - have been doing that periodically
123:47 - yes
123:49 - yes
123:50 - okay
123:51 - so now we're gonna make a new
123:53 - file
123:54 - we're gonna call it firework.js
123:59 - put that in here i'm going to make a new
124:01 - file
124:02 - call it particle.js
124:05 - and then
124:11 - that goes here now i forgot how this
124:14 - works
124:15 - um let's just
124:16 - so we make a firework and then update
124:20 - and show and if it's done splice it okay
124:23 - so this shouldn't be too hard
124:25 - so basically i need now in my main
124:28 - okay so first on index.html
124:31 - i need to reference
124:34 - firework
124:37 - and particle
124:38 - so i'm now pulling in the coding
124:40 - challenge of fireworks
124:43 - and
124:45 - um
124:46 - i'm going to make an array
124:49 - called fireworks
124:52 - and then in setup i'm going to say
124:55 - fireworks
124:56 - dot push
124:58 - new firework
125:03 - i don't know what
125:05 - um right i just give it oh no i don't
125:07 - even give it a uh oh wait because it
125:09 - doesn't i'm just gonna all right fine it
125:11 - gets its own location
125:13 - and then
125:15 - and then let's just write a nice little
125:17 - loop
125:19 - to draw them we're going to see what
125:21 - happens here
125:29 - gravity is not defined firework.update
125:34 - i guess i must have made a global
125:36 - variable called gravity
125:41 - apply force gravity
125:45 - huh
125:46 - well
125:51 - let's just make an arbitrary
125:53 - vector pointing down
125:59 - oh there it is did you see it
126:03 - there's the firework
126:05 - hey that's exciting
126:06 - okay okay this is good this is good so
126:09 - first of all the map is very bright
126:11 - so
126:12 - um
126:14 - a couple things one is
126:20 - uh the firework colors
126:24 - should probably be much darker it gets a
126:27 - hue
126:29 - and
126:31 - where do i draw the particles
126:34 - here okay so let's just make them darker
126:38 - so i think it'll show up better
126:45 - oop no stroke is not defined
126:49 - where did i type that
126:51 - here
126:55 - there we go
126:57 - see that beautiful firework that went
126:59 - off there
127:00 - now
127:01 - what i'm going to do
127:03 - i could have just asked for lat long
127:06 - i should have had everybody just enter
127:07 - their lat long we could go back and do
127:09 - that okay
127:12 - all right so now what i want to do is
127:14 - one at a time each dot is going to be
127:17 - starting a firework
127:20 - so
127:21 - um now where the firework begins
127:27 - is
127:30 - x y
127:32 - no
127:33 - where's the firework
127:37 - it gets a random location so i want to
127:39 - be able to give the firework
127:45 - a location
127:49 - so i'm going to pass in an x and y
127:53 - okay i'm gonna pass in an x and y
127:58 - and then
128:00 - um
128:02 - so in my sketch now
128:07 - i'm going to have
128:09 - a counter
128:13 - viewer counter equals zero i might want
128:16 - to sort all the viewers by time zone so
128:18 - we'd see the like happy new year ripple
128:20 - across
128:22 - um and i'm going to say
128:27 - in draw
128:31 - if and let's just do it once every 30
128:33 - frames
128:36 - uh
128:39 - new firework so hold on the
128:44 - the x y
128:46 - uh
128:49 - so uh
128:52 - uh viewer
128:54 - equals viewers
128:58 - uh viewer counter is that right
129:01 - like i want to get what is the current
129:03 - viewer and then i want to make a new
129:06 - i need a new like pixel location
129:11 - i need that pixel location which i can
129:13 - convert that viewer's latitude longitude
129:15 - to the pixel location x y
129:19 - and then create a firework at pix.x
129:21 - pix.y
129:25 - and then
129:27 - a new firework yeah that's good
129:30 - and then i'm still going to draw all the
129:32 - viewers just so i can see and then i
129:33 - should be able to say
129:35 - viewer counter
129:37 - plus plus
129:43 - viewer count is not
129:44 - defined what did i call it
129:47 - viewer counter
129:50 - say viewer index
129:52 - let's
129:54 - whoops let's call it viewer index
129:58 - so viewer index
130:02 - viewer index and obviously i'm going to
130:03 - get to the end of the array at some
130:05 - point but i'll deal with that is there
130:07 - is the mic making weird sound
130:21 - do we see any fireworks
130:26 - oh they're going way yep i see them
130:28 - they're go okay so they're launching way
130:29 - too high
130:31 - so
130:32 - i believe in the firework
130:39 - um
130:40 - which actually makes a particle
130:43 - and it gets an initial velocity
130:46 - which i need to make much less
130:51 - um let's just see
130:54 - if that helps
130:58 - and
131:00 - i don't understand where the gravity
131:01 - thing happens i'm not going to worry
131:02 - about it
131:06 - where was this gravity thing happening
131:12 - i don't understand
131:14 - i don't remember this code
131:20 - oh yeah there we go
131:22 - so they're all being the same color
131:25 - right now
131:27 - and they're
131:31 - okay so this is good
131:38 - yeah i think there's some interference
131:40 - going on i thought i had that corrected
131:43 - with this mic but i'm gonna not worry
131:45 - about it
131:47 - okay wait wait this is good
131:51 - all right it's just very hard to see why
131:53 - is it in a different
131:55 - oh because of the random seed
131:59 - okay we don't need that random seed
132:01 - anymore
132:06 - so let's get rid of this all right we
132:07 - don't need to draw
132:11 - all the dots
132:15 - or oh yeah so let's do that
132:31 - i bet you i could zoom and pan the map
132:33 - also automatically
132:37 - yeah
132:38 - yes print the city
132:41 - so let's have
132:44 - i like this idea
132:47 - so first of all
132:50 - i want these particles to be more
132:52 - visible
132:54 - hue saturation
132:56 - brightness
133:03 - yeah that's better darker
133:09 - so
133:10 - if it's not a firework do this otherwise
133:15 - and then text
133:17 - all right
133:18 - so let's get the city in here
133:30 - so
133:31 - now
133:32 - when i create
133:35 - the firework new firework
133:40 - oh
133:52 - uh
133:54 - oh yeah
133:56 - so i don't want the city here
134:02 - and what i want is to see the city
134:06 - um
134:15 - let's just put it in a fixed location
134:16 - just for a second
134:25 - is it font size or text size i can't
134:27 - remember
134:28 - i think it's text size
134:30 - in p5
134:36 - city is not defined this
134:44 - [Music]
134:52 - city is not defined number seven line
134:55 - seven
135:00 - when i made the firework
135:04 - when i made the
135:06 - firework oh god
135:12 - where do i make the firework here
135:15 - oh
135:16 - now i need the city the name
135:22 - viewer
135:25 - was it name i don't even remember
135:27 - city
135:34 - is that what it is
135:40 - hold on
135:41 - console.log
135:43 - viewer
135:52 - name name
135:56 - so uh make a firework
136:01 - viewer.name
136:06 - okay particle.js oh particle js
136:12 - right silly me
136:20 - yay the cities are
136:24 - popping up
136:26 - well it's something
136:32 - happy new year everybody happy new year
136:35 - goa happy new year chicago happy new
136:38 - year
136:38 - grito
136:40 - all right how do i make this appear a
136:41 - little bit longer
136:44 - and so the other thing i want to do is
136:46 - have them
136:47 - ripple across the map
136:49 - so i think i should sort them
136:53 - so and i should probably have the city
136:55 - name
136:58 - uh i have an idea all right we're gonna
137:00 - we're gonna clean this up a little it's
137:01 - 215. how's everybody doing you stall
137:03 - still with me people actually watching
137:06 - um all right let's try to clean this up
137:08 - a little bit if we had some more
137:09 - donations do we have more new new lyrics
137:12 - do i need to sing some more we're going
137:13 - to finish this off to make something
137:15 - nice
137:17 - not that what we don't have is isn't
137:19 - good already
137:20 - but
137:21 - let's think about how we're displaying
137:23 - the city name well let's first do the
137:25 - sorting
137:28 - so
137:29 - uh i have my list of viewers
137:33 - right viewers is an array
137:37 - so what i want to do is say viewers.sort
137:43 - you know what let's do the x y as part
137:45 - of the viewer here
137:49 - so when
137:51 - that data is the city's data
137:55 - the pixels
137:59 - whoops
138:03 - so data's
138:06 - pixels
138:08 - are converted from its latitude and
138:11 - longitude i mean obviously i should sort
138:15 - by latitude like
138:17 - but i'm going to just use pixels so i
138:18 - could go from right to left it'll make
138:20 - my life easier
138:21 - um
138:22 - [Music]
138:23 - so the
138:24 - um so then
138:27 - now down here
138:29 - i actually can just say
138:31 - the viewers pixel.x and the
138:35 - viewerspixel.y and the viewer's name so
138:38 - let me just make sure that this still
138:40 - works
138:43 - okay wait
138:52 - why
139:01 - why is it not getting the lat and the
139:03 - lawn
139:06 - sketch line 43
139:18 - sketch line 42
139:20 - oh
139:21 - what
139:24 - what
139:25 - i'm so confused
139:28 - oh
139:29 - well that's obviously a mistake hold on
139:34 - why is it printing out the actual data
139:37 - and then undefined
139:41 - i'll do the fireworks with shaders
139:43 - yeah i don't think so
139:45 - what did i miss here i'm just trying to
139:46 - make things a little simpler
139:56 - grow city
139:59 - oh because some of them ah ah i forgot
140:03 - if i'm gonna do more stuff
140:07 - i need to do it here
140:11 - got it
140:12 - i have it has to be valid
140:14 - then i should be able to say yeah yeah
140:16 - of course
140:18 - give me the pixels
140:23 - uh
140:24 - sketchjs 41
140:29 - no oh no no yeah ah
140:32 - this goes here okay this is right now
140:35 - i'm getting the data metadata for a
140:37 - given city if i couldn't find it just
140:40 - show me that i couldn't find it
140:41 - otherwise add the pixel value to that
140:43 - metadata and put it into an array
140:46 - that took me way too long to get okay
140:48 - toronto stockholm okay but i took the
140:50 - fireworks out that's fine
140:52 - i
140:54 - no
140:55 - data.pix
140:58 - no the fireworks should still be in
140:59 - there
141:00 - why are the fireworks not showing now
141:14 - what happened to the fireworks
141:17 - console.log
141:23 - viewer.pics
141:31 - all right that's weird
141:35 - is the map not oh because oh i always
141:38 - have to ah no no no no i can't do that
141:42 - the x and y is something that has to be
141:44 - processed and draw because i'm
141:46 - dynamically calculating the pixel values
141:48 - based on the map orientation so this was
141:50 - a lot of wasted energy for something
141:53 - that i cannot do
141:54 - i will have to sort by latitude and
141:57 - longitude
141:58 - fine i can handle that
142:01 - so sorry everybody
142:03 - this has to go back here
142:07 - that was a digression
142:09 - that
142:11 - was a very bad idea
142:15 - and now
142:17 - we should be back to
142:18 - fireworks at the proper location of the
142:21 - given cities
142:26 - okay
142:28 - all right so boy did i waste some time
142:30 - there so let's look at
142:33 - let's think about
142:35 - let's see if we can look at a nice
142:39 - like
142:40 - image of the globe showing us latitude
142:42 - and longitude
142:48 - um so i can like think about sorting it
142:52 - so i want to sort by longitude
142:55 - longitude being the long
142:58 - lines latitude being the
143:02 - so let's try sorting let's just try
143:03 - sorting it by longitude and see what
143:05 - happens
143:07 - so if i were going to go here
143:10 - and say
143:12 - viewers
143:14 - sort
143:16 - and then i need a function that compares
143:18 - a and b
143:20 - two elements
143:23 - of the array
143:26 - and
143:27 - i want to say console log
143:31 - a dot lat
143:33 - b what was i saying i was gonna do
143:34 - longitude b dot longitude
143:38 - just curious
143:42 - all right i get all these numbers now
143:43 - are they
143:44 - strings the question is are they strings
143:48 - because in theory i could just do return
143:51 - b dot long minus a dot long
143:56 - i mean i can make sure
143:58 - they're a number by doing this
144:04 - let's see what this gets me
144:15 - yes look at the happy new year going
144:17 - across
144:25 - okay so i got to do something about the
144:27 - text
144:29 - i got to do something about the text of
144:31 - my uh the city we got to improve that
144:35 - and we i want these to be much sparklier
144:38 - so we're going to we got to make these
144:39 - nicer so let's deal with the t where am
144:41 - i drawing the text
144:43 - i'm just absurdly hard coding drawing it
144:46 - somewhere
144:48 - um
144:51 - so this dot firework
144:56 - so i think i actually always want to
144:58 - draw it
145:02 - whether it's exploded or not as long as
145:04 - yeah as long as there's still life so
145:06 - i'm gonna do
145:08 - uh
145:10 - this dot firework dot is it pause
145:15 - does it does the firework itself have a
145:17 - location no it has a particle
145:20 - yeah this dot firework.pause okay
145:29 - so this should give me the city
145:32 - uh
145:33 - 64 is kind of huge
145:38 - and
145:39 - um
145:41 - text
145:42 - align
145:45 - right aligned
145:46 - and center
145:48 - and then let's draw it over
145:50 - by like five pixels
145:56 - and
145:57 - i i want to fix the okay let's see this
146:00 - should work better
146:12 - this is an improvement
146:16 - i did right aligned why did i do right
146:17 - aligned i meant left
146:23 - or i could just do it center center and
146:25 - put it above that might make more sense
146:28 - so how do i do this
146:31 - where do i get that zoom value
146:34 - um
146:37 - because when i'm drawing the particle
146:41 - there's like the zoom of the map
146:46 - i should have it fade that's what i
146:47 - should have it do okay
146:49 - hold on everybody
146:51 - um
146:54 - i think i mean this is going to be as
146:56 - good as i'm going to get i'm just going
146:57 - to have to hard code the
146:59 - the size in
147:01 - where does it where did i draw it again
147:06 - all right right here okay make it 16.
147:10 - let's get rid of the stroke
147:14 - and does this have like a lifespan does
147:16 - this one have a lifespan
147:19 - i think it does
147:22 - or is it the particle's lifespan i don't
147:24 - know
147:30 - i think it's the fireworks lifespan
147:38 - what is it doing
147:41 - is it drawing it twice
147:57 - let's see if this thing was actually a
147:58 - thing
148:10 - it's 255. that lifespan's not going down
148:15 - why not
148:28 - if the particle shapes into the name of
148:30 - the city then explodes yes that would be
148:32 - good
148:33 - oh no i don't have time for that i do
148:35 - have i've i have ways to get there
148:38 - that's such a good suggestion though
148:40 - wait okay hold on hold on
148:43 - um we're gonna celebrate new year's i
148:45 - swear
148:46 - in some way at some point
148:50 - i want to get
148:52 - so particle
148:58 - if it's not oh if it's not a firework
149:00 - that's only then its lifespan goes down
149:04 - well i'll have its life span go down uh
149:07 - whether it's a particle or whether it's
149:09 - a firework or not
149:15 - why is it not fading
149:24 - let's see here
149:30 - all right hold on
149:32 - i can make this happen on my own accord
149:37 - we're going to go into the firework
149:40 - and we're going to say
149:43 - uh
149:44 - this dot fade
149:46 - equals 255
149:52 - oh is it because the hue saturation
149:54 - brightness thing
150:02 - this dot fade this dot fade
150:07 - minus equals 10.
150:15 - i don't know why i can't get it to fade
150:16 - out
150:19 - but maybe i shouldn't care it also
150:20 - should be the same color
150:30 - there's so many ways this could be
150:32 - improved
150:36 - oh but i do kind of like it it's
150:38 - something it's a project it works in its
150:42 - own
150:42 - weird
150:44 - way
150:49 - okay
150:51 - all right what can i do to improve this
150:53 - i don't know why the fading is not
150:54 - working
150:55 - um
150:57 - maybe because of hue saturation
150:59 - brightness
151:10 - maybe the
151:11 - text
151:17 - i mean the order shouldn't matter
151:22 - like what if i put just hard code 10 in
151:24 - here
151:31 - it's really making me crazy
151:44 - there we go it's because of the rgb
151:46 - color mode
151:51 - the rgb color mode is
151:55 - messing that up
151:59 - yeah
152:01 - there we go that's what i was going for
152:10 - should just have a color palette not
152:11 - used i don't know why hsb
152:13 - but i want to use the same color
152:17 - as
152:29 - i don't know why the alpha should
152:31 - wouldn't work
152:33 - oh no now it's working
152:38 - except they're all the same
152:42 - but each one should get a new one
152:46 - oh no i
152:48 - so i put that back in there
152:56 - why why why why why why why why why why
153:00 - why why why why
153:03 - is this a bug in p5 have we found a bug
153:06 - in p5
153:08 - that alpha doesn't work with rgb
153:13 - hold on everybody
153:24 - we will test this
153:43 - okay
153:44 - so um let's draw now a rectangle
153:49 - zero zero two hundred four hundred
153:59 - okay so alpha blending
154:01 - is clearly
154:03 - uh working
154:11 - alpha blending is not working
154:32 - why does anybody
154:38 - anybody see like right
154:40 - like hsb
154:43 - the alpha value is not uh
154:47 - all right we're gonna change
154:55 - this is really making me crazy because i
154:56 - really want it to fade i also want it to
154:59 - be
155:03 - courier font because that
155:26 - yeah but it's
155:27 - hsb is where the issues
155:29 - oh the default is from 0 to 1.0 says
155:33 - bruno
155:34 - ah
155:36 - aha thank you
155:41 - this is probably the case and i just
155:43 - didn't realize that
155:50 - there we are
155:51 - bruno
155:53 - thank you
155:55 - the default for the alpha
155:58 - which uh that's fading out way too fast
156:07 - okay this is better already
156:17 - now i wonder if the text shouldn't
156:19 - actually move
156:21 - like the text should be where the city
156:22 - is
156:29 - all right so this is right so this is
156:31 - what i wanted
156:32 - um
156:34 - i would like i don't know about the font
156:36 - but
156:37 - um okay so now the question is
156:44 - oops the text is not
156:49 - this doesn't really work i'm not really
156:51 - live updating everything's location
156:53 - according to the lat long i should be
156:55 - doing that
156:57 - um because it's really just generating
156:59 - them from where they start but i'll that
157:02 - could be fixed but i have to wrap this
157:04 - up because it's almost three o'clock
157:08 - um and uh like share this somehow or
157:11 - improve it in a way that people could
157:13 - make their own version of it
157:15 - all right so what what should i do what
157:17 - more can i do here before i say goodbye
157:21 - um
157:24 - so
157:29 - we could first of all have
157:32 - many more particles
157:34 - like 500
157:38 - i think the particles themselves
157:42 - could be
157:45 - bursting out a little bit less far
157:50 - um
157:52 - and or slowing down a little faster
157:57 - um
158:05 - well that's pretty extreme that looks
158:07 - less fireworky
158:10 - so
158:11 - no they should be fading out faster
158:13 - that's that was the mistake
158:14 - for it to be more fireworky
158:18 - i feel like it needs some maybe all the
158:19 - particles should be different colors
158:28 - oh no no no no no no no no no that's the
158:31 - wrong thing
158:35 - it's the lifespan going down
158:40 - oh so where does the so i'm not even
158:42 - doing the life span correctly here this
158:44 - should be 1.0
158:46 - so this was a mistake
158:49 - in my previous version and an update
158:51 - where does the lifespan go down
158:55 - so confused
159:05 - how come i don't see where i am
159:06 - decreasing the lifespan
159:11 - i don't think the firework manages
159:13 - everything
159:16 - show
159:19 - apply force
159:22 - apply gravity
159:28 - apply force update splice
159:32 - it's weird
159:35 - i don't see
159:39 - that's right that's where i'm using the
159:41 - life span
159:43 - that's where i'm setting the life span
159:46 - that's where i'm checking if it's less
159:47 - than zero
159:48 - i think i deleted it by accident
159:52 - so that's a problem
159:54 - should be an update so anyway let me
159:56 - remedy that
160:01 - yeah i think i just messed that up
160:09 - i don't know they're less fireworky than
160:11 - they were before
160:13 - oh yeah
160:22 - happy new year
160:28 - so what if i sent off a few i think it
160:31 - would be better if i sent off a few
160:33 - in like random locations
160:36 - okay i've got an idea
160:38 - i have an idea this is gonna be better
160:41 - okay okay i'm gonna make this better
160:42 - everybody then we're gonna put this away
160:47 - i only want to change which city i'm on
160:52 - and i should say
160:54 - i should future proof this
160:58 - modulo
161:02 - i only want to change the city every
161:05 - once every second or so and actually we
161:07 - can we could we could even take a little
161:08 - bit longer
161:11 - then
161:13 - i could say if random one is less than
161:16 - like so every
161:18 - 10 frames about
161:21 - create
161:25 - a new firework
161:27 - we could give it a little um
161:31 - we could also have a vector
161:37 - we could also make a little random
161:39 - vector
161:42 - to offset it a little bit so they're not
161:44 - all in the same location
161:55 - oh and it's doing the city multiple
161:56 - times
161:58 - so i like this better already
162:01 - but i think the city
162:03 - should not i think the city shouldn't
162:05 - move
162:12 - it should be
162:13 - doing something more interesting
162:21 - kathy's saying go spend
162:25 - all right i can reduce the number of
162:26 - particles i think but i like this it's
162:28 - more of a pop pop pop exciting thing
162:32 - let's um
162:33 - let's expand the um
162:37 - uh
162:43 - the
162:44 - uh the offset for each of these
162:54 - i think it kind of works i think the
162:56 - text should maybe actually be a
162:58 - different color
163:00 - and over top of it
163:06 - we need some sound effects actually i
163:08 - think i'm kind of happy with this
163:12 - i think it actually just happened faster
163:15 - so
163:16 - um
163:18 - like what if
163:35 - yeah i like it happening faster
163:38 - i think the text i have an idea for the
163:41 - text that's going to make things better
163:45 - um
163:48 - the text
163:51 - where am i drawing the text i am going
163:52 - to go back to text align left
163:55 - and then x
163:57 - plus 25.
164:16 - i don't know how i feel about the text
164:23 - uh i don't know how i feel about the
164:25 - text um
164:27 - repeating itself so many times
164:32 - so what if the text
164:38 - like the firework didn't move okay i
164:41 - even
164:46 - i have an idea
164:53 - what if
164:55 - the text
164:57 - didn't actually move
165:18 - no but it's still why isn't the text
165:20 - just appearing on top of itself oh
165:23 - because i have that random offset where
165:25 - do i do that offset
165:28 - okay
165:30 - i'm going to give it the raw city x i
165:32 - mean i'm really
165:34 - grasping at straws here
165:36 - um
165:38 - this is going to be done in a second i
165:40 - just i'm obsessively want to fix this
165:43 - last thing where the text is is very
165:45 - readable
165:47 - um and when i create the firework
165:50 - now
165:52 - there's this offset
165:54 - but i can just give it pix.x
165:59 - pix.y and now there's so much that could
166:01 - be refactored here
166:06 - there we go i like this better
166:10 - i want the text to fade out a little bit
166:12 - faster
166:13 - so it's not as overlapping
166:17 - so let me
166:19 - do that
166:21 - then i'm going to be done i think i want
166:23 - a different font also
166:25 - oh this is very important stuff here
166:29 - where am i drawing the text again i've
166:31 - already forgotten in firework
166:34 - and it's fading out
166:37 - uh
166:40 - yeah because it's happening much faster
166:42 - now
166:51 - but also we could be way more zoomed in
166:59 - see i want to follow the map
167:02 - it's much it's really nice to be more
167:04 - zoo montreal is not there what
167:17 - i don't know what's going on everybody
167:19 - i'm sorry
167:22 - i think it's not i don't have things
167:24 - properly updating
167:28 - yeah it doesn't yeah i agree all right
167:29 - fine let's go back to
167:32 - all right hold on
167:44 - this i think this is
167:49 - this is where i want to be with this
167:52 - i just i
167:53 - it's got an issue where i can no longer
167:55 - move the map around
168:06 - i i don't know why
168:09 - it's totally off with certain latitude
168:11 - and longitudes
168:14 - what have i done
168:18 - it looked like
168:21 - everything was so right to start
168:28 - i i'm
168:43 - am i not using the zoom properly
168:53 - oh something's wrong with the zoom
168:58 - that's weird
169:00 - i broke something
169:18 - right because if i go back to my
169:20 - original code
169:30 - oh no that doesn't work either
169:34 - no
169:37 - oh yeah
169:47 - oh no it works
169:50 - i just was it was caching
169:57 - let's just see something latitude
170:24 - yeah you know it probably is
170:26 - it's probably that there's these small
170:28 - cities
170:29 - that are named after other cities in the
170:32 - u.s
170:35 - and so that's messing it up because of
170:38 - my
170:43 - silly
170:44 - because there's probably a london
170:46 - colorado you know
170:48 - because i'm not properly looking up the
170:50 - cities
170:51 - but
170:57 - i'm going to leave it at this
170:59 - i'm going to upload this so people can
171:02 - mess with it
171:03 - and make a nicer version of it you can
171:05 - all i can imagine so many improvements i
171:08 - don't know how long have i been going
171:09 - here are people still donating
171:13 - um
171:17 - but i i think um
171:21 - i think um
171:25 - i'm sorry i'm looking at twitter right
171:27 - now
171:31 - this is i think where i'm gonna get to
171:35 - all right what's all right so let's see
171:37 - let's see
171:39 - i think it's time for another song what
171:41 - about you
171:47 - maybe some random numbers
171:50 - we'll leave this going in the background
171:52 - we're celebrating new year's all across
171:54 - the world
171:59 - and i'm sorry for all of the incorrect
172:02 - city locations
172:05 - um
172:08 - let's zoom this in just a little bit
172:17 - good there we go
172:19 - okay
172:22 - all right now
172:25 - let's look
172:27 - where we last left off
172:29 - david keck
172:31 - had said
172:32 - keep singing dan
172:36 - do we have
172:38 - any more
172:39 - song lyrics
172:46 - well that's the question we have any
172:47 - more donations
172:49 - i have to make my donation i guess i'll
172:51 - do that the moment i log off
172:54 - we've definitely hit 500
172:55 - for sure
172:57 - do we have any new donations
173:03 - we certainly do
173:05 - we have gerard
173:08 - we have stephen kazur
173:10 - we have barry
173:12 - and we have jessica
173:14 - now
173:16 - am i do i have to rely on ai
173:18 - my random number book or some new song
173:21 - lyrics let's see
173:23 - uh
173:25 - there's a pull request
173:29 - there's the auto encoder okay let's take
173:31 - a look pull request
173:34 - stop deleting my song's song
173:41 - processing
173:44 - oh i want it this is great all right oh
173:46 - but we don't want to put python in the
173:48 - bin
173:50 - just to the side
173:52 - just to the side
173:54 - we don't want to cast up we don't want
173:56 - to cat
173:57 - we don't want to
173:58 - uh say mean things about other
174:00 - programming languages thank you
174:02 - anonymous so i'm gonna i'm gonna see if
174:03 - i can
174:04 - flower up this song in real time
174:07 - but i love that it's got processing in
174:09 - it okay so we're gonna merge it
174:14 - maybe i'll maybe i'll do some oh it's
174:16 - already been merged okay wait a sec
174:19 - or committed is it merged revert i don't
174:21 - know what's going on i don't know how to
174:22 - use i don't know how to use this version
174:24 - control i just like to rename my files
174:26 - dash two
174:28 - okay
174:29 - let's go to edit here
174:32 - and go down to okay
174:35 - should
174:36 - hexadecimal be
174:38 - forgot and c sharp
174:42 - not for today
174:45 - should basic
174:47 - just be
174:49 - to basic be my childhood memory
174:58 - and today
175:02 - today
175:03 - i code
175:05 - with
175:06 - really ruining this i'm so sorry
175:10 - for javascript
175:13 - is fine my dear nj sun it does shine
175:18 - we'll put the python
175:20 - [Music]
175:23 - aside for now
175:26 - but python is wonderful too
175:31 - for sake of process sign
175:35 - okay
175:42 - all i want for new year is code okay i
175:45 - could maybe make that happen
175:48 - i'm sorry i'm very uh
175:50 - i'm very sensitive
175:52 - to
175:54 - sort of like
175:55 - programming language battles
175:59 - and
176:01 - i
176:02 - um
176:03 - for me it's very important that
176:07 - all programming languages
176:10 - are great to use for different reasons
176:12 - at different times
176:14 - on different days i happen to love using
176:16 - processing in p5 we're here to celebrate
176:18 - that community but that community
176:20 - welcomes in you learning and programming
176:22 - with c-sharp and python and basic

190:49 - hold on
190:56 - we are going to do
190:57 - settings
191:00 - transfer
191:03 - transfer ownership
191:08 - this is what i always do by the way

192:08 - how that would go
192:10 - um all right so here
192:12 - on github
192:14 - coding train slash happy new year
192:16 - dash 2022
192:20 - by the way i don't know why anybody
192:21 - would want to do this
192:24 - but as soon as i the the whole stream

192:29 - asking um as soon as i uh shut this down
192:33 - i mean you should be able to rewind it
192:34 - right now but it'll certainly be their
192:35 - archive under the same link
192:37 - so now if i go to settings

194:10 - chastise me where is it i don't even
194:13 - know where it is okay zoom one https
194:16 - this is what i'm changing here by the

194:21 - thank you me i am so me for posting the
194:23 - link
194:25 - um i'm hoping that tonight i can make a
194:27 - nice
194:29 - little video like like we can improve
194:31 - this page that's not like it's missing
194:33 - things like it's missing the processing
194:35 - like celebrating processing it's missing
194:37 - the cities being in the wrong place
194:39 - it's missing a way for people to add
194:41 - their own city there's so much we could
194:42 - do today all together because well you
194:45 - have the whole day free to contribute to
194:46 - this
194:48 - um now
194:49 - let's go to
194:51 - i should know how to get to the pages
194:53 - i'm just going to do it the way i know
194:56 - which is here
194:57 - and i'm going to go to
195:00 - here
195:01 - this is ridiculous it'll go to here
195:04 - please work
195:09 - yeah but i think that's just because
195:11 - pages hasn't uh republished yet
195:19 - there we go
195:20 - okay
195:23 - why is it not full screening this map
195:30 - oh i had it hard-coded at 800-600
195:34 - what is wrong with me
195:38 - i didn't know that
195:43 - this is definitely the way to work on a
195:45 - project
195:47 - editing the code on github and expecting
195:50 - github pages to wait to just see if your
195:53 - change has worked okay last
195:58 - let's put it back to 1.5 this is a great
196:02 - idea
196:03 - this is a great idea
196:06 - and change this to window height what
196:08 - could go wrong nothing i tell you
196:10 - nothing
196:11 - commit
196:19 - and he's not any second now
196:22 - any second now
196:27 - any any moment
196:29 - i got nothing i had nothing to do just
196:30 - waiting just hitting refresh having it
196:33 - weirdly centered incorrectly everything
196:35 - about this wrong
196:44 - to caching
196:49 - all right hold on everybody
196:52 - i no longer can tolerate this
197:03 - let's pull down this repo
197:06 - no no no no no no no
197:29 - hmm
197:30 - this is not the one i'm working on
197:33 - i don't know i don't know why that's
197:38 - i just want to leave this in a state
197:40 - that is somewhat manageable
197:43 - somewhat viewable
197:44 - um okay
197:46 - oh i forgot i did that no wonder i was
197:48 - like messing around for no reason okay
197:54 - why is the zoom

Cleaned transcript:

uh so uh oh boy hello happy almost new year's wait it where is it somewhere we must it must already be a new year somewhere in the world tell me in the chat where you are and how long it is until it is your happy new year hello my name is dan i am your happy new year wisher of today i can't tell you by the way so i have about let's see i'm just just just on a real rough count here uh 10 12 you know 14 15 16. i got like 20 plus different buttons that i use to operate the live stream as it's going and at least half of them are not working right now so i had a little glitch there yeah little sneak preview of a guest that we're gonna have on in a moment um sorry about that summer you appeared just as a blip by accident as i was switching windows around um but um i've got i was about to say i have lots of fun things planned for today but i literally have well i have i have one thing planned which is our guest who's about to come on and talk a little bit about the processing foundation so because i don't have anything planned if you will uh indulge me and bear with me let me try to plan things and talk them through right now as i begin with this live stream so first of all if this is the first time you've ever tuned into the coding train welcome thank you i wore this special sweater for you it's not a processing sweater unfortunately but it is themed coating train themed uh i don't love that it's also a branded sort of thing but it's uh i believe this is like a chris minesweeper christmas tree so hope you enjoy that uh i wore it just just for you all of you all some number of people uh oh and i'm seeing in the chat great happy new year from malta is that five minutes and 54 seconds to go or five hours and 54 minutes five hours and 54 minutes until uh t minus 84 minutes captain like i feel like india is i think like it's gonna be new years in india some point during this stream just picking india because i have a sense that's like 10 and a half hours or 11 hours difference and it's noon right now i don't know somebody will tell me so okay um usually i have a very as everybody knows who is a viewer of the coding train i usually have an incredibly well organized structured stream where i methodically go from segment to segment tutorial tutorial and everything is well documented and perfect today won't be like that at all it never is that way that was a joke um but today is a day of new year's resolutions for me uh the 2022 i'm hoping uh well will be a better year than 2021 and 2020 and we don't need to go into we don't need to rehash how much this year uh was not so great uh for a variety of different reasons at different on different levels for all different people all over the world hopefully we can have a little moment of happiness and joy together in this virtual coding train online space today but i have some personally i have some exciting things that i'm really looking forward to in 2022 which is the ability to dedicate a lot more time to the coding train so if this is your first time tuning in welcome it's gonna take me a couple weeks to get my feet under me i'm still working on a new studio it's going to be solarpowered as of january 5th i'm that's the date where i'll be installing some solar panels here to power all of this equipment um i have as i've talked about a sabbatical from my teaching position my day job so to speak which will allow me more time to hopefully stream every week and produce more tutorials that's not what today is about but i just wanted to let you all know if you're just joining come on board i've said the water is warm but there's no water on the train the train is moving at a at a leisurely pace there's nice views out the windows comfy seats uh little laptops for everybody to code on i don't know where i'm going with this but i want to welcome you and i hope that we can spend a lot of time together being creative coding playing teaching learning from each other the best way to get involved with the coding train community is to join the discord but that's all i'm going to say because today is not about the coding trend i mean these things all blend together on some level but today is not about the coding train today is about the processing foundation i don't have a prop uh i feel like i need to hold something up uh the processing foundation is a heart my heart and soul it is a nonprofit uh dedicated to uh that that dedicated to bringing coding to the world uh in creative and exciting ways we maintain different software platforms run various educational and community initiatives and there is a fundraiser going on right now um uh uh i see by the way i see i see i've seen names in the chat that i haven't seen in a long time and it's making me so so happy to see them um and so i'm gonna get to all the ways you can donate and pull up that page and i have a little like uh back channel dashboard thing where i can see if somebody donated and i have my ukulele and i have i'm hooked up to gpt 3 to generate me some lyrics so every time somebody donates i'm going to sing which is probably actually a reason why you shouldn't donate you won't want to donate but i don't know we'll see if it really goes the other way then i'm going to keep singing until you donate how about that um but um uh uh uh my guest my wonderful guest is um waiting in the wings and i wanna uh bring him on and get that out of the way so um every year when i do this is this is i don't know which number maybe this is like the fourth processing telethon it's usually before the uh for the 25th the christmas holiday oh my goodness oh no hold on everybody i've got a slight issue okay i've got a pet issue here okay everything's gonna be fine but one of my cats just escaped because i left the door open so were you all were you all like this won't take more than a couple minutes for me to resolve uh actually you know what i can pass it on to soccer while i'm trying to rescue the cat the door to the outside is closed i'm in a garage and the garage has a little extra room attached to it and there's some construction being done in the house so i moved and i moved the cats to the garage do you hear the meow do you hear that yeah okay that's four grand i was lost because i left the door open as i was rushing back and forth to get everything ready and she's terrified and i'm gonna just go get her i'm gonna uh i'm gonna put this music back on and we'll be right back or wait darth sober do you wanna you wanna all right let me greta is fine i'm going to retrieve her this is not going very well okay so uh let me go back to what i was saying this is the um fourth or maybe fifth time i've done this usually i try to do it before the holidays couldn't get that together this year but i'm making it in right under the wire today is the last day you can donate for this year's annual processing fundraiser there are various rewards i will pull up that page and show you what there are what they are i'm planning to donate because there's a beautiful community catalog i would like to get but i want uh dorothy and other members of the processing team have come on to talk about processing um in the past uh and so i wanted you to get to hear from someone directly on the team and so i'm really excited that i have and i'm going to switch over here and now you're seeing me in a different camera and hopefully you're seeing sober and still hearing my audio saber will you say something just so i see if your audio is going through hey hey coding train all right so i can hear i can see sauber's audio going through everybody in the chat wants to see the cat um sovereign this is perfect timing i'm going to let you take it away for a couple minutes and talk about processing um i still can hear you i'm just going to go in and rescue the cat yeah do your thing take your time hey folks um great to be on a coding train and i'm going to talk a little bit about uh some of the work the foundation does the fundraising that it supports the programs it supports um and tell you um a little bit about what um what happens with these programs and then um you know see if there's questions or none so however much time dan needs to corral uh his cats um so uh let me introduce myself a little bit and then i'll share a little bit of a graphic that i have describing the programs so i'm cyber khan i'm a teacher in new york city i've been with the foundation for about three years i started as a community member um started uh hosting events um and then i'm back by the way hey dan how's the cat cat cat made it back i was gonna bring the cat but uh the way i was able to retrieve the cat is i walked over to her and she darted off back into the room where she's supposed to be and then i close the door so later we'll see maybe i can get a cat cam going sorry keep going i will by the way since you mentioned if people have questions i'll keep an eye on the chat you don't have to do that and if questions come up i'll note them down and um and ask you when when you're finished and apologies for not introducing you i'm glad you're introducing yourself thank you all good all right all good yeah so um education community director now processing foundation and uh what i do in that role is uh support educators in our community which is which is odd because almost you know most people in our community are sort of educators or students and then help put up some programs so i want to describe those uh dan's described them in the past uh quite a bit i'm sure dan will uh share more about it um and then there's lots of other programs that community members do too and the organization does too that are upcoming that um i don't have on this list so let me share my chrome oh you know what i have that error of like this is the first time you're trying to screen share on chrome uh on zoom so let me just give me one second let me let me deal with this issue i think i can not restart zoom and do this worst case scenario you can also oh no i see it you see it okay cool all right great um all right so let me just jump into it so uh processing foundation what are some of the programs uh that we do and that they're upcoming in 2022 which is why i wanted to come on and jump on with coding train today uh the reason i actually became part of the foundations that started this event and we've been doing it in person and virtual last couple of years and it's for educators and students mostly k12 oriented and what happens is kind of like what happens on the coding train but more like a 45 minute version of it here's a workshop on doing something fairly basic with creative coding so if you have any teachers or students that need that kind of uh slow pace uh this event might be for you and we're probably gonna do something in late actually that you can join uh so that's one of the programs that the foundation supports uh the second one is something that is maybe even more appropriate to share which is uh we support community members putting on their own events and they're called processing communities they've been happening for the past couple years you can organize one virtually or you know if you're able to do it in person and we're happy to help you um and i'll share the links for each of these types of events in the chat in a minute after i'm done talking you can also email us at this link at this email address below if you have questions about it there's a couple of more that are you might be interested in uh probably heard about them before but uh i'll love to remind you about them um if you're a coder and you are past high school and you're in some sort of postsecondary education uh like you're in uh college or grad school or in a some sort of coding boot camp or some sort of post secondary education you can come and contribute to the open source projects the foundation supports and this is through google and it runs through the summer and we've been part of it for a bunch of years and that's upcoming this year again and then the last thing that i had to share was um the foundation supports fellowships too for artists coders collectives and then more recently teachers and you uh conceive a project you execute it with us and these can be software but don't have to be software generally they're not software um and they're called fellowships and they also occur over the summer so this these are the four things that i could think of that are worth sort of sharing with you all and the last thing is a lot of this stuff to like see what community members are doing or saying about it uh the discourse is the link for that so those were the four things that i could think i'm trying to think of there's something big that i forgot um but oh the last thing i wanted to say was um you know just like dan's hoping to do a lot more in 2022 i'm hoping to do a lot more with my ninja especially with processing foundation thanks to all the fundraising that has happened recently and i think just like where the community is i think there's a lot more that you know we might have on this calendar uh in a year or so so i'm excited to see what other things we can sort of add to the list of things that we do every year that was it for me dan anything that i should talk about or mention i'm listening to you through the zoo so i couldn't hear you right yeah sorry i was actually muted in both places sorry about that right i'm i'm a little bit uh technically frazzled today no that was terrific um i don't have uh um i will what i'm gonna be sort of periodically pulling up different things from about processing during the stream i'll go to the foundation website i'm gonna show the donation page uh we're gonna i'm gonna code some stuff in p5 or processing so people will get to learn more about the work of the foundation and how to get started in coding if it's new to you i guess um the one thing i think that would be great for you to share just if people want to get in touch or have questions especially if they're teachers i know you do a lot you've done these sort of open office hours for um k through 12 teachers what's the best way to get in touch with you and or the processing foundation more general broadly yeah so that email foundation and processing is probably the general inbox and then my one is sauber processing.org yeah if you need help like if you're an educated you're like what do i do in my classroom or hey i run an after school i need help with curriculum or if it's something more serious like hey my district you know needs some support and we're interested in what you guys do uh those are all things i can help with and i would love to help with and i think in this coming year in the next few years we'll have a lot more ability to like sort of support people in that way so please do reach out especially if you reach out in the past and maybe we weren't able to do too much uh we might be able to do a little bit more and this time around so you know please don't hesitate to repeat a question you already asked us so yeah i'll put all the links in the chat i'll i'll hang out and uh it's just i just want to say it's such an awesome thing you know especially in the time of covet to like have the coding train as a place to hang out when there aren't too many other places uh tina hang out in person here we are again uh you and your community being that space thank you yes this is uh a labor of love that sort of uh ebbs and flows for me in various ways and i'm excited to try to tie a little bow around this year and sort of set us up into set myself up and the community up into the new year so i just want to read before you go sauber mark says great presentation sober month on says absolutely love what you guys are doing with processing keep up the amazing work and best practices well i really need to take learn from best practices please teach me all of the best practices i only have the worst practices uh says this is very nice happy dear to you okay so sauber will be around in the chat a little bit but even if not um if you have questions about the processing foundation this stream's got like a couple hours to go so you can always ask them i will be able to answer them or point you to the right person or of course foundation at processing.org for education specific questions or about some of the initiatives that sauber mentioned you can email sauber directly saber at processing.org and we'll put that stuff into the chat sauber if you're if you post something into the youtube chat i'm going to click on you and make you a moderator because i believe you can't share links or email addresses unless you're a moderator so your first message you can just say hello you i might have done this before if you happen to have been in the chat before and i did this but we'll find out momentarily all right thanks so much yeah happy new year dan all right happy new year to you too all right i'm gonna click off this zoom end meeting for all and here we are okay i'm back just me oh help help me everyone i i mean you would have thought right you would have thought it's december 31st my last day of teaching my last class was like i don't even recall now the 9th the 10th the 12th it was a while ago it was like weeks ago all this time to figure out and plan and be prepared to have an extravaganza here on the last day of the year and the truth of the matter is i have no plan um and so we're just gonna see how things go i'm gonna be reading the chat i'm gonna be answering questions um and i'm going to sing some songs and i definitely want to code something and i have a couple ideas but thing i'm open to your ideas but before i do any of that just give me a moment here oh wait a second we have something that just happened um now ah yes chris dennett donated thank you chris dennett no this one no now i want to launch into my which is again not planned my donation uh schtick thing that happens but i'm not ready to just yet um because i've got too many things open and uh i need to bring the computer over here and i need to go to donor box processing so i want to talk about how you can donate so give me a second here where's the button does this button work hope this button works oh yeah there's sober let me make sauber a moderator uh add moderator okay so sauber you should be able to post links and things now everyone's asking me about this sweater i i kind of regret wearing this sweater because every year during the processing telethon oh hello children have you come to join my live stream oh they're they're like they have hoodies over there's like sheets over their head they're running they're running away from me as fast as they possibly can all right enjoy enjoy um uh try not if you if you can manage without turning the heat on in there it makes a very loud noise so but if you're cold you can turn it on okay no no you're fine okay so many distractions working from home people gotta love it um so uh let me talk about the sweater for a second just it is i i saw it advertised online this is me engaging in like impulse purchasing commerce i believe it is sold by microsoft it is a christmas tree with minesweeper on it i think they're sold out so you can't get one it's unaffiliated you will not make a donation to anything you're just filling up the giant banks of corporate america by buying this uh so someday next year let's put this on the universe let's have uh coding train processing holiday ugly sweaters uh made that everybody can buy to celebrate and donate depressing i do have a coding train uh sweater which was made for me um and you uh you can check my twitter makiko made it and there was a whole video about it but it's kind of like it's a i it's i i need to preserve it it's a little bit it's it's it's it's got a little bit of wear on it so um all right anonymous donated over to here so um the processing foundation sauber talked about the processing foundation here is the processing foundation website right here on this very home page of the processing foundation itself you will see this wonderful call to action pick up your copy of the processing community catalog a hardcover 900 page book with over 600 pages contributed by community members in celebration of not one not two not five not ten not fifteen not eighteen not nineteen but twenty years and we're past twenty like we're like almost twenty and a half years at this point of processing itself started uh the project created by a processing software project created by casey reese and ben frye august 2001 um i did a live stream for the 20th celebration where i got an ibm thinkpad and tried to run the original original version of processing you can go back and watch that i do actually have i will say i'm just going to walk over here and show you i also purchased off of ebay when i was preparing that live stream let me switch to here oh oh it's uh keyed out one of these boy the green screen uh is really i think i can change this to just give me a second here so you can really see it there we go one of these a beautiful clam shell can i open it i can't open it just give me a second clamshell max and i was um working on getting processing to run on this um and um and yes and uh thank you sauber was wearing sauber's hoodie as much what i should be wearing i don't have one i only had a tshirt and it's very cold because i'm in a garage in upstate new york and i can run the heater in this garage and it's not very strong and it's very loud so um so it makes so i was running it this morning anyway stay tuned for a future live stream and one of the things i want to do in 2022 is a lot of retro computing by the way interestingly enough it says on the back here and if you can read that auburn university at montgomery uh apple computer inc uh let's see what year uh this was assembled in taiwan um is there a year or anything on it i don't know 1999 1999 apple computer so this should be able to run the first mac version of processing which you know if we're really feeling ambitious i could try to hook this up today but that's probably not the best use of the live stream all right so um okay so back to this view now ah all c you're perfect all c year year all c or i asked what are the rewards this year i'm so glad you asked so if i click here you can see the various rewards um um and so for 25 oh no you can't see them because i'm not showing them to you for 20. so this is what you'll get to the donor box page for 25 you will receive a pack of 10 stickers including the first ever printing of the new processing logo stickers and to see the new processing logo there it is right here this the new website and the new identity was created by design systems international i talked a lot about that on previous live streams by the way they're just i don't know i'm just putting this out there you might be seeing a new coding train website sometime in 2022 and if you like the processing foundation website you're probably going to like the new coding frame website because you know i'll talk about it later later later but you can see uh i don't know which ones of these logos but p5 stickers processing android but this is just beautiful maybe we can do code something with this today um but i think what the most special thing is here under 75 now first of all to be clear this community catalog will be freely available to download for everybody if you want a printed hard copy version of it for 75 you'll receive a limited edition printed copy of the processing community catalog plus a pack of stickers and i just want to say there will be there just might there just might be some coding train stickers and some coding train stickers that are only available as part of this in that pack as well so first ever processing logo sticker and never before seen coding train with a processing logo together in one sticker possibly um so take a look at that um so but the community catalog is really i want to see where i can find some things to show you about it um and then oh so you can see these oh yeah look look at that there are the stickers never before no printing there you can see they're not here on my laptop i don't got them i don't even have them but i hope to get them the processing community catalog so let's so you might have you know if you've been part of paying attention to the processing community um the to commemorate the 20th anniversary there was a call for community submissions to celebrate shared accomplishments and i believe the the catalog is something like um 700 pages somebody can correct me on that so this is a rendering of what it will look like with a 500 donation you'll receive the silver edition for a 75 donation to receive the standard edition orange oh wait a second see i'm just going to donate so what i would like to do today is match any donations that come in up to five hundred dollars which seems like some sort of selfless act but it's a purely self because i i would be purchasing it anyway for myself because i really want to have the community catalog there is a coding train page that i made with the community coding train community that's in the catalog and i know many of people in the chat uh give a shout out in the chat if you are uh if you made a page for the catalog i would love to see your name and celebrate you um so uh but i kind of like the orange but um 500 you receive the special silver edition uh 75 received the standard edition um this is a bit of a table of contents of what is in the catalog there's an oral history some articles and things that are written by members of the community there's about pages around education initiatives a bill about the history you can see some sample pages of what it looks like um and oh good so oh and this here so i have um i have a uh access to the dashboard so um anonymous donated a hundred dollars so before you okay gotta get my cardio in today so before you all donate um come a little bit dizzy hold on i got a little bit dizzy there before you all donate through youtube which is wonderful for you to do i'm leaving that open that any donations that come through that button on youtube will go direct i seriously got dizzy i have some coffee here i think that'll fix me up um it's been a rough week for me i we don't need i need to go into all of the all of the trials and tribulations of my last week you could join the dakota trade discord and i can write a a narrative essay about what i've been through in the last week if you want um so uh what was i saying here though ah yes so if you donate through the youtube link 100 of those funds will go directly to the processing foundation uh youtube uh google covers all transaction fees for nonprofit giving on the youtube platform however the processing foundation will not have any access to your information google obviously does whatever you're using to you know whatever they've got on their back end so we cannot give you the rewards through your donation through the youtube button so we i encourage you and welcome your donations but if you would like to receive the rewards i you i encourage you oh my goodness we hit the goal i was hoping we i mean i'm glad but i was kind of hoping we'd be like a little bit below the goal could we just change that goal to like i don't know 50 55 000 maybe i don't know but um uh um but um so i would really encourage you to donate here through this uh platform now if you've already donated through youtube and you're now realizing you want you know let's say you just donated 25 just now and you wanted the stickers um first of all us just i would say forward and send an email with your receipt forward your receipt to the youtube donation to foundation processing.org you can cc daniel at thecodingtrade.com um and hopefully we can work that out for you no promises i believe we've been able to do that in the past if we can verify your donation we could make sure to send you um some stickers or whatever reward level but if you really want to make sure you're receiving a reward if you want your name to appear here i'm trying to scroll down under the um under the donor wall the official donor wall on the processing donor box um that's where you'll want to donate and for every donation and i'm a little bit worried i know i think this is the thing that people enjoy because i make a fool out of myself because i'm not really very good at singing or playing the ukulele for every donation that comes in i might have to do only every any like um uh donation at a certain level for any donation comes in i will sing a special version of the new year's song ald lang syne for you let us begin for this is for this is for um everybody who donated so far is there a way that i can see real quick no unpin message well i guess i should pin that i don't know um so so this is for anonymous anonymous 150 and chris dennett anonymous anonymous and chris dennett and this version of aldlang sign is written by david david keck should should this dot be forgot and never typed in line should this dot be forgot and and cause an error on a line four at four for out of scope ref my dear for a simple brain forgot we'll take this and a dot and place it where happy new year okay they're gonna get better or worse i'm not sure which so uh if you like that i don't actually have another version of the song to sing because only i didn't write eddie myself i just put out a call on twitter which i just assumed you know everyone around the world is immediately going to stop whatever they're doing and write their own version of lyrics for the song but you can go you can go right here right now to coding train on github slash ald lang sein train the chat just went very quiet it's making me nervous did everybody leave oh it was just like a delay oh everybody was just quietly wrapped in attention to me singing and now they're coming into the saying things um you can go here and you can uh there is the original version uh written right here and all you need to do is edit click the edit button and add your own version of the song and um zachary mcarthur says the singing has improved from last year i'm not so sure about that it's kind of you to suggest um and but if you also if you don't know how to use github you don't have a github account well first of all you could also just post an issue with the lyrics in it um or you could i don't know jump in the discord somebody you could get in touch and somebody tweet at me at shiffman um uh maybe some somebody can figure out how to get get those song lyrics to me uh jap7n says i had so so much fun this year with processing p5.js also teaching it to my 10 year old son and students at the art academy where i work thank you he says thank you to me thank you to you um i i honestly really i really love hearing these comments and i'm very grateful for them um i am not at the moment i do not at the moment have a window open to um the coding train discord um but i'm taking a look now to see if i've missed anything wait when somebody tell me when is the first like okay let's just uh uh i wanted to make like a one of the things i thought we should do is make a live realtime new year's clock for various places so maybe what i could do let's let's work on this i've got an idea i mean i sort of had this idea before what if i could collect um and alex 1999 says how are you do you feel better i do feel like i've been sick negative tests but i'm a little unsure i have many vaccines in me i don't want to get into it but it's been a rough like week where i was feeling very uneasy and anyway but i feel pretty good today um and i'm here live streaming with you so uh knock on wood um but we'll we'll see i'm still waiting on uh pcr test results um thank you i am 63 years of age retired my grandchildren are coming over and i'll teach what i learned today because retired 32 years is a knuckle tracker i look for i'm getting up there i mean uh i'm not retired and i um i don't know if i i would be amazed to be retired for 32 years but um i'm thinking about it i think maybe this is it i'm gonna retire after today although i think i think i've got i think i could there's room for improvement here so i don't think this should be my last live stream so um a new countdown every hour yeah so i was thinking some kind of new year's countdown in p5 or processing we could have fireworks go off the fireworks could be in the shape of the processing logo this is what i was thinking of programming today but i would like to um kind of collect uh cities around the world where current viewers are watching so there's some ways i could do this i think probably actually to be honest it would be easiest for me to just quickly create a quick google form and then put that out there so let me do that this is uh we're gonna we're gonna um i'm gonna do this real quick so i could go to my um youtube analytics i'm sorry i'm not chuck i'm logging into some things here uh um where where are we going here uh password manager here just listen to this quiet you're gonna be so tired of this song by the end of today oh my goodness one password don't fail me now not a sponsor 2022 lots of sponsorships open i should not be talking about sponsors today oh my god dollar sign u i asterisk ampersand one capital w oh my god did i just speak my password out out loud no i was getting my brain it's amazing i can read actual letters and say other ones at the same time okay new form any moment now uh where are you watching i guess there's no reason why i can't show this to you now country i'm short answer uh please answer only once um should i ask for your latitude longitude i don't think so time zone just in case that helps i think i'm only going to make country required okay i think we've had enough of this music now how do i do the thing where um manage our responses are collected or protected so like i think no no i definitely don't want to do this limit to one response all right well we'll see how that works send shorten url okay so this google form is about to go into uh the chat it's about to go into the chat do i have the live stream open somewhere um and here it goes so now you should see that google form in the chat i don't see it over here there we go um where are you watching all right i'm going to go back to here for a second while i quickly see if any responses come in not yet but also one thing i'm going to do is i'm quickly going to go yes bruno is saying can i check youtube analytics i can check youtube analytics but i don't believe that there's any way through i looked into this briefly yesterday that the api will give me realtime analytics on people who are watching i'm going to now look at just the countries and i'll show them to you i've watched in the last year so let's go to the last 365 days and audience and um top geographies see more so this i'm going to um i'm always a little bit averse to a little bit um so let me show this to you there's got to be a way i can download this so while we're waiting programming with time zones is horror well we're going to see how it goes all right where's my button all right so this uh in case you're curious this is december 31st 2020 to december 30th 2021 the last 365 days if you've been curious as to who watches the coding train you can see the views in uh 17 watch time uh us there right at the top india coming in at number two uh germany coming in at number three united kingdom canada brazil france australia netherlands italy poland indonesia russia spain turkey sweden vietnam south korea mexico philippines israel japan taiwan argentina belgium romania hong kong ukraine portugal switzerland denmark pakistan bangladesh thailand singapore south africa malaysia austria morocco hungary norway egypt czechia greece ireland colombia finland nepal new zealand and saudi arabia that is just the top 50 results use exports to view up to 500 results so i'm just constantly afraid of showing some private information um here so i'm going to look for where the export is now uh where do i where's the export button there's got to be an export button um more post playlist no how do i export it says i can export oh download ah there we go comma separated values great let's do that all right so maybe i'll use this rather than the google form i mean i'm basically redoing coding challenge that i did a coding challenge for 500 000 subscribers but that's okay totals chart data table data okay um is this going to give me more than 50. let's look at this data how do i current view please use exports to view up to 500. all right all right let's let me get out of this for a second oh i have 49 responses um that's great all right so now um let's get into coding some stuff and let me check donor box because you know and let me check uh to see if we have any new lyrics come in is anybody writing lyrics for me all right we're gonna check donor box all right everybody let's see if another donation has come in i'm gonna hit refresh the last donation was cliff i think cliff deserves a song though we're gonna hit refresh kiffin gish all right time for another ald lang syne now this one's gonna be a little bit tricky first of all doesn't this seem out of tune to you let me tune let me tune this this is very important because as you know my singing is clearly perfect so it you know be such a tragedy if anything were slightly out of tune okay all right too sharp turned down too flat turn it tune up okay uh oh andrew did you donate but not write anything on the donation wall so i'm assuming if you're not appearing on the donation wall it's because you don't want me to shout out your name during a live stream i feel like putting your name on the wall is sort of opting in that's the best i can sort of think of but andrew if you did make a donation i um i have i believe in you i have faith this song is also dedicated to both kiffin and andrew now let's just check to see if maybe there's any issues or pull requests no nobody's written lyrics for me to sing how will i ever go on aha well um i've got my uh window open here to the open ai's gpd3 uh model and this is the prompt um that i wrote so i'm gonna take this one out so we'll get a new one just fresh the prompt that i wrote for gpt three is i love to sing the song alden here are the lyrics here are the lyrics i wrote my own version of the lyrics that are computer science themed here they are now i'm going to i'm going to save this here save this as my preset and i'm going to hit generate oh no oh this is not going to should we should we why why why let's try again oh you know what i need to go up here ah there we go this looks better oh my god okay this is kind of awesome oh wow except i don't have the chords here hold on i think i probably know the chords but let me just open up two windows just so i can kind of see them over here uh can i oh this is so hard no no go get get rid of this thank you okay over here move this way this is all going to be fine in a moment shall shell all them shall the bites forget forget when they first met and oh no no no no no no oh wow i went boy okay wait i can make this work can the chords be ai generated no yeah the chords are ai generated in the sense that i am definitely artificially intelligent sure shall all the bites forget when they first met and the bits been friends air they forgot will for they forget those halcyon days yeah those halcyon days essence air bites had a name for bits before they schooled in bitwise ways the bite abode air bit swapping up bite was invented and long before words like gigabyte came along into this complimentary of memory and i can't i can't match it up this is terrible i'm the worst okay hold on let's just do the last two lines for all bits will take a cup of bitful joy and buy bites on bites well done a cup of bites thank you thank you thank you thank you see i i i don't know if people should donate uh i gotta work on this some more maybe i've maybe there's some ways i can improve my gpt3 prompt ah all c all c or i made a pull request okay let me have a looksee here uh make sure everything is copacetic um uh where do i go for that um we're going to oh oh my god what does that must become of my life pull request linux distros okay let's take a look at this one oh this is good this is great thank you all i'll see your eye the next donation i will be um doing this one now unfortunately i just realized i want to um i want to merge this pull request and for some reason i'm not signed in i need to factor this um okay you know you're watching a professional live streaming broadcast when the person who is hosting the broadcast has to go and log into their phone to find their twofactor authentication code to log into some website that they need to use for the live stream uh authenticator you know christmas worked better because i had a wide variety of songs to choose from there's only one new year's song that i can think of which is all like sign okay verify there we go so now uh let us merge in the linux distros version of the song which will be the absolute next version that i sing so all we need your coding flows a bit better than your singing is true and me i am so me so nice to see you it's been so long i'm still the same disaster as i've always been uh let's take a look uh at our donation page we're never going to get to coding if people keep donating um our last donation was from kip and gish and also andrew n i believe and i'm hitting refresh rodrigo cold okay looks like we're getting the linux distro version right now i wonder if i should just do this one with a backing track let's try that oh linux mint my dear owl pie linux will take booboo to mate eating in a live stream is a bad idea but this orange just looks so so delicious i was gonna eat this before i started to give me a little energy you know what would be good five nine seven seven one two eight nine eight one four zero three four one seven six five five eight seven zero zero five eight four five six six six one four four eight nine zero seven nine two five eight one two six four huh i don't even write me lyrics i have a book of random numbers um that was for the the that was for matia uh who i noticed in the chat said they made a donation um but that was before today but wanted a song so i let that one go a little bit more all right i'm not sure backing track ukulele uh i don't want to check i need a break i don't want to check any donations right now let's get started on coding something so i'm trying to think of how i want to do this so i could use your help here pie land sign uh i there's a couple options one is uh a web page just has cities and countdown timers uh it could actually be a map maybe i should make a map with little countdown timers on the map and then when they reach zero little fireworks go off should we do that um let's take a look just um through a history of the coding train and if i go into coding challenges and i go to visualizing 500 000 subscribers let's take a look at this project that i made this was done of course i'm not logged in oh great um this was done um saved over two years ago if we look at the video i should really like visualize the p5 or processing community this is from july 9 2018 and if we run this code we'll see so this is a good starting point for us all right maybe uh in the interest of time um i it might make sense for me why did it just change colors that was interesting this is using this mappa library which wraps the leaflet wraps different other mapping libraries one of which called leaflet and i'm getting a sort of version of the map zero zero i'm loading subscribers geocsv let's see what that file looks like let's download this so one thing might be interesting to do is actually just um kind of rerun this with the data that i just created what does this data look like so let's let's go open visual studio i'm going to use visual studio code today and then i'll move stuff to the web editor so people can share it make tiny fireworks in the map only in the line of the time zone oh i like that ah we could watch the we could watch like this little line go by of the time zone and have little fireworks go off in it all right we're totally doing that that's going to be fun uh that's going to be fun all right so what am i in oh remember that autoencoder project let's close that out i need to get myself a little bit organized back here um um let's go to terminal here yeah sure update where did i download this um shoot probably under downloads yeah visualizing let's just take this let's go here so we're going to make an improvement off of this previous coding challenge which will save us a lot of time so i'm going to try to let's first make sure it runs i'm going to take the headers off just for a second um i'm gonna run a web server open it up get my javascript console okay so this looks good this is running just fine um and i'm sorry simon i see your comments here i'm sorry i'm not i have too many things open let me actually don't i think i don't need this dashboard open so i can see the um discord chat as well um you know one of the things that i'm thinking about doing in 2022 is uh doing some streaming on twitch uh once a week because the twitch platform has a much friendlier api features where i could do things like zach's suggestion maybe like have things happen based on like who's currently watching that kind of thing um all right okay so um so a couple things one let me go over here i just want to do some cleanup my i don't know if you can hear my children's loud noises i am going to get rid of p5 dom and p5 sound and i just want to make sure i have the newest version of the p5 library so i'm going to grab it from here uh all right so everything's still working i wanted to tell my children to keep it down but i'm not gonna be that guy today no it's fine i can i can i can power through this um it's very distracting you're a little bit loud in there um all right so let's take a look at this okay so we can delete the local versions of the p5 libraries and let's look and see what's happening in this sketch all right so we're loading this csv file called cert and i think i need to make the font a little bit bigger for people to be able to see let's go to 32. so this is a p5 sketch it has this it's making this instance of an object from this other library called mappa which is going to allow me to display that map i'll get to that this is some sort of configuration stuff for example i want the map to be centered at latitude longitude 0 with a zoom of 1.5 so if i change this to 0.5 for example and went back and hit refresh you could see i'm zoomed further out but you know it's something that can be changed in real time um so but i'm going to go back to one and that looks good to me and we can kind of move things over but i guess that this is actually the view that i want to see but i'm not going to worry about that right now um that line will take we'll do we'll do a sped up version of it okay we'll do like a time lapse version uh um stop deleting my posts sorry about that uh says that line will take five hours to cross the atlantic yeah and i'm i'm i've got like 45 minutes here to go let's see what we can get to happen all right loading countries.json so countries is just a lookup table with a lat and longitude for every country and then the data itself is country name country id subscribers comments watch time minutes so let's first just try to get some new data so this is the new data that i just downloaded i don't know i've chart data table data totals i don't know what any of these things are but let's let's bring these in so let's look at uh actually it's a hole let me undo that no i won't let me make a uh organize this better make a folder called data this is the new data i'm just putting this in here okay just so i can see what it is so chart data is the date the geography and the number of views i don't understand what this is what oh this is oh it's per day wow that's insane so i could show a time lapse of people i'm like i'm off in a whole other project now but that's interesting chart data table data geography views average duration watch time hours total and i'm not sure i believe yeah i don't know what this oh what oh total u.s so this is what i want if i want totals of views and then just totals is just the total views per day oh that's interesting i mean i don't know what the what i where i'm wandering off into here but let's this is the this is this data i could use for the same exact graph but i want to do it a different way hmm i'm trying to think about this i could i could also go back to um if you'll bear with me i'm just going to go look at the spreadsheet where people entered where they are and um of the people currently watching which might be a little bit more exciting i just don't in case there's some trolling in there i want to just like scan through it there are 52 responses so um let me repost that link in the chat so i also want i'm going to download this data in a moment i mean i could obviously connect to the connect to it in real time but i think i want to freeze it so hold on i'm coming back to the live stream where's the chat um okay oh all right so i think i just posted oh we got another donation we have to do another song i just posted the form so i think what i'm going to try to do actually first is put one dot for everybody currently watching so please if you don't mind you know on our system here as best as possible enter into the form just once please put a real city and country i'm going to look up the latitude longitude and time zone i think via some kind of api and we'll see how that goes so for example um i'm going to go so you can enter that stuff in i'm going to go back to my code and uh um just hold on i'm going to just take a one second break here while you're entering in that form okay so let's just say for the sake of argument that i have um i'm gonna i'm gonna not load any of this data just for a second so all i need is a lat and long to p to make something okay i want to go for more the one dot this dot yes this i could actually get the this dot image so if you don't mind letting me simplify this enormously because i think that'll also be more helpful for those of you who are just watching just right now so we're going to um i'm going to no i'm going to not have this normalizing code we're not going to go through any data just yet we're going to get a country like us i'm going to get the lat long for that country if it exists i'm going to not bother with the count i'm going to push 1 we're going to get this i don't need this min max i'm not worrying about the diameter wait lat long the diameter is just going to be 20. just for right now what have i done wrong am i missing a bracket something is wrong let data oh this is an extra bucket right what's going on here country no no okay i'm just hard coding in a country drain map overlay canvas okay hard coding in a country i'm getting the lat long of that country if the lat long exists pushing it into an array and then i'm so confused oh i see this is like uh there we go this is what i'm doing that's the mistake okay now for every country it's not going to be this is not going to be a country anymore forever i'm just going to call this like a viewer of data map the viewer's latitude and longitude to pixels fill oh i see adds this weird frame count thing going fill zoom is the train map zoom scale draw a circle with the viewer's diameter times scale okay so if all goes according to plan this is a very very simple bit of code for me to just draw one dot on the country of the u.s okay cannot read properties of undefined reading us countries u.s there it is um okay country equals us console log lat long let's try this 28. oh i forgot to load i forgot i was commenting out loading the data but i need this data okay there we go look okay my one dot all right so now um let's just make this four okay so now what i can do is i'm going to go back to this google form that hopefully everybody had a chance i'm going to give everybody um i think we've had some donations so i can maybe do one more song i don't know i don't want to do any more songs let's get some momentum going here um i'm just going to go back and i'm checking that google form now uh oh i have 80 responses that's great and i'm just looking at it no bad words that i can see nothing obvious there could be some and by the way um it's interesting to see okay great all right so i'm gonna st i could i can redownload oh 81. so i'm going to download this data um i think i can show it to you um you know i will quickly move away if something appears unseemly in here um so um basically uh um hopefully i can manage with uh the like strange way all the data is formatted but we can see all these locations so let's now uh just download this and you know sometimes it makes it easier let's do download as a csv and i'll come back and redownload this later if more people are entering viewers csv so let me bring this in over here into data and we have timestamp city country so um where am i here so i want to load i'm going to call it viewer data viewer data equals load table um viewers.csv comma header and then like so i think the way that i go through this for i'm it's in the code i had it in here so let's take a look i can't remember the way that i go through a csv um for load table let row of youtube data dot rows okay let row of viewer data.rows and then let country i'm just going to do start with country equal row dot um row dot row.get and so i'm using the so what am i doing here p5 has a special function built into it called load table which will parse a csv file for you otherwise i'd have to like load it as text and use split and chop it up by commas and so i can use this kind of fancy low loop to look at every single row and then what i want to get out of every single row just for the moment is the country i actually want to use the city i'm going to get the city the city is what i want to use so let's just go straight for it get city and then i'm going to say console.log city and let's just see what happens okay looks like there's a problem loading your data file viewers.csv ah it is in a folder called data there we go great so we can see i've got a list of all these cities now so i should be able to how do i find the latitude longitude of a city there's got to be some nice api i can use to do that api lat long of city geocoding well this is an ad i probably shouldn't start with whatever was advertised to me smarty streets developers geocoding api google has one open weather map i've used this before um okay i need an api key i have an api key somebody in the chat tell me if you if you have a better one and q q one of the p5 leads of p5.js is in the chat hello um you deserve a song i'm going to check in a minute um sorry as i look at my phone to try to find my open weather map password i'm like i have all these notifications let's see if i have it shared saved see this is if i had a chance to prepare in advance open weather map i i have a password now the question is what email did i use i'm going to just click away from this while i try to log into this and see if i have a valid api key which you will all immediately have access to so this this api key is going to be no good uh i already forgot what i was typing remember me that was not i think i mistyped the password and that did not work but could it be no this is not going very well this is not going very well what i'm trying to do right now in case you just tuned in is i'm looking for an api that can if i can pass it a city name i can get a um if i can pass it a city name i can get a lat long value and i know that open weather map will do this and i should just create a new account so i'm going to go through the process of doing that and i'm going to show it to you to the extent that um i'll create a new one under my coding train email uh well i don't usually use google's password manager thing but let's use it right now um i'm kind of them very robotic account email already taken oh maybe that was the password this is such a failure this is what anybody else anybody else have uh um anybody anybody else has a a better um suggestion ah all right um g um la long city to lat long lookup table maybe there's a big json file i could download cities of the world in json cities it's 12.4 megabytes so that's a good sign oh look at this this is good i'm just gonna use a big giant file i mean we're going to have some issues with spelling errors but we're going to do our best okay all right so we're going to download this save this as cities.json okay so um we're going to load cities equals cities.json so we're doing this based off cities now and what i'm going to do now is also just say and if i look at cities how is it organized it's a big array so okay okay okay okay i know it's a big file you don't want to look at it so big um i did tell them to quiet down but they did not listen to me there's some chattering away happy on december 31st we're just all having a party no school today let's play play play loudly loud no no more out of the dad is trying to concentrate really hard on coding a really important project with some small amount of people watching is no good my city is not on there armor we will correct that for you so any cities that are missing from this file we will add in manually okay we can do that uh console.log city let's just make sure this is coming through uh data okay cities are coming through there's an error country is not being defined okay where oh okay let's take this out okay sketch 36 so that's the viewer data how come this didn't come out console what i don't have this data it seems cities dot length undefined cities load json data cities let cities okay oh it's an object so it's not actually an array it is an array how come it didn't load it as an array and this is fine can i just do let city of cities oh no so this is not iterable all right i have an idea i'm going to put it in an object now i have to get all the way to the bottom which is going to be very hard there's a lot of cities this is crazy what i'm doing it's got to be a better way get to the bottom get to the bottom of this okay oh come back to me no that's not formatted correctly it really hates this 12 megabyte file what have i done can i just put it in make it the first ah shouldn't that work all right let's hold on okay see you later uh it is a big city's object array from cities me oh i could have done array from cities uh it's not 2022 yet max oh this is what a wonderful group of people in the chat watching me have a total meltdown here trying to just load a 12 megabyte json file which was probably a terrible idea in the first place because now i have to match up the way that you typed your city i know it's not a dictionary i'm going to make it into a dictionary that's what i'm trying to do okay hold on yeah i know it's not iterable i don't want to iterate it just yet for all the iterable okay just give me something here there we go look at that look at this i made it work the way i wanted it to once again i got a little bit dizzy oh i think i'm going to pull the muscle in my back all right everything's going to be fine everybody getting there it's a little kind of warm in here even though it's quite cold in temperature okay everyone so now um for uh four let city of cities dot cities this should work console log city there we go look at that look at that boom boom boom oh i'm console logging like 128 bazillion million cities this is terrible it's never going to end oh dear what have i done what have i done what have i done okay we got to the end what's that sound weird weird creaking hum what strange creature is roaming through the attic of this garage okay um all right now next up i want to make a lookup table so we're going to call this city lookup and make it an object so as i go through every city i want the name to be the thing that gets me the lookup um console.log oh but so um city dot name dot to lowercase so i definitely want to make everything to lower case that'll help a little bit okay those are all the cities to lower case um let name now we're going to i'm sure there's higher order array function magic that i could do to transform the array to like a lookup table object but i'm going to do it manually i'm going to say city lookup city lookup name equals that city so all of the metadata associated with the city i can get to just by its name this way when i go to the viewers and i get their city and i say to lowercase i should be able to now say console.log city and then console.log city lookup that city to see if i can get the metadata so let's see and then let me just put in a little like line breaky thing so out of the 80 or so values that i currently have of people watching two locale lower case thank you to locale lowercase i've never used that but i like that suggestion oh again just as i put that there and my i have a discord notification which is nothing to do with anything okay two lowercase we're gonna celebrate the new year i gotta check donations sink some old lang sign uh next year could be a rocket that goes from one city to the next one and get some fireworks at each city that's a great idea this i'm hoping is going to get somewhere at some point okay so holly springs we got stuttgart seville batumi sturbridge golden colorado hmm paris blacksburg so new delhi new delhi we got so some aren't working so why didn't it get bangalore let's see if we can figure this out like bangalore should 100 be in there is there another way it could be written that's my question so all right let's print out all the ones where it doesn't find anything oh we have a donation i'm gonna have to do a song has anybody written me more lyrics or do i have to use ai again because refresh here any pull request no really only two only two includes includes ah yes that's a good idea but first let me make a list of okay uh let me i'm gonna like make a list of everything that it doesn't have so this is only going to print out any that it couldn't found bangalore is now bengaluru thank you akshat so this is good to know so this we're going to do some data cleaning everybody all right so toronto and there goes the heater sometimes you just can't stop the heater from going on um so why is toronto not in there that seems crazy for ron toronto is there but why is there a toronto in the u.s that's weird there's a lot of toronto so that doesn't make any sense there's so many cities with the same name this is really going to be a problem all right let's go to um the uh the data here so let's so this should be bengaluru let's just check if bengaluru is in there yep so that we can fix bangalore should be bengaluru now we can fix okay now why did it is there was there like a space with toronto it's the first one which is a little weird salah north richland hills amman regai phoenix phoenix this is why i want to use an api now so it's there what did i miss this seems weird well i guess i should okay row get city to lower case data city look up city uh oh it got four it got four phoenix's i'm lost yeah good point oh i have a console ah i have that there no wonder oh my gosh no wonder thank you for that oh my goodness that was like the worst the worst error i don't know what to play for that all right okay so this makes more sense probably like accents we got some commas here so these are the cities that didn't work i bet you if i get rid of the common new york there we're gonna do a little bit more yeah we're gonna do a little bit more cleanup west niacc the problem is i really want to send it the full country because there's going to be some serious problems there um columbus i can fix um golden i can fix by taking out the state i mean that data is good data so i okay so i'm going to have to leave the fact that some of these don't work right now just to see if we can get to having the dots appear on the map okay let's see here so we're going back to the code so now so for each viewer so now i want to create a viewer oh i'm just going to say viewers dot push that data and then and then here oh i guess it's called data what did i call it no this should be viewers so each viewer gets the city data pushed into an array and then each viewer of viewers and i forget what the object looks like so let's just console.log viewer and then i'm going to say no loop and see if this works okay good so now why do i have a oh yeah country latitude longitude name so it's just latlng so this should actually still work lato but this should be lng and um i don't have i'm just going to make everyone 16 pixels and that should work so let's see and then i'm going to take out the new loop see what happens okay this is currently why am i still console logging something oh yeah this in theory is a dot for everybody watching right now uh everybody who entered instead of reg regular okay so the problem is i need a better way of getting the latitude and longitudes but and also if two people are in the same place so a couple things i want to do i think i'd like to give everybody a little bit of random offset um and uh also give some alpha so let's just so we can see if there's more than one i think if i just do random seed five it should like where is the city that more than one person entered like if two people i don't know if somebody can tell me what city this is over here that maybe two people entered or it's just coincidentally like like were there a lot of new yorks this must be all the new york people the normal person donate okay can people see themselves is somebody is somebody a rally north carolina so i forgot what the point of doing this was oh we're gonna make little new year's fireworks and countdowns for all of these spots all right let's see everybody knowing now here's the thing if you do not see your dot here if you do not see your dot here what i would like you to do is reenter to the google form so i'm going to do i'm going to check donations and do a song but i'm going to get everybody to reenter their data so but now if you see your dot here you don't need to reenter your data if you think that your dot isn't there if this is you if one of these is you um it's not showing up reenter your city name matching uh whatever is in this so like montreal like why is ah because of the accent so montreal didn't show up because of the accent so i need the correct accent so i could correct some of these but if you're still watching um and that's if you're bangalore also please change it because i changed those mango manually so i'm going to redownload the data so let me repost the form no i don't want to share this i want to i want to share the form send the form so i'm going to post this form back to the chat we're going to get fireworks going you need to make it so you can edit your responses can i do that yes okay hold on that would be excellent okay uh settings allow response okay i have now allowed response editing so hopefully so you can either also edit your response edit your response you can see i have 90 responses now or you can just reenter it because if it failed it'll still fail and the correct one will come in okay so now i am going back to um the stream and i am oh yeah now oh the link to the city the what the cities look like so where did i find those anybody remember where i found those let me actually cities yeah this is it so this is i'm also going to post this into the chat this is the list of the cities so you want to make sure your city name matches i could remove the accent that could be a way but let's try to match the accents okay everybody so now we're going to do we're going to do some donation thanking while we wait uh we're gonna do some donation thinking where is support p5 okay oh whoa so many donations have come in i don't understand the order here cliff is where we started oh matthieu was right there so we had uh machia i sang a song for roberto thank you stefan thank you indy long live rodrigo okay here we go everybody we are going to yeah don't alka don't worry the time zone is irrelevant now um you can ignore that all right i'm gonna hit refresh everybody okay we're gonna see did we get some new donations in to support processing in the year 2022 here we go everybody yay all right david keck keep dance singing careful what you wish for yarn ray for more people in science thank you rodrigo called so many people do we have a new song to sing i don't know if we do there's a new song in the readme all right all right this is to dedicate it to all of you donators who donated here david guillerm rodrigo everybody but those are the ones since the last time here we go i'm looking for the github uh and let's see here i guess somebody who had permission merged or added one linux distros [Laughter] this is kind of amazing i have been trying to change the auto encoder to color and can't figure out the right dimensions from kfont 22. kfun um are you in the discord um i i really want to work more on the auto encoder i actually want to turn it into a video and so i would love to help you with that and let's see how this goes should should tenser dim be denied and cause a fatal error should i lose my mind i'll comment out the working code and start a fresh next time oh tenser dim oh tenser dim oh tenser dim oh tenser dim how do i match your shape how i forgot where i was what is the correct shape wait how does the song go again and start a fresh next time oh tense or demo tense or dim what is the correct shape oh wait i start over be denied and cause a fatal error should i lose my my mind i'll comment out the working code so slow and start a fresh net next time oh tenser dimensions what is the correct shape i am losing should i lose next time see you later tonight have a great evening st petersburg russia is in the json file but it wasn't showing all right we're going to find out all right so now everybody's had a chance i everybody's had a chance to reenter their cities or edit them i'm just scanning through it oh responder updated oh that's so cool montreal responder updated updated the great great great and we've got some new cities um cacao rock club okay we're gonna see all right bengaluru excuse me oh that was a little i think you know all that singing it's uh everything's oh you're not even seeing what i'm looking at um we're gonna download this again okay this is our this is a spreadsheet of everybody this is perfectly accurate it's a onetoone perfect list of every single person watching and what city they're in no mistakes download to csv and i'm going to grab this and say viewers this is going to be now this is going to be really good i'm going to keep track of this file and the difference between the previous one by naming this viewers dash 2 version control magic okay so viewers dash 2 then goes to can i just like drag it into uh visual studio code oh where where are you no computer ah what is going on i don't know how to use a computer help finder where did you go oh my god you're the worst i cannot operate this machine i cannot operate it what has happened okay hold on there ah what just what viewers too your virgin my virgin control was too much for it viewers dash two sketch so we don't need this very simple sketch here viewers dash two so just to remind you i am loading the spreadsheet of all of the viewers who entered in their city their honest city of where they are with the precise spelling of the way that it also is in my giant json file of cities and latitude longitudes good this is the optimal absolute best way of doing this nobody could possibly come up with a better solution and then i am going to for every city that the viewer is i'm going to look up and put it into an array with the latitude and longitude then i'm going to find that latitude longitude convert it to a pixel location and draw it on a map and i'm gonna hit refresh and we're gonna see everybody's location this is looking pretty good do we have new zealand nobody from new zealand no australia alaska i really want to do like some hovering over we can see some clusters so here's everybody currently watching the live stream at the moment now we need to celebrate new year's for everybody so uh let's see where uh oh my god um where has it like like what see like what time it is in malaysia for example um oh my goodness happy new year malaysia happy new year ah man we missed it we missed it happy new year happy new year oh jason i wonder if your athens got put into greece because of my highly sophisticated system so these are the ones that aren't showing up because i need to correct them this still didn't show up i don't know why but montreal worked right so we're still missing some zurich maybe it has an accent in it st petersburg you think it's listed as it without the full worth saint i don't know anyway this is this is gonna have to do because i've got a lot of time here folks we're gonna make some fireworks happen okay we're gonna make some fireworks happen it just turned midnight in pakistan ah wait i'm seeing in the the discord chat string normalize replace we'll strip accents uh uh all right that's that so i'm i'm i'm gonna i'm gonna post this and hope um that people can help me make it work better but ultimately i should really be using a geocoding api which would probably let me put stuff in in much more arbitrary form i should have i should have probably spent a little longer with open weather map but we're going to go next to fireworks and we're going to grab this code oh are you kidding me oh that's the saddest thing i've ever seen i wrote this code so long ago it's not even using classes okay so hold on i probably hopefully corrected it in the web editor version because i i have been doing that periodically yes yes okay so now we're gonna make a new file we're gonna call it firework.js put that in here i'm going to make a new file call it particle.js and then that goes here now i forgot how this works um let's just so we make a firework and then update and show and if it's done splice it okay so this shouldn't be too hard so basically i need now in my main okay so first on index.html i need to reference firework and particle so i'm now pulling in the coding challenge of fireworks and um i'm going to make an array called fireworks and then in setup i'm going to say fireworks dot push new firework i don't know what um right i just give it oh no i don't even give it a uh oh wait because it doesn't i'm just gonna all right fine it gets its own location and then and then let's just write a nice little loop to draw them we're going to see what happens here gravity is not defined firework.update i guess i must have made a global variable called gravity apply force gravity huh well let's just make an arbitrary vector pointing down oh there it is did you see it there's the firework hey that's exciting okay okay this is good this is good so first of all the map is very bright so um a couple things one is uh the firework colors should probably be much darker it gets a hue and where do i draw the particles here okay so let's just make them darker so i think it'll show up better oop no stroke is not defined where did i type that here there we go see that beautiful firework that went off there now what i'm going to do i could have just asked for lat long i should have had everybody just enter their lat long we could go back and do that okay all right so now what i want to do is one at a time each dot is going to be starting a firework so um now where the firework begins is x y no where's the firework it gets a random location so i want to be able to give the firework a location so i'm going to pass in an x and y okay i'm gonna pass in an x and y and then um so in my sketch now i'm going to have a counter viewer counter equals zero i might want to sort all the viewers by time zone so we'd see the like happy new year ripple across um and i'm going to say in draw if and let's just do it once every 30 frames uh new firework so hold on the the x y uh so uh uh viewer equals viewers uh viewer counter is that right like i want to get what is the current viewer and then i want to make a new i need a new like pixel location i need that pixel location which i can convert that viewer's latitude longitude to the pixel location x y and then create a firework at pix.x pix.y and then a new firework yeah that's good and then i'm still going to draw all the viewers just so i can see and then i should be able to say viewer counter plus plus viewer count is not defined what did i call it viewer counter say viewer index let's whoops let's call it viewer index so viewer index viewer index and obviously i'm going to get to the end of the array at some point but i'll deal with that is there is the mic making weird sound do we see any fireworks oh they're going way yep i see them they're go okay so they're launching way too high so i believe in the firework um which actually makes a particle and it gets an initial velocity which i need to make much less um let's just see if that helps and i don't understand where the gravity thing happens i'm not going to worry about it where was this gravity thing happening i don't understand i don't remember this code oh yeah there we go so they're all being the same color right now and they're okay so this is good yeah i think there's some interference going on i thought i had that corrected with this mic but i'm gonna not worry about it okay wait wait this is good all right it's just very hard to see why is it in a different oh because of the random seed okay we don't need that random seed anymore so let's get rid of this all right we don't need to draw all the dots or oh yeah so let's do that i bet you i could zoom and pan the map also automatically yeah yes print the city so let's have i like this idea so first of all i want these particles to be more visible hue saturation brightness yeah that's better darker so if it's not a firework do this otherwise and then text all right so let's get the city in here so now when i create the firework new firework oh uh oh yeah so i don't want the city here and what i want is to see the city um let's just put it in a fixed location just for a second is it font size or text size i can't remember i think it's text size in p5 city is not defined this city is not defined number seven line seven when i made the firework when i made the firework oh god where do i make the firework here oh now i need the city the name viewer was it name i don't even remember city is that what it is hold on console.log viewer name name so uh make a firework viewer.name okay particle.js oh particle js right silly me yay the cities are popping up well it's something happy new year everybody happy new year goa happy new year chicago happy new year grito all right how do i make this appear a little bit longer and so the other thing i want to do is have them ripple across the map so i think i should sort them so and i should probably have the city name uh i have an idea all right we're gonna we're gonna clean this up a little it's 215. how's everybody doing you stall still with me people actually watching um all right let's try to clean this up a little bit if we had some more donations do we have more new new lyrics do i need to sing some more we're going to finish this off to make something nice not that what we don't have is isn't good already but let's think about how we're displaying the city name well let's first do the sorting so uh i have my list of viewers right viewers is an array so what i want to do is say viewers.sort you know what let's do the x y as part of the viewer here so when that data is the city's data the pixels whoops so data's pixels are converted from its latitude and longitude i mean obviously i should sort by latitude like but i'm going to just use pixels so i could go from right to left it'll make my life easier um so the um so then now down here i actually can just say the viewers pixel.x and the viewerspixel.y and the viewer's name so let me just make sure that this still works okay wait why why is it not getting the lat and the lawn sketch line 43 sketch line 42 oh what what i'm so confused oh well that's obviously a mistake hold on why is it printing out the actual data and then undefined i'll do the fireworks with shaders yeah i don't think so what did i miss here i'm just trying to make things a little simpler grow city oh because some of them ah ah i forgot if i'm gonna do more stuff i need to do it here got it i have it has to be valid then i should be able to say yeah yeah of course give me the pixels uh sketchjs 41 no oh no no yeah ah this goes here okay this is right now i'm getting the data metadata for a given city if i couldn't find it just show me that i couldn't find it otherwise add the pixel value to that metadata and put it into an array that took me way too long to get okay toronto stockholm okay but i took the fireworks out that's fine i no data.pix no the fireworks should still be in there why are the fireworks not showing now what happened to the fireworks console.log viewer.pics all right that's weird is the map not oh because oh i always have to ah no no no no i can't do that the x and y is something that has to be processed and draw because i'm dynamically calculating the pixel values based on the map orientation so this was a lot of wasted energy for something that i cannot do i will have to sort by latitude and longitude fine i can handle that so sorry everybody this has to go back here that was a digression that was a very bad idea and now we should be back to fireworks at the proper location of the given cities okay all right so boy did i waste some time there so let's look at let's think about let's see if we can look at a nice like image of the globe showing us latitude and longitude um so i can like think about sorting it so i want to sort by longitude longitude being the long lines latitude being the so let's try sorting let's just try sorting it by longitude and see what happens so if i were going to go here and say viewers sort and then i need a function that compares a and b two elements of the array and i want to say console log a dot lat b what was i saying i was gonna do longitude b dot longitude just curious all right i get all these numbers now are they strings the question is are they strings because in theory i could just do return b dot long minus a dot long i mean i can make sure they're a number by doing this let's see what this gets me yes look at the happy new year going across okay so i got to do something about the text i got to do something about the text of my uh the city we got to improve that and we i want these to be much sparklier so we're going to we got to make these nicer so let's deal with the t where am i drawing the text i'm just absurdly hard coding drawing it somewhere um so this dot firework so i think i actually always want to draw it whether it's exploded or not as long as yeah as long as there's still life so i'm gonna do uh this dot firework dot is it pause does it does the firework itself have a location no it has a particle yeah this dot firework.pause okay so this should give me the city uh 64 is kind of huge and um text align right aligned and center and then let's draw it over by like five pixels and i i want to fix the okay let's see this should work better this is an improvement i did right aligned why did i do right aligned i meant left or i could just do it center center and put it above that might make more sense so how do i do this where do i get that zoom value um because when i'm drawing the particle there's like the zoom of the map i should have it fade that's what i should have it do okay hold on everybody um i think i mean this is going to be as good as i'm going to get i'm just going to have to hard code the the size in where does it where did i draw it again all right right here okay make it 16. let's get rid of the stroke and does this have like a lifespan does this one have a lifespan i think it does or is it the particle's lifespan i don't know i think it's the fireworks lifespan what is it doing is it drawing it twice let's see if this thing was actually a thing it's 255. that lifespan's not going down why not if the particle shapes into the name of the city then explodes yes that would be good oh no i don't have time for that i do have i've i have ways to get there that's such a good suggestion though wait okay hold on hold on um we're gonna celebrate new year's i swear in some way at some point i want to get so particle if it's not oh if it's not a firework that's only then its lifespan goes down well i'll have its life span go down uh whether it's a particle or whether it's a firework or not why is it not fading let's see here all right hold on i can make this happen on my own accord we're going to go into the firework and we're going to say uh this dot fade equals 255 oh is it because the hue saturation brightness thing this dot fade this dot fade minus equals 10. i don't know why i can't get it to fade out but maybe i shouldn't care it also should be the same color there's so many ways this could be improved oh but i do kind of like it it's something it's a project it works in its own weird way okay all right what can i do to improve this i don't know why the fading is not working um maybe because of hue saturation brightness maybe the text i mean the order shouldn't matter like what if i put just hard code 10 in here it's really making me crazy there we go it's because of the rgb color mode the rgb color mode is messing that up yeah there we go that's what i was going for should just have a color palette not used i don't know why hsb but i want to use the same color as i don't know why the alpha should wouldn't work oh no now it's working except they're all the same but each one should get a new one oh no i so i put that back in there why why why why why why why why why why why why why why is this a bug in p5 have we found a bug in p5 that alpha doesn't work with rgb hold on everybody we will test this okay so um let's draw now a rectangle zero zero two hundred four hundred okay so alpha blending is clearly uh working alpha blending is not working why does anybody anybody see like right like hsb the alpha value is not uh all right we're gonna change this is really making me crazy because i really want it to fade i also want it to be courier font because that yeah but it's hsb is where the issues oh the default is from 0 to 1.0 says bruno ah aha thank you this is probably the case and i just didn't realize that there we are bruno thank you the default for the alpha which uh that's fading out way too fast okay this is better already now i wonder if the text shouldn't actually move like the text should be where the city is all right so this is right so this is what i wanted um i would like i don't know about the font but um okay so now the question is oops the text is not this doesn't really work i'm not really live updating everything's location according to the lat long i should be doing that um because it's really just generating them from where they start but i'll that could be fixed but i have to wrap this up because it's almost three o'clock um and uh like share this somehow or improve it in a way that people could make their own version of it all right so what what should i do what more can i do here before i say goodbye um so we could first of all have many more particles like 500 i think the particles themselves could be bursting out a little bit less far um and or slowing down a little faster um well that's pretty extreme that looks less fireworky so no they should be fading out faster that's that was the mistake for it to be more fireworky i feel like it needs some maybe all the particles should be different colors oh no no no no no no no no no that's the wrong thing it's the lifespan going down oh so where does the so i'm not even doing the life span correctly here this should be 1.0 so this was a mistake in my previous version and an update where does the lifespan go down so confused how come i don't see where i am decreasing the lifespan i don't think the firework manages everything show apply force apply gravity apply force update splice it's weird i don't see that's right that's where i'm using the life span that's where i'm setting the life span that's where i'm checking if it's less than zero i think i deleted it by accident so that's a problem should be an update so anyway let me remedy that yeah i think i just messed that up i don't know they're less fireworky than they were before oh yeah happy new year so what if i sent off a few i think it would be better if i sent off a few in like random locations okay i've got an idea i have an idea this is gonna be better okay okay i'm gonna make this better everybody then we're gonna put this away i only want to change which city i'm on and i should say i should future proof this modulo i only want to change the city every once every second or so and actually we can we could we could even take a little bit longer then i could say if random one is less than like so every 10 frames about create a new firework we could give it a little um we could also have a vector we could also make a little random vector to offset it a little bit so they're not all in the same location oh and it's doing the city multiple times so i like this better already but i think the city should not i think the city shouldn't move it should be doing something more interesting kathy's saying go spend all right i can reduce the number of particles i think but i like this it's more of a pop pop pop exciting thing let's um let's expand the um uh the uh the offset for each of these i think it kind of works i think the text should maybe actually be a different color and over top of it we need some sound effects actually i think i'm kind of happy with this i think it actually just happened faster so um like what if yeah i like it happening faster i think the text i have an idea for the text that's going to make things better um the text where am i drawing the text i am going to go back to text align left and then x plus 25. i don't know how i feel about the text uh i don't know how i feel about the text um repeating itself so many times so what if the text like the firework didn't move okay i even i have an idea what if the text didn't actually move no but it's still why isn't the text just appearing on top of itself oh because i have that random offset where do i do that offset okay i'm going to give it the raw city x i mean i'm really grasping at straws here um this is going to be done in a second i just i'm obsessively want to fix this last thing where the text is is very readable um and when i create the firework now there's this offset but i can just give it pix.x pix.y and now there's so much that could be refactored here there we go i like this better i want the text to fade out a little bit faster so it's not as overlapping so let me do that then i'm going to be done i think i want a different font also oh this is very important stuff here where am i drawing the text again i've already forgotten in firework and it's fading out uh yeah because it's happening much faster now but also we could be way more zoomed in see i want to follow the map it's much it's really nice to be more zoo montreal is not there what i don't know what's going on everybody i'm sorry i think it's not i don't have things properly updating yeah it doesn't yeah i agree all right fine let's go back to all right hold on this i think this is this is where i want to be with this i just i it's got an issue where i can no longer move the map around i i don't know why it's totally off with certain latitude and longitudes what have i done it looked like everything was so right to start i i'm am i not using the zoom properly oh something's wrong with the zoom that's weird i broke something right because if i go back to my original code oh no that doesn't work either no oh yeah oh no it works i just was it was caching let's just see something latitude yeah you know it probably is it's probably that there's these small cities that are named after other cities in the u.s and so that's messing it up because of my silly because there's probably a london colorado you know because i'm not properly looking up the cities but i'm going to leave it at this i'm going to upload this so people can mess with it and make a nicer version of it you can all i can imagine so many improvements i don't know how long have i been going here are people still donating um but i i think um i think um i'm sorry i'm looking at twitter right now this is i think where i'm gonna get to all right what's all right so let's see let's see i think it's time for another song what about you maybe some random numbers we'll leave this going in the background we're celebrating new year's all across the world and i'm sorry for all of the incorrect city locations um let's zoom this in just a little bit good there we go okay all right now let's look where we last left off david keck had said keep singing dan do we have any more song lyrics well that's the question we have any more donations i have to make my donation i guess i'll do that the moment i log off we've definitely hit 500 for sure do we have any new donations we certainly do we have gerard we have stephen kazur we have barry and we have jessica now am i do i have to rely on ai my random number book or some new song lyrics let's see uh there's a pull request there's the auto encoder okay let's take a look pull request stop deleting my song's song processing oh i want it this is great all right oh but we don't want to put python in the bin just to the side just to the side we don't want to cast up we don't want to cat we don't want to uh say mean things about other programming languages thank you anonymous so i'm gonna i'm gonna see if i can flower up this song in real time but i love that it's got processing in it okay so we're gonna merge it maybe i'll maybe i'll do some oh it's already been merged okay wait a sec or committed is it merged revert i don't know what's going on i don't know how to use i don't know how to use this version control i just like to rename my files dash two okay let's go to edit here and go down to okay should hexadecimal be forgot and c sharp not for today should basic just be to basic be my childhood memory and today today i code with really ruining this i'm so sorry for javascript is fine my dear nj sun it does shine we'll put the python aside for now but python is wonderful too for sake of process sign okay all i want for new year is code okay i could maybe make that happen i'm sorry i'm very uh i'm very sensitive to sort of like programming language battles and i um for me it's very important that all programming languages are great to use for different reasons at different times on different days i happen to love using processing in p5 we're here to celebrate that community but that community welcomes in you learning and programming with csharp and python and basic and boy does json does it shine all i want for christmas is code all i want for new years is code okay i could go back to some previous year's songs wait you changed the chords on me i don't know these chords so it does you also changed the chords on me i was doing it in c i think i know them though so it's fine should hexadecimal b forgot and c sharp just not for today should basic just be my childhood memory and today i code with processing for javascript is fine my dear i can't transpose it in my head and json it does shine we'll put the python it doesn't bite aside for now but python is wonderful too you should learn it for the sake of yeah i was struggling the other key but i need pictures of the chords i don't really play the ukulele i just learned those chords this morning or yesterday i i spent a year learning the ukulele like two years ago but i haven't picked it up in at least a year all right i'm gonna be done unless there's more donations um there was something came up though oh yes um where is my holiday songs um all right we can go back in time we can go back in time to 2020. no um all i want for new year's this is pretty good boy these were those were the days i had all this free time everybody wrote all these songs i don't have my ukulele book with all the chords i have a whole book do i have any of the um do i still have the tab with all of my old oh my god i do i don't need a lot for coding there is just one thing i need incentives can keep on floating underneath binary trees i just want the code to work just waiting for you to be done make my code error free all i want for new years is my code to run yeah baby i don't need a lot for new year's there is just one thing i need i don't care about these pixels underneath the computer screen don't need to know my set location or rather the print projection algorithms won't make me happy with a high complexity i got off there high complexity i just want was that even the right song lyrics are the right song i have no idea oh and cranium this is for you go to snowman do you wanna code a snowman we can color with rgb oh i need the melody if you wanna code a snowman we can color with rgb we can coat a stack of circles and a triangle for a nose that's pretty sweet you've just got to use ellipse you can use circle now stroke weight background and then add in a fill that's why do you wanna do you wanna go to snowman it doesn't have to be go away daniel hey wait what's that okay bye oh so me all right thank you ed cranium for your donation 7m chop 7m join today cap 7m welcome to coding train membership today is not about the coding terrain membership program today is about the processing foundation its 20th anniversary in the year 2020 it's not 2020 it's 20 20 21. it's gonna be 2022 what i don't even know what's going on anymore but thank you for joining a random number coming your way find the google form join the discord et cetera et cetera reach out um and all that stuff i'm so tired it's three o'clock how long have i been going three hours ah buffer overflow is exactly right all right are we doing another song okay um let's check uh our donation board um where's the donation page here it is jessica parente do we have another donation do i need to keep going because i will i will keep going i'm really hoping there's more donations i mean i want there to be more donations i just want them to not beat in this in the next two minutes so i can say goodbye i'm gonna have a wild party tonight let me tell you okay everybody thank you thank you thank you thank you oh this has been the cody train um you know the worst thing you can ever do is eat on a live broadcast i've been doing this for three hours and this orange has been here this entire time my mute button is even broken this is going to give me a little boost a little vitamin c little natural sugars encourage you eat the fruit of the land i'm gonna just take a look at the chat i'm gonna wish everybody a happy new year i want to say happy new year everybody i was going to do kind of like a year in review of the coding train but i didn't get a chance to prepare that it's going to take me a couple weeks to get my feet under me in the new year but i have a lot of plans if there are things that you find that are the most useful to you or that you'd like to see more of join the discord let me know support processing um how loud is the chewing it's got to be like just like the most grating thing on your ears right i really hope you enjoyed today this barely happened this year i really want to i know i joke about it but i really want to be able to do more work to prepare and plan for fun projects and goofy shtick and have guests and all of that this coming or maybe it never will nature of code though my new year's resolution here's my new year's resolution to all of you have you been wanting to see a second edition of the nature of code book come out with all javascript examples i mean it's kind of already there but it's not finished and wrapped up and made it a nice neat little bow and you could buy it as a new year holiday present by next holiday if you wanted to buy somebody a physical copy of the nature of code book with in javascript as a present that's my new year's resolution saying it here putting it on the universe otherwise i just want to be a good person and i want my kids to have a good year they'll go to school i want all of you to have your coding dreams come true um i love you all this is such a special thing that i get to do i'm in this garage i want to get this garage set up i want to figure out get this white board working you can see it's apparently not working music is really filling me it's just like generic thank you epidemic sound i have an account with epidemic sound where i can download music that i can use on my little channel epidemic sound nature coded python 2023 happy new year oh it's the music's over i haven't finished my orange i don't want to say goodbye i'm i don't want to say goodbye i should say goodbye okay wait let's get this going quick check okay good we're still good what where where did i go here i am we're gonna we're gonna enter full screen how do i get this top thing to go away go away houston canada we love you houston canada all right um be in touch uh let's see follow donate to processing if you can say it's the last day for those rewards um if you oh whoa whoa whoa whoa let's do this um if you got nothing to do today um let's go uh coding train let's make a new repo coding train oh happy new year 2022 code from today's live stream let's do this i'm going to make this repository then i'm going to so i will accept pull requests to just make this nicer and more interesting but also i would more than that i would encourage you to just grab the code and make your own version of it share it on social media as we all and maybe i'll work on it more today so that tonight we can i can have a nicer um um happy new years all over the world message to send out i wanted to have something that was like a really nice happy new years to the processing community around the world that was kind of the goal didn't entirely get there but i think i would gladly gladly um accept pull requests to making this prettier making it work nicer um and adding like the processing logo and the message messages of love and happiness and support and joy to everybody so i'm just putting it up in its raw format um let's see then i'm going to go to settings and i am going to go to uh pages has its own dedicated tab okay i'm going to just use the main branch all right so oh how come i made it in shiffman not in coding train uh hold on we are going to do settings transfer transfer ownership this is what i always do by the way whoever tells me to type this to confirm i always just copy paste it i feel like i'm this is like i am being so bad i'm like i was like such a rebel oh my god yeah i i'm sticking it to you internet rules but really i'm just hurting myself aren't i because i don't know all right transfer oh you got to be kidding me now i need to put all right let's see if that works okay uh just transfer it okay um so now where do i find it by the way if you want to write me some new lyrics i could start a tick tock and i could just sing old lag sein on tik tok right i made a short of me trying to sing one of them just out of uh on youtube to see how that would go um all right so here on github coding train slash happy new year dash 2022 by the way i don't know why anybody would want to do this but as soon as i the the whole stream archive will be there so hvhbot who's asking um as soon as i uh shut this down i mean you should be able to rewind it right now but it'll certainly be their archive under the same link so now if i go to settings pages should be here all right what's the issue oh mixed content shoot oh what did i do what's insecure element what did it what does it oh okay that should still work right that must be why um let's make sure this still works i don't know oh this still works okay so couple things one is zoom and i gotta make that https so oh i didn't actually all right i'm just going to be lazy and go to um code sorry everybody we're getting there i'm gonna go to where was that just in sketch.js edit look away don't look at how i'm coding best practices where are you in the chat best practices within the chat best practice is going to come and chastise me where is it i don't even know where it is okay zoom one https this is what i'm changing here by the way zoom one and i'm adding https thank you me i am so me for posting the link um i'm hoping that tonight i can make a nice little video like like we can improve this page that's not like it's missing things like it's missing the processing like celebrating processing it's missing the cities being in the wrong place it's missing a way for people to add their own city there's so much we could do today all together because well you have the whole day free to contribute to this um now let's go to i should know how to get to the pages i'm just going to do it the way i know which is here and i'm going to go to here this is ridiculous it'll go to here please work yeah but i think that's just because pages hasn't uh republished yet there we go okay why is it not full screening this map oh i had it hardcoded at 800600 what is wrong with me i didn't know that this is definitely the way to work on a project editing the code on github and expecting github pages to wait to just see if your change has worked okay last let's put it back to 1.5 this is a great idea this is a great idea and change this to window height what could go wrong nothing i tell you nothing commit and he's not any second now any second now any any moment i got nothing i had nothing to do just waiting just hitting refresh having it weirdly centered incorrectly everything about this wrong to caching all right hold on everybody i no longer can tolerate this let's pull down this repo no no no no no no no hmm this is not the one i'm working on i don't know i don't know why that's i just want to leave this in a state that is somewhat manageable somewhat viewable um okay oh i forgot i did that no wonder i was like messing around for no reason okay why is the zoom okay that's better there we go okay okay fix zoom etc okay nobody look nobody look i'm pushing directly to me nobody look nobody look nobody look cover your eyes avert your eyes just don't speak don't look there we go now we just have to wait for it to rebuild so hold on i can do this though this is fine okay how much can i zoom in a little more and still get the whole world no by the way i would totally take like a dark theme for the map all right this is pretty good i just want to make sure new zealand is there all right good enough oh no okay hold on come on rebuild rebuild github pages there we go okay it's kind of zoomed all the way out but i don't care there we go all right everyone uh this is our happy new year okay so so i uh i mean i want to say i'm going to work on this more i don't know that i really will but i will be glued to my github pull request notifications so if you have an idea for how to visually improve this to how to pull the longitude values from the cities more accurately um i will also gladly if you want to continue to enter your cities in um i'll put the form uh if someone wants to pull requests to the readme i'll link to the form i need all the help there's a way this project could come together or maybe this is just how it is this is my happy new year to you um i'll just do one last check because you never know you never know you never know you never know if somebody has donated and i hope that you're just not donating because you're waiting for me to log off so that you can donate because you don't want me to sing anymore i totally get that do i get to go and be done today i'm really really hoping i get to be done thank you everybody donate the processing have a happy new year all around the world a p5.js new year to all of you this needs so much more to wish you a p5.js processing foundation new year but it's about all i can manage oh no no no no no you're now no no no i mean yes yes yes i mean yes yes thank you your support goes a long way to supporting all the people who work on processing in p5 and the fellowships and google summer of code and all of the things that happen and uh i don't know if you have a particular request me i am so me but i think a nice ald lang sign random numbers might be what's called for might be what's called for here i was i was gonna go um i have to find i've to find where i have the chords here okay so i am reading from the book a million random digits with 100 000 normal deviants i could do another gpt3 lyrics but i really think we're just going to start from the you know what maybe 2022 will be the year that i actually figure out a way to read through this entire book we're gonna start on page one right at the beginning of the story this is my new year's song all lang syne as played by daniel shiffman on the ukulele who doesn't really know how to play the ukulele but just learned a few chords this is the table of random digits to the tune of ald lang syne as performed by me and case anybody wants to do anything with this later i'll just let you have this version of it one zero zero nine seven three two five three three seven six five two zero one three five eight six three four seven three four six seven three five four it's really hard to put random numbers it's really hard to put red numbers to the tune of something when you don't really really know the song or like my dear five four five and four five four eight seven six eight zero zero nine oh nine is good kind of rhymes with all the blank sign zero nine five nine zero nine one one seven and thirty 39 39 29 happy new year everybody oh i think we just do we'll just do we'll just do the the real lyrics should all acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind should all acquaintance be of kindness yet and days of old blank vine thank you everybody i'm saying goodnight goodbye good afternoon happy new year wishing you a happy new year from all around the world with processing in p5js if you donate now there's no more songs i can't do it i'll see you next year on the coding train i'm coming back in full force i really hope what if i would like to live stream every day what if i did new courses new videos new styles i don't know if anything could happen i probably won't be able to do any of it because life is really hard thank you for being with me for tuning in you are all the best and um i don't have any more oranges to eat i'm gonna go do some grocery shopping um uh have a cup of tea relax see love each other um code is fun and great make something creative make something for your work make something for your friends but also take a break from it be outside or the inside or all the other kinds of things you might do get a sweater play the violin learn to play the ukulele cook i made the most delicious vegan bolognese sauce the other day it's like their possible meat from scratch my kids get through their minds and i'm like 20 22 i'm gonna cook more that's what i ended on all right uh goodbye everybody i'll leave this up um as i slowly turn things off and feel free to contribute to this maybe we can make it do some wonderful things later 32 minutes to go in east africa happy new year to east africa 32 minutes to go are you tired you must be tired of the old leg zion song all right i am saying goodbye um and i will see you all in the new year my mute button doesn't work you
