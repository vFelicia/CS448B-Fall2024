00:02 - in the way we've wrapped up this section
00:05 - of videos about particle systems but
00:07 - there's a two little topics that I want
00:09 - to tack on to the end here one is kind
00:12 - of a strange thing happened that I don't
00:13 - know if I really intended but in our
00:15 - efforts to really focus on the ArrayList
00:17 - inheritance organizing the sort of
00:20 - collection of particles we took a few
00:23 - steps backwards if you notice in the
00:25 - particle system class in these examples
00:27 - the particle has a constant acceleration
00:29 - there's no apply force method but really
00:33 - we do want our particle systems to exist
00:36 - in the world we've built where objects
00:39 - that are moving around can respond to
00:41 - forces and this is going to become very
00:42 - necessary when we get to some future
00:45 - examples where we build these systems of
00:47 - objects that that interact with each
00:49 - other through forces the flocking system
00:51 - a crowd system those examples are really
00:54 - going to need particle systems where the
00:56 - particles can respond to forces from the
00:58 - environment or forces between each other
01:00 - so what I wanted this video to do is
01:02 - just look at adding the apply force
01:06 - method back in but this is not as simple
01:09 - as it may seem it's actually quite
01:11 - simple but it's not as obvious as it
01:12 - might seem like oh well all we got to do
01:14 - is just add the apply force method back
01:16 - in but let's let's think about this
01:17 - let's map this out for a moment before
01:19 - we come and put this in our code so we
01:21 - have a particle class this we know about
01:27 - this we've written this is the thing
01:29 - we've been making all along mover
01:31 - particle it's all the same thing now we
01:34 - have a particle system class our
01:40 - particle system class has the ArrayList
01:44 - it manages the collection of particles
01:47 - what's in our main program in our main
01:50 - program we have set up we have draw and
01:54 - what are we doing we're we're making a
01:57 - particle system a new particle system
02:00 - and we're saying hey the particle system
02:03 - should be displayed and the particle
02:06 - system should be updated notice here
02:11 - this sort of main program and if I go
02:13 - back over here it's the same thing
02:14 - notice here in this main program we are
02:17 - not referring to any particles how do we
02:19 - apply a force to the particle well in
02:21 - order to apply a force to the particle
02:24 - we need to say particle system dot apply
02:28 - force some force that's going to apply
02:34 - the force to the system which will in
02:36 - turn apply the force to every single
02:37 - particle so again this is maybe sort of
02:40 - a small detail but one thing we need to
02:42 - realize once we've sort of organized
02:44 - ourselves in this principle is when we
02:46 - want to act on individual particles we
02:48 - have to act on them through the through
02:51 - the particle system so we apply a force
02:53 - to the particle system the particle
02:55 - systems can apply force method which can
02:57 - apply a force to all the particles so
02:59 - let's go and add that into this example
03:01 - and this is gonna be I so it can be less
03:03 - than five minutes this video I'm very
03:04 - excited I can turn the timer on so okay
03:06 - so we know what we want to do is say
03:09 - something like hey there is a P vector
03:12 - called gravity it looks something like
03:17 - this and we want to say apply that force
03:21 - gravity to the entire particle system
03:25 - well what did we used to have in our
03:27 - programs in days of yours right in our
03:31 - particle class we had a function called
03:35 - apply Force which took in a P vector and
03:38 - you know I'm gonna skip mass right now
03:42 - you can add that back in and we added
03:44 - that force into acceleration and our
03:47 - update method we just remember one of
03:49 - the things we would do is we would clear
03:52 - out acceleration and clear out
03:54 - acceleration at V at the end of the
03:57 - update method because that's something
03:59 - we worked on before cope I could watch
04:01 - the video link to it
04:02 - magic internet machine thing that you
04:06 - remember so this is what we had before
04:07 - Newton's law force equals mass times
04:10 - acceleration we're accumulating the
04:12 - forces in acceleration we run this okay
04:14 - so so though now of course we run this
04:16 - but remember we only put the apply force
04:19 - method in the particle class we now need
04:22 - to put that apply for some
04:23 - that in the particle system class so
04:26 - here in the particle system class we
04:28 - need to write a function called apply
04:30 - force and what does that function do it
04:33 - receives a force and what happens here
04:36 - when we apply a force to a particle
04:38 - system we need to in turn apply that
04:40 - force to every single particle for every
04:45 - particle P in particles P dot apply
04:50 - force force so this may seem sort of
04:54 - silly and redundant and perhaps it is
04:57 - but this is our methodology now we send
05:00 - something into the particle system it
05:02 - receives it it runs a loop through all
05:04 - the particles and sends that to the
05:05 - particle objects itself and now when we
05:07 - run this we can see this looks pretty
05:10 - similar to what we had before because
05:12 - we're applying this gravity force but
05:14 - notice now I could say hey if
05:16 - mousepressed make a P vector called wind
05:22 - which sends stuff off to the right and
05:27 - apply that force so now we've all that
05:31 - work we did in Chapter two in all those
05:34 - examples we now have here I click the
05:36 - mouse and all of a sudden the particles
05:38 - are blowing off to the right I let go of
05:39 - the mouse and the wind has stopped so
05:41 - this is really important we don't want
05:44 - to lose all this work we did we now our
05:46 - particle system can now also receive
05:48 - forces and pass those along to the
05:50 - particles and we can see I just want to
05:52 - point out to you that there's you know
05:53 - so this is essentially example four
05:55 - point six if you're following along in
05:57 - the book but there's also an example for
05:58 - point seven where and one additional
06:02 - slightly more advanced example that I
06:04 - want to show you just in the same way we
06:06 - might take a vector and pass it through
06:09 - the particle systems apply force which
06:11 - will then in turn send it to all the
06:13 - particles we can do that with anything
06:15 - if there is a repeller object in our
06:17 - world in this particular example there's
06:19 - a repeller object that repelled that net
06:22 - at that as a force that repels particles
06:24 - we could we could send that repeller
06:27 - object through a particle system
06:28 - function in this case called apply
06:30 - repeller
06:30 - which in turn if we go and look at that
06:33 - method right apply force takes a vector
06:36 - and
06:36 - is that to the ply force method apply
06:39 - repeller whoops fancy computer
06:42 - what does apply repeller do it goes
06:44 - through all of the particles calculates
06:47 - the repelling force and then applies it
06:49 - so the point of what we're doing here is
06:52 - is is just to say that we can't accent
06:56 - we are not accessing the particles
06:58 - individually anymore in our main program
07:00 - we're accessing them through the
07:01 - particle system and you can see an
07:03 - example our first example just sent
07:05 - vectors in through an apply force but if
07:07 - we have other objects that communicate
07:08 - we can send them through another method
07:11 - as well so so okay so what I would
07:16 - suggest to you is go back take have you
07:19 - been working on that particle system
07:20 - maybe you've got it with all sorts of
07:23 - crazy different kinds of particles that
07:25 - inherit from the main particle class now
07:27 - trying to make sure your modeling forces
07:29 - with that go back and make sure you have
07:30 - that apply force method and one of the
07:32 - things that's really interesting to
07:34 - think about that you might try as an
07:35 - exercise we're going to look at this a
07:36 - lot more in future videos is could you
07:39 - make a particle system where the
07:41 - particles all apply forces to each other
07:44 - so for every particle apply a force to
07:47 - every other particle what would that
07:48 - need to do that's kind of a difficult
07:50 - problem and I want to say we're about it
07:52 - but I'm gonna leave it at that and we'll
07:54 - look at it more we're certainly going to
07:56 - look at it more once we get to flocking
07:57 - systems because that's exactly what a
07:58 - flocking system is okay I think there's
08:00 - one more video left to make and I'm
08:03 - gonna do that right now but you don't
08:04 - need to watch it right now because you
08:05 - could go do something else like pee or
08:08 - have a snack whatever people do and they
08:11 - are not just in a room by themselves
08:12 - talking to a camera goodbye

Cleaned transcript:

in the way we've wrapped up this section of videos about particle systems but there's a two little topics that I want to tack on to the end here one is kind of a strange thing happened that I don't
