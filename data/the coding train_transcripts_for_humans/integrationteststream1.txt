06:33 - three
06:34 - two
06:35 - one
06:37 - hello good morning happy friday on the
06:40 - coding train without fail as soon as i
06:42 - begin speaking gloria pickle
06:44 - my wonderful
06:46 - uh corgi beagle mix sleeping quietly
06:49 - right on the floor in front of me i
06:51 - start to talk loud she gets up
06:54 - goes downstairs runs away that's
06:56 - probably the appropriate reaction to me
06:58 - beginning to speak uh hopefully you are
07:00 - not all just getting up and running away
07:02 - though i would understand
07:04 - where i am in brooklyn new york it is
07:06 - absolutely a beautiful day outside um a
07:09 - little bit hard to motivate myself to
07:11 - get this stream started this morning
07:13 - but i'm here i'm doing it i'm gonna be
07:16 - here for about two hours and then i'm
07:18 - going to enjoy the rest of the beautiful
07:20 - day and hopefully the weekend um this
07:22 - marks a um
07:24 - really for me we're approaching the
07:26 - beginning of summer which is um
07:28 - my favorite season
07:30 - mostly because my uh day job work
07:33 - commitments are quite light and i can
07:35 - focus on
07:36 - um
07:39 - coding
07:40 - and other things too um let's see i am
07:44 - uh i finally i think you know it's been
07:46 - weeks and months of this live poll
07:49 - application which i think i finally have
07:51 - it down you hopefully are seeing above
07:53 - me you can scan this qr code to go and
07:56 - vote you can also go to
07:58 - um i posted this link into the chat let
08:00 - me do it again
08:02 - live dash poll dash coding dash train
08:06 - dot glitch dot me slash vote dash now
08:09 - how's that for url i'll put it right
08:12 - here into the chat if you go to that url
08:14 - you can vote and your vote will be
08:16 - registered immediately on this overlay
08:18 - in open broadcast studio this is a web
08:21 - application project that i began
08:23 - um i don't actually recall when although
08:26 - i could look at the github history uh
08:28 - let's see i've got it open here which
08:30 - i'm not bothering to show you this does
08:32 - it show me when the first commit was
08:35 - let's see there's been 103 commits
08:38 - and if i scroll all the way down older
08:41 - there's got to be a better way of doing
08:42 - this oh wait wait i can go to the i
08:44 - really should show you what i'm looking
08:45 - at okay hold on everybody let me show
08:47 - you what i'm looking at uh insights
08:50 - um
08:51 - and i think if we go to commits
08:54 - you can see that
08:56 - looks like i began this project in
08:59 - september
09:00 - of
09:01 - uh what year is it now 2021
09:05 - i think it's right so a little less than
09:07 - a year ago probably september 2020 um
09:11 - and uh if i go here and look at
09:13 - contributors you can see that a bunch of
09:16 - people have added and various things
09:18 - um but um in particular uh foxy over
09:22 - here has been doing an incredible amount
09:24 - of work to build this live poll
09:27 - application
09:28 - um and here it is
09:29 - so and just in time
09:33 - just in time for me to finally have it
09:36 - my act together and have it up and
09:38 - running and the poll going before i
09:41 - begin to live stream
09:43 - just when i just when i'm there finally
09:45 - when i'm there
09:48 - youtube no no fanfare no announcement no
09:50 - no no no no just you couldn't let me
09:52 - know drop a little note in there in the
09:54 - email hey
09:55 - dan you're like a youtuber you have this
09:58 - channel it has like a million people
10:00 - subscribed to it even though not so many
10:02 - of those people even watch the videos
10:03 - but they seem to click that button
10:06 - we wanted to let you know about this new
10:08 - feature
10:10 - pulling embedded built-in polling in the
10:13 - live stream chat
10:15 - nope
10:16 - nope
10:17 - just noticed it this morning there's a
10:18 - new button i pressed it i made a poll
10:21 - and so i've got two polls going and if i
10:22 - look over here i can see the results of
10:24 - the built-in youtube poll maybe i can
10:26 - show that to you
10:28 - um
10:30 - which i'm feeling very sad about those
10:31 - results so i'm gonna have to put my
10:32 - finger on the scale here my thumb on the
10:34 - scale i believe is the expression
10:36 - um
10:37 - i'm opening my live stream page
10:40 - uh and here it is you're seeing you know
10:42 - yeah you know
10:43 - dan ception over here uh coding
10:45 - transception
10:46 - um this is the built-in poll
10:49 - which has 247 votes is that more than uh
10:53 - it is more than the 92 votes that i'm
10:54 - getting with my live poll application
10:57 - and uh well you know i don't know if
10:59 - this is really good use of polling or
11:01 - bad use of polling is the question i
11:02 - have to ask for you if anybody gets that
11:04 - reference
11:05 - but um
11:10 - um
11:12 - basically what i am looking at here
11:17 - is um
11:19 - that oh yeah so uh you know the people
11:21 - who are vote voting in this poll
11:23 - probably like the embedded poll so
11:25 - they're more likely to vote for the
11:27 - built-in youtube poll but folks if
11:28 - you're watching this right now and you
11:30 - have not yet voted in the embedded
11:33 - youtube poll
11:35 - you should absolutely
11:37 - um
11:39 - vote for the coding training live poll
11:41 - app because look look how beautiful it
11:43 - is look how much work went into it it
11:44 - even has does youtube have a qr code
11:47 - for their embedded poll i don't think so
11:51 - they just happen to have it in the page
11:53 - itself making it very convenient to vote
11:59 - enoch says please shader tutorial that
12:03 - is kind of coming
12:08 - and i'm thinking also an interesting
12:10 - discussion about d3 and p5 which i do
12:12 - want to address i have a very
12:14 - specific point of view
12:16 - about this um
12:19 - i forgot what i was talking about uh hi
12:21 - cat king hi eamon
12:23 - hi lokesh a high shadow cow whenever i
12:26 - forgot what i'm talking about what i'm
12:28 - gonna say i could just say hello to
12:29 - people in chat all right let's start
12:30 - with
12:31 - what is going on in coding train news
12:38 - [Music]
12:41 - there's no breaking news here but um
12:44 - well actually i should i should begin
12:47 - news to you this sunday
12:49 - father's day

12:54 - um i have a sponsor for today's
12:56 - live stream today's live stream is
12:58 - sponsored by
13:00 - curiosity stream the reason why i was
13:02 - thinking about father's day and
13:03 - curiosity stream is i am a father i love
13:07 - to watch documentaries i already have a
13:09 - curiosity stream account so i'm not
13:11 - asking anyone to get one for me but if

13:25 - friends day somebody you want to say you
13:28 - care about them day
13:30 - um and boy i've got some really serious
13:32 - uh video feedback stuff going on here um
13:35 - if you're looking for a gift i would
13:36 - really suggest curiositystream.com
13:39 - codingtrain the thing about it is it
13:40 - comes first of all it comes with nebula
13:42 - watch nebula which is a streaming
13:43 - service that i am a part of with a bunch
13:45 - of other youtubers and um they're
13:47 - running for father's day a 41
13:50 - uh exclusive discount on the curiosity
13:53 - stream and nebula bundle so nebula by
13:55 - the way is like i forget three or four
13:57 - dollars a month something like that
13:59 - you're getting it for free for less um
14:01 - so with the discount it's 11.79
14:04 - i'm reading off my notes here for the
14:06 - entire year and i'm gonna um come back
14:08 - later and show you some documentaries
14:10 - and curiosity stream that i would
14:12 - recommend and uh please i um
14:14 - get it for yourself or get it for the
14:16 - the loved one in your life as a gift and
14:19 - i've got to turn on my do not disturb
14:22 - notifications while live streaming is a
14:24 - really bad idea do not disturb is on
14:27 - all right so
14:28 - um wash your hat yeah oh you can really
14:32 - see how gross it is that's terrible i
14:35 - need a new hat you know i wear this hat
14:38 - all the time
14:40 - um and it's um
14:42 - it got i guess i was out in the rain i
14:44 - think that's really just like
14:46 - i don't know what that is like why
14:48 - there's that sort of orange
14:50 - well
14:51 - anyway
14:52 - let's fix that yeah is there some sort
14:54 - of ai machine learning model that i can
14:56 - use to fix my hat what just happened did
15:00 - we just break the live poll app
15:02 - oh no
15:03 - let's go back to here
15:05 - should refresh
15:08 - hmm
15:12 - oh boy
15:13 - this is not good
15:15 - okay hold on a sec everybody
15:17 - let's examine this
15:21 - what just happened here
15:23 - um
15:24 - i'm going to go up it's back
15:27 - ask and ye shall receive all right um so
15:30 - i um
15:32 - you know uh uh am well known for wasting
15:34 - a ton of time on live streams and not
15:36 - actually doing anything
15:38 - and i think i need to rectify that a
15:40 - little bit i mean there's there's a time
15:42 - for sort of goofing off and my rambling
15:44 - voice and reading random numbers and
15:46 - saying hello to people in the chat
15:49 - um
15:50 - but um
15:55 - yeah this is a great comment um
15:58 - what comes and legendary i'm just gonna
16:00 - call you legendary uh in the uh
16:02 - supporter uh discord here channel what
16:05 - comes between d3 and p5 n4 so somebody
16:08 - would create the n4 library
16:11 - um
16:12 - is that mug made to look upside down i
16:15 - don't know what's going on here i was
16:17 - trying to say something
16:18 - it's a
16:19 - very apt point because here i was just
16:22 - getting distracted and who knows what
16:24 - talking about but i would like to have
16:27 - two coding segments
16:30 - each live stream break in the middle
16:33 - as well as some regular segments like
16:35 - showing community contributions and i
16:37 - have a new regular segment which i will
16:40 - just begin with right now don't have a
16:42 - theme song for it let's try this one
16:49 - my new segment on the coding train live
16:51 - stream
16:52 - is reading your comments that's right
16:55 - i'm going to go through
16:57 - my recent videos from the coding train
17:00 - and take a look at some of the comments
17:02 - you the viewers have posted answer your
17:05 - questions comment on them enjoy them
17:08 - feel warm glow inside because of how
17:11 - happy you may be or who knows what we
17:13 - shall see
17:14 - [Music]
17:17 - and
17:18 - in the five minutes i spent preparing
17:21 - for today's live stream i went and found
17:24 - a few comments already that i wanted to
17:25 - take a look at
17:26 - um so
17:28 - um thanks again curiosity stream today's
17:30 - sponsor
17:32 - it's really good
17:35 - just like i when i'm like on i i guess i
17:37 - i really should be like do my sponsor
17:39 - segments when i'm supposed to be doing
17:40 - my sponsor segments but i just want to
17:42 - say like i subscribe to a lot of
17:44 - streaming services i always go right to
17:45 - the documentary section
17:47 - typically that's what i'm interested
17:49 - often and watching first curiosity
17:50 - stream this is all all documentaries i
17:52 - don't have to go to the documentary
17:53 - section
17:54 - it's subsections because of different
17:56 - kinds of documentaries
17:59 - um all right
18:00 - now
18:01 - all right so uh let's see let's look at
18:03 - today's a first comment
18:05 - first comment is on my recent um 5.2
18:10 - seeking a target so first of all i
18:11 - wanted to say something about this a
18:14 - video so if you haven't watched it yet
18:16 - it's still time you could yeah you could
18:18 - probably watch it now and come back in
18:20 - 13 minutes and seven seconds and i'll
18:23 - still just be here like talking about
18:24 - like how there's a dot between views in
18:27 - june or something you won't have missed
18:28 - anything and to be honest who's who's
18:31 - watching my videos on 1x speed right
18:34 - you're at least on 1.5 it's intolerable
18:37 - to me to watch myself at 1x
18:40 - the recommended speed is 2x
18:42 - um
18:44 - that said um
18:46 - i there were several comments along the
18:48 - lines of wow this is exactly the same
18:50 - video as this one you released or you've
18:53 - covered this topic in at least four
18:56 - other videos
18:57 - all of that is true uh you know i am
18:59 - burdened with glorious purpose
19:02 - i'm traveling through time
19:04 - and space
19:06 - different variants of me you guys
19:08 - watching the loki show oh so good what
19:10 - is the path by the way
19:13 - from coding train to marvel i gotta
19:15 - figure that out
19:17 - i don't think i'm gonna it's gonna be a
19:18 - while before i get there probably never
19:20 - of course but i don't know does anybody
19:22 - have any ideas for me
19:25 - um
19:26 - some people are saying they watch it on
19:28 - uh 1x that's surprising to me anyway i
19:30 - was saying uh
19:31 - this is a variant
19:34 - i am
19:35 - a kind of going in a time loop redoing
19:37 - videos i don't know if this is so great
19:40 - i mean i do have my sort of like i have
19:41 - my material
19:42 - and that's kind of ran out of it
19:44 - and a lot of it's like old and the lower
19:47 - quality or i did in a different language
19:50 - um
19:51 - so um i
19:54 - um
19:56 - i i i wanted to redo this um
19:58 - specifically um and and really like have
20:02 - a recent well-done
20:05 - sequence tutorials from the nature of
20:07 - code so um you know most if you're
20:09 - watching the live stream uh it's
20:11 - possible that you're brand new but
20:13 - you're probably pretty familiar with my
20:15 - stuff
20:17 - but this is what i'm talking about so um
20:20 - i am just working through a lot of this
20:22 - is re
20:23 - content that i've covered before
20:25 - but i'm kind of covering it anew with
20:28 - whatever the latest version of the p5
20:30 - library is today
20:32 - uh new thumbnail design a little bit
20:34 - higher production value
20:36 - additional examples a little more
20:38 - thoughtfulness in terms of the way the
20:40 - material is presented
20:41 - interestingly enough i have also gotten
20:44 - some comments it's generally skewed
20:46 - um the other way but i also get the
20:49 - comment of
20:50 - i miss
20:52 - uh or like this i don't like this style
20:54 - of video anymore i don't know how else
20:56 - to put it um i me you know my older
20:58 - videos have no editing
21:01 - not such great audio
21:04 - um
21:05 - and
21:06 - um no extra overlays or references or
21:09 - flying in examples or diagrams to
21:12 - illustrate a point
21:13 - so um i would like to be able to
21:17 - keep a balance of different kinds of
21:19 - styles of content i do think that
21:22 - authentic no editing just build a whole
21:24 - project from start to finish is very
21:26 - valuable but i do think for these
21:27 - tutorials i think they're improved with
21:30 - the new production style that said i'm
21:33 - not 100 sure about that it certainly is
21:35 - more takes longer to make it's more
21:37 - expensive to make and more involved to
21:39 - make but i would be certainly curious
21:41 - anecdotally to um here marcus says i
21:44 - would like if you would also hide the
21:46 - older videos so i'm
21:48 - i'm really loath
21:50 - to delete a video off of youtube
21:54 - i suppose i could make some older videos
21:56 - that this these have now replaced
21:58 - unlisted
21:59 - but generally speaking my approach is to
22:03 - leave everything as is where it is but
22:06 - kind of de-link to it from playlists and
22:08 - other websites and material that i'm
22:10 - publishing because i always have like a
22:12 - syllabus or a book or a webpage or a
22:15 - blog post so then i will i will link an
22:18 - unnamed username
22:20 - who uh thank you thanks has helped me
22:22 - title the integration test uh stream um
22:26 - old ones was the one locus says that got
22:28 - me into your channel month on says love
22:31 - the new videos old ones are
22:32 - gold there's a lot of different comments
22:34 - here um so um but what was i saying ah
22:37 - so i just um deprecate essentially the
22:39 - older ones the the the canonical place
22:43 - if you're looking for the coding train
22:44 - cannon
22:48 - um
22:49 - the coding train cannon is here on the
22:52 - coding train website now there is a top
22:54 - secret
22:57 - not even close to tops here because i
22:58 - talk about it every stream
23:00 - uh project that is going on right now to
23:02 - completely redesign and rebuild the
23:04 - coding train website that will be
23:06 - launching probably sometime in the fall
23:08 - it will always be a kind of continuous
23:10 - incremental a project but a major
23:13 - facelift is happening and i'll talk more
23:15 - about that at some point soon um but
23:18 - this is where if you're looking for okay
23:20 - what are the sort of most recent
23:22 - up-to-date recommended learning lists
23:25 - nature of code ml5 this is if i'm
23:28 - looking for like where do i begin
23:30 - like
23:30 - what could i watch where i need no
23:32 - experience whatsoever
23:34 - these three so um this is also where
23:37 - you know if i go i don't uh go to the
23:39 - coding challenge video i can find all of
23:42 - the code that goes along with every
23:44 - video uh running in the web editor i can
23:46 - see oh we have one we have an arnov
23:50 - arnov are you watching are you in the
23:51 - audience right now because
23:53 - we've now switched from
23:57 - going through your youtube comments
23:59 - which i haven't even gotten to the first
24:01 - comment yet
24:02 - to community contributions no record
24:04 - scratch stop
24:06 - i was doing my segment
24:08 - back to the segment i was doing
24:11 - 5.3 will be coming out soon i also want
24:13 - to thank this really shocked me because
24:15 - the um self-avoiding walk video the
24:18 - coding challenge videos tend to do
24:20 - fairly well youtube gives me lots of
24:21 - like gold stars and little confetti
24:23 - things like oh more viewers are watching
24:25 - your video than usual
24:28 - and then usually when i release one of
24:29 - my like tutorials that's in the middle
24:31 - of the sequence like oh no no viewers
24:33 - seem less interested maybe you should
24:35 - think about doing different content like
24:37 - youtube i i've got a thing i'm doing
24:39 - here you don't i mean just please be
24:40 - nice
24:42 - um
24:44 - but this one 5.2 i don't know it's not
24:47 - even 5.1
24:48 - it seems to uh people are clicking on it
24:50 - and watching it so i'm quite um
24:52 - quite glad for that
24:54 - um
24:58 - right so diacron i want to address this
25:01 - comment diacron says i like the older
25:03 - style there's great value in seeing how
25:05 - the connections are made so even with so
25:08 - maybe i'm wrong about this maybe i'm i'm
25:10 - deluding myself
25:12 - but with the editing and added extra
25:15 - sort of visual information
25:17 - my goal is never to remove the
25:20 - interesting parts where i am struggling
25:23 - through or sorting through or figuring
25:25 - something out
25:27 - the only thing what i remove and and
25:30 - those of you who watch my recording
25:31 - sessions you can join as a coding
25:33 - trained member and i brought live stream
25:34 - the recording sessions um and if you
25:36 - join uh you can also go back and watch
25:39 - all the back catalog of them so i'd be
25:40 - curious here from those of you who watch
25:42 - those what your perspective is
25:44 - between watching those and what gets
25:46 - edited is
25:48 - you know um
25:50 - if i'm stuck on something for a long
25:53 - time
25:55 - it's not useful to have the video be an
25:57 - hour and 15 minutes
25:59 - so i try to like
26:01 - show the being stuck
26:04 - show the resolution if possible indicate
26:06 - the passage of time to get a sense of
26:08 - that relatable that relatable feeling
26:10 - but i think i could do still do more
26:12 - with that but um and the coding
26:14 - challenges i really it's really the
26:16 - intention the they're not like the
26:18 - tutorials in that i kind of know what
26:20 - the example is and i'm just kind of
26:21 - building and talking through it really
26:23 - more figuring it out anyway i don't need
26:25 - to go on and on about this we are at a
26:27 - segment
26:28 - my segment is
26:32 - reading
26:33 - your comments and i said about 10
26:36 - minutes ago it was time for that segment
26:38 - and i opened the webpage was the first
26:41 - comment i was going to read
26:43 - and
26:44 - never even
26:46 - got to it so it's time for me to do that
26:48 - now
26:49 - and this first comment comes in from
26:52 - thomas shocker thank you for commenting
26:55 - on the coding train video so uh you know
26:59 - this is
26:59 - [Music]
27:01 - part of this is i want to do the point
27:03 - of the live streams is to have more kind
27:05 - of community interaction uh um with the
27:07 - viewers
27:08 - um and to sort of follow up on things
27:10 - that are in the video tutorials that are
27:12 - being published i also just maybe this
27:14 - will encourage people to comment because
27:16 - i do read all the comments and scan
27:18 - through them and i'm going to be trying
27:20 - to pick some out to highlight um on the
27:22 - stream so thomas asks our writes hi just
27:25 - watched your video thank you for all
27:27 - them thank you for saying thank you very
27:29 - nice and quick question why
27:33 - mag and i think that means set mag so
27:35 - the function is
27:38 - set the magnitude of the desired
27:40 - velocity to the maximum speed and not
27:42 - desired dot limit maximum speed
27:45 - well and there's a reply here i wondered
27:48 - the same thing if the target is close it
27:51 - doesn't need to go maximum speed towards
27:53 - it thank you rick for this it will still
27:55 - overshoot the target and oscillate back
27:57 - and forth the logic of arrive is needed
28:00 - to start allowing only have to avoid
28:01 - that but it will damp the oscillation so
28:02 - eventually stop on the target i think it
28:04 - is an improvement right so
28:07 - this is exactly the discussion to have
28:10 - a quick question why set mag and not
28:12 - limit
28:14 - there's no answer to that question
28:18 - the point of steering behaviors and
28:21 - autonomous agents as the coder as the
28:23 - designer of the system is to ask those
28:26 - questions what are the rules of the
28:28 - world that i'm building what are the
28:30 - desires of the characters in that world
28:33 - how is it that i expect and want them to
28:36 - behave
28:37 - and the definition if the definition of
28:40 - seeking a target is reach that target as
28:44 - fast as humanly or what's not human as
28:46 - fast as autonomously agentedly possible
28:50 - no matter how far or close you are the
28:53 - target could be right in front of my
28:54 - face and i just want to get there as
28:55 - fast as possible or it could be really
28:56 - far away and i just want to get there as
28:58 - fast as possible that is how i chose to
29:01 - define seeking a target in this
29:04 - particular video and it's not really how
29:05 - i chose because i'm basing all this work
29:07 - off of craig reynolds you know seminal
29:09 - paper steering behaviors for autonomous
29:11 - characters so with that definition set
29:14 - mag set the magnitude to maximum speed
29:16 - is always correct
29:18 - but
29:19 - you're right to point that out that the
29:20 - logic is sort of flawed because in a lot
29:23 - of cases
29:24 - maybe if you're getting close to
29:26 - something you don't want to be going so
29:27 - if you don't want to crash into it i
29:28 - mean it's very reasonable you want to be
29:31 - slowing down so the magnitude of your
29:33 - desired velocity shrinks the closer you
29:35 - get
29:36 - maybe after a certain point it's in the
29:38 - opposite direction maybe it's too
29:40 - perpendicular 90 degrees uh clockwise
29:44 - it's up to us to define
29:46 - how it is what the rules are for how
29:48 - these uh characters behave so in this
29:51 - case that's why i chose to use set
29:52 - setmag
29:54 - it's only on me if that was not clear
29:56 - although i i think this discussion is
29:58 - useful to have no matter how clear i
30:00 - might make it whether making it clear
30:02 - now um
30:03 - and um
30:05 - but you're absolutely right to wonder
30:07 - about this because in in i don't have
30:10 - these uh available for you to see yet
30:13 - but in 5.3
30:15 - which will hopefully be released next
30:16 - week
30:17 - pursue evade are the behaviors i look at
30:20 - and in 5.4 i look at the arrival
30:23 - behavior arrive behavior and that really
30:25 - is
30:26 - um
30:28 - that's where limit but it's even it's
30:30 - even different than limit it's about um
30:34 - uh
30:36 - uh you know shrinking it according to
30:38 - distance um in a different way um does
30:40 - he know a python
30:45 - not really
30:48 - um i do not really know python but i
30:50 - would like to know it more
30:54 - um all right so that was that comment
30:56 - any other questions or comments about
30:57 - that how'd that go this is good i like
30:59 - this segment now we have another comment
31:03 - i think there's a point
31:04 - where i'm over using my theme music
31:07 - which isn't even my music by the way if
31:08 - you are a composer musician you do have
31:11 - somebody that i'm already working with
31:12 - need to reach out but i'm i'm looking to
31:15 - expand my musical selection
31:19 - [Music]
31:22 - next comment
31:24 - is
31:27 - from x nick
31:30 - this is also on 5.2
31:32 - seeking a target
31:35 - x nick writes
31:36 - as always i love your content well x
31:39 - nick that is so nice to say
31:41 - i mean am i picking the ones that start
31:44 - with a nice compliment to myself
31:48 - no i really was looking for the ones
31:50 - with interesting things that i noted or
31:51 - highlighted but i do appreciate when
31:53 - they start with a nice compliment i'm
31:55 - just a human being who enjoys being
31:57 - complimented like anybody else the
31:59 - critical ones are actually uh
32:01 - constructive critical ones are very
32:03 - useful as well um
32:05 - um so thank you for those there's
32:07 - sometimes there's some mean mean-ish
32:09 - comments i'm very lucky and privileged
32:11 - to
32:13 - have an easy time on the internet
32:15 - relative to so many people who are much
32:18 - sort of worse targets for harassment i
32:20 - got no complaints here but you know be
32:22 - nice people
32:24 - one small nitpick detail
32:26 - for the character to be able to perceive
32:28 - its own velocity it has to be aware of
32:31 - its own coordinates in an absolute
32:33 - reference frame the canvas
32:35 - it would be more realistic for the
32:37 - character to use a relative reference
32:39 - frame when it perceives the relative
32:42 - motion
32:43 - where it perceives the relative motion
32:45 - of the target itself
32:46 - it would be more difficult to code
32:49 - yes
32:51 - but probably not that much difficult but
32:53 - perhaps more realistic so admittedly i'm
32:55 - not so sure i completely understand this
32:57 - comment i i i believe in this comment
32:59 - and i really appreciate it and i think
33:02 - if i were to rephrase it and and uh x
33:04 - nick i i i doubt that you're watching
33:06 - this right now
33:08 - but um if you are please chime into the
33:10 - chat or certainly be looking for
33:13 - um other oh x nick is there
33:16 - x-nick
33:18 - i mean it's got to be the same it's
33:19 - gotta be the same x nick because you can
33:20 - only have one x nick on
33:22 - youtube you know
33:25 - there's no verified check mark speaking
33:26 - of which come on twitter
33:28 - i mean what's up what's a simple boy
33:31 - from baltimore maryland to do you gotta
33:33 - do to get verified on twitter i like
33:36 - going i'm gonna be 50 in a couple years
33:38 - how can i just be verified on twitter so
33:40 - i thought that's long i'm old tired
33:44 - why do i care about these things i don't
33:46 - know okay wait i was reading x6 comments
33:48 - so let me try to understand this i think
33:51 - um if i were to rephrase it
33:53 - what the
33:54 - vehicle is truly experiencing
33:57 - is not its own movement throughout this
34:00 - 2d world
34:01 - but everything in the 2d world
34:03 - movement relative to wherever it is
34:06 - so is it about thinking about the ways
34:09 - that i calculate the relative vectors
34:12 - always thinking of the vehicle's
34:15 - kind of core location as the origin
34:18 - point and its velocity essentially a
34:20 - zero and other velocities just being
34:22 - relative to its movement
34:25 - so i understand that conceptually but i
34:27 - feel like wouldn't the math ultimately
34:30 - end up being the same
34:33 - um i don't know
34:36 - um so to tell me wrong let's look at
34:38 - another oh i wrote the reply like oh
34:40 - there's a reply to this one good i think
34:42 - i wrote oh this is such an interesting
34:43 - point thank you
34:45 - um yeah because i i'm thinking about it
34:47 - um let's let's give this comment a heart
34:49 - um
34:50 - [Music]
34:51 - and
34:52 - there's some other lovely
34:54 - comments here
34:55 - uh from from uh monsieur alexander gulbu
35:00 - and vatula 64.
35:03 - uh so right now i'm just reading random
35:05 - comments that's not the point prepared
35:07 - comments
35:08 - um so i don't know i'm i'm looking to
35:09 - see if there's any further elaboration
35:11 - in the chat but i need to think about
35:13 - this one more but i really appreciate
35:15 - that comment and i i think that in the
35:18 - end
35:18 - uh for me
35:20 - this would be like a
35:22 - thought experiment exercise as part of
35:25 - my tutorials and material because i do
35:27 - think
35:28 - it adds a layer of complexity
35:30 - um it's not that it's unnecessary but
35:32 - that goes beyond where the way that i
35:35 - want to present the content
35:37 - um
35:40 - uh
35:43 - okay um sorry i'm reading the chat and
35:46 - sometimes interesting discussions are
35:47 - coming up but not discussions that make
35:49 - sense for me to refer to okay
35:51 - um moving on i have one more comment
35:58 - this is from the coding challenge 162
36:01 - which will be a nice segue into looking
36:03 - at arnov's community contribution
36:08 - this year alexandra goldberg is here all
36:11 - right hold on
36:13 - i'm gonna address
36:14 - your comment therefore i think if i go
36:16 - back to here
36:21 - will i
36:23 - find it come on come on internet
36:26 - did the internet i mean the internet
36:27 - didn't break
36:29 - because you are hearing me if you are
36:30 - hearing me the internet is still working
36:36 - i love
36:37 - nothing makes me happier by the way than
36:41 - interacting with comments or community
36:44 - contributions or various things that
36:46 - people have contributed to the coding
36:48 - train
36:49 - and then seeing that person
36:52 - appear in the chat
36:56 - and i don't know why i'm not able to get
36:58 - this page to load i'm going to just take
37:00 - out the highlighted comment from the url
37:06 - seriously wow
37:09 - did youtube go down
37:12 - and
37:13 - uh
37:14 - did i just go through some kind of um
37:18 - time door
37:20 - for the time keepers on to me
37:23 - are they shutting me down
37:24 - are they pruning
37:26 - am i being pruned
37:28 - oh no
37:32 - which variant am i am i the sacred one i
37:35 - don't know
37:38 - youtube
37:40 - what happened to you
37:44 - okay i'm not gonna oh there we go i
37:45 - don't know what's going on
37:48 - um
37:49 - as you were for a second here
37:52 - i seem to be back
37:54 - 5.2
38:01 - um all right let's take a look at
38:02 - monsieur alexander gulbu's comment since
38:05 - uh uh monsieur alexander gulbu is in the
38:08 - chat
38:09 - i'm very upset that your latest videos
38:11 - do not gain the deserved number of views
38:13 - likes comments ah
38:15 - again thank you thank you i think they
38:17 - do i think they get the deserved number
38:20 - of views likes comments either youtube
38:22 - algorithms are choking you it's a kind
38:24 - of a harsh way to put it or something
38:26 - else i think actually now i'm realizing
38:27 - i kind of addressed this earlier um
38:31 - so i really struggle with uh having a
38:35 - youtube channel with i think you know
38:38 - the term for this is evergreen content i
38:40 - mean it's not so evergreen because
38:42 - technology changes so rapidly but this
38:45 - video 5.2
38:47 - isn't something that somebody urgently
38:49 - needs to watch or is about the events of
38:51 - the day or like a hot take on the new
38:53 - apple product that came out or whatever
38:55 - again no criticism that's what those are
38:57 - basically like the videos i like
38:59 - watching hot takes on new apple products
39:02 - um
39:03 - but i do think it's true the the youtube
39:05 - algorithm is not kind to people who want
39:08 - to release sequential tutorials and i
39:11 - have often thought about
39:13 - uh separating out into different
39:15 - channels
39:16 - but and kind of focusing on like a sort
39:18 - of like monthly or bi-weekly coding
39:21 - challenge project video that would sort
39:23 - of you know drive a particular chat but
39:25 - i don't honestly i don't have time to
39:27 - deal with that i'm just making the stuff
39:28 - that i make and enjoying the word but i
39:31 - suppose um i shouldn't be going on and
39:33 - on about this but i do appreciate that
39:35 - thought and i do think about it a lot
39:37 - and
39:38 - look at my analytics a lot i probably
39:39 - should just shut all that stuff off and
39:41 - not worry about it
39:43 - but you know i think if you
39:46 - for those of you when you share
39:47 - something
39:48 - with somebody else or that you made or
39:50 - you recommend
39:51 - watch this beginner playlist to learn to
39:53 - code
39:54 - that's a way that you can contribute and
39:55 - give back if you do enjoy the content
39:57 - and feel like uh more people should find
39:59 - it um but there's also you know
40:02 - there's lots of other people in this
40:03 - world making amazing tutorials and
40:06 - projects and coding so recommend those
40:08 - other people too please
40:11 - all right
40:12 - um what was the comment i was on
40:14 - self-avoiding walk oh this one is super
40:16 - interesting so one of the things i
40:18 - really struggled with in the
40:19 - self-avoiding walk
40:21 - was um thinking about um
40:25 - what is sort of the big o notation
40:29 - what is the algorithmic complexity
40:32 - the run time
40:34 - of an algorithm
40:36 - to find through brute force
40:39 - randomness and brute force brute force
40:43 - uh a self of i'm looking for um
40:45 - you know what does a self-avoiding walk
40:46 - look like
40:48 - a self-avoiding walk that spill that
40:51 - fills an entire uh two-dimensional or
40:54 - could be three-dimensional any
40:55 - dimensional space
40:58 - and um
41:00 - i sort of said informally it was sort of
41:02 - like a quick
41:04 - thought in the video uh it was n squared
41:06 - because it's n by n so there's n squared
41:11 - um
41:11 - [Music]
41:13 - you know
41:15 - spots in the two-dimensional space
41:18 - and then at every spot
41:20 - it's got some number of neighbors so it
41:22 - has to try all these others
41:25 - and then each one of those i was like n
41:27 - squared factorial or something which i
41:30 - don't think and then i was like looking
41:31 - at some papers it was like there's no
41:33 - known way to quantify it but this is a
41:35 - pretty interesting comment that i will
41:37 - try to that i will read now
41:39 - there is an easy upper boundary of
41:42 - number of boy
41:44 - there's variance with this too
41:46 - variants for backtracking any valid walk
41:48 - is a starting point plus sequence of
41:51 - letters up down left right of length
41:55 - w times h or that's n squared minus one
41:58 - where w h is within height
42:00 - thus straight ahead you can say that
42:02 - backtracking will do less than w times h
42:06 - times 4 to the power of w times h minus
42:09 - 1 which is much less than
42:11 - n squared factorial that kind that's
42:14 - making sense to me right it's the
42:16 - maximum number from any place that you
42:18 - are of backtracking steps that you would
42:20 - have to take
42:22 - totally makes sense right there are only
42:25 - four possible ways
42:27 - so four to the power of how many
42:29 - backtracking steps which is much less
42:31 - next it's an easy to notice that after
42:33 - each letter there's exactly one
42:34 - forbidden letter after up you can't have
42:36 - down after l you can't r so for any
42:39 - place for fixed letters there are only
42:41 - three options okay
42:43 - therefore upper bound is w times h
42:47 - times four times three to the power of w
42:50 - times h minus two
42:53 - similarly in the end there's exactly one
42:54 - spot missing and the last two steps
42:56 - exactly two spots missing so upper bound
42:58 - but i think sometimes with the big o
43:00 - notation we're talking about
43:02 - a kind of average run time or worst case
43:06 - run time
43:07 - so i'm not sure how relevant that is but
43:09 - this is interesting w times h times 4
43:12 - times 3 to the power of okay
43:15 - so in my
43:18 - do macintosh computers have calculators
43:20 - on them
43:21 - apparently they do
43:24 - uh can i make this like a science you
43:26 - funny you think i would know this
43:28 - uh scientific
43:30 - let's look at this okay
43:32 - so
43:33 - w times h uh let's oh i want to get this
43:36 - comment up
43:42 - uh here we go okay
43:48 - w times h times four
43:50 - is 64
43:52 - times four
43:55 - um
43:57 - three like hold on
43:59 - three to the power of how do i do this
44:01 - three
44:02 - to the power of
44:04 - 62
44:06 - here's a big number
44:12 - times
44:14 - what did we say
44:15 - 64
44:19 - times 4.
44:21 - okay
44:22 - still a pretty big number but a lot less
44:25 - than the factorial
44:28 - yeah i xnick says i use the google
44:29 - search bar instead of the calculator i
44:31 - usually do too i don't know why i just
44:32 - decided not to this moment all right
44:34 - thank you for these comments
44:36 - um
44:39 - i really appreciate them
44:41 - um i hope to make this a regular part of
44:43 - live streams uh picking out and looking
44:46 - at a select group of comments on recent
44:49 - videos to address them answer questions
44:51 - i also would now if you have a thought
44:53 - about this i would definitely encourage
44:55 - you to come right onto
44:58 - the youtube page for the video and reply
45:00 - right there i've kind of got these noted
45:02 - so i'm i'm kind of interested to follow
45:03 - along the discussion and of course i
45:06 - always have to plug
45:07 - the discord which i should have a button
45:10 - here
45:11 - uh which will post a link to the coding
45:12 - trade discord in the chat all right
45:17 - it's 11 30.
45:19 - remember how i said
45:21 - i was gonna have i want to have two
45:22 - coding segments yeah
45:25 - i think i'll probably um do community
45:27 - contributions
45:29 - uh talk about the sponsor curiosity
45:31 - stream and then take a short break and
45:33 - come back and explore
45:35 - um
45:36 - what looks most likely to be p5 with d3
45:40 - and i will address
45:42 - the comment
45:43 - which is that um i've seen something
45:47 - um so
45:49 - d3 and you know i'm going to come back
45:50 - to this i'll come back to this later i
45:52 - want to talk about why i want to use p5
45:53 - and d3 together
45:55 - which again i'm not suggesting is
45:58 - the
45:59 - most appropriate
46:00 - or efficient or ultimate
46:03 - uh uh meaningful path for you the viewer
46:05 - to follow but it is of great interest to
46:08 - me for a few particular reasons which i
46:10 - will come to
46:12 - okay now it's time for
46:15 - the moment on the coding train where i
46:17 - share community contributions things
46:19 - that you have made
46:21 - um and um today what i would like to do
46:23 - is look at two the two recent videos
46:26 - that i published since the last live
46:28 - stream or within the last couple weeks
46:32 - so let's go to
46:34 - the coding train website
46:38 - [Music]
46:41 - um and let's go to self-avoiding walk
46:47 - all right
46:49 - so um this is the first community
46:52 - contribution
46:53 - thank you arnov to the self-avoiding
46:56 - random walk i'm really expecting there
46:58 - to be more
46:59 - i mean especially that 3d one with the
47:01 - rainbow colors so many possible
47:04 - visual variations that i think you the
47:07 - creative people of the internet could
47:09 - make make your little gift loop make
47:12 - your little video
47:14 - etc
47:15 - um but there's only one so far so um i
47:18 - encourage you please submit um you know
47:21 - you
47:21 - don't
47:22 - don't be shy you change just even a
47:24 - little something it will bring me so
47:25 - much joy to see what it is that you
47:27 - thought to apply um if you just got it
47:30 - running on your own computer and you
47:32 - want to document that share a link to
47:34 - your documentation of that ah it will
47:36 - make me happy there is no threshold for
47:39 - what you need to do to submit your
47:40 - community contribution
47:42 - all right so random walk with random
47:44 - colors random alpha and random size
47:46 - whoops so just as a reminder
47:49 - um
47:50 - let me look at oops sorry everybody oh
47:54 - sometimes
47:57 - and here i am about to sneeze
48:01 - about why did the internet break for me
48:03 - today
48:05 - what's going on on my computer
48:07 - like seriously
48:16 - okay to the challenge
48:18 - um i wanted to show just this as a
48:20 - reminder
48:22 - this is the example
48:25 - that uh i build in the coding challenge
48:28 - video so you can see it is a random walk
48:30 - i know i know i'm repeating myself but i
48:32 - always like to set context sort of
48:35 - assume that not everybody has like
48:37 - watched every video or every live stream
48:39 - and what is going on here is a entity is
48:43 - making random decisions to move left
48:44 - right up or down
48:46 - in this grid pattern every frame of
48:48 - animation and if it has been somewhere
48:50 - before it can't go there again and if it
48:53 - gets stuck where it has no options where
48:55 - to go it backtracks and tries a
48:57 - different direction and you can see here
48:59 - how it is getting sort of stuck in the
49:01 - corner fairly quickly which is a pretty
49:04 - typical result i thought actually in the
49:07 - version that i released
49:09 - that i changed it to
49:12 - um
49:16 - starting in the middle
49:19 - which i definitely prefer because it
49:21 - kind of has more room to sort of find
49:23 - its way around uh various parts without
49:26 - getting stuck as quickly so anyway i
49:28 - prefer that okay so um
49:31 - [Music]
49:32 - i
49:33 - um oh
49:34 - look this is a great question in the
49:36 - chat
49:38 - okay so so people are asking about the
49:39 - community contributions wonderful okay
49:43 - could you first of all exnick says could
49:44 - use d3 to display info about youtube
49:46 - videos exactly this is what i'm looking
49:48 - to do got a plan i will talk about it
49:51 - um
49:52 - where's the coding terrain community
49:53 - contribution tab again okay i will come
49:55 - to that hey da how you best hey dan if i
49:57 - use a lot of your videos to build
49:58 - something cool where should i contribute
50:00 - it that's a great question i don't
50:02 - actually i don't know
50:03 - so um
50:05 - what i would suggest um and maybe some
50:07 - of the mods moderators and folks who
50:10 - help manage the website will run away in
50:12 - here
50:13 - um i would pick
50:15 - one of the videos
50:16 - and just submit it to that one maybe
50:18 - like whichever one's the most recent one
50:21 - um and then just in your documentation
50:24 - you know whether it's you're linking to
50:25 - a uh whether it's just in the code
50:27 - comments or a blog post or a video or
50:29 - whatever just include more context and
50:32 - information uh about the different
50:35 - videos you drew from because that's
50:36 - interesting for me at least personally
50:38 - to know i wouldn't get too hung up on
50:40 - about it just submit it um we'll help
50:42 - you figure it out if it's in the wrong
50:43 - place um you could submit it in multiple
50:45 - places but i think i would prefer
50:47 - not to have that because i think that
50:49 - new systems we're trying to build
50:51 - hopefully will it wouldn't make sense to
50:53 - do that um
50:55 - and
50:56 - uh hamiltonian cycle i keep keep hearing
50:59 - about that i do want to do that
51:01 - um but um let me just address the
51:03 - question and chris is asking if any
51:04 - plans for react angular view no no plans
51:08 - kind of not really a front-end web
51:09 - development channel person thing i mean
51:12 - i'd love to do all this stuff but i i
51:14 - want to stay in my lane of kind of
51:17 - creative exploration of algorithms and
51:20 - graphics and interactivity you know i do
51:22 - server-side stuff and databases and apis
51:26 - but that's in many ways uh uh tools to
51:30 - further explore the sort of creative and
51:32 - nothing you can't be creative with
51:33 - reactiveview i mean it's just um quick
51:36 - prototyping maybe that's more what i'm
51:37 - trying to say i don't know i don't know
51:38 - how to answer that question so if you're
51:40 - looking to contribute basically on every
51:44 - page
51:45 - um there should be a link here uh add
51:47 - your own version it just takes you to
51:49 - and i don't know why it's asking me to
51:50 - sign into github and two-factor it's
51:52 - going to take you to uh an editing a
51:55 - file
51:56 - that you uh if you add your your
51:59 - metadata for your project into that file
52:01 - following the format um which isn't
52:03 - really self-explanatory but if you go
52:05 - here under see how i have a little video
52:08 - that walks you through it and some extra
52:10 - information here
52:12 - most of the time
52:13 - it is so it'll show up here under coding
52:16 - train website
52:19 - uh pull work website and then if i go to
52:21 - pull requests
52:23 - um
52:24 - you know if i go to closed
52:26 - we can see um did i just get a new
52:29 - member or something i'm getting some
52:31 - flashing lights um
52:34 - um if you go here game of life community
52:37 - contribution like we can look at this
52:39 - one um
52:40 - you'll see this is how it works
52:42 - um and if we look here and see like
52:45 - files changed um you can see this is
52:47 - what um adiads added with the url and
52:50 - their url and source and it's um and
52:52 - thank you luis
52:54 - for your
52:55 - very generous and kind super chat hello
52:58 - to you in brazil
53:00 - um
53:01 - yes and there's coding garden for
53:03 - angular react view stuff so um anyway
53:05 - don't be alarmed if after you submit it
53:07 - you get a big red x
53:10 - of like it failed we have tests to check
53:12 - that the syntax is right we will swoop
53:14 - in i say we myself or uh grueselhouse is
53:17 - uh really takes a lot of thank you so
53:19 - much to nico does a ton of work uh
53:22 - managing these emerging these pull
53:23 - requests we'll swoop in to help you sort
53:25 - that out
53:26 - um but let's take a look i know i know i
53:28 - want to go to r knobs but since i'm here
53:30 - this also i really really appreciate
53:31 - this
53:33 - when in addition to submitting it to the
53:34 - website just in the comment on github
53:37 - you put a link to it because i like to
53:39 - review them sometimes before they get
53:41 - merged um
53:43 - and
53:44 - um
53:45 - and and so on and so forth and and thank
53:47 - you stig for your comment about
53:49 - me looking at comments agreed and i only
53:52 - want to do
53:53 - more of
53:54 - that okay so let's take a look at
53:57 - aditya's
53:59 - game of life coding um uh variation
54:02 - so okay so a couple things i like about
54:04 - this
54:05 - one is i believe uh well let me do it
54:08 - again
54:10 - so there's some uh additional
54:12 - thoughtfulness in terms of the visual
54:14 - design so um and i want to get the name
54:16 - correct um aditya has made some efforts
54:20 - to think about color
54:21 - um i like this soft blue one thing that
54:23 - you do want to consider i think is in
54:25 - sort of thinking about accessibility
54:26 - when you build stuff for the web
54:28 - is color contrast so i might be
54:31 - concerned that the contrast of these
54:33 - characters to the background
54:35 - is a little bit too light and
54:41 - contrast checker you can find these uh
54:45 - web content accessibility guidelines
54:47 - contrast checkers
54:48 - um
54:50 - to sort of see if um your the contrast
54:53 - ratio of your background and foreground
54:55 - meet certain minimum requirements for
54:57 - everybody to be able to read so that's
55:00 - one just a comment that i would have
55:02 - otherwise i find this color scheme to be
55:03 - quite beautiful i like the fact that
55:05 - okay well this is pretty awesome that
55:07 - i'm able to draw in my own cells and
55:10 - then hit run
55:12 - oh my god
55:14 - oh my god
55:17 - none of you heard that did you it was
55:20 - incredibly loud in my ear uh i'm gonna
55:23 - let you hear that but i'm gonna warn you
55:26 - to turn down your headphones
55:29 - i'm gonna turn the sound on and then i'm
55:31 - going to
55:32 - um
55:34 - let's set it to 50 so this is software i
55:36 - use called loopback to route the audio
55:39 - to the stream
55:41 - uh i don't have a
55:42 - physical mixer which would be nice to
55:44 - have
55:45 - uh maybe they'll upgrade someday so um
55:48 - let's see
55:51 - so when as soon as i hit this play
55:53 - button which i'm about to do now i'll
55:54 - count you down it started to play some
55:56 - sound
55:58 - three
55:59 - two
56:00 - one
56:00 - go
56:04 - okay so whatever the pattern i had
56:06 - before had a much more louder static
56:10 - so i think it's like
56:12 - somehow interpreting the
56:15 - changing state of the cells to tones so
56:19 - like adjusting the frequency
56:22 - i don't know whether it's using like
56:23 - envelope sound envelopes and changing
56:25 - the sort of attack or the decay that i
56:27 - was not aware was about to happen
56:30 - um this is called
56:34 - um
56:36 - oh no it just doesn't just yeah so one
56:38 - thing by the way is i would love more
56:41 - explanation
56:42 - so i this is amazing that there's a
56:44 - whole
56:46 - like
56:48 - interface here i can actually change the
56:50 - color for myself so there we go i can
56:53 - adjust the contrast perhaps that way
56:56 - i can have a delay
56:58 - i can mute the audio
57:00 - it shows me like the sort of population
57:02 - of how much
57:04 - um
57:05 - is and there's pause and what's this
57:07 - a library oh my god can i
57:10 - oh i thought maybe i could like drag
57:11 - these on
57:13 - so this is cool it's showing me the
57:14 - library of like things that happen in
57:16 - the game of life that is why
57:19 - i love all these interface elements i
57:21 - don't know what this does but for me
57:23 - what i would love to have here as
57:26 - somebody totally new
57:27 - is and i don't think you need to
57:29 - necessarily pollute this page like if
57:31 - you want the sort of design of this page
57:34 - to be minimal
57:36 - so certainly like a button that brings
57:38 - up a modal overlay that has an
57:39 - explanation
57:40 - or a separate documentation post where
57:42 - then you could sort of click about this
57:44 - sketch or something but i would really
57:47 - want i really want to understand more
57:49 - about one how is it i'm expected to
57:51 - interact and that could be you could say
57:56 - i don't want to tell you how it works i
57:58 - want you to experience this page without
58:00 - knowing and explore and discover on your
58:03 - own but i would at least like to know
58:05 - that that's your point of view um
58:08 - so um but this is really wonderful work
58:11 - and i'm actually thrilled that this is
58:13 - um
58:14 - um
58:15 - being shown
58:16 - um shown i wanna um see if i can pull
58:18 - something up something really
58:19 - interesting happens periodically
58:21 - with my videos
58:23 - and
58:25 - i'm just going into my analytics right
58:28 - now
58:29 - [Music]
58:30 - and i want to show you something
58:34 - just give me a second
58:38 - um
58:40 - no i don't want the real time shoot
58:42 - sorry i'm gonna get there
58:46 - i think this is interesting little
58:47 - inside baseball about how weird stuff
58:50 - that happens on youtube
58:53 - this is a video from 2017
58:58 - and i'm just going to show you
59:01 - its views
59:03 - i'll see more
59:06 - and i'm going to do last 365 days
59:11 - so uh i don't think i am
59:15 - giving away uh giving away any
59:17 - proprietary information here i'm just
59:19 - looking
59:21 - before i show it to you
59:24 - [Music]
59:27 - let's see here
59:31 - talk amongst yourselves for a second
59:35 - i'm having trouble controlling my
59:36 - computer
59:38 - come on there we go
59:40 - there we go okay this is exactly what i
59:42 - want to show you here comes three two
59:44 - one so this is interesting because this
59:47 - is the uh
59:49 - these are the views a graph of the views
59:51 - for the last year
59:53 - of the game of life video
59:55 - so like what happened so it's like
59:57 - pretty normal like it gets like a few
59:58 - hundred views per day it's an old video
60:02 - you know there's some variation on one
60:04 - day there's like a little peak here
60:05 - where like 600 people watched it or
60:08 - whatever but then look at this
60:09 - all of a sudden recently the only thing
60:12 - i can think of is that veritasium which
60:14 - is quite a huge um youtube
60:17 - channel um recently released a video
60:20 - which made heavy references to the game
60:22 - of life and i was trying to think like
60:24 - oh maybe but but i looked through and
60:26 - like referrals and that kind of thing i
60:28 - couldn't find any other evidence to that
60:30 - but i do think this kind of this happens
60:32 - um periodically
60:34 - that certain older videos just start
60:36 - getting recommended and they kind of
60:37 - take off and um yes sadly john conway
60:40 - who invented the game of life um uh
60:43 - passed away last year due to covid um
60:46 - um but anyway i'm fascinated by this if
60:49 - anybody uh understands why and how this
60:52 - happens
60:53 - it usually comes and then it just like
60:54 - leaves like it'll be back within a week
60:56 - it'll be back to just this like little
60:58 - trickling a few hundred views per day um
61:00 - i think uh just to show you the full um
61:03 - lifetime
61:04 - since uploaded
61:07 - you can see here it's still
61:10 - a piddling
61:12 - like this is a huge sudden bump
61:15 - right here in this particular video
61:17 - right now
61:18 - but it still is relative to when it was
61:21 - first released
61:22 - right where you can see um you know
61:25 - where it was first released
61:27 - it had something like you know 11 000
61:28 - views in one day but um it was de and
61:31 - chris is saying it was definitely
61:32 - derek's video that caused it okay um so
61:35 - that's good i should do it a little
61:36 - deeper dive and see but that's kind of
61:38 - interesting to note and and yeah
61:41 - um
61:42 - but um anyway if you haven't watched
61:44 - this one i think this is a pretty
61:45 - interesting example lots of stuff you
61:46 - could do with it and please contribute
61:48 - your community contribution
61:49 - now
61:51 - um let me close that out
61:54 - and go back to
61:56 - uh where i really was
61:58 - which was
62:00 - uh i was about to look at arnov's
62:02 - uh
62:04 - random walk
62:07 - with random colors random alpha and
62:09 - random size
62:10 - so you know basically you want your
62:13 - community contribution to be featured
62:15 - submit it to the most recent video
62:18 - because uh there's not a lot coming in
62:20 - and i get to look at them every week and
62:22 - i'll get back to looking at random ones
62:24 - already okay
62:26 - uh let me let's take a look at this i
62:28 - haven't actually looked at this one yet
62:33 - oh i love this
62:36 - i love this so random colors and random
62:39 - alpha so we're seeing
62:41 - i can't to me i don't think so this i
62:43 - don't think this is there's nothing i'm
62:45 - not saying this that there's something
62:46 - wrong with this but just to be clear i
62:47 - don't believe this is a self-avoiding
62:49 - walk
62:50 - i believe this is a based off of like
62:53 - this for the first example in that video
62:55 - where i start to just look at how i
62:57 - might visualize the history of how many
63:00 - times uh the walker has landed in a
63:03 - given spot i just do that through alpha
63:05 - here we're seeing sort of color and size
63:07 - um it does does feel to me like i wonder
63:10 - part of me wonders if we there might be
63:12 - some more
63:14 - um compelling or meaningful
63:16 - um
63:18 - results if instead of using randomness
63:21 - for how you draw the circles in the
63:22 - colors that's actually tied to some data
63:24 - of the system so for me one of the
63:26 - things i like about the thinking about
63:27 - the random walk is
63:29 - the thing that's random
63:31 - is the step it chooses to take
63:34 - but what if that you had a constraint
63:36 - that was the only thing you were allowed
63:38 - to have randa and every other way you
63:40 - choose to draw whether it's shape color
63:43 - size speed etc um
63:47 - has to come from some other logic and
63:49 - that that i think is actually you know
63:51 - today's session being something about
63:52 - data visualization i think is really
63:54 - important to consider
63:58 - we as human beings are looking for
64:00 - patterns and to describe meaning so i'm
64:02 - really just here trying to understand
64:04 - this and thinking green means something
64:06 - or pink means something so i think as an
64:08 - exerciser just constrain to yourself
64:11 - how could you you know
64:13 - is there's an irony here i suppose of me
64:15 - talking about this as a person who you
64:17 - know favorite book is a book of random
64:19 - numbers and reads from it regularly but
64:23 - randomness can be used as a crutch i
64:25 - think in design so uh it's a it's a tool
64:28 - and it can be used with great uh to
64:31 - achieve great wonder and beauty but also
64:34 - it can be overused or
64:37 - maybe maybe there's some sweet spot in
64:39 - the middle of him kind of controlled
64:40 - randomness or thinking about probability
64:42 - that also um
64:43 - [Music]
64:45 - and i i think a good example of this is
64:47 - like
64:48 - stochastic fractals or fractals that
64:50 - have this very highly regular order but
64:52 - some amount of randomness sprinkled into
64:54 - them
64:55 - okay
64:56 - so um but thank you for this arnov it's
64:58 - quite beautiful um i could really
65:00 - imagine this just being like a beautiful
65:02 - print
65:03 - um
65:04 - there's a lot of um you know nice
65:06 - background a large scale public
65:08 - projection lots of possibilities there
65:10 - thank you so much for sharing this okay
65:14 - guess what everybody
65:15 - um
65:26 - so um i want to take a moment before i
65:28 - take a a break and come back with the uh
65:31 - looking at some data visualization code
65:33 - in today's live stream and thank today's
65:36 - sponsor
65:38 - curiosity stream i'm going to play a
65:40 - quick ad for you from curiositystream
65:44 - from the founder of discovery channel
65:46 - comes a new independent streaming
65:48 - service
66:16 - so i i've talked about this before um
66:18 - many times a curiosity stream is a
66:20 - regular sponsor of the coding train it's
66:21 - one of my uh favorite sponsors they're
66:24 - all my favorite sponsors but boy
66:25 - actually well i really do love curious
66:27 - dream especially because
66:29 - um i happen to be part of a group of
66:30 - educational youtubers who are building
66:33 - something called nebula and you can find
66:35 - that at
66:36 - watchnebula.com which i'm just going to
66:38 - pull up here
66:39 - this is a streaming service service that
66:43 - has and i'm just going to go here under
66:45 - videos um it has a why oh boy i really
66:48 - gotta check this one from mike boyd um
66:50 - this week i learned to spin a baseball
66:51 - bat oh i'm so i know what i'm doing this
66:54 - afternoon um you can see uh probably
66:57 - some of your hopefully some of your
66:58 - favorites here um you know if you're
67:00 - looking for a way to like a subset of
67:02 - videos you might be interested in
67:04 - that are all you know a lot of this
67:05 - content is on youtube and nebula there's
67:07 - lots of nebula plus content um i would
67:09 - highly recommend you go check out watch
67:12 - network.com why am i talking about this
67:15 - curiosity stream which is a streaming
67:16 - service um
67:18 - for
67:19 - um
67:20 - uh documentaries nebula is a partnering
67:23 - with curiosity stream um nebula has
67:25 - ad-free content experiments with all
67:27 - different kinds of content
67:28 - that actually has nebula originals tom
67:30 - scott's money is a really wonderful one
67:32 - so curiosity stream loves educational
67:34 - creators and supporting more educational
67:36 - content so uh nebula we worked out a
67:38 - deal with if you sign up at that coding
67:41 - train link curiositystream.com
67:43 - codingtrain
67:45 - not only do you get access for the
67:46 - entire year
67:48 - to curiositystream but you get nebula
67:50 - for free not a trial you will always
67:52 - have nebula as long as you're a
67:53 - curiosity stream member so my script
67:56 - here says for a limited time curiosity
67:59 - stream is offering a 26
68:01 - discount but that's what my script says
68:03 - that's not actually the discount the
68:05 - discount is higher than that it's 41
68:08 - special father's day again i can't think
68:10 - don't buy it for me i already have it
68:12 - um but if i wanted my kids to get me
68:15 - they're too young they can't buy stuff
68:16 - themselves but they could tell their
68:18 - mom or
68:20 - friend's parent or grandparent to buy it
68:22 - for me to get a father's day gift i
68:25 - would want this gift
68:27 - and so you can get it for 41 off that's
68:29 - 11.79
68:32 - that's less than 12
68:33 - for the whole year
68:35 - it's like you know if you want to
68:36 - subscribe to the coding train membership
68:38 - thing that's way more than that
68:40 - so i hope you will consider um it helps
68:42 - me uh helps me out a little bit uh if
68:44 - you do choose to sign up it supports my
68:46 - channel um and so go to the link in the
68:48 - description
68:50 - um
68:52 - yeah oh but let me let's just i do want
68:54 - to um just take a minute here i have um
68:57 - a little text file where i was like
68:59 - keeping track of a bunch of my
69:01 - recommended documentaries that i think
69:04 - some of them are just things that i love
69:05 - like the secret lives of big cats and um
69:08 - there's actually a new one new curacao
69:10 - stream original it's about you know i'm
69:12 - kind of like a pet rescue person
69:14 - or my family is we have a lot of we have
69:16 - a foster cat we foster dogs but it's
69:18 - things called doug saves the world i'm
69:20 - going to get the name wrong but there's
69:21 - a new uh crusty stream original about um
69:24 - uh a drone pilot who rescues um animals
69:27 - but really i think probably escher's
69:29 - infinite perspective uh the magic
69:31 - numbers and uh
69:34 - and the joy of data these are there's a
69:36 - lot of documentary content that i think
69:37 - you would find inspirational for um that
69:39 - would
69:40 - be of interest to you but i just wanna
69:42 - let's just click on um
69:44 - uh uh i think you know if you're
69:46 - interested if you like the history of
69:47 - computing which is definitely a thing
69:48 - that i'm interested in also like
69:50 - um
69:51 - and you can see calculating ada the
69:53 - countess of computing and of course
69:54 - here's uh dr um hannah fry who is a host
69:57 - of a lot of the videos who's a really
69:59 - incredible science communicator nature's
70:02 - mathematics all about fractals let's
70:04 - look at um
70:05 - escher's infinite perspective um you
70:08 - know i can kind of like scroll through a
70:09 - little bit of this
70:11 - that you can see like the escher stuff
70:13 - is really amazing uh pleasure that
70:16 - mystified everyone for generations are
70:18 - you hearing that audio drawing with a
70:20 - hidden meaning yeah oh my accessible
70:22 - only so anyway this is like a library i
70:25 - mean
70:26 - the library of content here is
70:28 - incredible so i i gotta watch myself go
70:31 - on for too long about this uh i went way
70:34 - off script this time but uh hopefully
70:36 - you'll consider it uh again it's a 41
70:38 - discount it's this weekend only for
70:40 - father's day um by the way you you're
70:43 - not seeing it on the banner here but um
70:45 - it says on the website it says 40 off if
70:48 - you go to my coding train link it's 41
70:50 - off one percent better uh and also uh
70:54 - help support the coding train channel
70:55 - okay so i'm gonna take a break you got
70:57 - nothing else to do go to
70:59 - curiositystream.com codingtrain uh sign
71:01 - up i'll be back in about five minutes to
71:03 - explore uh visualizing data with p with
71:07 - d3 in particular i wanna look at their
71:10 - uh force-directed force uh the the
71:13 - features of the api that allow you to do
71:15 - force directed graph so i'll talk about
71:16 - what that is and i'll be back in less
71:18 - than five
71:19 - minutes
71:21 - [Music]
71:48 - [Music]
71:55 - so
71:57 - [Music]
72:21 - [Music]
72:32 - [Music]
74:07 - do
74:10 - [Music]
74:48 - [Music]
75:01 - so
75:03 - [Music]
75:17 - do
75:19 - [Music]
75:26 - [Music]
75:41 - [Music]
75:43 - do
75:47 - [Music]
76:42 - and i am back
76:44 - okay
76:46 - so
76:46 - um it's time to actually do some coding
76:49 - thank you all for your patience
76:52 - um so one of the things that i'm
76:53 - interested in doing
76:55 - um in the future is building a map
76:59 - of all of my youtube videos and let me
77:03 - switch over here
77:05 - and thanks again to curiositystream for
77:07 - sponsoring today's coding train episode
77:10 - um i'm going to look for d3
77:13 - force directed graph it's going to take
77:16 - me to an observable notebook page
77:19 - and this is the example that i'm looking
77:20 - at
77:21 - so
77:22 - this is using a particular data set from
77:26 - the les miserables story um and it's
77:29 - visualizing connections between
77:31 - different characters i will probably
77:33 - today
77:34 - i might even just use that data set just
77:36 - to have something
77:38 - um that i can you know pair it i would
77:40 - like to basically make this exact
77:43 - example but i want to change the drawing
77:45 - mechanism
77:47 - um
77:49 - and use
77:50 - p5.js to do the drawing and i'll talk
77:52 - about why for a second so a couple
77:54 - things
77:55 - um one is um i have um
78:00 - some examples of force-directed graphs
78:02 - um using um different physics libraries
78:05 - i think i've tried it with
78:07 - matter.js and with toxiclips.js
78:10 - um
78:15 - but um i find that one of the things
78:17 - that i really struggle with
78:19 - is keeping any sense of kind of
78:21 - stability within the system and i've
78:24 - been looking at some of the d3 examples
78:26 - in particular i'm actually a little bit
78:27 - more interested in this disconnected
78:29 - graph so maybe this is actually the one
78:31 - that i should start with um
78:35 - i've been really sort of impressed with
78:36 - the sort of stability and physics of
78:39 - these systems
78:41 - and i would like to be able to
78:44 - play around with them
78:45 - however um i'm not i'm you know i
78:48 - certainly uh these examples are both
78:51 - using svg
78:53 - and d3
78:54 - has a particular module built into it
78:57 - and i think simon pointed this out that
78:59 - d3 has a lot of hooks into drawing
79:01 - already you can create an svg and
79:03 - there's some advantages using svgs
79:05 - rather than canvas
79:07 - and you can um
79:09 - build and design the svg
79:11 - um
79:12 - um and you can sort of see things that
79:13 - might look familiar to you like line and
79:15 - stroke and stroke opacity very sort of
79:18 - p5 drawing like so that's great
79:21 - nothing wrong with that approach i'm
79:22 - interested in learning that approach too
79:24 - but i think a way for me to understand
79:26 - more about how d3 works is to pair it
79:29 - with something that i know really well
79:31 - like p5 and i do know that d3
79:34 - also uh renders to canvas
79:37 - um these are you know probably these are
79:39 - probably pretty old articles like 2017
79:41 - actually not that um so d3 also works
79:45 - with canvas and we can see things like
79:48 - you can create a container and then you
79:50 - can say canvas d3 select that container
79:52 - and append a canvas and then you can uh
79:55 - call various uh
79:57 - canvas drawing functions to bind the
79:59 - data um so
80:01 - this all you don't need p5 at all
80:04 - but i would like to explore this
80:07 - um
80:08 - in just to experiment to learn a little
80:10 - bit about d3 there's also a wonderful
80:12 - resource um p5d3 cookbook
80:17 - um which um um i don't know i forgot who
80:20 - created this but i definitely refer to
80:22 - it on multiple occasions which kind of
80:24 - looks at um pairing p5 and d3
80:28 - and i would say that when i look at the
80:31 - when i've looked at d3 canvas examples
80:35 - with canvas
80:36 - ultimately what i want to do with p5 is
80:39 - nothing different than what they're
80:40 - already doing
80:41 - they're just using native canvas
80:43 - functions and tying them to d3 i just
80:46 - want to use the p5 canvas functions and
80:48 - tie them to d3 and see what happens
80:50 - okay
80:52 - change the stream title i probably
80:55 - should
80:56 - not the best seo but you know i can't
80:58 - can't help but like
81:01 - go with a meme all right let's figure
81:04 - out here how i want to do this
81:06 - i think actually interestingly enough
81:10 - let me try
81:11 - to just recreate this exact example
81:16 - with p5 drawing in canvas
81:19 - instead of but use d3 for the data
81:23 - parsing
81:24 - and the force layout
81:26 - and i'm going to look at this is going
81:27 - to be a very important page for me to
81:30 - look at um the various documentation for
81:34 - all the force stuff
81:36 - um so first thing i need to do oh boy
81:40 - one of these days i'll learn about all
81:41 - this like fancy new javascript way of
81:44 - doing things
81:45 - but let's just get
81:48 - d3 how to um
81:50 - d3 cdn i'll look for
81:55 - um
81:56 - is this what i want
82:00 - d37 oh boy
82:02 - oh boy it's been a while since i looked
82:04 - at d3
82:05 - so the first thing i need to do
82:07 - is i already have the most recent
82:09 - version of p5 referenced in my
82:11 - index.html and i'm working outside of
82:14 - any online web code editor right now
82:16 - just to sort of
82:19 - manage things
82:20 - and now i am referring to d3
82:24 - and i think if i just say console log
82:28 - d3
82:29 - console log p5 i should see that both
82:32 - libraries have been loaded
82:37 - and
82:39 - p5 is loaded and d3 is loaded okay great
82:42 - so step one
82:44 - i've got about 45 minutes here to make
82:47 - this happen step one i have both p5 and
82:50 - d3 loaded
82:54 - now one thing that i almost just want to
82:56 - do
82:57 - before i even get to canvas is just
82:59 - unobservable this is maybe a terrible
83:02 - thing that i'm doing and my deepest and
83:04 - sincerest apologies to mike postock
83:06 - right now
83:07 - but uh observable notebooks which is
83:10 - this sort of like web editor web-based
83:12 - framework for writing
83:15 - javascript and in particular used for a
83:17 - lot of d3 examples
83:18 - um
83:20 - i find uh is i'm not used to it and it
83:23 - has some of its own
83:24 - sort of ways that it works
83:26 - so i want to unobservable this to just
83:30 - make it a regular uh sketch so i'm going
83:32 - to
83:34 - first grab all of this code
83:37 - and then i'm going to un take out all of
83:38 - the
83:40 - um
83:44 - what am i saying i'm going to take out
83:45 - all of the
83:49 - svg stuff after that okay
83:51 - all right so i've got all this code here
83:54 - uh but what i don't have is the data so
83:56 - the data is oh interesting file
83:59 - attachment graph.json
84:02 - oh there's a file here how do i get that
84:04 - file
84:08 - or do i just copy this oh can i download
84:10 - this
84:12 - run cell
84:13 - oh boy can i oh look at this can i get
84:16 - this data somehow
84:19 - add embed download json
84:27 - oh perfect okay i've got the data
84:30 - let's bring it in here
84:34 - hit save hey how come my formatting
84:36 - isn't working is did i turn off format
84:39 - on save
84:41 - oh never one of these days
84:47 - ah format on save all right
84:50 - what happened to all my beautification
84:54 - stuff i'm not gonna worry about that
84:55 - right now
84:58 - let's use preload
85:12 - data.json
85:13 - [Music]
85:15 - and then
85:18 - start
85:19 - simulation
85:21 - i'm going to create a function just call
85:22 - it start simulation
85:26 - put all this stuff in that
85:28 - and then i'm gonna say start simulation
85:31 - here
85:33 - and i'm actually gonna say no canvas
85:35 - right now
85:36 - like i'm not using p5 for anything other
85:39 - than just like loading the json and
85:41 - calling this initial
85:43 - um
85:44 - like set of code that's all d3 stuff
85:47 - that i got from this observable page
85:49 - um i guess i need this drag function as
85:53 - well
85:55 - let's
85:56 - let's grab that and let's just um
86:04 - just to make this
86:07 - more i mean i like using the arrow stuff
86:09 - but just for right now let's just do
86:11 - this
86:12 - okay so i think maybe i've gotten
86:14 - everything
86:15 - [Laughter]
86:20 - yeah and stig is asking wouldn't you be
86:21 - able to make a force-directed graph
86:23 - armed with your knowledge from your
86:24 - physics videos springs attraction yeah
86:26 - so i've done that um and i do want to do
86:28 - that and i did actually include that
86:30 - even i should have maybe i should have
86:32 - done from scratch or sort of like um
86:34 - in my sort of poll from today i did
86:36 - address this earlier um but i i'm just
86:38 - really i kind of wanted to explore i
86:40 - just really
86:41 - love this particular example and want to
86:43 - see um
86:45 - if i can integrate how it works
86:47 - integrate it but yes um there's you know
86:49 - the other library i'm really interested
86:52 - in looking at is um
86:55 - this particular
86:57 - library which also has a lot of
87:03 - network graph kind of stuff world cup
87:05 - network so i'm just kind of interested
87:08 - in seeing what's out there okay
87:12 - uh uncaught invalidation is not defined
87:16 - all right what is this i don't think i
87:18 - need this right now
87:21 - i don't need to stop this simulation
87:22 - anytime
87:25 - um okay color was expecting color okay
87:28 - so it's calling some color function
87:30 - which i probably forgot to get from the
87:33 - observable notebook
87:38 - yeah there's also a color function
87:45 - this is confusing to me
87:47 - and i'm messing up the p5 color
87:58 - i think this should actually be
88:02 - this right
88:09 - so i'm just turning this into a generic
88:12 - function for color which it's really not
88:14 - going to like because that's a p5
88:15 - function
88:20 - uh p5 and problems creating okay p5
88:23 - colors
88:27 - where
88:28 - where
88:33 - uh this is just a bunch of like
88:35 - hold on sometimes these warnings cause
88:38 - me more trouble than they help me
88:40 - so i think i'm just going to go to the
88:42 - p5 minified version which takes those
88:44 - out
88:45 - okay
88:46 - so let's see here
88:49 - um
88:51 - so what i want to do now
88:53 - is look at let's make sure the data is
88:56 - there
89:01 - okay i've got the data links and nodes
89:04 - so that's promising
89:06 - create the simulation
89:09 - create the svg oh you know what
89:13 - i bet you width and height are not set
89:26 - all right let's look at is did the svg
89:28 - get created
89:33 - this is strange
89:35 - um
89:47 - so created this svg
89:52 - why do i not see it
90:03 - 600 600
90:08 - create a
90:10 - attribute
90:11 - oh does it do i have to like add it to
90:13 - the dom somehow
90:18 - just wondering if the simulation is even
90:20 - running
90:26 - so this is like a update function like
90:28 - the draw loop
90:32 - so the simulation is running
90:35 - that's promising
90:38 - um
90:52 - four simulation nodes
91:00 - oh you know what i think i lost
91:02 - no no no
91:04 - data link
91:05 - hold on
91:13 - let's make sure this worked the way it
91:15 - was supposed to
91:23 - okay so i'm getting all of the
91:26 - nodes
91:29 - oh they have a location and a velocity
91:36 - so they're there how come i don't see
91:38 - them oh i bet you i've messed up the
91:40 - color
91:41 - stuff
91:47 - let me take out this color thing for a
91:49 - second
92:03 - is that not called drag
92:12 - that's the only place
92:19 - okay all right why
92:27 - do i not see the svg
92:41 - is that something i need to do
92:46 - no
92:52 - oh i'm so confused
92:56 - the funny thing is i don't even care
92:57 - about using the svg so maybe i should
92:59 - just
93:01 - quit that because
93:03 - i'm about to be i was going to do all
93:04 - this with canva
93:05 - cam document.body append
93:08 - child
93:15 - but where's the svg
93:18 - how do you add
93:20 - uh d3 add svg to
93:25 - dom
93:32 - d3 select body append svg
93:37 - is that in did i just miss that and it's
93:39 - actually in this
93:55 - d3
93:56 - select body append
93:59 - svg
94:05 - okay i see an svg
94:08 - can i append this svg
94:20 - uh
94:32 - i'm so confused
94:34 - so now i have an svg
94:54 - the function you copied returns the svg
94:56 - for adding to the dom
95:01 - i know
95:02 - so why can't i add it
95:11 - hold on
95:19 - return svg.oh return svg.node
95:23 - oh
95:28 - like that
95:39 - select append
95:49 - this is so funny that i'm stuck on this
95:51 - like tiny little thing here uh
96:14 - there we go
96:16 - boom
96:20 - okay
96:22 - that was rough
96:25 - okay i got it
96:27 - so what i did was i
96:30 - selected the body and appended the svg
96:33 - there
96:34 - then made that svg the thing that i'm
96:37 - adding all the stuff to i'm not really
96:39 - sure
96:42 - what i did but the point of this is i
96:45 - just wanted to get it up on the screen
96:46 - i'm going to undo all the svg stuff
96:49 - but i wanted to make sure i had it
96:51 - and i want to get rid of some of my
96:52 - console log stuff
96:54 - because i actually think i'm going to
96:55 - simplify it greatly
97:02 - and by the way let me just put this
97:03 - color thing back
97:06 - just curious
97:08 - if
97:09 - um
97:11 - i think i want to probably
97:13 - not use this
97:16 - i'll call it color d3
97:20 - let's call this uh color d3 let's see if
97:22 - that works
97:27 - uh why am i not getting
97:30 - color
97:39 - okay i'm not going to worry about the
97:40 - color thing
97:42 - that's not my concern
97:46 - simplify okay so now
97:54 - now here we go so what i would like to
97:56 - do and i'm also just gonna like comment
97:58 - out this drag thing i'm gonna definitely
98:00 - need to deal with that at some point
98:03 - but i'm going to look at this so
98:05 - basically what's happening is i'm taking
98:07 - all of the data
98:09 - this data is a whole lot of nodes and
98:12 - links the nodes are the circles the
98:14 - links are the connections
98:18 - and
98:19 - basically
98:21 - i'm creating a force simulation out of
98:24 - all those node objects
98:26 - the force is a link between them
98:29 - based on linking
98:31 - their ids
98:33 - to ids
98:34 - there is a
98:38 - charge force
98:39 - which is the um
98:42 - i'm assuming is kind of like the overall
98:44 - many body well let's just see that must
98:47 - be what's sort of like
98:49 - keeping them from not overlapping
98:52 - oh yeah drag is not defined okay let's
98:54 - put the drag back just for right
98:56 - now let's look at these different forces
99:01 - right so
99:03 - that is like a repulsion force like
99:05 - they've got the force linking them that
99:06 - springy force
99:08 - but they don't have
99:10 - um
99:11 - they don't have the charge force
99:13 - which would be now they're all spread
99:15 - out
99:16 - and then um this is interesting this is
99:19 - like basically a force i think keeping
99:23 - keeping it all like clustered like if i
99:25 - take this out everything's just gonna
99:26 - like fly away because they're pushing
99:28 - each other away and nothing like holding
99:30 - it to the center
99:31 - right you can see everything's flying
99:32 - away
99:33 - um
99:35 - so i think you know this is really just
99:37 - like
99:38 - zero
99:40 - zero i think it's the equivalent of that
99:45 - no
99:47 - what did i do
99:52 - okay
99:52 - so what is oh oh no no this is a force x
99:55 - the d that's this is a function that's
99:58 - having every x be pulled to the center
100:01 - right so that's you'll you'll see like
100:03 - if i do like negative 100
100:06 - watch this whole graph is going to shift
100:08 - over
100:09 - see because that's the like this is
100:11 - setting that like center force so that's
100:13 - kind of important
100:15 - um and then the link
100:17 - right if i just take this link out
100:21 - now none of them are linked so it's just
100:24 - uh like perfectly oh i really kind of
100:26 - love this like everything is like the
100:28 - charge force is spreading everything out
100:30 - but everything is also being kept within
100:33 - the sort of constraints of the svg shape
100:37 - so i want the link back
100:40 - because eventually i want to do this
100:41 - with my own data that's sort of the
100:42 - point but just going to keep this data
100:45 - um
100:48 - okay so we're good
100:50 - so
100:51 - uh everybody um well hold on
100:53 - let's do um
100:57 - whoops
101:00 - um
101:05 - how do i do that thing where i do get
101:06 - branch uh fine let's do this
101:20 - no not on github
101:35 - well fine i know how to do this
101:38 - just
101:39 - okay
101:43 - oops
101:54 - no
101:58 - there we go
102:05 - so i'm gonna just do
102:12 - um we'll make like just like a little
102:15 - change here
102:20 - uh how do you set a tag working
102:24 - working d3
102:27 - uh
102:27 - [Music]
102:31 - port of d3 observable notebook
102:35 - okay so now at least whenever i put this
102:38 - anywhere in the git history you will be
102:40 - able to find
102:41 - this version of it with all the svg
102:43 - stuff i want to now
102:46 - and i have a width and height of 600
102:48 - let's just just see will it
102:50 - like work
102:52 - whoa what the
102:58 - i think i did something wrong about the
102:59 - size i shouldn't really be too
103:08 - can i do this
103:14 - i don't okay i'm not gonna worry about
103:17 - i'm gonna create the canvas
103:19 - so uh let me do create canvas
103:24 - with height
103:26 - and
103:26 - actually
103:31 - those are now going to be global p5
103:33 - variables
103:34 - set by create canvas
103:36 - background zero
103:39 - okay so now i've got a canvas and i've
103:41 - got the svg below it what i want to do
103:43 - is reproduce
103:45 - this exact
103:47 - drawing in the canvas
103:49 - and then i'll delete all the svg stuff
103:52 - so
103:53 - function draw
103:57 - um basically
103:59 - the nodes have
104:07 - let's look at the nodes
104:10 - oh okay so these i'm going to need these
104:12 - to be
104:13 - global variables thank you very much
104:17 - how do how to make good code worse
104:24 - okay so the nodes
104:26 - each one has
104:28 - an x and y
104:29 - great
104:31 - so i should be able to now just say
104:35 - 4 let
104:37 - node of nodes
104:39 - circle
104:41 - node.x node.y
104:45 - 10.
104:51 - okay that's promising
104:54 - background
104:55 - zero
104:57 - now ah so the center
105:00 - is on a p5 canvas at the top left
105:03 - so i guess i will just say translate
105:07 - oh boy
105:08 - all of my vs code settings seem to have
105:11 - disappeared
105:12 - great okay so this is promising
105:15 - now i just need to do the same thing
105:16 - with all the links
105:20 - let link of
105:22 - links
105:24 - stroke 255
105:29 - line
105:31 - oh yeah i don't know what the links look
105:32 - like
105:33 - how do i find the two
105:35 - nodes that they're connected to
105:38 - the links are all
105:41 - index oh a source
105:44 - and a target so it looks like the source
105:47 - is the source
105:49 - node and the target is the target node
105:50 - okay
105:51 - that should work
105:53 - uh link dot
105:55 - can i do this
106:00 - can i destructure this object
106:03 - and then say source.x
106:05 - source.y
106:07 - target.x
106:09 - target.y
106:11 - okay
106:13 - there we go
106:15 - all right this is very promising oh i
106:17 - like this okay guess what now guess what
106:19 - i get to do now oh it makes so much
106:21 - simpler
106:24 - um
106:26 - i don't need any of this svg stuff
106:33 - all i'm doing
106:35 - is to start the simulation is load the
106:39 - data and this is very silly like the
106:41 - data is just in a thing that has links
106:43 - and nodes and this is just pulling the
106:45 - data out to be in separate links and
106:48 - nodes
106:50 - so this could maybe be rethought a
106:52 - little bit like when i put my own data
106:53 - in there i might do something different
106:55 - set up all the forces
106:58 - and then now this is interesting i do
107:01 - think oh i do need this tick because
107:04 - what it's doing is
107:06 - for every update of the animation this
107:08 - doesn't
107:11 - is this something
107:14 - forever how does it know what link and
107:16 - node are here
107:19 - for every update of the animation what
107:21 - is link and node this is so weird
107:29 - this must be some magic that happens
107:35 - in the background
107:38 - node is not defined
107:40 - what the
107:47 - okay
107:52 - oh
107:54 - wait a sec
107:55 - was this something oh was
107:57 - oh this was because
107:59 - oh this was because this is the svg
108:01 - stuff okay i don't need this
108:08 - yeah this is just
108:10 - i guess i could say
108:11 - uh i could call this render
108:14 - and i could use d3s
108:17 - you know forget about um
108:19 - p5's draw loop i could just call on tick
108:22 - for the animation call render
108:24 - no
108:25 - oh but you know what
108:27 - that messes up the translate
108:29 - uh draw knows to reset the
108:31 - transformation matrix in p5 so i'd have
108:34 - to explicitly say reset no
108:38 - it's weird
108:41 - there we go
108:45 - so i don't know whether it makes sense
108:46 - now the only thing is i can't drag any
108:48 - of this stuff so how do i get this drag
108:50 - stuff
108:51 - back
108:56 - hmm okay this is going to be challenging
109:00 - drag simulation drag event
109:09 - do i i mean could it be as simple
109:12 - as saying
109:13 - drag simulation
109:15 - just call that function
109:16 - pass the simulation in and
109:19 - attach all this
109:20 - stuff to it it doesn't
109:23 - that's not that's not gonna do it
109:29 - hold on
109:30 - uh hmm all right so this i got to think
109:33 - about
109:34 - um
109:36 - let's look at what was it doing here
109:38 - so this
109:42 - uh call dr oh call drag
109:46 - simulation oh that's weird
109:50 - interesting
109:52 - what if
109:59 - all right hold on let's look at this
110:01 - canvas d3
110:03 - drag
110:05 - drag and zoom
110:08 - blocks this is an old example
110:12 - before
110:13 - observable there was blocks
110:16 - but this is using canvas right so this
110:19 - is
110:20 - this is exactly what i was talking about
110:23 - i'm using p5 instead
110:26 - of like context move to and arc and all
110:28 - of that
110:30 - [Music]
110:36 - and oops
110:38 - so i think
110:40 - hold on hold on hold on i think i might
110:42 - have a clue here
110:44 - where is the drag
110:46 - canvas call d3 drag subject drag subject
110:50 - on drag drag okay hold on
110:52 - this is a clue here got it got it got it
110:55 - got it so
111:00 - this is my canvas
111:03 - canvas equals create canvas
111:06 - canvas.call d3 direct but it's not
111:10 - canvas
111:11 - dot call because
111:13 - i'm d3 wants me probably to call it on
111:15 - the name this is the p5 canvas the
111:17 - native html canvas is in a property
111:19 - called elt
111:22 - um hold on let's get rid of the zoom
111:26 - could you please
111:28 - why
111:29 - i want you to do the thing where you oh
111:37 - hold on okay um
111:39 - what is the like
111:42 - uh
111:42 - there's that property that's like
111:45 - i wanted to wrap
111:49 - um hold on i'm like
111:52 - i'm having a major crisis in that my
111:55 - i don't know how to use vs code
111:57 - line length
111:58 - my line length property
112:03 - line length
112:09 - uh
112:12 - javascript
112:14 - is this going to do it no that's html
112:16 - form
112:19 - oh my god i don't know how to do this
112:27 - wait i'll just have to survive so d3 dra
112:31 - canvas is i'll call d3 dot drag subject
112:34 - drag subject
112:37 - on drag dragged
112:40 - alt z
112:43 - no i don't want to rat i don't want it
112:44 - to wrap i want it to just be so long
112:48 - that it needs to
112:49 - like put them on different lines
112:54 - um
112:55 - my my audit format is gone but i okay
112:57 - what's drag's subject here
113:00 - oh
113:01 - what
113:08 - can i just say on that's weird drag
113:12 - subject
113:16 - this is weird
113:19 - well let's try something
113:22 - well this is going to get wonky okay i'm
113:24 - going to get rid of this
113:31 - got it got it got it got it got it got
113:33 - it got it got it
113:34 - i see
113:36 - i think i understand what to do here
113:40 - i basically
113:44 - when i create the canvas
113:48 - oh i need to do this
113:53 - let's make this a global variable
113:57 - and in start simulation i'm also going
113:59 - to do this here
114:03 - and then this is
114:07 - where did i get that
114:10 - well i got this from
114:13 - from here
114:23 - oh i got it from the end of this i see i
114:26 - see hold on this i did not expect to
114:28 - have to deal with i could i could skip
114:30 - this dragging stuff but i want to
114:33 - figure it out oh yeah here here that's
114:34 - what i'm looking for
114:39 - how am i doing on time oh this is going
114:41 - to take a while let's uh oh i have it
114:43 - here
114:52 - [Music]
114:53 - i'm figuring this out i'm using my
114:56 - canvas ah there we go got it got it got
114:58 - it got it got it got it got it i think i
114:59 - know what to do
115:03 - canvas call d3 drag
115:21 - on
115:23 - on
115:27 - canvas.elt
115:40 - oh
115:47 - i just had like some wonky syntax stuff
115:49 - no
115:51 - yeah extra i'm gonna get this
115:54 - why won't it autoformat is this not
115:56 - right
116:04 - what's the chance this is right drag
116:06 - started
116:08 - dragged drag ended
116:11 - so let me just try drag started
116:19 - and see what happens here
116:22 - sketch line 56.
116:29 - oh whoops that's the problem
116:33 - there we go
116:43 - okay people sorry i'm really working
116:46 - very intensely on this and i'm not
116:48 - really able to explain while i'm going
116:49 - i've kind of lost i just want to see
116:51 - let's see
116:54 - canvas.elt.col is not a function
117:12 - that's the canvas elt is the default
117:15 - canvas
117:18 - oh because it's a oh oh oh oh i know
117:21 - what i need to do ah i need to make a d3
117:25 - canvas
117:27 - d3 select canvas of course
117:30 - of course
117:43 - this is all
117:44 - d3 stuff
117:46 - okay so select the canvas hopefully it's
117:49 - the right
117:50 - canvas this is the problem okay
117:54 - yay
117:57 - okay this is good
118:00 - i mean i'm get it's registering my
118:02 - clicks
118:04 - so um
118:07 - simulation it needs to be a global
118:09 - variable because of the way that i've
118:10 - done this
118:12 - obviously i could put these these could
118:14 - be like enclosed in that function which
118:16 - would probably be the correct way to do
118:18 - this
118:19 - but i'm just going to lazily use global
118:21 - variables
118:23 - okay cannot read property x of undefined
118:26 - sketch.js line 12.
118:31 - so hold on
118:33 - let me just look at what doesn't know
118:35 - what d is where is it supposed to get d
118:41 - so
118:42 - the event is
118:44 - subject
118:46 - target there's definitely a subject here
118:50 - x y
118:53 - oh you know what i need to do
118:56 - okay
118:59 - so i've got an event i think this d is
119:00 - like
119:01 - no longer relevant here
119:05 - must have been so and let's look at this
119:07 - one
119:08 - um
119:10 - right it needs a subject
119:12 - how does it find the sub the subject is
119:16 - doing some kind of transform thing i
119:18 - don't want isn't there like um
119:26 - i think there's
119:32 - drag subject this is what i'm looking
119:34 - for
119:35 - which circle to drag
119:42 - drag subject
119:45 - choose the circle that is closest to the
119:47 - pointer for dragging
119:53 - i thought there was an automated way to
119:55 - do this in d3 that i've seen
120:03 - but let's look at this
120:05 - subject drag subject okay that's what
120:07 - i'm missing okay
120:13 - subject is null distance is constant
120:17 - n of nodes
120:23 - this is looking at the distance between
120:26 - the nodes x and y in the event if it's
120:28 - less than distance
120:30 - subject is that node
120:33 - so now
120:36 - so that's where the d goes
120:40 - the d gets filled in by the subject
120:43 - and so um
120:50 - let me just do these take these out for
120:52 - a second
120:53 - and so now if i were to say
120:56 - drag
121:00 - subject drag subject
121:03 - there we go it got long enough finally
121:06 - is this right call d3.drag
121:13 - subject drag subject okay let's see if
121:15 - this works
121:16 - this is so weird how d3 works
121:21 - max distance is not defined
121:27 - in drag subject
121:32 - let's make that infinity
121:34 - right that's the longest distance
121:41 - okay oh subject
121:43 - there's the subject okay
121:46 - so now
121:49 - i don't know what this is
121:53 - is it event
122:08 - what this fx is
122:26 - d is not defined
122:31 - so confused
122:39 - yeah where why is there a d in here and
122:41 - how come i don't have it and look at
122:43 - this one
122:44 - drag oh
122:55 - i guess i could do it this way
123:10 - okay
123:29 - like this
123:35 - oh wait a sec
123:37 - i'm getting something
123:38 - but i'm off by that weird offset
123:41 - so um
123:42 - [Music]
123:45 - where's the offset because i translated
123:48 - event dot x m plus width divided by two
123:54 - plus height divided by two is that
124:01 - no
124:05 - minus
124:12 - oh there we go
124:28 - sort of got this working but it's like
124:30 - it's losing it
124:32 - um
124:39 - i almost want to you start using the p5
124:42 - uh functions
124:44 - like
124:47 - um
124:52 - like if i have a active node
124:56 - and then i just do
124:58 - um
125:03 - okay well maybe i'm not going to get
125:04 - hung up on this so much
125:10 - maybe i won't get hung up on this so
125:11 - much
125:12 - because ultimately i just wanted to do
125:14 - this
125:18 - but it's losing it
125:23 - i kind of want to just put i want to put
125:24 - my own data in in it i'm looking at the
125:27 - i'm looking at the um
125:30 - chat see if i'm missing something
125:31 - obvious
125:33 - drag subject finds it
125:38 - return subject
125:41 - it should keep the subject
125:44 - all along until we say there's no
125:51 - no the event oh
125:55 - it's got all this stuff built into it
125:58 - hold on
126:00 - this one let me just look at this
126:02 - example again
126:07 - it's staying
126:09 - okay
126:10 - come skims call drag circles on
126:26 - interesting
126:34 - simon is saying i think you have messed
126:36 - up math
126:37 - the the
126:39 - this drag
126:44 - i guess i should think about this for
126:45 - real this is
126:54 - for all the nodes
126:58 - the event.x is
127:01 - the untranslated mousex mouse y
127:05 - so i need to subtract yeah no this is
127:07 - right
127:10 - this seems right to me
127:17 - yeah this is right
127:19 - i think you're i think simon is behind
127:21 - because that is where i messed it up
127:24 - um
127:25 - maybe something with the event active
127:28 - yeah when does drag ended get called
127:31 - let's take a look at this
127:38 - started dragging
127:44 - drag ended
127:57 - i don't see end
127:59 - it's so weird
128:05 - like what is going on
128:26 - right
128:53 - um
128:56 - so
129:00 - are you changing the drag subject when
129:02 - your cursor gets too close to another
129:04 - node but when is drag subject called
129:07 - let's let's
129:08 - that's actually a really great question
129:10 - i don't know when any of these things
129:11 - are called i'm sure it's all in the
129:12 - document documentation
129:19 - so let's just see here
129:21 - let's see when all these events happen
129:23 - it's 36.
129:27 - whoops
129:28 - this is what i was doing here
129:32 - okay so i'm going to click
129:34 - finding subject started
129:41 - so it's just finding the subject once
129:44 - i have a weird kind of idea
129:46 - which is i want to um just out of
129:49 - curiosity
129:52 - take this out for a second
129:55 - and what i want to do is call
130:00 - um
130:01 - [Music]
130:12 - i want to do this myself
130:15 - uh
130:16 - find subject
130:20 - so i'm going to say
130:22 - function mouse pressed
130:32 - um
130:34 - mouse x
130:36 - mouse y
130:39 - subject
130:40 - is dragged
130:43 - true
130:48 - uh acted
130:50 - dragged node i'm just doing this myself
130:53 - with p5 functions
130:55 - just for a second
130:58 - drag note find the subject
131:00 - set is dragged equal to true
131:04 - and
131:06 - i probably should do
131:08 - uh if dragged
131:11 - node i don't know what this does but
131:13 - let's
131:14 - let's put that in there
131:18 - take this out
131:19 - i probably should have done a commit so
131:21 - i could back up to this but
131:23 - and then i'm going to do
131:25 - a
131:25 - [Music]
131:27 - function mouse released
131:31 - dragged node is dragged false
131:35 - drag node
131:37 - is nothing
131:43 - and then what if i were to say
131:46 - uh in
131:49 - render here
131:51 - just
131:52 - if dragged node
131:54 - dragged node equals mouse x
131:58 - drag node equals mouse y dot x
132:06 - this is probably a terrible terrible
132:09 - idea
132:10 - and i didn't realize how much i was
132:11 - gonna end up undoing to do this
132:14 - um
132:21 - and
132:27 - okay
132:27 - this is promising
132:29 - i'm not finding the right subject
132:31 - because
132:39 - oh oh i see this has to be
132:43 - minus
132:48 - i have to have that offset
132:51 - there we go
132:54 - well this is better
133:00 - huh
133:01 - p5 for the win here
133:05 - okay so um
133:07 - i don't love that i just did this
133:09 - because
133:11 - i've basically disabled whatever
133:13 - automated
133:14 - d3 functionality
133:17 - like
133:18 - [Music]
133:20 - finding a node to drag
133:28 - oh
133:29 - it always finds the closest one
133:34 - but you know what i should do
133:36 - find the subject
133:38 - so it should also have to be okay hold
133:40 - on hold on
133:41 - uh let
133:42 - radius
133:44 - equal 10.
133:46 - so where am i drawing these things
133:49 - uh radius times two
133:52 - now
133:54 - this is finding the closest one
133:58 - but i should say if d is less than
134:00 - distance
134:02 - and
134:08 - d is less than the radius
134:14 - so now
134:16 - if i click here okay cannot set property
134:17 - is dragged of null
134:20 - i don't think i need that is dragged
134:27 - because i'm just finding it it's either
134:29 - null or setting it to null
134:31 - so clicking
134:33 - here it doesn't pick anything up but if
134:36 - i click here it does
134:38 - there we go
134:40 - so i'm finding the closest one
134:43 - that i clicked on
134:45 - and dragging it
134:49 - what does this
134:56 - oh wait a sec
134:57 - and i missed one thing
135:00 - which is
135:06 - um where's the dragging stuff
135:10 - here
135:22 - i don't know what this alpha target is
135:26 - this should be zero
135:33 - what is alpha target under simulation
135:35 - let's look at this alpha
135:38 - target
135:40 - restarts the simulation internal timer
135:42 - and returns the simulation combination
135:44 - with alpha target reheat the simulation
135:47 - during interaction such as when dragging
135:49 - a node or to resume the simulation after
135:52 - temporarily pausing it oh i see
135:55 - okay
135:56 - so
135:57 - um
136:05 - what
136:07 - what if i just took that out i'm just
136:09 - curious
136:11 - what if i didn't bother doing that
136:14 - if i find a node
136:23 - ah i see i think i need that
136:33 - okay
136:34 - so now i've got it where i'm dragging
136:35 - stuff around uh let me change the radius
136:39 - to four and and now the great thing is i
136:42 - can really start to
136:44 - um play with color to my heart's delight
136:48 - uh for example
136:50 - let me just grab a couple coding train
136:52 - colors
136:54 - and obviously there's a lot that i could
136:56 - do to make these nodes object oriented
137:00 - if i do this
137:04 - there we go
137:05 - oh my camera went off
137:23 - oh weird
137:25 - not sure what happened there
137:27 - okay so
137:29 - i'm i'm at one o'clock so i'm at my um
137:38 - i'm at my um
137:40 - and end here for today's live stream but
137:42 - i've made some pretty good progress here
137:43 - in understanding
137:45 - uh d3 uh this force
137:48 - thing and
137:49 - uh but i i wanna um
137:51 - i wanna use my own data
137:54 - so the idea and i'm gonna have to like
137:56 - this will have to be for another time
137:58 - how do i
138:02 - uh configure
138:04 - prettier sure
138:07 - yay okay
138:09 - so oh it has a radius in it and okay so
138:13 - this is using some data set
138:15 - um and i am going to
138:22 - delete basically almost
138:25 - the entire data set here
138:28 - oh hold on
138:29 - let's do before
138:30 - let's do uh
138:33 - youtube
138:34 - uh data
138:36 - so eventually i'm going to need to
138:40 - um
138:48 - oh my god this is so hard to figure out
138:50 - okay
138:53 - then links i just want two of these
139:02 - oh my goodness
139:04 - i want two nodes
139:15 - okay so i'm gonna make a node that's
139:17 - like um
139:22 - self-avoiding
139:23 - random walk i'm not going to worry about
139:25 - the groupings the radius
139:29 - um but it could be i could do something
139:31 - like views i suppose
139:36 - and then let's do one more let's do a
139:39 - couple more
139:40 - uh you know fractal tree
139:48 - uh and uh what's something else that
139:50 - i've done game of life
139:57 - okay then links are
140:01 - game of life
140:05 - to fractal tree
140:10 - uh has a
140:12 - a link with a strength of 10
140:14 - and then fractal tree
140:18 - is linked to
140:19 - self-avoiding random walk
140:27 - with a value of five
140:29 - okay
140:31 - so now if i go into sketch and change
140:34 - this to
140:36 - yt-data
140:40 - right these are just my three
140:43 - data points
140:45 - but i want to do a little bit more now
140:47 - i want to
140:53 - draw them with
140:55 - node
140:56 - views
140:58 - divided by 10.
141:01 - they're way too big divided by 100
141:04 - right so now
141:08 - oh in the ah i see so then the class
141:12 - clicking on it the find subject
141:17 - has to also
141:20 - oh so yes the node should have a radius
141:24 - i guess i could put that in the data oh
141:26 - but i could do that
141:30 - object.create
141:38 - um
141:44 - this is silly what i'm doing but
141:47 - could i make
141:50 - the radius
141:54 - what did i divide it by
141:58 - like could i give every node a radius
142:01 - this way
142:03 - and then
142:06 - i'm just drawing the radius based on its
142:09 - radius times two
142:15 - and then this would be n dot radius
142:23 - that didn't work
142:33 - game of life target radius n-a-n
142:37 - oh does this
142:39 - is this not coming in as a number
142:51 - oh value i'm in the links ah
142:55 - i'm in the links i want to be in the
142:57 - nodes
143:05 - i think there's like a lot of extra
143:06 - unnecessary stuff here
143:08 - but it's fine
143:10 - um
143:12 - can i read prop
143:17 - oh return return return
143:21 - okay
143:22 - so now each circle
143:25 - is representing
143:27 - the number of views
143:30 - and
143:30 - um
143:36 - i could have
143:39 - the stroke thickness
143:42 - be the link's
143:44 - value let's just make it the links value
143:48 - so if i go into my data
143:53 - like five
143:55 - two
143:58 - right so you can see and then
144:01 - this is really pretty wonky the way i'm
144:02 - doing this but i want to draw the nodes
144:05 - second for sure
144:07 - and then
144:08 - i want to say no stroke here
144:11 - and
144:15 - so we can see the thickness represents
144:17 - kind of the strength of its connection
144:19 - but
144:20 - i actually would like to
144:25 - there must be some properties for this
144:27 - force link thing
144:29 - i'm going to stop this in a second
144:35 - uh there was a documentation page i was
144:37 - on here
144:39 - force link
144:42 - force link
144:44 - source target index
144:47 - recomputes distance and
144:54 - strength distance ah
144:57 - return 30.
145:04 - so can i do something like distance
145:07 - 100
145:19 - uh
145:24 - wait where does this distance go
145:31 - yikes
145:35 - hold on what did i do i messed this up
145:48 - i chair creaks yes
145:51 - uh force i i have to stop
145:55 - but
145:56 - i must
146:02 - dot id dot distance
146:06 - 30.
146:11 - yes okay
146:16 - 130.
146:17 - there we go
146:19 - okay so that's like controlling the
146:21 - distance
146:23 - so that could also be related to
146:26 - um
146:30 - potentially
146:32 - the value times
146:35 - 10.
146:40 - oh
146:41 - d uh
146:43 - return value times 10
146:45 - right so
146:47 - but maybe so okay so i'm just figuring
146:49 - out how to control the distance
146:51 - and then i could also do like strength
146:57 - um
147:00 - also tied to that like value whoa
147:02 - [Music]
147:18 - so this is interesting anyway i don't
147:19 - have an idea for what i want this to
147:21 - look like yet
147:23 - but uh now
147:25 - um let me add
147:28 - just a little bit more
147:35 - data
147:36 - um
147:39 - hold on um
147:41 - what's another video
147:43 - um
147:45 - you know pi day
147:48 - and then
147:50 - let's say
147:54 - pi day
148:03 - pi day
148:07 - like fractal tree
148:10 - and then
148:15 - my day game of life self-avoiding walk
148:19 - fractal i just want to do two
148:24 - just going to separate these just out of
148:26 - curiosity
148:27 - okay
148:28 - so we can see here
148:32 - uh
148:33 - [Music]
148:38 - i'm not sure what i'm doing
148:40 - but i'm visualizing this data
148:43 - uh and then
148:45 - i think this is pretty much where i i
148:46 - mean obviously i need to get some real
148:48 - data in here to like play around with it
148:51 - but there was something that i wanted to
148:53 - try
148:55 - ah yes i know what i want last thing i
148:57 - want to try is just
148:59 - um okay
149:04 - so
149:07 - hover equals find subject
149:12 - nodes
149:14 - if hover
149:16 - then text
149:19 - hover dot
149:20 - id hover
149:23 - dot x plus
149:25 - plus hover dot radius
149:28 - plus 10
149:29 - hover dot y
149:32 - text align
149:33 - left
149:34 - center uh fill 255 no str
149:39 - what i'm trying to do is just see if can
149:40 - i reuse my fine subject
149:50 - um this is the last thing i'm going to
149:51 - do oh mousex mouse y is what i need to
149:54 - pass it
149:59 - to do a rollover basically
150:02 - and i don't think i need to call
150:05 - this
150:06 - i don't need to console.log finding
150:08 - subject anymore
150:10 - nope mouse is not defined
150:14 - oops mousex
150:19 - there we go
150:22 - um
150:24 - text size
150:26 - 60
150:27 - 32
150:31 - there we go
150:32 - see now again i have no thoughtfulness
150:35 - in terms of the design
150:38 - but now i can hover and see what it is
150:41 - they have a relationship
150:44 - a state analog says you sound burned out
150:46 - yeah this basically happens to me after
150:49 - once i get i'm way over my time so this
150:52 - is great i'm going to i mean if i don't
150:54 - say so myself i'm going to wrap up now
150:57 - of course uh
151:00 - uh
151:02 - starting with some dummy data
151:06 - plus canvas p5
151:09 - oh i don't have um so let me put this
151:12 - on github for anybody who wants to
151:15 - play around with it before i go
151:17 - i'm gonna start playing this outro music
151:22 - no i won't sign in
151:25 - [Music]
151:25 - [Applause]
151:37 - [Applause]
151:39 - [Music]
152:21 - okay so now
152:24 - if anybody wants to take a look at this
152:26 - um i will put this into
152:30 - um
152:31 - discord
152:34 - i forgot to set up discord
152:36 - [Music]
152:41 - have i done video youtube api videos
152:43 - before no but that's what i'm interested
152:45 - in pursuing a little bit this summer
152:48 - um
152:49 - i'm just trying to open up discord here
152:55 - coding train
152:59 - that
153:03 - okay
153:04 - so um this is the coding train discord
153:07 - um i just posted a link to it in the
153:10 - chat um this is where
153:12 - during the live streams i will
153:15 - um post things links to things i'm
153:17 - working on which is just this so now you
153:20 - have seen my um
153:23 - exploration of working with d3
153:26 - p5 and trying to create a force directed
153:29 - graph
153:30 - with the
153:32 - um d3 force module i got very
153:35 - i mean i felt like actually i got very
153:37 - far because i really understand a lot
153:39 - more about how this kind of works with
153:41 - e3 with my alarm's going off because i
153:43 - really have to go
153:45 - so um i hope everyone enjoyed this
153:48 - stream um play with this code join jump
153:52 - in the discord say hi there
153:54 - um you know i just want to uh thank once
153:57 - again as the timer is running out
153:59 - curiosity stream if you go to
154:00 - curiositystream
154:03 - codingtrain
154:04 - father's day is this weekend it's a nice
154:06 - gift um you'll get 41 off it's 11.79 for
154:10 - the entire year for both the curiosity

Cleaned transcript:

do so do do do do do do me test one two oh my god rushing around getting all the cables set up are you hearing me i hope you are i hope you are you're about to see me in three two one hello good morning happy friday on the coding train without fail as soon as i begin speaking gloria pickle my wonderful uh corgi beagle mix sleeping quietly right on the floor in front of me i start to talk loud she gets up goes downstairs runs away that's probably the appropriate reaction to me beginning to speak uh hopefully you are not all just getting up and running away though i would understand where i am in brooklyn new york it is absolutely a beautiful day outside um a little bit hard to motivate myself to get this stream started this morning but i'm here i'm doing it i'm gonna be here for about two hours and then i'm going to enjoy the rest of the beautiful day and hopefully the weekend um this marks a um really for me we're approaching the beginning of summer which is um my favorite season mostly because my uh day job work commitments are quite light and i can focus on um coding and other things too um let's see i am uh i finally i think you know it's been weeks and months of this live poll application which i think i finally have it down you hopefully are seeing above me you can scan this qr code to go and vote you can also go to um i posted this link into the chat let me do it again live dash poll dash coding dash train dot glitch dot me slash vote dash now how's that for url i'll put it right here into the chat if you go to that url you can vote and your vote will be registered immediately on this overlay in open broadcast studio this is a web application project that i began um i don't actually recall when although i could look at the github history uh let's see i've got it open here which i'm not bothering to show you this does it show me when the first commit was let's see there's been 103 commits and if i scroll all the way down older there's got to be a better way of doing this oh wait wait i can go to the i really should show you what i'm looking at okay hold on everybody let me show you what i'm looking at uh insights um and i think if we go to commits you can see that looks like i began this project in september of uh what year is it now 2021 i think it's right so a little less than a year ago probably september 2020 um and uh if i go here and look at contributors you can see that a bunch of people have added and various things um but um in particular uh foxy over here has been doing an incredible amount of work to build this live poll application um and here it is so and just in time just in time for me to finally have it my act together and have it up and running and the poll going before i begin to live stream just when i just when i'm there finally when i'm there youtube no no fanfare no announcement no no no no no just you couldn't let me know drop a little note in there in the email hey dan you're like a youtuber you have this channel it has like a million people subscribed to it even though not so many of those people even watch the videos but they seem to click that button we wanted to let you know about this new feature pulling embedded builtin polling in the live stream chat nope nope just noticed it this morning there's a new button i pressed it i made a poll and so i've got two polls going and if i look over here i can see the results of the builtin youtube poll maybe i can show that to you um which i'm feeling very sad about those results so i'm gonna have to put my finger on the scale here my thumb on the scale i believe is the expression um i'm opening my live stream page uh and here it is you're seeing you know yeah you know dan ception over here uh coding transception um this is the builtin poll which has 247 votes is that more than uh it is more than the 92 votes that i'm getting with my live poll application and uh well you know i don't know if this is really good use of polling or bad use of polling is the question i have to ask for you if anybody gets that reference but um um basically what i am looking at here is um that oh yeah so uh you know the people who are vote voting in this poll probably like the embedded poll so they're more likely to vote for the builtin youtube poll but folks if you're watching this right now and you have not yet voted in the embedded youtube poll you should absolutely um vote for the coding training live poll app because look look how beautiful it is look how much work went into it it even has does youtube have a qr code for their embedded poll i don't think so they just happen to have it in the page itself making it very convenient to vote enoch says please shader tutorial that is kind of coming and i'm thinking also an interesting discussion about d3 and p5 which i do want to address i have a very specific point of view about this um i forgot what i was talking about uh hi cat king hi eamon hi lokesh a high shadow cow whenever i forgot what i'm talking about what i'm gonna say i could just say hello to people in chat all right let's start with what is going on in coding train news there's no breaking news here but um well actually i should i should begin news to you this sunday father's day um and um i have a sponsor for today's live stream today's live stream is sponsored by curiosity stream the reason why i was thinking about father's day and curiosity stream is i am a father i love to watch documentaries i already have a curiosity stream account so i'm not asking anyone to get one for me but if you were looking for a gift for the father in your life or any family loved one you know father schmother kind of day you know this should just be like loved ones day friends day somebody you want to say you care about them day um and boy i've got some really serious uh video feedback stuff going on here um if you're looking for a gift i would really suggest curiositystream.com codingtrain the thing about it is it comes first of all it comes with nebula watch nebula which is a streaming service that i am a part of with a bunch of other youtubers and um they're running for father's day a 41 uh exclusive discount on the curiosity stream and nebula bundle so nebula by the way is like i forget three or four dollars a month something like that you're getting it for free for less um so with the discount it's 11.79 i'm reading off my notes here for the entire year and i'm gonna um come back later and show you some documentaries and curiosity stream that i would recommend and uh please i um get it for yourself or get it for the the loved one in your life as a gift and i've got to turn on my do not disturb notifications while live streaming is a really bad idea do not disturb is on all right so um wash your hat yeah oh you can really see how gross it is that's terrible i need a new hat you know i wear this hat all the time um and it's um it got i guess i was out in the rain i think that's really just like i don't know what that is like why there's that sort of orange well anyway let's fix that yeah is there some sort of ai machine learning model that i can use to fix my hat what just happened did we just break the live poll app oh no let's go back to here should refresh hmm oh boy this is not good okay hold on a sec everybody let's examine this what just happened here um i'm going to go up it's back ask and ye shall receive all right um so i um you know uh uh am well known for wasting a ton of time on live streams and not actually doing anything and i think i need to rectify that a little bit i mean there's there's a time for sort of goofing off and my rambling voice and reading random numbers and saying hello to people in the chat um but um yeah this is a great comment um what comes and legendary i'm just gonna call you legendary uh in the uh supporter uh discord here channel what comes between d3 and p5 n4 so somebody would create the n4 library um is that mug made to look upside down i don't know what's going on here i was trying to say something it's a very apt point because here i was just getting distracted and who knows what talking about but i would like to have two coding segments each live stream break in the middle as well as some regular segments like showing community contributions and i have a new regular segment which i will just begin with right now don't have a theme song for it let's try this one my new segment on the coding train live stream is reading your comments that's right i'm going to go through my recent videos from the coding train and take a look at some of the comments you the viewers have posted answer your questions comment on them enjoy them feel warm glow inside because of how happy you may be or who knows what we shall see and in the five minutes i spent preparing for today's live stream i went and found a few comments already that i wanted to take a look at um so um thanks again curiosity stream today's sponsor it's really good just like i when i'm like on i i guess i i really should be like do my sponsor segments when i'm supposed to be doing my sponsor segments but i just want to say like i subscribe to a lot of streaming services i always go right to the documentary section typically that's what i'm interested often and watching first curiosity stream this is all all documentaries i don't have to go to the documentary section it's subsections because of different kinds of documentaries um all right now all right so uh let's see let's look at today's a first comment first comment is on my recent um 5.2 seeking a target so first of all i wanted to say something about this a video so if you haven't watched it yet it's still time you could yeah you could probably watch it now and come back in 13 minutes and seven seconds and i'll still just be here like talking about like how there's a dot between views in june or something you won't have missed anything and to be honest who's who's watching my videos on 1x speed right you're at least on 1.5 it's intolerable to me to watch myself at 1x the recommended speed is 2x um that said um i there were several comments along the lines of wow this is exactly the same video as this one you released or you've covered this topic in at least four other videos all of that is true uh you know i am burdened with glorious purpose i'm traveling through time and space different variants of me you guys watching the loki show oh so good what is the path by the way from coding train to marvel i gotta figure that out i don't think i'm gonna it's gonna be a while before i get there probably never of course but i don't know does anybody have any ideas for me um some people are saying they watch it on uh 1x that's surprising to me anyway i was saying uh this is a variant i am a kind of going in a time loop redoing videos i don't know if this is so great i mean i do have my sort of like i have my material and that's kind of ran out of it and a lot of it's like old and the lower quality or i did in a different language um so um i um i i i wanted to redo this um specifically um and and really like have a recent welldone sequence tutorials from the nature of code so um you know most if you're watching the live stream uh it's possible that you're brand new but you're probably pretty familiar with my stuff but this is what i'm talking about so um i am just working through a lot of this is re content that i've covered before but i'm kind of covering it anew with whatever the latest version of the p5 library is today uh new thumbnail design a little bit higher production value additional examples a little more thoughtfulness in terms of the way the material is presented interestingly enough i have also gotten some comments it's generally skewed um the other way but i also get the comment of i miss uh or like this i don't like this style of video anymore i don't know how else to put it um i me you know my older videos have no editing not such great audio um and um no extra overlays or references or flying in examples or diagrams to illustrate a point so um i would like to be able to keep a balance of different kinds of styles of content i do think that authentic no editing just build a whole project from start to finish is very valuable but i do think for these tutorials i think they're improved with the new production style that said i'm not 100 sure about that it certainly is more takes longer to make it's more expensive to make and more involved to make but i would be certainly curious anecdotally to um here marcus says i would like if you would also hide the older videos so i'm i'm really loath to delete a video off of youtube i suppose i could make some older videos that this these have now replaced unlisted but generally speaking my approach is to leave everything as is where it is but kind of delink to it from playlists and other websites and material that i'm publishing because i always have like a syllabus or a book or a webpage or a blog post so then i will i will link an unnamed username who uh thank you thanks has helped me title the integration test uh stream um old ones was the one locus says that got me into your channel month on says love the new videos old ones are gold there's a lot of different comments here um so um but what was i saying ah so i just um deprecate essentially the older ones the the the canonical place if you're looking for the coding train cannon um the coding train cannon is here on the coding train website now there is a top secret not even close to tops here because i talk about it every stream uh project that is going on right now to completely redesign and rebuild the coding train website that will be launching probably sometime in the fall it will always be a kind of continuous incremental a project but a major facelift is happening and i'll talk more about that at some point soon um but this is where if you're looking for okay what are the sort of most recent uptodate recommended learning lists nature of code ml5 this is if i'm looking for like where do i begin like what could i watch where i need no experience whatsoever these three so um this is also where you know if i go i don't uh go to the coding challenge video i can find all of the code that goes along with every video uh running in the web editor i can see oh we have one we have an arnov arnov are you watching are you in the audience right now because we've now switched from going through your youtube comments which i haven't even gotten to the first comment yet to community contributions no record scratch stop i was doing my segment back to the segment i was doing 5.3 will be coming out soon i also want to thank this really shocked me because the um selfavoiding walk video the coding challenge videos tend to do fairly well youtube gives me lots of like gold stars and little confetti things like oh more viewers are watching your video than usual and then usually when i release one of my like tutorials that's in the middle of the sequence like oh no no viewers seem less interested maybe you should think about doing different content like youtube i i've got a thing i'm doing here you don't i mean just please be nice um but this one 5.2 i don't know it's not even 5.1 it seems to uh people are clicking on it and watching it so i'm quite um quite glad for that um right so diacron i want to address this comment diacron says i like the older style there's great value in seeing how the connections are made so even with so maybe i'm wrong about this maybe i'm i'm deluding myself but with the editing and added extra sort of visual information my goal is never to remove the interesting parts where i am struggling through or sorting through or figuring something out the only thing what i remove and and those of you who watch my recording sessions you can join as a coding trained member and i brought live stream the recording sessions um and if you join uh you can also go back and watch all the back catalog of them so i'd be curious here from those of you who watch those what your perspective is between watching those and what gets edited is you know um if i'm stuck on something for a long time it's not useful to have the video be an hour and 15 minutes so i try to like show the being stuck show the resolution if possible indicate the passage of time to get a sense of that relatable that relatable feeling but i think i could do still do more with that but um and the coding challenges i really it's really the intention the they're not like the tutorials in that i kind of know what the example is and i'm just kind of building and talking through it really more figuring it out anyway i don't need to go on and on about this we are at a segment my segment is reading your comments and i said about 10 minutes ago it was time for that segment and i opened the webpage was the first comment i was going to read and never even got to it so it's time for me to do that now and this first comment comes in from thomas shocker thank you for commenting on the coding train video so uh you know this is part of this is i want to do the point of the live streams is to have more kind of community interaction uh um with the viewers um and to sort of follow up on things that are in the video tutorials that are being published i also just maybe this will encourage people to comment because i do read all the comments and scan through them and i'm going to be trying to pick some out to highlight um on the stream so thomas asks our writes hi just watched your video thank you for all them thank you for saying thank you very nice and quick question why mag and i think that means set mag so the function is set the magnitude of the desired velocity to the maximum speed and not desired dot limit maximum speed well and there's a reply here i wondered the same thing if the target is close it doesn't need to go maximum speed towards it thank you rick for this it will still overshoot the target and oscillate back and forth the logic of arrive is needed to start allowing only have to avoid that but it will damp the oscillation so eventually stop on the target i think it is an improvement right so this is exactly the discussion to have a quick question why set mag and not limit there's no answer to that question the point of steering behaviors and autonomous agents as the coder as the designer of the system is to ask those questions what are the rules of the world that i'm building what are the desires of the characters in that world how is it that i expect and want them to behave and the definition if the definition of seeking a target is reach that target as fast as humanly or what's not human as fast as autonomously agentedly possible no matter how far or close you are the target could be right in front of my face and i just want to get there as fast as possible or it could be really far away and i just want to get there as fast as possible that is how i chose to define seeking a target in this particular video and it's not really how i chose because i'm basing all this work off of craig reynolds you know seminal paper steering behaviors for autonomous characters so with that definition set mag set the magnitude to maximum speed is always correct but you're right to point that out that the logic is sort of flawed because in a lot of cases maybe if you're getting close to something you don't want to be going so if you don't want to crash into it i mean it's very reasonable you want to be slowing down so the magnitude of your desired velocity shrinks the closer you get maybe after a certain point it's in the opposite direction maybe it's too perpendicular 90 degrees uh clockwise it's up to us to define how it is what the rules are for how these uh characters behave so in this case that's why i chose to use set setmag it's only on me if that was not clear although i i think this discussion is useful to have no matter how clear i might make it whether making it clear now um and um but you're absolutely right to wonder about this because in in i don't have these uh available for you to see yet but in 5.3 which will hopefully be released next week pursue evade are the behaviors i look at and in 5.4 i look at the arrival behavior arrive behavior and that really is um that's where limit but it's even it's even different than limit it's about um uh uh you know shrinking it according to distance um in a different way um does he know a python not really um i do not really know python but i would like to know it more um all right so that was that comment any other questions or comments about that how'd that go this is good i like this segment now we have another comment i think there's a point where i'm over using my theme music which isn't even my music by the way if you are a composer musician you do have somebody that i'm already working with need to reach out but i'm i'm looking to expand my musical selection next comment is from x nick this is also on 5.2 seeking a target x nick writes as always i love your content well x nick that is so nice to say i mean am i picking the ones that start with a nice compliment to myself no i really was looking for the ones with interesting things that i noted or highlighted but i do appreciate when they start with a nice compliment i'm just a human being who enjoys being complimented like anybody else the critical ones are actually uh constructive critical ones are very useful as well um um so thank you for those there's sometimes there's some mean meanish comments i'm very lucky and privileged to have an easy time on the internet relative to so many people who are much sort of worse targets for harassment i got no complaints here but you know be nice people one small nitpick detail for the character to be able to perceive its own velocity it has to be aware of its own coordinates in an absolute reference frame the canvas it would be more realistic for the character to use a relative reference frame when it perceives the relative motion where it perceives the relative motion of the target itself it would be more difficult to code yes but probably not that much difficult but perhaps more realistic so admittedly i'm not so sure i completely understand this comment i i i believe in this comment and i really appreciate it and i think if i were to rephrase it and and uh x nick i i i doubt that you're watching this right now but um if you are please chime into the chat or certainly be looking for um other oh x nick is there xnick i mean it's got to be the same it's gotta be the same x nick because you can only have one x nick on youtube you know there's no verified check mark speaking of which come on twitter i mean what's up what's a simple boy from baltimore maryland to do you gotta do to get verified on twitter i like going i'm gonna be 50 in a couple years how can i just be verified on twitter so i thought that's long i'm old tired why do i care about these things i don't know okay wait i was reading x6 comments so let me try to understand this i think um if i were to rephrase it what the vehicle is truly experiencing is not its own movement throughout this 2d world but everything in the 2d world movement relative to wherever it is so is it about thinking about the ways that i calculate the relative vectors always thinking of the vehicle's kind of core location as the origin point and its velocity essentially a zero and other velocities just being relative to its movement so i understand that conceptually but i feel like wouldn't the math ultimately end up being the same um i don't know um so to tell me wrong let's look at another oh i wrote the reply like oh there's a reply to this one good i think i wrote oh this is such an interesting point thank you um yeah because i i'm thinking about it um let's let's give this comment a heart um and there's some other lovely comments here uh from from uh monsieur alexander gulbu and vatula 64. uh so right now i'm just reading random comments that's not the point prepared comments um so i don't know i'm i'm looking to see if there's any further elaboration in the chat but i need to think about this one more but i really appreciate that comment and i i think that in the end uh for me this would be like a thought experiment exercise as part of my tutorials and material because i do think it adds a layer of complexity um it's not that it's unnecessary but that goes beyond where the way that i want to present the content um uh okay um sorry i'm reading the chat and sometimes interesting discussions are coming up but not discussions that make sense for me to refer to okay um moving on i have one more comment this is from the coding challenge 162 which will be a nice segue into looking at arnov's community contribution this year alexandra goldberg is here all right hold on i'm gonna address your comment therefore i think if i go back to here will i find it come on come on internet did the internet i mean the internet didn't break because you are hearing me if you are hearing me the internet is still working i love nothing makes me happier by the way than interacting with comments or community contributions or various things that people have contributed to the coding train and then seeing that person appear in the chat and i don't know why i'm not able to get this page to load i'm going to just take out the highlighted comment from the url seriously wow did youtube go down and uh did i just go through some kind of um time door for the time keepers on to me are they shutting me down are they pruning am i being pruned oh no which variant am i am i the sacred one i don't know youtube what happened to you okay i'm not gonna oh there we go i don't know what's going on um as you were for a second here i seem to be back 5.2 um all right let's take a look at monsieur alexander gulbu's comment since uh uh monsieur alexander gulbu is in the chat i'm very upset that your latest videos do not gain the deserved number of views likes comments ah again thank you thank you i think they do i think they get the deserved number of views likes comments either youtube algorithms are choking you it's a kind of a harsh way to put it or something else i think actually now i'm realizing i kind of addressed this earlier um so i really struggle with uh having a youtube channel with i think you know the term for this is evergreen content i mean it's not so evergreen because technology changes so rapidly but this video 5.2 isn't something that somebody urgently needs to watch or is about the events of the day or like a hot take on the new apple product that came out or whatever again no criticism that's what those are basically like the videos i like watching hot takes on new apple products um but i do think it's true the the youtube algorithm is not kind to people who want to release sequential tutorials and i have often thought about uh separating out into different channels but and kind of focusing on like a sort of like monthly or biweekly coding challenge project video that would sort of you know drive a particular chat but i don't honestly i don't have time to deal with that i'm just making the stuff that i make and enjoying the word but i suppose um i shouldn't be going on and on about this but i do appreciate that thought and i do think about it a lot and look at my analytics a lot i probably should just shut all that stuff off and not worry about it but you know i think if you for those of you when you share something with somebody else or that you made or you recommend watch this beginner playlist to learn to code that's a way that you can contribute and give back if you do enjoy the content and feel like uh more people should find it um but there's also you know there's lots of other people in this world making amazing tutorials and projects and coding so recommend those other people too please all right um what was the comment i was on selfavoiding walk oh this one is super interesting so one of the things i really struggled with in the selfavoiding walk was um thinking about um what is sort of the big o notation what is the algorithmic complexity the run time of an algorithm to find through brute force randomness and brute force brute force uh a self of i'm looking for um you know what does a selfavoiding walk look like a selfavoiding walk that spill that fills an entire uh twodimensional or could be threedimensional any dimensional space and um i sort of said informally it was sort of like a quick thought in the video uh it was n squared because it's n by n so there's n squared um you know spots in the twodimensional space and then at every spot it's got some number of neighbors so it has to try all these others and then each one of those i was like n squared factorial or something which i don't think and then i was like looking at some papers it was like there's no known way to quantify it but this is a pretty interesting comment that i will try to that i will read now there is an easy upper boundary of number of boy there's variance with this too variants for backtracking any valid walk is a starting point plus sequence of letters up down left right of length w times h or that's n squared minus one where w h is within height thus straight ahead you can say that backtracking will do less than w times h times 4 to the power of w times h minus 1 which is much less than n squared factorial that kind that's making sense to me right it's the maximum number from any place that you are of backtracking steps that you would have to take totally makes sense right there are only four possible ways so four to the power of how many backtracking steps which is much less next it's an easy to notice that after each letter there's exactly one forbidden letter after up you can't have down after l you can't r so for any place for fixed letters there are only three options okay therefore upper bound is w times h times four times three to the power of w times h minus two similarly in the end there's exactly one spot missing and the last two steps exactly two spots missing so upper bound but i think sometimes with the big o notation we're talking about a kind of average run time or worst case run time so i'm not sure how relevant that is but this is interesting w times h times 4 times 3 to the power of okay so in my do macintosh computers have calculators on them apparently they do uh can i make this like a science you funny you think i would know this uh scientific let's look at this okay so w times h uh let's oh i want to get this comment up uh here we go okay w times h times four is 64 times four um three like hold on three to the power of how do i do this three to the power of 62 here's a big number times what did we say 64 times 4. okay still a pretty big number but a lot less than the factorial yeah i xnick says i use the google search bar instead of the calculator i usually do too i don't know why i just decided not to this moment all right thank you for these comments um i really appreciate them um i hope to make this a regular part of live streams uh picking out and looking at a select group of comments on recent videos to address them answer questions i also would now if you have a thought about this i would definitely encourage you to come right onto the youtube page for the video and reply right there i've kind of got these noted so i'm i'm kind of interested to follow along the discussion and of course i always have to plug the discord which i should have a button here uh which will post a link to the coding trade discord in the chat all right it's 11 30. remember how i said i was gonna have i want to have two coding segments yeah i think i'll probably um do community contributions uh talk about the sponsor curiosity stream and then take a short break and come back and explore um what looks most likely to be p5 with d3 and i will address the comment which is that um i've seen something um so d3 and you know i'm going to come back to this i'll come back to this later i want to talk about why i want to use p5 and d3 together which again i'm not suggesting is the most appropriate or efficient or ultimate uh uh meaningful path for you the viewer to follow but it is of great interest to me for a few particular reasons which i will come to okay now it's time for the moment on the coding train where i share community contributions things that you have made um and um today what i would like to do is look at two the two recent videos that i published since the last live stream or within the last couple weeks so let's go to the coding train website um and let's go to selfavoiding walk all right so um this is the first community contribution thank you arnov to the selfavoiding random walk i'm really expecting there to be more i mean especially that 3d one with the rainbow colors so many possible visual variations that i think you the creative people of the internet could make make your little gift loop make your little video etc um but there's only one so far so um i encourage you please submit um you know you don't don't be shy you change just even a little something it will bring me so much joy to see what it is that you thought to apply um if you just got it running on your own computer and you want to document that share a link to your documentation of that ah it will make me happy there is no threshold for what you need to do to submit your community contribution all right so random walk with random colors random alpha and random size whoops so just as a reminder um let me look at oops sorry everybody oh sometimes and here i am about to sneeze about why did the internet break for me today what's going on on my computer like seriously okay to the challenge um i wanted to show just this as a reminder this is the example that uh i build in the coding challenge video so you can see it is a random walk i know i know i'm repeating myself but i always like to set context sort of assume that not everybody has like watched every video or every live stream and what is going on here is a entity is making random decisions to move left right up or down in this grid pattern every frame of animation and if it has been somewhere before it can't go there again and if it gets stuck where it has no options where to go it backtracks and tries a different direction and you can see here how it is getting sort of stuck in the corner fairly quickly which is a pretty typical result i thought actually in the version that i released that i changed it to um starting in the middle which i definitely prefer because it kind of has more room to sort of find its way around uh various parts without getting stuck as quickly so anyway i prefer that okay so um i um oh look this is a great question in the chat okay so so people are asking about the community contributions wonderful okay could you first of all exnick says could use d3 to display info about youtube videos exactly this is what i'm looking to do got a plan i will talk about it um where's the coding terrain community contribution tab again okay i will come to that hey da how you best hey dan if i use a lot of your videos to build something cool where should i contribute it that's a great question i don't actually i don't know so um what i would suggest um and maybe some of the mods moderators and folks who help manage the website will run away in here um i would pick one of the videos and just submit it to that one maybe like whichever one's the most recent one um and then just in your documentation you know whether it's you're linking to a uh whether it's just in the code comments or a blog post or a video or whatever just include more context and information uh about the different videos you drew from because that's interesting for me at least personally to know i wouldn't get too hung up on about it just submit it um we'll help you figure it out if it's in the wrong place um you could submit it in multiple places but i think i would prefer not to have that because i think that new systems we're trying to build hopefully will it wouldn't make sense to do that um and uh hamiltonian cycle i keep keep hearing about that i do want to do that um but um let me just address the question and chris is asking if any plans for react angular view no no plans kind of not really a frontend web development channel person thing i mean i'd love to do all this stuff but i i want to stay in my lane of kind of creative exploration of algorithms and graphics and interactivity you know i do serverside stuff and databases and apis but that's in many ways uh uh tools to further explore the sort of creative and nothing you can't be creative with reactiveview i mean it's just um quick prototyping maybe that's more what i'm trying to say i don't know i don't know how to answer that question so if you're looking to contribute basically on every page um there should be a link here uh add your own version it just takes you to and i don't know why it's asking me to sign into github and twofactor it's going to take you to uh an editing a file that you uh if you add your your metadata for your project into that file following the format um which isn't really selfexplanatory but if you go here under see how i have a little video that walks you through it and some extra information here most of the time it is so it'll show up here under coding train website uh pull work website and then if i go to pull requests um you know if i go to closed we can see um did i just get a new member or something i'm getting some flashing lights um um if you go here game of life community contribution like we can look at this one um you'll see this is how it works um and if we look here and see like files changed um you can see this is what um adiads added with the url and their url and source and it's um and thank you luis for your very generous and kind super chat hello to you in brazil um yes and there's coding garden for angular react view stuff so um anyway don't be alarmed if after you submit it you get a big red x of like it failed we have tests to check that the syntax is right we will swoop in i say we myself or uh grueselhouse is uh really takes a lot of thank you so much to nico does a ton of work uh managing these emerging these pull requests we'll swoop in to help you sort that out um but let's take a look i know i know i want to go to r knobs but since i'm here this also i really really appreciate this when in addition to submitting it to the website just in the comment on github you put a link to it because i like to review them sometimes before they get merged um and um and and so on and so forth and and thank you stig for your comment about me looking at comments agreed and i only want to do more of that okay so let's take a look at aditya's game of life coding um uh variation so okay so a couple things i like about this one is i believe uh well let me do it again so there's some uh additional thoughtfulness in terms of the visual design so um and i want to get the name correct um aditya has made some efforts to think about color um i like this soft blue one thing that you do want to consider i think is in sort of thinking about accessibility when you build stuff for the web is color contrast so i might be concerned that the contrast of these characters to the background is a little bit too light and contrast checker you can find these uh web content accessibility guidelines contrast checkers um to sort of see if um your the contrast ratio of your background and foreground meet certain minimum requirements for everybody to be able to read so that's one just a comment that i would have otherwise i find this color scheme to be quite beautiful i like the fact that okay well this is pretty awesome that i'm able to draw in my own cells and then hit run oh my god oh my god none of you heard that did you it was incredibly loud in my ear uh i'm gonna let you hear that but i'm gonna warn you to turn down your headphones i'm gonna turn the sound on and then i'm going to um let's set it to 50 so this is software i use called loopback to route the audio to the stream uh i don't have a physical mixer which would be nice to have uh maybe they'll upgrade someday so um let's see so when as soon as i hit this play button which i'm about to do now i'll count you down it started to play some sound three two one go okay so whatever the pattern i had before had a much more louder static so i think it's like somehow interpreting the changing state of the cells to tones so like adjusting the frequency i don't know whether it's using like envelope sound envelopes and changing the sort of attack or the decay that i was not aware was about to happen um this is called um oh no it just doesn't just yeah so one thing by the way is i would love more explanation so i this is amazing that there's a whole like interface here i can actually change the color for myself so there we go i can adjust the contrast perhaps that way i can have a delay i can mute the audio it shows me like the sort of population of how much um is and there's pause and what's this a library oh my god can i oh i thought maybe i could like drag these on so this is cool it's showing me the library of like things that happen in the game of life that is why i love all these interface elements i don't know what this does but for me what i would love to have here as somebody totally new is and i don't think you need to necessarily pollute this page like if you want the sort of design of this page to be minimal so certainly like a button that brings up a modal overlay that has an explanation or a separate documentation post where then you could sort of click about this sketch or something but i would really want i really want to understand more about one how is it i'm expected to interact and that could be you could say i don't want to tell you how it works i want you to experience this page without knowing and explore and discover on your own but i would at least like to know that that's your point of view um so um but this is really wonderful work and i'm actually thrilled that this is um um being shown um shown i wanna um see if i can pull something up something really interesting happens periodically with my videos and i'm just going into my analytics right now and i want to show you something just give me a second um no i don't want the real time shoot sorry i'm gonna get there i think this is interesting little inside baseball about how weird stuff that happens on youtube this is a video from 2017 and i'm just going to show you its views i'll see more and i'm going to do last 365 days so uh i don't think i am giving away uh giving away any proprietary information here i'm just looking before i show it to you let's see here talk amongst yourselves for a second i'm having trouble controlling my computer come on there we go there we go okay this is exactly what i want to show you here comes three two one so this is interesting because this is the uh these are the views a graph of the views for the last year of the game of life video so like what happened so it's like pretty normal like it gets like a few hundred views per day it's an old video you know there's some variation on one day there's like a little peak here where like 600 people watched it or whatever but then look at this all of a sudden recently the only thing i can think of is that veritasium which is quite a huge um youtube channel um recently released a video which made heavy references to the game of life and i was trying to think like oh maybe but but i looked through and like referrals and that kind of thing i couldn't find any other evidence to that but i do think this kind of this happens um periodically that certain older videos just start getting recommended and they kind of take off and um yes sadly john conway who invented the game of life um uh passed away last year due to covid um um but anyway i'm fascinated by this if anybody uh understands why and how this happens it usually comes and then it just like leaves like it'll be back within a week it'll be back to just this like little trickling a few hundred views per day um i think uh just to show you the full um lifetime since uploaded you can see here it's still a piddling like this is a huge sudden bump right here in this particular video right now but it still is relative to when it was first released right where you can see um you know where it was first released it had something like you know 11 000 views in one day but um it was de and chris is saying it was definitely derek's video that caused it okay um so that's good i should do it a little deeper dive and see but that's kind of interesting to note and and yeah um but um anyway if you haven't watched this one i think this is a pretty interesting example lots of stuff you could do with it and please contribute your community contribution now um let me close that out and go back to uh where i really was which was uh i was about to look at arnov's uh random walk with random colors random alpha and random size so you know basically you want your community contribution to be featured submit it to the most recent video because uh there's not a lot coming in and i get to look at them every week and i'll get back to looking at random ones already okay uh let me let's take a look at this i haven't actually looked at this one yet oh i love this i love this so random colors and random alpha so we're seeing i can't to me i don't think so this i don't think this is there's nothing i'm not saying this that there's something wrong with this but just to be clear i don't believe this is a selfavoiding walk i believe this is a based off of like this for the first example in that video where i start to just look at how i might visualize the history of how many times uh the walker has landed in a given spot i just do that through alpha here we're seeing sort of color and size um it does does feel to me like i wonder part of me wonders if we there might be some more um compelling or meaningful um results if instead of using randomness for how you draw the circles in the colors that's actually tied to some data of the system so for me one of the things i like about the thinking about the random walk is the thing that's random is the step it chooses to take but what if that you had a constraint that was the only thing you were allowed to have randa and every other way you choose to draw whether it's shape color size speed etc um has to come from some other logic and that that i think is actually you know today's session being something about data visualization i think is really important to consider we as human beings are looking for patterns and to describe meaning so i'm really just here trying to understand this and thinking green means something or pink means something so i think as an exerciser just constrain to yourself how could you you know is there's an irony here i suppose of me talking about this as a person who you know favorite book is a book of random numbers and reads from it regularly but randomness can be used as a crutch i think in design so uh it's a it's a tool and it can be used with great uh to achieve great wonder and beauty but also it can be overused or maybe maybe there's some sweet spot in the middle of him kind of controlled randomness or thinking about probability that also um and i i think a good example of this is like stochastic fractals or fractals that have this very highly regular order but some amount of randomness sprinkled into them okay so um but thank you for this arnov it's quite beautiful um i could really imagine this just being like a beautiful print um there's a lot of um you know nice background a large scale public projection lots of possibilities there thank you so much for sharing this okay guess what everybody um so um i want to take a moment before i take a a break and come back with the uh looking at some data visualization code in today's live stream and thank today's sponsor curiosity stream i'm going to play a quick ad for you from curiositystream from the founder of discovery channel comes a new independent streaming service so i i've talked about this before um many times a curiosity stream is a regular sponsor of the coding train it's one of my uh favorite sponsors they're all my favorite sponsors but boy actually well i really do love curious dream especially because um i happen to be part of a group of educational youtubers who are building something called nebula and you can find that at watchnebula.com which i'm just going to pull up here this is a streaming service service that has and i'm just going to go here under videos um it has a why oh boy i really gotta check this one from mike boyd um this week i learned to spin a baseball bat oh i'm so i know what i'm doing this afternoon um you can see uh probably some of your hopefully some of your favorites here um you know if you're looking for a way to like a subset of videos you might be interested in that are all you know a lot of this content is on youtube and nebula there's lots of nebula plus content um i would highly recommend you go check out watch network.com why am i talking about this curiosity stream which is a streaming service um for um uh documentaries nebula is a partnering with curiosity stream um nebula has adfree content experiments with all different kinds of content that actually has nebula originals tom scott's money is a really wonderful one so curiosity stream loves educational creators and supporting more educational content so uh nebula we worked out a deal with if you sign up at that coding train link curiositystream.com codingtrain not only do you get access for the entire year to curiositystream but you get nebula for free not a trial you will always have nebula as long as you're a curiosity stream member so my script here says for a limited time curiosity stream is offering a 26 discount but that's what my script says that's not actually the discount the discount is higher than that it's 41 special father's day again i can't think don't buy it for me i already have it um but if i wanted my kids to get me they're too young they can't buy stuff themselves but they could tell their mom or friend's parent or grandparent to buy it for me to get a father's day gift i would want this gift and so you can get it for 41 off that's 11.79 that's less than 12 for the whole year it's like you know if you want to subscribe to the coding train membership thing that's way more than that so i hope you will consider um it helps me uh helps me out a little bit uh if you do choose to sign up it supports my channel um and so go to the link in the description um yeah oh but let me let's just i do want to um just take a minute here i have um a little text file where i was like keeping track of a bunch of my recommended documentaries that i think some of them are just things that i love like the secret lives of big cats and um there's actually a new one new curacao stream original it's about you know i'm kind of like a pet rescue person or my family is we have a lot of we have a foster cat we foster dogs but it's things called doug saves the world i'm going to get the name wrong but there's a new uh crusty stream original about um uh a drone pilot who rescues um animals but really i think probably escher's infinite perspective uh the magic numbers and uh and the joy of data these are there's a lot of documentary content that i think you would find inspirational for um that would be of interest to you but i just wanna let's just click on um uh uh i think you know if you're interested if you like the history of computing which is definitely a thing that i'm interested in also like um and you can see calculating ada the countess of computing and of course here's uh dr um hannah fry who is a host of a lot of the videos who's a really incredible science communicator nature's mathematics all about fractals let's look at um escher's infinite perspective um you know i can kind of like scroll through a little bit of this that you can see like the escher stuff is really amazing uh pleasure that mystified everyone for generations are you hearing that audio drawing with a hidden meaning yeah oh my accessible only so anyway this is like a library i mean the library of content here is incredible so i i gotta watch myself go on for too long about this uh i went way off script this time but uh hopefully you'll consider it uh again it's a 41 discount it's this weekend only for father's day um by the way you you're not seeing it on the banner here but um it says on the website it says 40 off if you go to my coding train link it's 41 off one percent better uh and also uh help support the coding train channel okay so i'm gonna take a break you got nothing else to do go to curiositystream.com codingtrain uh sign up i'll be back in about five minutes to explore uh visualizing data with p with d3 in particular i wanna look at their uh forcedirected force uh the the features of the api that allow you to do force directed graph so i'll talk about what that is and i'll be back in less than five minutes so do so do do and i am back okay so um it's time to actually do some coding thank you all for your patience um so one of the things that i'm interested in doing um in the future is building a map of all of my youtube videos and let me switch over here and thanks again to curiositystream for sponsoring today's coding train episode um i'm going to look for d3 force directed graph it's going to take me to an observable notebook page and this is the example that i'm looking at so this is using a particular data set from the les miserables story um and it's visualizing connections between different characters i will probably today i might even just use that data set just to have something um that i can you know pair it i would like to basically make this exact example but i want to change the drawing mechanism um and use p5.js to do the drawing and i'll talk about why for a second so a couple things um one is um i have um some examples of forcedirected graphs um using um different physics libraries i think i've tried it with matter.js and with toxiclips.js um but um i find that one of the things that i really struggle with is keeping any sense of kind of stability within the system and i've been looking at some of the d3 examples in particular i'm actually a little bit more interested in this disconnected graph so maybe this is actually the one that i should start with um i've been really sort of impressed with the sort of stability and physics of these systems and i would like to be able to play around with them however um i'm not i'm you know i certainly uh these examples are both using svg and d3 has a particular module built into it and i think simon pointed this out that d3 has a lot of hooks into drawing already you can create an svg and there's some advantages using svgs rather than canvas and you can um build and design the svg um um and you can sort of see things that might look familiar to you like line and stroke and stroke opacity very sort of p5 drawing like so that's great nothing wrong with that approach i'm interested in learning that approach too but i think a way for me to understand more about how d3 works is to pair it with something that i know really well like p5 and i do know that d3 also uh renders to canvas um these are you know probably these are probably pretty old articles like 2017 actually not that um so d3 also works with canvas and we can see things like you can create a container and then you can say canvas d3 select that container and append a canvas and then you can uh call various uh canvas drawing functions to bind the data um so this all you don't need p5 at all but i would like to explore this um in just to experiment to learn a little bit about d3 there's also a wonderful resource um p5d3 cookbook um which um um i don't know i forgot who created this but i definitely refer to it on multiple occasions which kind of looks at um pairing p5 and d3 and i would say that when i look at the when i've looked at d3 canvas examples with canvas ultimately what i want to do with p5 is nothing different than what they're already doing they're just using native canvas functions and tying them to d3 i just want to use the p5 canvas functions and tie them to d3 and see what happens okay change the stream title i probably should not the best seo but you know i can't can't help but like go with a meme all right let's figure out here how i want to do this i think actually interestingly enough let me try to just recreate this exact example with p5 drawing in canvas instead of but use d3 for the data parsing and the force layout and i'm going to look at this is going to be a very important page for me to look at um the various documentation for all the force stuff um so first thing i need to do oh boy one of these days i'll learn about all this like fancy new javascript way of doing things but let's just get d3 how to um d3 cdn i'll look for um is this what i want d37 oh boy oh boy it's been a while since i looked at d3 so the first thing i need to do is i already have the most recent version of p5 referenced in my index.html and i'm working outside of any online web code editor right now just to sort of manage things and now i am referring to d3 and i think if i just say console log d3 console log p5 i should see that both libraries have been loaded and p5 is loaded and d3 is loaded okay great so step one i've got about 45 minutes here to make this happen step one i have both p5 and d3 loaded now one thing that i almost just want to do before i even get to canvas is just unobservable this is maybe a terrible thing that i'm doing and my deepest and sincerest apologies to mike postock right now but uh observable notebooks which is this sort of like web editor webbased framework for writing javascript and in particular used for a lot of d3 examples um i find uh is i'm not used to it and it has some of its own sort of ways that it works so i want to unobservable this to just make it a regular uh sketch so i'm going to first grab all of this code and then i'm going to un take out all of the um what am i saying i'm going to take out all of the svg stuff after that okay all right so i've got all this code here uh but what i don't have is the data so the data is oh interesting file attachment graph.json oh there's a file here how do i get that file or do i just copy this oh can i download this run cell oh boy can i oh look at this can i get this data somehow add embed download json oh perfect okay i've got the data let's bring it in here hit save hey how come my formatting isn't working is did i turn off format on save oh never one of these days ah format on save all right what happened to all my beautification stuff i'm not gonna worry about that right now let's use preload data.json and then start simulation i'm going to create a function just call it start simulation put all this stuff in that and then i'm gonna say start simulation here and i'm actually gonna say no canvas right now like i'm not using p5 for anything other than just like loading the json and calling this initial um like set of code that's all d3 stuff that i got from this observable page um i guess i need this drag function as well let's let's grab that and let's just um just to make this more i mean i like using the arrow stuff but just for right now let's just do this okay so i think maybe i've gotten everything [Laughter] yeah and stig is asking wouldn't you be able to make a forcedirected graph armed with your knowledge from your physics videos springs attraction yeah so i've done that um and i do want to do that and i did actually include that even i should have maybe i should have done from scratch or sort of like um in my sort of poll from today i did address this earlier um but i i'm just really i kind of wanted to explore i just really love this particular example and want to see um if i can integrate how it works integrate it but yes um there's you know the other library i'm really interested in looking at is um this particular library which also has a lot of network graph kind of stuff world cup network so i'm just kind of interested in seeing what's out there okay uh uncaught invalidation is not defined all right what is this i don't think i need this right now i don't need to stop this simulation anytime um okay color was expecting color okay so it's calling some color function which i probably forgot to get from the observable notebook yeah there's also a color function this is confusing to me and i'm messing up the p5 color i think this should actually be this right so i'm just turning this into a generic function for color which it's really not going to like because that's a p5 function uh p5 and problems creating okay p5 colors where where uh this is just a bunch of like hold on sometimes these warnings cause me more trouble than they help me so i think i'm just going to go to the p5 minified version which takes those out okay so let's see here um so what i want to do now is look at let's make sure the data is there okay i've got the data links and nodes so that's promising create the simulation create the svg oh you know what i bet you width and height are not set all right let's look at is did the svg get created this is strange um so created this svg why do i not see it 600 600 create a attribute oh does it do i have to like add it to the dom somehow just wondering if the simulation is even running so this is like a update function like the draw loop so the simulation is running that's promising um four simulation nodes oh you know what i think i lost no no no data link hold on let's make sure this worked the way it was supposed to okay so i'm getting all of the nodes oh they have a location and a velocity so they're there how come i don't see them oh i bet you i've messed up the color stuff let me take out this color thing for a second is that not called drag that's the only place okay all right why do i not see the svg is that something i need to do no oh i'm so confused the funny thing is i don't even care about using the svg so maybe i should just quit that because i'm about to be i was going to do all this with canva cam document.body append child but where's the svg how do you add uh d3 add svg to dom d3 select body append svg is that in did i just miss that and it's actually in this d3 select body append svg okay i see an svg can i append this svg uh i'm so confused so now i have an svg the function you copied returns the svg for adding to the dom i know so why can't i add it hold on return svg.oh return svg.node oh like that select append this is so funny that i'm stuck on this like tiny little thing here uh there we go boom okay that was rough okay i got it so what i did was i selected the body and appended the svg there then made that svg the thing that i'm adding all the stuff to i'm not really sure what i did but the point of this is i just wanted to get it up on the screen i'm going to undo all the svg stuff but i wanted to make sure i had it and i want to get rid of some of my console log stuff because i actually think i'm going to simplify it greatly and by the way let me just put this color thing back just curious if um i think i want to probably not use this i'll call it color d3 let's call this uh color d3 let's see if that works uh why am i not getting color okay i'm not going to worry about the color thing that's not my concern simplify okay so now now here we go so what i would like to do and i'm also just gonna like comment out this drag thing i'm gonna definitely need to deal with that at some point but i'm going to look at this so basically what's happening is i'm taking all of the data this data is a whole lot of nodes and links the nodes are the circles the links are the connections and basically i'm creating a force simulation out of all those node objects the force is a link between them based on linking their ids to ids there is a charge force which is the um i'm assuming is kind of like the overall many body well let's just see that must be what's sort of like keeping them from not overlapping oh yeah drag is not defined okay let's put the drag back just for right now let's look at these different forces right so that is like a repulsion force like they've got the force linking them that springy force but they don't have um they don't have the charge force which would be now they're all spread out and then um this is interesting this is like basically a force i think keeping keeping it all like clustered like if i take this out everything's just gonna like fly away because they're pushing each other away and nothing like holding it to the center right you can see everything's flying away um so i think you know this is really just like zero zero i think it's the equivalent of that no what did i do okay so what is oh oh no no this is a force x the d that's this is a function that's having every x be pulled to the center right so that's you'll you'll see like if i do like negative 100 watch this whole graph is going to shift over see because that's the like this is setting that like center force so that's kind of important um and then the link right if i just take this link out now none of them are linked so it's just uh like perfectly oh i really kind of love this like everything is like the charge force is spreading everything out but everything is also being kept within the sort of constraints of the svg shape so i want the link back because eventually i want to do this with my own data that's sort of the point but just going to keep this data um okay so we're good so uh everybody um well hold on let's do um whoops um how do i do that thing where i do get branch uh fine let's do this no not on github well fine i know how to do this just okay oops no there we go so i'm gonna just do um we'll make like just like a little change here uh how do you set a tag working working d3 uh port of d3 observable notebook okay so now at least whenever i put this anywhere in the git history you will be able to find this version of it with all the svg stuff i want to now and i have a width and height of 600 let's just just see will it like work whoa what the i think i did something wrong about the size i shouldn't really be too can i do this i don't okay i'm not gonna worry about i'm gonna create the canvas so uh let me do create canvas with height and actually those are now going to be global p5 variables set by create canvas background zero okay so now i've got a canvas and i've got the svg below it what i want to do is reproduce this exact drawing in the canvas and then i'll delete all the svg stuff so function draw um basically the nodes have let's look at the nodes oh okay so these i'm going to need these to be global variables thank you very much how do how to make good code worse okay so the nodes each one has an x and y great so i should be able to now just say 4 let node of nodes circle node.x node.y 10. okay that's promising background zero now ah so the center is on a p5 canvas at the top left so i guess i will just say translate oh boy all of my vs code settings seem to have disappeared great okay so this is promising now i just need to do the same thing with all the links let link of links stroke 255 line oh yeah i don't know what the links look like how do i find the two nodes that they're connected to the links are all index oh a source and a target so it looks like the source is the source node and the target is the target node okay that should work uh link dot can i do this can i destructure this object and then say source.x source.y target.x target.y okay there we go all right this is very promising oh i like this okay guess what now guess what i get to do now oh it makes so much simpler um i don't need any of this svg stuff all i'm doing is to start the simulation is load the data and this is very silly like the data is just in a thing that has links and nodes and this is just pulling the data out to be in separate links and nodes so this could maybe be rethought a little bit like when i put my own data in there i might do something different set up all the forces and then now this is interesting i do think oh i do need this tick because what it's doing is for every update of the animation this doesn't is this something forever how does it know what link and node are here for every update of the animation what is link and node this is so weird this must be some magic that happens in the background node is not defined what the okay oh wait a sec was this something oh was oh this was because oh this was because this is the svg stuff okay i don't need this yeah this is just i guess i could say uh i could call this render and i could use d3s you know forget about um p5's draw loop i could just call on tick for the animation call render no oh but you know what that messes up the translate uh draw knows to reset the transformation matrix in p5 so i'd have to explicitly say reset no it's weird there we go so i don't know whether it makes sense now the only thing is i can't drag any of this stuff so how do i get this drag stuff back hmm okay this is going to be challenging drag simulation drag event do i i mean could it be as simple as saying drag simulation just call that function pass the simulation in and attach all this stuff to it it doesn't that's not that's not gonna do it hold on uh hmm all right so this i got to think about um let's look at what was it doing here so this uh call dr oh call drag simulation oh that's weird interesting what if all right hold on let's look at this canvas d3 drag drag and zoom blocks this is an old example before observable there was blocks but this is using canvas right so this is this is exactly what i was talking about i'm using p5 instead of like context move to and arc and all of that and oops so i think hold on hold on hold on i think i might have a clue here where is the drag canvas call d3 drag subject drag subject on drag drag okay hold on this is a clue here got it got it got it got it so this is my canvas canvas equals create canvas canvas.call d3 direct but it's not canvas dot call because i'm d3 wants me probably to call it on the name this is the p5 canvas the native html canvas is in a property called elt um hold on let's get rid of the zoom could you please why i want you to do the thing where you oh hold on okay um what is the like uh there's that property that's like i wanted to wrap um hold on i'm like i'm having a major crisis in that my i don't know how to use vs code line length my line length property line length uh javascript is this going to do it no that's html form oh my god i don't know how to do this wait i'll just have to survive so d3 dra canvas is i'll call d3 dot drag subject drag subject on drag dragged alt z no i don't want to rat i don't want it to wrap i want it to just be so long that it needs to like put them on different lines um my my audit format is gone but i okay what's drag's subject here oh what can i just say on that's weird drag subject this is weird well let's try something well this is going to get wonky okay i'm going to get rid of this got it got it got it got it got it got it got it got it i see i think i understand what to do here i basically when i create the canvas oh i need to do this let's make this a global variable and in start simulation i'm also going to do this here and then this is where did i get that well i got this from from here oh i got it from the end of this i see i see hold on this i did not expect to have to deal with i could i could skip this dragging stuff but i want to figure it out oh yeah here here that's what i'm looking for how am i doing on time oh this is going to take a while let's uh oh i have it here i'm figuring this out i'm using my canvas ah there we go got it got it got it got it got it got it got it i think i know what to do canvas call d3 drag on on canvas.elt oh i just had like some wonky syntax stuff no yeah extra i'm gonna get this why won't it autoformat is this not right what's the chance this is right drag started dragged drag ended so let me just try drag started and see what happens here sketch line 56. oh whoops that's the problem there we go okay people sorry i'm really working very intensely on this and i'm not really able to explain while i'm going i've kind of lost i just want to see let's see canvas.elt.col is not a function that's the canvas elt is the default canvas oh because it's a oh oh oh oh i know what i need to do ah i need to make a d3 canvas d3 select canvas of course of course this is all d3 stuff okay so select the canvas hopefully it's the right canvas this is the problem okay yay okay this is good i mean i'm get it's registering my clicks so um simulation it needs to be a global variable because of the way that i've done this obviously i could put these these could be like enclosed in that function which would probably be the correct way to do this but i'm just going to lazily use global variables okay cannot read property x of undefined sketch.js line 12. so hold on let me just look at what doesn't know what d is where is it supposed to get d so the event is subject target there's definitely a subject here x y oh you know what i need to do okay so i've got an event i think this d is like no longer relevant here must have been so and let's look at this one um right it needs a subject how does it find the sub the subject is doing some kind of transform thing i don't want isn't there like um i think there's drag subject this is what i'm looking for which circle to drag drag subject choose the circle that is closest to the pointer for dragging i thought there was an automated way to do this in d3 that i've seen but let's look at this subject drag subject okay that's what i'm missing okay subject is null distance is constant n of nodes this is looking at the distance between the nodes x and y in the event if it's less than distance subject is that node so now so that's where the d goes the d gets filled in by the subject and so um let me just do these take these out for a second and so now if i were to say drag subject drag subject there we go it got long enough finally is this right call d3.drag subject drag subject okay let's see if this works this is so weird how d3 works max distance is not defined in drag subject let's make that infinity right that's the longest distance okay oh subject there's the subject okay so now i don't know what this is is it event what this fx is d is not defined so confused yeah where why is there a d in here and how come i don't have it and look at this one drag oh i guess i could do it this way okay like this oh wait a sec i'm getting something but i'm off by that weird offset so um where's the offset because i translated event dot x m plus width divided by two plus height divided by two is that no minus oh there we go sort of got this working but it's like it's losing it um i almost want to you start using the p5 uh functions like um like if i have a active node and then i just do um okay well maybe i'm not going to get hung up on this so much maybe i won't get hung up on this so much because ultimately i just wanted to do this but it's losing it i kind of want to just put i want to put my own data in in it i'm looking at the i'm looking at the um chat see if i'm missing something obvious drag subject finds it return subject it should keep the subject all along until we say there's no no the event oh it's got all this stuff built into it hold on this one let me just look at this example again it's staying okay come skims call drag circles on interesting simon is saying i think you have messed up math the the this drag i guess i should think about this for real this is for all the nodes the event.x is the untranslated mousex mouse y so i need to subtract yeah no this is right this seems right to me yeah this is right i think you're i think simon is behind because that is where i messed it up um maybe something with the event active yeah when does drag ended get called let's take a look at this started dragging drag ended i don't see end it's so weird like what is going on right um so are you changing the drag subject when your cursor gets too close to another node but when is drag subject called let's let's that's actually a really great question i don't know when any of these things are called i'm sure it's all in the document documentation so let's just see here let's see when all these events happen it's 36. whoops this is what i was doing here okay so i'm going to click finding subject started so it's just finding the subject once i have a weird kind of idea which is i want to um just out of curiosity take this out for a second and what i want to do is call um i want to do this myself uh find subject so i'm going to say function mouse pressed um mouse x mouse y subject is dragged true uh acted dragged node i'm just doing this myself with p5 functions just for a second drag note find the subject set is dragged equal to true and i probably should do uh if dragged node i don't know what this does but let's let's put that in there take this out i probably should have done a commit so i could back up to this but and then i'm going to do a function mouse released dragged node is dragged false drag node is nothing and then what if i were to say uh in render here just if dragged node dragged node equals mouse x drag node equals mouse y dot x this is probably a terrible terrible idea and i didn't realize how much i was gonna end up undoing to do this um and okay this is promising i'm not finding the right subject because oh oh i see this has to be minus i have to have that offset there we go well this is better huh p5 for the win here okay so um i don't love that i just did this because i've basically disabled whatever automated d3 functionality like finding a node to drag oh it always finds the closest one but you know what i should do find the subject so it should also have to be okay hold on hold on uh let radius equal 10. so where am i drawing these things uh radius times two now this is finding the closest one but i should say if d is less than distance and d is less than the radius so now if i click here okay cannot set property is dragged of null i don't think i need that is dragged because i'm just finding it it's either null or setting it to null so clicking here it doesn't pick anything up but if i click here it does there we go so i'm finding the closest one that i clicked on and dragging it what does this oh wait a sec and i missed one thing which is um where's the dragging stuff here i don't know what this alpha target is this should be zero what is alpha target under simulation let's look at this alpha target restarts the simulation internal timer and returns the simulation combination with alpha target reheat the simulation during interaction such as when dragging a node or to resume the simulation after temporarily pausing it oh i see okay so um what what if i just took that out i'm just curious what if i didn't bother doing that if i find a node ah i see i think i need that okay so now i've got it where i'm dragging stuff around uh let me change the radius to four and and now the great thing is i can really start to um play with color to my heart's delight uh for example let me just grab a couple coding train colors and obviously there's a lot that i could do to make these nodes object oriented if i do this there we go oh my camera went off oh weird not sure what happened there okay so i'm i'm at one o'clock so i'm at my um i'm at my um and end here for today's live stream but i've made some pretty good progress here in understanding uh d3 uh this force thing and uh but i i wanna um i wanna use my own data so the idea and i'm gonna have to like this will have to be for another time how do i uh configure prettier sure yay okay so oh it has a radius in it and okay so this is using some data set um and i am going to delete basically almost the entire data set here oh hold on let's do before let's do uh youtube uh data so eventually i'm going to need to um oh my god this is so hard to figure out okay then links i just want two of these oh my goodness i want two nodes okay so i'm gonna make a node that's like um selfavoiding random walk i'm not going to worry about the groupings the radius um but it could be i could do something like views i suppose and then let's do one more let's do a couple more uh you know fractal tree uh and uh what's something else that i've done game of life okay then links are game of life to fractal tree uh has a a link with a strength of 10 and then fractal tree is linked to selfavoiding random walk with a value of five okay so now if i go into sketch and change this to ytdata right these are just my three data points but i want to do a little bit more now i want to draw them with node views divided by 10. they're way too big divided by 100 right so now oh in the ah i see so then the class clicking on it the find subject has to also oh so yes the node should have a radius i guess i could put that in the data oh but i could do that object.create um this is silly what i'm doing but could i make the radius what did i divide it by like could i give every node a radius this way and then i'm just drawing the radius based on its radius times two and then this would be n dot radius that didn't work game of life target radius nan oh does this is this not coming in as a number oh value i'm in the links ah i'm in the links i want to be in the nodes i think there's like a lot of extra unnecessary stuff here but it's fine um can i read prop oh return return return okay so now each circle is representing the number of views and um i could have the stroke thickness be the link's value let's just make it the links value so if i go into my data like five two right so you can see and then this is really pretty wonky the way i'm doing this but i want to draw the nodes second for sure and then i want to say no stroke here and so we can see the thickness represents kind of the strength of its connection but i actually would like to there must be some properties for this force link thing i'm going to stop this in a second uh there was a documentation page i was on here force link force link source target index recomputes distance and strength distance ah return 30. so can i do something like distance 100 uh wait where does this distance go yikes hold on what did i do i messed this up i chair creaks yes uh force i i have to stop but i must dot id dot distance 30. yes okay 130. there we go okay so that's like controlling the distance so that could also be related to um potentially the value times 10. oh d uh return value times 10 right so but maybe so okay so i'm just figuring out how to control the distance and then i could also do like strength um also tied to that like value whoa so this is interesting anyway i don't have an idea for what i want this to look like yet but uh now um let me add just a little bit more data um hold on um what's another video um you know pi day and then let's say pi day pi day like fractal tree and then my day game of life selfavoiding walk fractal i just want to do two just going to separate these just out of curiosity okay so we can see here uh i'm not sure what i'm doing but i'm visualizing this data uh and then i think this is pretty much where i i mean obviously i need to get some real data in here to like play around with it but there was something that i wanted to try ah yes i know what i want last thing i want to try is just um okay so hover equals find subject nodes if hover then text hover dot id hover dot x plus plus hover dot radius plus 10 hover dot y text align left center uh fill 255 no str what i'm trying to do is just see if can i reuse my fine subject um this is the last thing i'm going to do oh mousex mouse y is what i need to pass it to do a rollover basically and i don't think i need to call this i don't need to console.log finding subject anymore nope mouse is not defined oops mousex there we go um text size 60 32 there we go see now again i have no thoughtfulness in terms of the design but now i can hover and see what it is they have a relationship a state analog says you sound burned out yeah this basically happens to me after once i get i'm way over my time so this is great i'm going to i mean if i don't say so myself i'm going to wrap up now of course uh uh starting with some dummy data plus canvas p5 oh i don't have um so let me put this on github for anybody who wants to play around with it before i go i'm gonna start playing this outro music no i won't sign in okay so now if anybody wants to take a look at this um i will put this into um discord i forgot to set up discord have i done video youtube api videos before no but that's what i'm interested in pursuing a little bit this summer um i'm just trying to open up discord here coding train that okay so um this is the coding train discord um i just posted a link to it in the chat um this is where during the live streams i will um post things links to things i'm working on which is just this so now you have seen my um exploration of working with d3 p5 and trying to create a force directed graph with the um d3 force module i got very i mean i felt like actually i got very far because i really understand a lot more about how this kind of works with e3 with my alarm's going off because i really have to go so um i hope everyone enjoyed this stream um play with this code join jump in the discord say hi there um you know i just want to uh thank once again as the timer is running out curiosity stream if you go to curiositystream codingtrain father's day is this weekend it's a nice gift um you'll get 41 off it's 11.79 for the entire year for both the curiosity stream uh streaming service and nebula bundle um thank you everybody see you ooh i didn't even cover all of my news and schedule it's going to be a bit before there's a next live stream next live stream is coming in july sign up onto the discord and um if you want to get notifications about live stream scheduling um just go into once you're in discord um use the bot command and let me move this over here use the bot command exclamation subscribe this will give you the notifications role which you will see will give you um here under schedule whenever i'm live streaming or have updates about my schedule this is where i post at notification so i do not use the at everyone except for in emergencies um so um please join the discord stay tuned there i will see you all in a future live stream coming in july uh new videos on a bezier curve videos on time displacement split scanning those things are coming out on the channel in the next couple weeks okay see y'all as always i always forget that this stop this stop it stop this stop i'm gonna do this stop this stop i'm gonna do this this stop this stop this stop i'm gonna do this stop i just stopped this dot this stock this this dot this dot song never forget this dot there's somebody composed that song for me i'm going to say once again here we go it's look forward to cartesian coordination autotune and the internet will fix that for me unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what else is there yes kittens thank you very much kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice that look what i get i'm really losing my mind okay let's do it the kittens and kittens i feel just sort of like a nice feeling of relaxation everything's going to be okay today dream is not broken it has not frozen this is a this is a wonderful thing okay we're gonna do it i'm really getting to something i need my sound effects that was invalid syntax i forgot uh there was one other thing here that i think is important that i will use continuously over and over again all sorts of text generation analysis things that i will use continuously over and over again first thing i need to do is yes okay we're gonna do it kittens the kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens the kittens and kittens and kittens kittens oh the camera went off bye everybody i don't know why the camera keeps going off i'll see you next time have a wonderful day
