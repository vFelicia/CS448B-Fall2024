00:28 - do
00:29 - [Music]
02:34 - oh
02:46 - [Music]
02:48 - hmm
02:50 - [Music]
03:03 - good morning sound check one two three
03:08 - starting in just about 35 seconds
03:18 - [Music]
03:49 - good morning and welcome to the coding
03:52 - train with your host dan who seems to be
03:54 - sort of sitting in the dark i don't
03:56 - guess i don't usually stream this early
03:59 - and if i do maybe the last time i did it
04:02 - the sun was not
04:03 - out and so you can see the sun is coming
04:06 - in and shining behind me i do have these
04:08 - two lights pointed
04:09 - straight at my face but nonetheless oh
04:12 - now it seems to have come around
04:13 - and i can see myself in my monitor over
04:15 - here this is why i always look over here
04:16 - because i have this monitor over here
04:18 - where i should be looking at you
04:20 - the viewers the people of the internet
04:22 - um thank you for joining me this morning
04:24 - i
04:24 - i don't know i don't i don't know how
04:27 - this is gonna go
04:28 - i don't have two i actually do have a
04:29 - plan not to say i don't have a plan but
04:31 - i do have a plan
04:32 - um this is probably the
04:35 - last live stream of the summer
04:39 - um never say never but i will be back in
04:42 - full
04:42 - force in september i am teaching um
04:45 - two multiple classes at nyu this fall
04:48 - and i have a lot of content i hoped and
04:50 - planned to make
04:51 - for those courses um but um so this is
04:54 - my last little just
04:56 - like hurrah here for the summer um i do
04:58 - have some other videos that will be
05:00 - coming out um
05:02 - you know that i'm doing some of you
05:04 - might be uh i've followed the fact that
05:05 - i'm doing a guest conductor series i've
05:07 - got a couple more of those planned
05:09 - um i also have another coding in the
05:12 - cabana
05:13 - video planned um first of all i just
05:16 - want to say good morning to rose because
05:18 - i saw in the chat very briefly that rose
05:20 - woke up at
05:20 - 5am to watch this stream and i'm so so
05:23 - sorry
05:26 - hopefully this goes well it is
05:27 - interesting and you uh
05:29 - enjoy yourself learn something maybe
05:31 - just have it on the background and
05:32 - because you're
05:33 - got lots of other things to do that's
05:34 - totally fine but thank you for
05:36 - tuning in um i know that it's a bunch of
05:38 - people it's the evening for them
05:40 - um but it's it's it's uh it's it's not
05:44 - that early to be honest it's it's it's
05:46 - eight
05:46 - and usually this wouldn't be early for
05:48 - me i'm an early riser lots to do but
05:50 - this whole quarantine situation
05:52 - i scheduled just gotten pushed back and
05:53 - back and back my sleep is all messed up
05:56 - if i had known how it's gonna feel this
05:59 - morning
05:59 - i would not have scheduled this live
06:01 - stream yesterday but once i schedule it
06:04 - it's scheduled so my kids are still
06:06 - sleeping
06:07 - because we're on such a late schedule
06:08 - although they do very shortly
06:10 - have an online chess class that they're
06:12 - taking which is why at nine o'clock
06:13 - which is why
06:14 - i am here was able to sort of work out
06:16 - to stream this morning
06:18 - i hope to be done around 10
06:21 - is the plan you know how i always go
06:22 - late but
06:25 - i don't get all day people got lots of
06:27 - stuff to do
06:28 - um yeah so
06:33 - how are you i hope you're well um
06:36 - so let's let me let me sort of set the
06:39 - stage here set the table
06:41 - if you will um i have been doing
06:45 - so if you've never tuned in before this
06:46 - is the coding train
06:48 - um i do have a new sponsor for the
06:50 - coding train today which i will briefly
06:52 - just mention oh wait i have to go here
06:55 - and then i have to go
06:56 - here and then there it is notion i'm
06:59 - waking up people
07:00 - i'm actually excited to talk to you
07:01 - about notion um notion
07:04 - is a whoops all my things in the wrong
07:08 - place is a
07:09 - is um productivity software
07:13 - uh that breaks the mold by combining all
07:15 - essential work tools so i'll come back
07:16 - and talk to you a little bit more about
07:18 - notion
07:18 - uh later i have i'm slightly allergic to
07:21 - project management systems that i tend
07:23 - to just email myself things to do
07:26 - but i've been working with notion um and
07:28 - and actually quite enjoying it so
07:30 - you can check it out at um what was it
07:32 - again
07:36 - oh i'm fired i'm so fired bit.lee notion
07:39 - coding train you can get a free uh
07:42 - personal plans they used to be five
07:43 - dollars a month but now you can get a
07:44 - personal plan for free
07:45 - um so go check that out i will come back
07:47 - and um
07:49 - talk a little more about that later um
07:51 - let's see
07:52 - so okay so also
07:55 - it's i i don't know what the temperature
07:57 - is outside i do have the one of these
07:58 - old
07:59 - old-timey old-fashioned um thermometers
08:01 - downstairs
08:03 - um and i seem to have just gotten a new
08:05 - member because
08:06 - these lights behind me are blinking oh
08:08 - i'm so in the dark
08:10 - what is going on daniel garden has
08:12 - joined
08:13 - wait i can't i'm all over the place here
08:15 - oh where's my bell
08:17 - and my random number book and my music
08:20 - cube
08:22 - daniel garden uh really you should be a
08:24 - member of the coding garden
08:26 - with a name like daniel garden but thank
08:28 - you very much for joining
08:31 - i'm just about there
08:36 - you have won with your membership to the
08:39 - coding train
08:40 - a person sitting in the dark
08:43 - in the morning it's so bright in here
08:46 - and so hot what i was gonna say is it's
08:48 - like i turn the air conditioning off so
08:49 - it makes a loud noise
08:50 - but i think i need to turn it back on so
08:53 - there will be
08:54 - a little bit of a hum in the background
08:55 - for this live stream and here's your
08:56 - random number daniel
08:58 - 79 454. thank you
09:02 - okay um oh daniel garden is a moderator
09:06 - on the coding garden excellent
09:08 - um uh thank you pedro
09:11 - it's not going very well it's not going
09:13 - well do you think it's going well i
09:15 - don't think it's going well
09:19 - okay i'm turning the air conditioner
09:21 - back on cold for comedy
09:24 - there's no comedy here that's by the way
09:26 - one of the um
09:27 - one of the most frequently commented
09:29 - comments on my uh videos
09:31 - is i don't know why you think you're
09:32 - funny you're not funny
09:35 - like i never said i was funny not funny
09:38 - not funny
09:39 - not funny not funny
09:49 - okay um
09:53 - now come on wake get into the light
09:56 - camera adjust your white balance thingy
09:58 - whatever
10:00 - now the sun will rise it will keep going
10:02 - this way you know that way is that way
10:05 - it's north
10:07 - so that way it's east sunrises in the
10:10 - east right
10:10 - so it's going to go like this
10:15 - let's see yes marcos thank you
10:18 - [Laughter]
10:20 - marcos is after my heart with his quote
10:24 - of acting
10:25 - thank you um
10:28 - [Music]
10:30 - and let's
10:33 - go here uh oh my goodness my
10:37 - stream deck is bugging out all right
10:41 - so i was setting the table the fork i
10:44 - don't know where the
10:44 - does anybody know how to set the table i
10:46 - don't i just put the forks and the
10:48 - plates and the cups
10:52 - remember how coating train used to be
10:53 - brought to you by water those are the
10:54 - days
10:56 - i had a recording studio i didn't have
11:00 - all this
11:01 - hair i was in the light i didn't know
11:04 - this would happen
11:06 - the sun is really uh
11:11 - messing with me so um what i've been
11:14 - doing with these summer live streams
11:15 - which i actually really quite enjoy is
11:17 - just
11:17 - working on random stuff i worked on a
11:20 - discord bot
11:21 - did train some machine learning text
11:23 - generation models we tried playing
11:25 - around with my hue lights
11:27 - uh tried the youtube api i had a whole
11:30 - list
11:30 - i don't know where that list went i mean
11:32 - i know where it went but i erased it
11:35 - so um but uh today this morning
11:38 - there are a few kind of random things i
11:40 - want to work on one
11:42 - is and let me just bring this up here
11:46 - [Music]
11:52 - fork and knife to the right says frank
11:54 - spoon to the left thank you very much
11:57 - then you put like the salad fork does it
11:59 - go like on the top
12:02 - no that's the soup spoon
12:07 - so one of the things i definitely want
12:09 - to do i'm really excited about this
12:11 - is if i come back to
12:14 - the most recent guest conductor video
12:17 - with guest artist chrissy brimmage
12:21 - who helped us learn uh who taught me
12:25 - and whoever tuned in blender the basics
12:27 - of blender i'm just looking and made
12:29 - this
12:29 - like beautiful um model of mew
12:33 - i made my own model of mew which i will
12:35 - show you which i'm naming mewtwo
12:38 - and i want to try importing my model of
12:40 - mewtwo into processing
12:42 - and see what i can do with that um let's
12:46 - take a look by the way
12:47 - at twitter.com and let's take a look at
12:51 - mewtrain
12:52 - because mutrain is the hashtag for
12:55 - everybody to post
12:56 - their blender models that they um so if
12:59 - you didn't tune in to that stream
13:01 - go usually i don't tell anyone to go
13:03 - back and watch something
13:04 - because you know please don't don't
13:08 - but uh chrissy is amazing
13:11 - and that stream was mind-blowing to me
13:13 - and you should definitely go back and
13:15 - watch it
13:15 - and make your own uh 3d model in blender
13:18 - if you've never done that before
13:20 - um you can see this is my isn't it
13:22 - beautiful
13:24 - oh mewtwo you are you are my love
13:29 - um vadim made this incredible
13:33 - um mew which i don't even understand
13:36 - there's like
13:37 - shadow and a floor and there's like a
13:40 - ball over here and look at these eyes
13:42 - just gorgeous um
13:46 - this is um
13:49 - tweet great detailed explanation
13:52 - colby's mew marcos says look at that
13:56 - with the rainbow
13:57 - little i like the arms like
14:00 - i'm a t-rex um
14:03 - but with the rainbow there is amazing um
14:05 - this is the coding trains
14:07 - tweet this is uh chrissy's oh so you
14:09 - know if you if you're not familiar with
14:11 - chrissy's artwork this is a reel of her
14:13 - artwork
14:13 - it's fantastic uh soarin from denmark
14:16 - followed along
14:17 - and i um this was so interesting to me
14:20 - like i never occurred to me that
14:24 - that you might like place a reference
14:26 - image in 3d space it's almost like
14:28 - you're
14:28 - tracing an image or painting by numbers
14:30 - or um and that was really mind-blowing
14:32 - to me it's super fun it's i can tell
14:34 - immediately that it's like a thing that
14:36 - i'm not gonna be very good at
14:38 - like i have trouble with um it's almost
14:44 - like
14:47 - like mechanical analog physical things
14:49 - in the world i have trouble putting them
14:51 - together let's just put it that way
14:54 - but interestingly enough like in
14:56 - software and coding is the thing that i
14:58 - it's not that i find it easy but it's
15:00 - something that i uh that fits with the
15:02 - way that i think and work
15:04 - and blender 3d modeling seems to be
15:06 - somewhere in between
15:08 - because there's a bit of like manual
15:10 - dexterity and sort of artisticness to
15:12 - how you
15:12 - sort of and you can see where what i
15:14 - ended up with here
15:16 - but i i actually really i really love
15:18 - mine youtube
15:19 - have i lost all my viewers left let
15:23 - yet oh we can't talk
15:28 - all right so that's uh item number one
15:32 - is um playing around with mewtwo in
15:36 - processing
15:37 - very excited about that
15:42 - and um now
15:45 - item number two if i go to
15:48 - thecodingtrain.com my most recent
15:52 - coding in the cabana video
15:56 - i don't know why everyone's telling me
15:57 - it's lina gomez's birthday i've seen
16:00 - this
16:00 - in both the discord chat and the youtube
16:03 - chat
16:04 - i made a video about marching squares
16:08 - so i would like to look at community
16:11 - contributions to marching squares if you
16:13 - made your own marching squares
16:15 - uh variation you can maybe possibly
16:17 - still get that in right now
16:20 - and a couple people in the chat asked
16:22 - about the interpolation
16:23 - step so i'd like to go over that code
16:25 - because it's not it's not something i
16:27 - went over in the video
16:28 - but it makes quite a difference in the
16:30 - quality of the visuals that you get
16:32 - so that's probably actually where i'm
16:34 - gonna start i'm gonna start with the
16:35 - marching squares
16:36 - and then work on the mewtwo stuff the
16:39 - things that i won't get to
16:41 - but i would like to are thinking about
16:44 - marching cubes like how would i take the
16:46 - marching squares into 3d
16:49 - so in marching squares
16:53 - let me pull up a little diagram here
16:55 - that i know is on the wikipedia page
16:58 - all right where's my video people should
17:02 - come up maybe it hasn't been around long
17:03 - enough
17:04 - um this is the diagram i'm looking at
17:09 - so looking for so with marching squares
17:13 - there are 16 configurations because
17:16 - there are four
17:17 - corners to a square if each corner has
17:20 - two possibilities
17:22 - that's two to the fourth power or 16.
17:26 - marching cubes
17:29 - let's see if there's a similar diagram
17:32 - somewhere that i can find
17:37 - here we go 15 oh the originally
17:40 - published 15
17:41 - but i was going to say there's got to be
17:42 - 256.
17:44 - what is going on here this is
17:48 - wacko wait
17:51 - anyway i have not looked at this
17:54 - in advance but i was going to assume
17:57 - that with a cube
17:58 - given that our there are eight corners
18:02 - and each one could have a zero or a one
18:05 - that there would be two hundred two to
18:07 - the eighth power which if i'm correct
18:09 - is 256 possibilities
18:13 - and i believe there are techniques and
18:15 - strategies probably for
18:17 - creating some kind of like lookup table
18:19 - for based on the configuration which
18:21 - which uh polygon should be drawn
18:26 - uh and there's a cool of course there's
18:28 - a video from sebastian lag
18:30 - about marching cubes um which uh
18:34 - i guess we could all watch it together
18:36 - but
18:37 - um there are only 15 unique
18:41 - possibilities i don't understand that
18:43 - oh because you could rotate it
18:47 - maybe with rotations i see
18:50 - that's interesting so there must be some
18:53 - way
18:55 - um there's yes there's 256 but
18:58 - each but there are probably each
19:01 - variation can be
19:02 - a rotated version of another one that
19:05 - must make sense
19:08 - it's written 256 possibilities look at
19:10 - the text beside
19:12 - this image the algorithm proceeds
19:16 - through the scalar field taking eight
19:18 - neighbor locations at a time
19:20 - determining the polygons needed to
19:22 - represent the part of the iso surface
19:23 - that passes through this queue
19:26 - okay this is done by creating an index
19:28 - to a pre-calculated array of 256
19:30 - possible polygon configurations
19:33 - yeah by treating each of the eight
19:35 - scalar values as a bit in an 8-bit
19:37 - integer
19:38 - so how do i create that array of 256
19:41 - possible polygon configurations
19:43 - is that a thing that i could just pull
19:45 - out of a json file
19:47 - like that would be cool right someone's
19:49 - got must have made one
19:50 - because if that were the case i feel
19:52 - like i could do this rather quickly
19:57 - json file marching
20:00 - cubes configuration
20:07 - uh lookup table like
20:11 - lookup table maybe configuration is
20:15 - wrong
20:18 - by the way can i just make a random plug
20:23 - i never i'm never able to um use
20:26 - google in search engines the same way
20:28 - after reading this book um
20:30 - algorithms of oppression by dr safiya um
20:34 - noble fantastic book highly recommended
20:37 - i'm part of a
20:38 - book club right now that's reading it
20:39 - and discussing it it's fantastic
20:41 - uh okay ah
20:44 - original marching cubes look up table
20:50 - i just want like a data file that has
20:53 - like all of the vertices for me
20:56 - uh that i can just maybe that's the
20:58 - thing i should make
21:00 - how to construct the marching cubes
21:02 - table algorithmically
21:05 - why would you want to do this well of
21:07 - course i want to do this
21:08 - don't ask me why um okay so simon
21:12 - thanks thankfully simon is watching this
21:14 - morning because i know i can get i could
21:16 - use google
21:16 - or i could just ask simon
21:20 - there are 256 possibilities but there
21:22 - are only uh
21:23 - 15 unique ones the others are just
21:26 - rotations and reflections
21:27 - you can just download the list off the
21:30 - interwebs
21:31 - yes but where i need a url or or better
21:33 - yet i need
21:34 - some keywords to type in to this search
21:37 - engine here to find that for me but
21:39 - that's not what i'm
21:39 - doing right now oh paul bork
21:43 - oh my gosh first of all speaking of
21:45 - amazing things to plug i have used
21:47 - this website basically my entire life as
21:51 - a programmer
21:52 - i think i started using this website
21:54 - probably in as early as 2001. you can
21:56 - see this
21:56 - is an article from me 1994. just about i
21:59 - mean i
22:00 - you know i could skip my whole way i
22:03 - could just basically
22:04 - use paul bork's site as
22:07 - entire means for looking for all of my
22:10 - coding challenges i probably referenced
22:12 - it a bunch of times
22:13 - there's so much amazing stuff in here
22:15 - highly recommend um
22:18 - an alternative table oh look at this
22:22 - look at this this is what i'm looking
22:24 - for
22:27 - the following code was generated from
22:29 - the above
22:31 - here is a table 256
22:34 - and 13 points
22:38 - so what do those 13 i need i don't have
22:40 - my white board
22:41 - set up shoot i didn't think i would need
22:44 - it today
22:45 - but clearly if i'm going to talk about
22:47 - marching cubes i
22:48 - really really need that whiteboard uh
22:52 - sebastian lag has a link to a list
22:55 - all right let's see sebastian
22:58 - lag marching cubes
23:02 - uh look in here
23:06 - um project
23:09 - files oh look at this so there's that
23:13 - link that i was just looking at
23:15 - let's see what these two are and let's
23:18 - take a look at this one
23:20 - generating complex procedural trains
23:23 - okay
23:24 - marching cubes right right here's the 15
23:27 - configurations a lookup table
23:30 - okay i i should this is actually could
23:33 - just this this could be a
23:34 - i could make a follow-up coding in the
23:36 - cabana there's enough here that i could
23:38 - do that
23:39 - i don't know that it makes sense for me
23:40 - to really get to try to do this today
23:42 - or i could when i can get back to i know
23:44 - a couple of you in the chat mentioned i
23:46 - missed the coding challenges
23:47 - and i agree um this would be a good sort
23:50 - of coding challenge
23:51 - video this is the paper that i've
23:53 - already read
23:54 - [Music]
23:56 - and this is the github page so i wonder
23:59 - if
23:59 - in here there is like somewhere in here
24:02 - the
24:03 - lookup table scripts
24:06 - boy wow amazing i guess this is what
24:09 - happens when you code in
24:10 - unity um
24:14 - all right so that's great that i found
24:17 - that
24:20 - let me put that aside so
24:24 - we have mewtwo
24:27 - loading into processing marching squares
24:31 - looking at community variations
24:34 - and um talking about the interpolation
24:38 - step
24:38 - we have trying to code marching cubes
24:40 - not gonna happen
24:42 - and then what i am what i was planning
24:45 - to do as my
24:46 - next coding in the cabana video is
24:49 - uh fractal flame so fractal flame
24:53 - um and i want to look for the original
24:56 - paper here it is
24:58 - um where's the pdf
25:02 - um let's see maybe that will show up if
25:06 - i just put pdf here
25:09 - yeah that's here we go
25:14 - yeah this is what i'm looking for so uh
25:16 - here's the url if you want to take a
25:17 - look at this yourself
25:19 - so um
25:22 - this is a particular algorithm invented
25:24 - by
25:25 - scott draves and a collaborator eric
25:27 - recase
25:28 - um and if you go to
25:31 - my uh twitter which is twitter.com
25:35 - shiffman am i still in the dark you can
25:37 - see the sun is moving
25:39 - um we'll see here oh first of all uh
25:41 - james schloss from i don't know how to
25:43 - say this lee ios
25:44 - lee leo is also working on fractal flame
25:49 - we've been messaging about this
25:50 - um you can see these are results that
25:52 - i've gotten with some of my early
25:54 - experiments but i'm not entirely sure
25:57 - that i'm doing it correctly
25:59 - but what i've been reading i read over
26:02 - this paper and i'd be happy to start
26:04 - walking through some of the code even in
26:05 - today's live stream
26:07 - because i do want to make a video kind
26:09 - of coding this thing from
26:11 - you know all the way from nothing to the
26:12 - end um
26:14 - but this paper describes it really quite
26:16 - well there's a lot of math notation
26:18 - which can be a little bit
26:19 - intimidating and tricky but the thing
26:22 - that's always helped me
26:23 - is going to these um pseudo code
26:27 - little spots which really do explain um
26:30 - which are very helpful to me and sort of
26:31 - like figuring out how to write the code
26:33 - for it
26:34 - um and so um and then
26:37 - there's all these different uh uh
26:40 - transformation
26:41 - uh functions where you just take an x y
26:43 - and so like this is just making a copy
26:45 - of the x y
26:46 - this is taking the x y and giving you
26:47 - back sine of x sine of y
26:49 - so these are these are things that um
26:52 - that
26:52 - looks a little scary but are actually
26:55 - quite um
26:56 - quite not easy but are quite
26:58 - transferable into code
27:00 - um but what i wanted to ask about if
27:03 - anyone's going to look at this
27:05 - uh later and maybe want to engage with
27:07 - me on twitter to help
27:09 - is i don't what i really don't
27:11 - understand
27:13 - is like i've got my images uh look
27:16 - without a lot of the extra sort of like
27:18 - blurring and fancy work with coloring
27:20 - that i think i'm missing my images look
27:22 - kind of like this so i think i'm on the
27:23 - right track
27:25 - however
27:29 - what i really don't understand
27:33 - is how these images are are were created
27:37 - because i mean i don't want to get too
27:40 - far into the weeds with this
27:42 - basically there it's a three-step
27:46 - process you apply a transformation
27:50 - uh then one of these variations and then
27:52 - another trans linear transformation and
27:53 - one of these variations and another
27:54 - linear transformation and i can't
27:56 - and i get sort of like all sorts of
27:59 - wacky fun results when i'm sort of
28:00 - throwing
28:01 - all the spaghetti at the wall but this i
28:04 - feel like i must be missing something
28:05 - because
28:06 - this these particular examples
28:10 - are showing i can't reproduce these
28:14 - so that i would if that is something
28:15 - that i would love some help with if you
28:17 - want to look at my code so far to
28:18 - compare with the paper
28:20 - um if you go to github.com codingtrain
28:25 - um and i think if i go under
28:27 - repositories it's probably the most
28:29 - recent one
28:30 - fractal flame right here
28:33 - so we can see and i'll just show this to
28:35 - you by the way like so just look you'll
28:37 - see
28:37 - i mean i've done this in a sort of
28:39 - awkward way but
28:42 - but um you can see so i what the way
28:44 - that i have this
28:45 - is i have this idea of a ver um
28:49 - a class called variation and it keeps
28:52 - track of its name and some color
28:53 - information
28:54 - and these coefficients for these
28:56 - transformation steps but then
28:58 - every single one of these
29:01 - variations like if we look at spherical
29:05 - v2 of x x the function which gets as
29:09 - input x y returns 1 divided by
29:12 - r squared which is the magnitude of the
29:14 - vector x y
29:15 - times x y if we go back to my code
29:20 - and i look for spherical you can see
29:24 - this is what i'm just doing exactly that
29:26 - but with vector notation
29:27 - so r is v is v dot x v dot y
29:31 - r is then magnitude squared and i return
29:33 - a copy of it
29:34 - divided by r and so you can see swirl is
29:37 - like okay
29:38 - r is magnitude squared and then i return
29:41 - x times sine of r
29:42 - minus y times cosine of r and if i went
29:45 - back to the paper
29:47 - and i look for swirl you can see
29:51 - here's exactly that formula x times sine
29:53 - of r i'm saying r for
29:55 - r squared uh minus y so um and
29:58 - and transferring this to p5.js wouldn't
30:00 - be um
30:04 - so first of all there's so i could i
30:06 - could yes um ashik is asking about
30:08 - translating this to p5.js
30:10 - that would be somewhat trivial at least
30:11 - for me who's so used to like moving back
30:13 - and forth between these two environments
30:14 - the reason why i would hold off a little
30:16 - bit on that is
30:18 - um these images the way that i'm doing
30:20 - it take an incredibly long time to
30:22 - render let me just pull down my code
30:24 - this is i'm talking about this now
30:26 - so why not go with it
30:30 - [Music]
30:33 - so let me pull down my code and i'll try
30:36 - to
30:36 - run it oh wait hold on
30:41 - to show you what i show you what i mean
30:44 - i have to sneeze a sneeze is coming
30:49 - can i try mute my microphone put on some
30:52 - music
30:58 - this is good sneezing music
31:04 - it won't now that i said i was gonna
31:05 - sneak this i'm not going to
31:18 - [Music]
31:26 - okay um so
31:30 - what i i don't remember where i left
31:32 - this when i um
31:35 - committed it oops
31:38 - i can't use the computer today thank you
31:45 - so um you can see here these are all the
31:48 - different variations
31:50 - so i'm adding them all in um creating a
31:53 - pixel map
31:54 - and um there's a lot to talk about with
31:57 - this
31:57 - but what i let me just run it see what
32:00 - happens
32:01 - see what we get so you can see this is
32:04 - how long it's taking to render
32:15 - what just happened did something go
32:17 - crazy with the sound
32:19 - oh um so there you go there you see
32:21 - there you see the image i got
32:23 - but um the reason why is it has done a
32:26 - total of
32:27 - that's a total of 100 million points and
32:30 - i'm doing
32:30 - 1 million point per points per frame
32:34 - so that's why i'm able to draw this
32:35 - loading bar and like if i just change
32:37 - this to like
32:39 - 1 million points and like a thousand
32:41 - points per frame
32:44 - well this is silly it doesn't need to it
32:46 - doesn't need to take this long
32:49 - now i'm just animating it for no reason
32:53 - so let's do all the points per frame
32:57 - i just want to see what i get
33:00 - actually that's not so bad so uh but
33:03 - the the the the amount of detail the
33:06 - quality of the image
33:07 - is not as
33:12 - fleshed out if you will as it really
33:15 - requires like a lot of points
33:17 - so let me put back to 100 million points
33:20 - and we'll let this render
33:24 - um certainly a job for the graphics card
33:28 - makes sense
33:30 - there probably is a way so anyway i
33:32 - would like to make a video to and this
33:34 - is what i was thinking of doing as a
33:35 - coding in the cabana video
33:36 - but i'm not ooh i like that one i'm not
33:38 - entirely sure
33:40 - i've gotten this right so and often with
33:43 - the coding of the cabana videos like
33:45 - um i don't really practice or figure it
33:47 - out in advance
33:48 - but this one like i really i was reading
33:50 - the paper and thinking okay well i'll
33:52 - just read the paper and then i'll go do
33:53 - it
33:54 - a coding challenge i would just that's
33:56 - how i would do it but this one
33:57 - i'm really intrigued by and i couldn't
34:00 - resist and plus i feel like i need to
34:01 - prepare for it
34:02 - so anyway that's there that's there for
34:05 - you to look at
34:06 - stay tuned um i will come back um
34:11 - and um and um hopefully you'll see a
34:14 - video about this maybe even in august
34:16 - because i if i'm going to do this coding
34:17 - in the gabano video i've got to record
34:19 - it this week
34:20 - marcos in the chat is asking was this
34:22 - linear or did you add a transformation
34:25 - function
34:26 - so the way that i'm doing this and let's
34:28 - see if
34:30 - i can kind of show it in the paper
34:35 - so the way that this works is
34:38 - um it's a three-step process
34:43 - where where first you
34:47 - apply a transformation
34:50 - a pre-transformation so there's a post
34:52 - transform
34:53 - which is right here and let's see if
34:55 - there's a pre-transform
34:57 - so each one of these transformations
35:00 - um you you have an input x y
35:03 - and then you have coefficients a b c d
35:06 - e f and so you take you say a times x
35:10 - plus b
35:10 - times y plus c this is like um applying
35:13 - a matrix transformation
35:15 - i think this is kind of like similar to
35:16 - what i've done in some of those in
35:18 - matrix transformation videos i've made
35:19 - so there's six coefficient that's the
35:22 - pre-transform
35:25 - and then there is also a post
35:28 - transform which is here
35:32 - uh again uh alpha beta
35:37 - gamma delta epsilon i don't know if i'm
35:40 - doing this right oh i'm so embarrassed
35:42 - but whatever six more coefficients so
35:46 - that's the pre and post and in between
35:49 - those two
35:50 - you you are applied one of these
35:51 - variations so
35:53 - in my code again i'm not entirely sure
35:55 - i'm doing this correctly
35:56 - but in my code if i look at the
35:59 - variation code
36:00 - um i have a function called flame
36:05 - where i get an input vector that's an
36:09 - input x and y so you can think of
36:11 - anything that's the p vectors in x and y
36:13 - and i apply a pre-transformation to that
36:17 - then i apply one of the variation
36:19 - functions to it
36:20 - then i apply the post transformation
36:24 - and that's just i have an array of
36:26 - coefficients
36:28 - zero you know coefficient zero times x
36:30 - one times y plus two
36:32 - three times x plus four times y plus
36:34 - five and then i return
36:36 - that vector and then i create when i
36:39 - create a variation
36:40 - i make those arrays they each have six
36:42 - things in it
36:43 - and i just pick the coefficients
36:44 - randomly
36:47 - so uh breaking news what's this
36:51 - is this is this what i'm looking for my
36:53 - marching cubes look up table simon
36:56 - i can't really get to it easily on the
36:58 - computer where i'm looking at the chat
37:00 - you might have to tell me more what that
37:01 - is
37:02 - um but um
37:05 - so so that's how i'm doing it so i'm
37:08 - doing a pre-transformation step
37:10 - applying any one of these variations
37:12 - like you can see this sinusoidal one is
37:14 - very simple
37:14 - it's just sine of x sine of y and then
37:17 - a post-transformation what uh what's and
37:20 - then so i could what i could do here is
37:22 - i could
37:22 - show you like what happens if i just do
37:26 - linear and let's let's just do like
37:31 - 10 million instead of so it's a little
37:33 - faster so i get nothing
37:37 - i've got nothing is it is it because i
37:40 - have so few points
37:48 - lars is making an excellent comment in
37:50 - the chat about the marching squares
37:52 - video
37:52 - would you mind adding that as a github
37:55 - issue on codingtrain
37:56 - website or just leaving it as a comment
37:58 - on the actual youtube video itself
38:00 - i'd like to return to that so i'm not
38:03 - getting
38:04 - anything let's try like what if i do
38:06 - just
38:07 - swirl so this is why i feel like i'm
38:08 - doing something wrong
38:13 - uh oh it's a triangulation table
38:16 - okay thank you simon i can get to it
38:18 - from from there
38:21 - so i'm not getting anything for these if
38:24 - i just use one variation maybe that's
38:26 - correct
38:27 - but it's clearly not because in the
38:30 - paper
38:32 - described in the paper there are these
38:34 - really nice examples
38:37 - of these visualizations of the
38:41 - singular variation i would really like
38:43 - to be able to reproduce these
38:45 - so i feel like until i can reproduce
38:46 - those diagrams i'm not ready
38:48 - to make that coding of the cabana video
38:51 - because i'm not
38:52 - entirely sure i'm doing this in the
38:54 - correct way now fortunately
38:56 - the creator of this algorithm themselves
38:59 - scott draves um
39:02 - uh messaged me on twitter and uh said
39:05 - they would look at
39:06 - a code so maybe i'll hear from scott
39:09 - draves
39:10 - um let me see if i can pull up what
39:13 - simon created really quickly
39:15 - just.github.com simon
39:19 - tiger i hope you made it public
39:20 - otherwise i won't be able to get it
39:23 - yep so this is an array of
39:26 - configurations
39:27 - each configuration is another array the
39:29 - numbers are the vertices of the cube
39:32 - every triple triple of numbers
39:35 - represents a triangle
39:36 - oh fantastic
39:41 - i think i understand how to use this i'm
39:44 - not entirely sure
39:45 - but this is perfect
39:49 - thank you simon i feel like maybe i've
39:52 - got till 10
39:54 - and you know you can see i've done
39:55 - nothing it's 8 40 i'm just talking
39:57 - um swiom is saying how do you choose
40:00 - which variation to
40:01 - apply great question let me go back to
40:03 - my fractal flame code
40:05 - so let's say i put all the variations
40:07 - back in
40:09 - the way i'm running the code and you can
40:12 - you can create a more
40:14 - sophisticated probability map but i am
40:16 - picking um one of these randomly
40:19 - so um i
40:22 - so i have all of these variations in an
40:24 - arraylist of variations
40:26 - and then each frame um
40:29 - i pick a random number between zero and
40:32 - the size of the arraylist
40:34 - then i pick that or variation and then i
40:36 - apply that variation to the current
40:39 - vector and i have a new vector
40:40 - so this is an iterative iterated
40:42 - function system
40:43 - by the way i i should have led with this
40:46 - the
40:47 - prerequisite so to speak for this
40:51 - particular uh algorithm
40:55 - if you want to if you want to like
40:57 - before you read the fractal flame paper
41:00 - and look at my code you should look at
41:03 - um coding challenge uh 123 the chaos
41:07 - game part one and part two
41:09 - because essentially a fractal flame
41:12 - is a uh an augmentation of exactly this
41:17 - particular algorithm the chaos game
41:19 - so but there's the addition of these
41:22 - non-linear transformations with
41:24 - polar coordinates and sine and cosine
41:26 - and all sorts of other extra stuff
41:28 - and mixing and matching so you can see
41:30 - if i just did
41:31 - a sort of more stan you know you could
41:33 - get these very specific fractal
41:34 - algorithms like the sir pinsky triangle
41:36 - with applying just a singular linear
41:39 - transformation
41:41 - okay um so oh alka is here
41:45 - hello i haven't seen alca in a while or
41:47 - maybe i'm just not paying enough
41:49 - attention
41:52 - nice to see you here all right where was
41:54 - i
41:57 - uh at nine o'clock i'll be taking a
41:58 - short break i'm gonna make sure my kids
42:00 - get set up with their chess class
42:03 - oh by the way hmm is anybody a roblox
42:06 - player out there
42:07 - because i am learning roblox coding and
42:11 - my kids and i are making a roblox game
42:13 - they made one called sword blocks
42:15 - i don't know how to find it maybe if
42:16 - they're when they're when they're in
42:18 - here
42:19 - i'll ask how do i if i could find
42:22 - i think they're the username on roblox
42:28 - um can i i don't i don't want to log in
42:32 - um if i know their username is there a
42:36 - url that i can just go to their page
42:39 - this is really sorry i'll come back to
42:42 - that i'll look for it when i take a
42:44 - break
42:44 - show you their roblox game they wanted
42:46 - people to play it but i was not really
42:47 - ready yet so
42:50 - um okay alka is confirming that i do pay
42:53 - attention
42:56 - alka's not been around that much okay
42:58 - welcome back
43:00 - all right let's get to the good stuff
43:03 - let's start
43:04 - looking at some of the variations that
43:07 - post over some people made
43:08 - so first of all uh we've got a little
43:11 - thing go so
43:12 - thank you to violet who does uh and so
43:14 - many people
43:15 - niko and many others as well but i
43:17 - wanted to thank violet in particular
43:19 - um they do a lot of work on the coding
43:21 - train website and github repositories
43:24 - um and created a new methodology for
43:27 - when a coding video has many many
43:29 - examples involved
43:30 - that here's all the p5 versions you can
43:33 - download the code view the code go to
43:34 - the web editor
43:35 - here's all the processing versions i
43:36 - love that it has the little logo this is
43:38 - this is mostly it doesn't look so crazy
43:41 - because if i go to
43:42 - like a particular video like let's say i
43:44 - just go to
43:46 - uh tic-tac-toe like we just got this one
43:49 - p5.js
43:50 - so it looks sort of normal and then
43:53 - i think we recently realized like oh
43:55 - this uh particular coding in the cabana
43:58 - uh example has so many so i think it
44:00 - might be nice to redo this design a
44:02 - little bit if anybody's a designer out
44:03 - there has some ideas
44:05 - maybe it makes more sense to uh compact
44:08 - this horizontally and like just put it
44:09 - up here
44:10 - i don't know but um so if you have ideas
44:13 - about that but that's why
44:14 - there's this sea of examples and i'm
44:16 - gonna come to some of them but
44:17 - we don't have um i i didn't do a big
44:20 - push in discord i know that kobe has
44:22 - really helped with this in the past
44:24 - of getting people to post encouraging
44:26 - people to post their contributions
44:28 - even if you just play with one of the
44:30 - examples you change some colors
44:33 - i think one thing that you could really
44:34 - try that i didn't that i wish i had
44:36 - emphasized
44:37 - in the video is change what's being
44:40 - drawn
44:40 - you have eight possible possible
44:43 - configurations
44:44 - for what you would draw in a square you
44:46 - don't have to draw the lines exactly
44:48 - like
44:48 - you could draw circles you could draw
44:51 - triangles
44:52 - you could draw the lines in the wrong
44:54 - places like what kind of patterns would
44:55 - you get so i encourage you to make
44:57 - your own um version of it but let's look
45:01 - at what people have created so first
45:04 - let's look i don't know so some of these
45:06 - i might not be able to
45:07 - run uh if um for example i don't know
45:10 - that i can easily run python pi game
45:12 - although that would be fun to try to
45:13 - figure out right now
45:14 - but let's look at re24's source code
45:19 - and well
45:22 - thank you ari for your beautiful
45:24 - community contribution let's just look
45:26 - at it python
45:28 - so this is cool because what ari seems
45:31 - to have done here
45:32 - is write their own um
45:37 - vector like like p5 vector ported p5
45:41 - vector
45:41 - to python that is so cool lerp
45:45 - all the functions are here that is
45:47 - amazing
45:48 - great job i think a train whistle for
45:50 - that for sure
45:53 - um that is wonderful so that's really
45:55 - nice to see if i knew how to run pygame
45:57 - quickly i would run this
45:59 - so again i know i've mentioned this but
46:02 - something you can do
46:03 - that i would recommend ari if you're
46:05 - watching is add a readme file
46:07 - and then in the readme file you can
46:09 - embed an image and so that way if
46:10 - somebody's looking at it
46:12 - coming to there and they want to see
46:13 - like you could explain a little more
46:14 - about it
46:15 - you know i don't know how much traffic
46:17 - these community contributions generate
46:19 - but that's what i would want to see if
46:20 - i'm browsing the internet and looking
46:22 - for different examples and i wasn't
46:23 - familiar with pygame
46:25 - that i would want to see a readme file
46:26 - there with some annotations so
46:28 - it's as easy as pip install pie game
46:32 - okay um marching squares
46:35 - in a purlin noise field
46:40 - let's take a look at that so maybe by
46:41 - the way i should very very briefly
46:43 - just show um
46:46 - the example from the video so this is
46:49 - the example from the video just so we
46:51 - can sort of get a sense of what people
46:53 - have done that's different
46:54 - this is just the raw marching squares
46:57 - algorithm over a field of per
46:59 - of open simplex noise so let's go back
47:03 - and look at greg kreisman's marching
47:06 - squares in a perlin noise field
47:08 - oh cool oh look at this so
47:12 - anytime i see some sliders i get very
47:14 - excited
47:15 - that means i can play with this in real
47:17 - time
47:19 - zoom so that's cool because oh what i
47:22 - like about this i like the fact that i
47:23 - see the full square there
47:25 - and you know it looks so interesting
47:27 - about this algorithm it looks like these
47:28 - continuous paths
47:29 - but really they only connect because of
47:31 - the sort of cleverness
47:32 - of the algorithm if you will really each
47:35 - square is looked at individually with a
47:36 - line drawn so that's what i mean what
47:38 - would happen
47:38 - if you just drew the lines in a
47:40 - completely different way
47:42 - i think that's some creative possibility
47:44 - artistic possibilities here let me zoom
47:46 - all the way back out
47:46 - oh cool and uh let's what does this one
47:50 - do the noise step
47:52 - oh so that's just like how fast so one
47:54 - of the things that's interesting about
47:56 - purlin noise
47:58 - i don't know how well we'll be able to
47:59 - see this so this look
48:01 - wow it looks like is it just me or are
48:04 - we panning over the
48:06 - noise field vertically i think we are
48:10 - uh that's a pretty interesting way of
48:12 - doing this
48:14 - also i mean which is totally fine but
48:16 - one of the things that i did in my video
48:18 - is i add oh no maybe this is just
48:20 - because of the zoom
48:21 - yeah that's just because of the zoom the
48:23 - zoom level i had it didn't make it all
48:24 - the way to the edge
48:27 - just just could you bear with me for a
48:28 - moment to sneeze
48:34 - was i muted all that time
48:49 - [Music]
49:14 - do
49:18 - okay i'm back sorry about that
49:22 - um so with with so a couple things one
49:25 - is um i don't know whether this is you
49:28 - uh it says purlin noise which i know
49:30 - there's a lot of
49:31 - not controversy sort of speed but
49:32 - there's a lot of different
49:34 - uh stages of development that pearl and
49:37 - noise that the sort of
49:38 - purlin noise went through so in
49:41 - processing and p5
49:43 - uh when when i say pearly noise i'm
49:45 - really referring back to the sort of
49:46 - classic
49:47 - early 1980s perlin noise algorithm
49:50 - but um that particular algorithm has a
49:54 - lot of sort of repeating patterns in it
49:57 - and has a different quality than open
49:58 - simplex noise so that's one thing i was
50:00 - curious to see if we could notice
50:02 - but also um the way that i animate
50:05 - is in the way that i animate it in my
50:07 - example is by using the third dimension
50:11 - uh sort of step through slices of
50:14 - noise 2d noise in a 3d space whereas
50:17 - this looks like it's taking
50:18 - noise in a 2d space and panning down
50:21 - that but i'm not entirely sure that's
50:23 - true
50:23 - i mean we could look at the code let's
50:25 - look at the code
50:27 - uh and let's see um
50:31 - where there yeah so this is using the
50:34 - just the noise function in p5 and it
50:37 - says noise
50:38 - z and z is
50:42 - interesting going up by rows so i think
50:45 - that's sort of like
50:47 - it looks like this is one dimensional
50:50 - noise
50:51 - somehow but the way that it's like being
50:54 - used is maybe going over the columns and
50:56 - then sort of panning
50:57 - i don't know oh gregory's in the chat
51:00 - so that's my question for gregory in the
51:02 - chat is this is a surprise to me
51:05 - to see only one argument here in the
51:08 - noise function
51:09 - if you look for example at my code
51:12 - and again i'm not saying one's a correct
51:14 - way or an incorrect way of doing it
51:16 - that's no such
51:17 - thing i i love the quality this like
51:20 - panning quality that's happening it's
51:21 - quite beautiful and unique
51:24 - i just i'm interested in comparing it so
51:27 - if i go back to
51:29 - mine and i go here to web editor
51:32 - and i look for where am i calculating
51:36 - noise right
51:37 - i am calc my noise function
51:40 - has three arguments x y z
51:45 - by the way the sun has now moved and i'm
51:48 - in the light again it would appear
51:57 - ah simon is by the way i missed
51:59 - something in ari's python contribution i
52:01 - would love to go back to it but i'll
52:02 - just mention it
52:04 - one of the things that it always makes
52:05 - it tricky in processing or p5 and java
52:08 - or javascript
52:09 - is with vectors you have to use these
52:11 - add functions or
52:13 - call these functions to do vector math
52:14 - you can't use the plus minus
52:17 - multiply um operators but in python you
52:20 - can overload those operators so you can
52:22 - actually say vector one plus vector two
52:25 - um i'm not saying an answer to this
52:28 - question which is fine i don't need one
52:29 - right now but that's an interesting
52:30 - that's an interesting uh difference to
52:32 - note
52:33 - okay let's come back to
52:40 - um oh another python one okay i might
52:43 - have to
52:43 - might have to figure out how to run some
52:44 - python stuff today since there's two of
52:46 - them
52:47 - i just did the most simple noise from
52:49 - one dimension yes so that's interesting
52:51 - because
52:51 - uh gregory figured out something very
52:53 - very clever and i'd have to go back and
52:54 - really un unpack the code a bit more
52:57 - but i it never occurred to me that there
53:00 - might be a method
53:01 - for using one-dimensional noise but
53:03 - spreading it out
53:04 - over a two-dimensional field
53:08 - and then even animating it over time and
53:10 - i think there must be some combination
53:12 - of using like a global starting variable
53:14 - and then incrementing over the 2d space
53:16 - and then moving the starting variable
53:18 - with each frame of animation
53:19 - super interesting technique um okay
53:22 - let's look at marching squares with 3d
53:26 - purlin noise
53:27 - by josh
53:30 - um oh great see readme file
53:35 - [Music]
53:36 - that's a ding and a train whistle for
53:39 - both gregory and josh here
53:41 - so first of all rainbow colors
53:45 - you had me you had me at rainbow colors
53:47 - i love how you figured out to sort of
53:49 - like
53:50 - fill in this area um and that's
53:53 - really quite and and fill it in with
53:55 - these with this sort of rainbow gradient
53:57 - that's very unique
53:58 - um weighted colors based on average of
54:00 - each cell's corners
54:02 - uh it looks a bit smoother but the gif
54:04 - has some quality loss
54:05 - oh look at that so that's interesting so
54:08 - i again
54:08 - i think a lot of times um just by
54:12 - varying the drawing style and the color
54:15 - you can come up with some really unique
54:18 - artistic uh variations of the sort of
54:21 - core algorithm
54:23 - so i really appreciate that here's some
54:25 - terrain deformation oh look at that
54:28 - so that's kind of cool to like just use
54:30 - it to create this terrain and then it's
54:31 - almost like
54:32 - it's like food that this little square
54:34 - is running around and eating
54:38 - whoa oh this is didn't make it yeah
54:42 - so this is what i was assuming i would
54:46 - get
54:47 - if i take marching squares
54:50 - into marching cubes and run it over
54:53 - like a 3d open simplex noise field this
54:56 - is what i was kind of assuming i'd get
54:57 - so i'd love to tackle that
55:00 - i don't know when sometimes i
55:04 - i don't know sometimes i wonder
55:07 - [Music]
55:10 - so thank you for this this is fantastic
55:13 - i love that you have the documentation
55:15 - and the code that people can look at
55:16 - beautiful work
55:18 - and we've got one more here by fan by
55:22 - principle uh marching squares with
55:25 - square
55:26 - contours p5.js
55:32 - so oh yeah so this is what i was saying
55:35 - so i love this
55:36 - so this is the idea of instead of using
55:39 - the
55:40 - original sort of like iso lines that
55:43 - go from the midpoints what this
55:46 - variation does
55:47 - by fan by principle is uses like
55:49 - straight
55:50 - horizontal and vertical lines which has
55:52 - a really nice quality to it
55:54 - um it feels very kind of retro
55:57 - in a way switch solution wait where's my
56:00 - mouse
56:01 - so now we see the original and switch
56:04 - background
56:04 - oh look at that
56:09 - so that's really nice to see thank you
56:12 - so these are
56:12 - these are wonderful so i i tend to try i
56:15 - really do try to look at all of these i
56:16 - do miss some
56:18 - um and um
56:21 - i know that david isn't here for this
56:22 - live stream but i'm going to pull up
56:24 - something
56:24 - so let's let's just say that you are
56:27 - watching today you didn't realize that
56:29 - you could
56:30 - submit your own community contribution
56:32 - and have it appear on this page
56:35 - so the links you want to look at are
56:37 - this you can also add your own version
56:40 - see how so i think if i click on see how
56:43 - this will give a bit of a page hey i
56:45 - have a little video walkthrough that you
56:46 - can watch
56:47 - um i think it's still a date and then
56:49 - there's a little bit of a text
56:50 - explanation for how to do it
56:53 - and uh if i click on this link add your
56:56 - own version it's going to take me right
56:58 - to the page that you need to edit it's
57:00 - actually going to open it up as
57:01 - so you do the only thing you need is you
57:04 - do need to sign up for
57:06 - a github account there's probably some
57:08 - way to do it without signing up for
57:09 - github account
57:10 - i don't know what that is um um
57:13 - but um so and there it's it's confusing
57:16 - which uses this weird
57:18 - a markup language called yaml yet
57:20 - another markup language
57:21 - or i think there's some other um
57:26 - variations of that why aml um but
57:29 - basically
57:30 - uh you need to follow this format of
57:34 - uh contra under where is it under
57:36 - contributions
57:37 - where's that contributions you can see
57:40 - that you just need a title
57:42 - an author with a name and a url and a
57:45 - source
57:46 - oh but you can also have a url for your
57:48 - project
57:50 - and then a source url so um
57:54 - you know it's tricky so what i would do
57:55 - is i would just take this
57:57 - i would copy it i would like sort of
58:00 - paste it in here i would try to get the
58:02 - indentation to be the same and i would
58:04 - say like marching
58:05 - wacky and i would put my name
58:11 - daniel schiffman and i would change the
58:14 - url and stuff and then i would go down
58:16 - here
58:17 - and i would hit uh well i wants me to be
58:20 - able to commit it directly it's not
58:21 - going to let you do that
58:22 - it's going to create a new branch and
58:25 - start a pull request
58:26 - and you can follow through i'm not going
58:27 - to do this right now to follow through
58:29 - these steps
58:29 - it looks like oh my god am i going to
58:31 - break things i'm going to do it wrong is
58:32 - someone going to yell at me am i doing
58:34 - don't worry think of hearts
58:38 - and rainbows when you're on the coding
58:40 - train github
58:42 - we are here and say we being the
58:44 - community and some people that are
58:46 - specifically helped maintain the repos
58:47 - along with myself
58:49 - are here to help are here to encourage
58:51 - you are here to welcome you in with open
58:53 - arms if you've
58:54 - never filed a pull request before if
58:56 - your
58:57 - variation is exactly the same as
59:00 - the example well that's fine too there's
59:03 - no threshold
59:04 - of achievement we just want you to share
59:06 - uh
59:07 - and feel a sense of accomplishment and
59:09 - participation
59:10 - um in the community so i really
59:12 - encourage you to do so
59:14 - no matter your experience level no
59:16 - matter your background
59:18 - and you know if you run into
59:21 - any issues i guess probably emailing
59:24 - info at thecodingtrain.com is an email
59:26 - address but you can tweet at
59:28 - shiffman or at the coding train and you
59:31 - can also
59:32 - but but really what i would say if you
59:34 - want to help in particular
59:36 - with github and submitting your
59:37 - contribution i'm going to leave this
59:39 - page
59:39 - the best way to do that is to go to the
59:42 - issues page
59:43 - and click new issue so you could click
59:46 - new issue
59:47 - and you could say i would love some help
59:55 - and then you could write here is my
59:57 - question that i would love
59:59 - help with now one thing i'll say is um
60:02 - this isn't really the place for getting
60:05 - uh help with debugging your code uh what
60:08 - i mean more is like help
60:09 - making a contribution or a pull request
60:11 - if you want to if you want help
60:13 - of debugging your code or have a code
60:14 - question
60:16 - the best place for that is actually the
60:17 - discord and so i think i have a little
60:19 - button here
60:21 - um if all goes well the discord will now
60:23 - appear in the chat appeared twice
60:26 - you can join the discord and there's a
60:27 - lot of help channels there where the
60:29 - community
60:29 - will answer questions um yeah
60:33 - okay that's marching squares
60:37 - it is nine o'clock it is time
60:40 - look at me on schedule sort of
60:44 - and it's time for me to check in with my
60:46 - children and their chess
60:48 - class i but hey
60:51 - here's my segue i found a new way to
60:54 - stay on task
60:55 - and stay on schedule and so i'm so
60:58 - excited
60:59 - to tell you about a new sponsor
61:02 - for the coding trade and i'm going to
61:04 - press the button correctly
61:06 - notion and what i oh the thing that i'm
61:08 - really excited about this is i don't
61:10 - even have to ask you to buy anything
61:12 - um there of course there are premium
61:14 - plans and different things that you can
61:15 - get
61:16 - but um with notion which is a
61:19 - productivity software that breaks the
61:20 - mold
61:21 - by combining all essential work tools
61:23 - notes docs
61:24 - databases did i say databases databases
61:27 - you know the way that i'm using it right
61:29 - now
61:30 - so uh if you're a coding trained member
61:34 - you're probably missing your rewards i'm
61:36 - supposed to mail you a sticker
61:38 - or a notebook and
61:41 - i do have piles of envelopes and labels
61:44 - i have these new thank you cards over
61:46 - here
61:47 - i'll give you a little more of a
61:48 - close-up view of it on these thank you
61:50 - cards that i'm sending out
61:52 - um i'm so so late with these and i'm so
61:55 - so sorry
61:56 - um but one of the ways i'm organized
61:59 - with it now is i have
62:00 - all of the members names in the notion
62:02 - database
62:03 - and with the address that i need to send
62:05 - stuff to what i can check off when it's
62:06 - done so i am getting organized
62:08 - with um notion um
62:13 - let me click over to here so
62:16 - notion works like a box of software
62:18 - legos letting you flexibly stack
62:20 - these tools however you want to build
62:21 - your own productivity system so
62:23 - it used to be that to get a personal
62:25 - plan it was five dollars a month
62:27 - but now all personal plans are free
62:30 - forever so free users will be able to
62:31 - add as many blocks as they like
62:33 - to their personal notion database
62:35 - students are using notion for class
62:36 - notes
62:37 - managing tasks organizing job
62:38 - applications you can learn about this at
62:40 - notion.so students
62:44 - high school and college oh high school
62:47 - and college educators use notion to
62:49 - create syllabi
62:50 - communicate with their students and
62:51 - easily publish information the web guess
62:53 - what
62:53 - i'm a well i'm not a high school i'm a
62:55 - college educator
62:57 - in addition to just playing one on tv
62:59 - youtube oh i hear the chess
63:01 - classes started um can you hear oh and
63:04 - i've got a new member
63:05 - um so i didn't actually even realize
63:08 - that until i started looking into notion
63:09 - that's something i will definitely
63:10 - consider maybe there's a way that i can
63:12 - even spin up
63:13 - a coding train course using notion that
63:14 - might be fun to try
63:16 - um and oh and this is this is what
63:20 - there's a mobile app this is what it
63:21 - looks like
63:22 - uh on the mobile app um you know i have
63:24 - to say like i was saying earlier that
63:26 - the way that i have traditionally kept
63:27 - track of my like task lists and to-do
63:29 - list
63:30 - is by just emailing myself or use a text
63:32 - file all right once i tried using github
63:34 - for a while and didn't
63:35 - like issues with my to-do list but i'm
63:38 - i'm really excited i've been trying in
63:39 - the last couple weeks since uh
63:40 - notion got in touch with setting up and
63:42 - keep keep with a to-do list and it's
63:43 - working quite well but
63:44 - really the the the game changer for me
63:47 - has been organizing all of the coding
63:48 - train
63:49 - uh member rewards and things like that
63:51 - so
63:52 - um notion is great for the office has
63:55 - been used by the wall street journal
63:56 - verizon and even pixar
63:58 - i love pixar uh create a company wiki
64:01 - wiki see database wiki i love these
64:03 - terms i have a feeling
64:04 - that there's an api or notion is working
64:06 - on an api i feel like i saw something on
64:08 - the website
64:08 - that's something that would be really
64:09 - exciting to me if i could uh you know
64:12 - as a coder and programmer work with it
64:13 - that way
64:15 - so you can answer questions at scale
64:17 - onboard new employees and track every
64:19 - project catalog logos fonts and assets
64:22 - so thank you so much uh to notion
64:25 - for being a sponsor of the coding train
64:27 - i'm going to take a
64:28 - short break and check on my kids and
64:30 - their chess class
64:31 - uh about five minutes um and if you're
64:34 - interested in checking it out please go
64:35 - to
64:35 - bit.lee notion coding train because that
64:38 - will let them know that you
64:40 - found it through the coding train and
64:42 - you know just
64:43 - a little bit a little bit you can do to
64:46 - that that helps me out as well
64:47 - okay um that's
64:50 - all uh i have to say and i will be back
64:53 - in
64:54 - just a short a bit
65:00 - and the laptop sound is not working
65:04 - where is the music what happened here
65:11 - there we go okay i'll be right back
65:22 - [Music]
65:48 - dog
65:51 - [Music]
66:51 - [Music]
67:17 - [Applause]
67:19 - [Music]
67:40 - do
67:47 - [Music]
68:36 - so
68:42 - [Music]
69:41 - [Applause]
69:46 - do
69:48 - [Music]
70:29 - and we're back how's it going
70:33 - i just made it just back the whole time
70:35 - thank you notion again bit.lean ocean
70:37 - coding train
70:38 - um the whole time i was trying to log
70:40 - into my roblox account
70:43 - and the password wasn't working i was
70:44 - trying to reset the password i failed
70:46 - oh well i believe my roblox username
70:49 - is actually codingtrain no i don't mean
70:52 - it's actually codingtrain i mean it's
70:54 - actually codingtrain the word actually
70:57 - coding
70:58 - train and if i could log into that
71:01 - i could find i think i have i think i'm
71:03 - in my kids
71:05 - like game studios called ducky studio
71:07 - and then there's a game in there
71:08 - called sword blocks i couldn't find it
71:10 - sometime in the future
71:12 - i will come back and live stream some
71:14 - roblox coding
71:15 - um um in fact i've been just as a little
71:19 - plug
71:20 - i've been watching the alvin blocks
71:23 - youtube channel
71:24 - part of i'm a member of the alvin
71:25 - block's youtube channel and part of
71:27 - their discord
71:28 - where i've been learning uh roblox
71:30 - coding so
71:32 - my uh my roblox game
71:36 - development empire is starting now and
71:39 - probably
71:40 - not going to happen there was something
71:43 - else that i wanted to just mention
71:45 - ah yes so where am i off to next
71:49 - on the coding train uh alka says i hope
71:53 - you look at
71:54 - my marching squares it's not finished
71:56 - but it's a nice effect
71:57 - oh was there another contribution that i
72:00 - missed
72:06 - i don't know where i find it is there a
72:08 - pull request open
72:15 - aha oh wait wait wait
72:18 - open 43 minutes ago i don't see alca oh
72:22 - so unfortunately if you send it to me in
72:24 - the discord
72:25 - there's no way for me to access it on
72:27 - the stream
72:28 - that's way too much technology for me i
72:31 - have the link on this computer
72:33 - right over here and there's just no way
72:36 - i could ever possibly get it onto this
72:38 - computer
72:39 - i mean i could type it in manually so
72:41 - please um add it
72:42 - uh add it as an issue if you want to
72:45 - just put it
72:46 - as an issue here i will look at it but
72:49 - let's look at these two
72:51 - um
72:54 - [Music]
72:56 - update marching squares so so here so
73:00 - one of the things that i uh
73:01 - really asked people to do um and no
73:04 - worries
73:05 - srakshan 98 um it's not entirely clear
73:09 - but in addition if you could the reason
73:11 - why the template
73:12 - um has a this part in it is please add a
73:17 - link to it
73:18 - here because this way i could just click
73:21 - um i could just click on it right here
73:23 - to look at it otherwise
73:24 - i have to go into here then i have to
73:27 - find it here
73:28 - then i have to sort of manually copy it
73:29 - out which is no problem just a little
73:31 - bit of an extra step
73:32 - but let's take a look at this
73:35 - cool so this is marching squares
73:39 - playable oh look at that with the
73:42 - with the keyboard i can move this little
73:44 - dot around super fun
73:45 - and i think this was done with
73:46 - typescript
73:50 - train whistle for typescript great work
73:53 - thank you for sharing that
73:54 - and next we have
74:00 - um so same thing only holy
74:04 - um please when you file your issue
74:07 - um if you could also just link to the
74:09 - project right here
74:11 - that way i see it i click on it because
74:13 - that's honestly like they come
74:15 - onto my email um and i can just click on
74:17 - and look at him in my email otherwise
74:18 - i've got to go to the webpage and click
74:20 - around
74:21 - thank you my anime jim very kind of you
74:25 - and i'm going to go here to interpolated
74:28 - contour lines oh i like the sound of
74:30 - this
74:32 - um and let's run this
74:37 - whoa
74:40 - whoa that is really cool
74:43 - oh i love that so i'm curious like how
74:47 - did you create the number field
74:50 - to make this kind of pattern i mean it
74:52 - has a very
74:53 - simplexy noisy like quality but it's
74:56 - different
74:57 - let's see if we can take a quick peek
74:58 - here um
75:00 - move myself up here for a second um
75:04 - so where is the feel oh it's just it's
75:06 - just using a different
75:09 - set of values for noise and i guess with
75:12 - interpolation and the colors
75:14 - it really has a different quality to it
75:16 - so that's amazing to me that this is
75:17 - using the basically the exact
75:19 - same code but just through tweaking
75:21 - different parameters
75:22 - and using color in a creative way i
75:24 - really thought like oh there's something
75:26 - different underlying here
75:27 - so that's wonderful
75:29 - [Music]
75:31 - issue alka's version is now as an issue
75:39 - and let's work in progress marching
75:41 - squares contribution
75:43 - and let's go over here on oh i love that
75:46 - let's take a look
75:49 - whoa that is wow so
75:52 - i assume there's some kind of like
75:54 - interesting blending that's going on
75:57 - i love the sort of like 3d quality to
76:00 - this
76:01 - um it's really lovely
76:05 - i feel like it's like a little portals
76:08 - into another dimension or being opened
76:09 - up for me to look through
76:12 - quite beautiful
76:15 - so what i wanted to mention is i do try
76:17 - to look at these community contributions
76:20 - and this reminded me that if i go
76:23 - back to the issues
76:27 - gypsy dangerous here a coding train
76:29 - contributor and viewer and member
76:32 - created this wheel of contributions
76:36 - which randomly picks
76:40 - so we're going to look i'm going to just
76:41 - do one because i want to move on to
76:43 - uh importing a 3d model into processing
76:45 - that'll be kind of where i finish off
76:46 - today
76:48 - um so what this does
76:51 - is it looks back through all of the
76:53 - contributions
76:54 - that i have never shown on a live stream
76:56 - it loads i guess one two three four five
76:58 - six internet
76:59 - ten of them randomly and then i can spin
77:02 - the wheel
77:07 - [Music]
77:14 - wow that's right on the line
77:20 - looks like it's in the red well actually
77:22 - we can tell it's in the red because the
77:23 - background is red
77:24 - so i can also say remove and view
77:26 - selected
77:27 - and what we've got is asteroid field
77:31 - by bossy smacks the original
77:34 - challenge is uh this one
77:38 - ah this is coding challenge number one
77:41 - which was done and i just like when was
77:43 - this done let's go over to youtube
77:45 - how long ago look at me look at this
77:46 - youthful glowing
77:49 - short-haired oh it was a simpler time
77:53 - back in april 2016. oh boy
77:58 - get me a time machine now oh boy
78:02 - let's go back to april 2016.
78:05 - things will things will turn around i am
78:08 - hopeful
78:09 - um uh first coding challenge um
78:15 - this guy has to be the happiest
78:16 - developer alive that's very kind of you
78:19 - um and uh now uh mike
78:27 - i still have some sleep in my eyes i
78:29 - think
78:30 - um or my glasses just need to be cleaned
78:33 - what was i doing
78:34 - okay we're looking at this contribution
78:36 - there it is so let's take a look at the
78:39 - asteroid field
78:40 - which is a variation of the starfield
78:42 - example
78:44 - oh awesome oh this is such a
78:48 - perfect transition to talking
78:52 - about 3d
78:55 - because it looks like to me that these
78:58 - are little like
78:58 - 3d models um i don't know how
79:02 - i'm sure there's a way that i could get
79:03 - to the source code since this is hosted
79:05 - on glitch
79:07 - oh boy do i have some interesting glitch
79:09 - tutorials coming up for you in the fall
79:11 - i have figured out how to run a twitter
79:14 - bot
79:15 - off glitch with web hooks and reply all
79:18 - this stuff oh i'm so excited about it
79:21 - uh if you want to like enter into a very
79:24 - random
79:24 - i know i'm just like
79:27 - mr tangent today i guess i'm always that
79:30 - way
79:31 - let me go up uh and just to go into a
79:34 - completely other tangent austin is
79:35 - asking me if i've checked out
79:37 - stand-up maths video on complex
79:38 - fibonacci numbers no
79:40 - but everybody keeps telling me to maybe
79:42 - that should just be my next
79:44 - coding in the cabana video that was
79:45 - suggested yeah 2016 was pretty beautiful
79:48 - so okay not anyway um so
79:52 - when i'm up
79:57 - time out focus focus i've got 40 minutes
80:01 - left
80:02 - what i love about this is it looks like
80:04 - it's taking that star field example
80:06 - which was just using
80:07 - um 2d dots and maybe replacing them with
80:10 - 3d models or something that has a
80:12 - more of an asteroid like quality to it
80:15 - i think i could probably move over to
80:17 - glitch and find the source code
80:18 - but um thank you if you if you bossie
80:22 - happen to be in the chat please say
80:23 - hello um but i'm gonna move on
80:26 - so close a bunch of these
80:29 - windows that was when i tried to use a
80:32 - timer
80:33 - uh i will get back i will get back to
80:35 - doing coding challenges again
80:38 - um some people it's interesting the
80:40 - feedback that i get um
80:42 - uh it's very mixed in term i think
80:44 - people mostly the feedback i get is
80:46 - positive thank you very much
80:47 - people like the coding cabana videos
80:49 - they like the coding challenge videos
80:50 - some people seem to very strongly prefer
80:53 - the coding challenge style of just like
80:57 - in a studio with green screen coding
81:00 - coding coding
81:01 - some people like the sort of zen quality
81:03 - i mean i'm not
81:04 - i don't think it's very sad but the
81:06 - different style of the coding cabana
81:07 - with a bit more editing and
81:08 - being sort of in this outdoor space um
81:12 - my plan was always to do both but having
81:14 - trouble
81:15 - finding the time these days okay
81:22 - oh it wasn't 2020.
81:26 - sorry i get everything wrong ah deep
81:28 - breath all right
81:30 - we are here ready to load
81:33 - mewtwo into processing and let's make a
81:36 - world
81:37 - of flocking you choose that's what i'm
81:39 - going to attempt to do
81:40 - in about the next 40 minutes and i will
81:42 - hope that you will take your
81:44 - so so if you want to uh follow along and
81:47 - make your own
81:48 - version the first thing you'll need to
81:49 - do is go back and watch this blender
81:52 - tutorial
81:53 - from chrissy one of the things i really
81:55 - want to get into a better habit of
81:57 - is if i just put time codes in the video
82:01 - description
82:01 - it will make it into chapters and you
82:04 - could find the specific
82:05 - things you're looking for i have a lot
82:08 - of people who
82:09 - work on different coding train projects
82:11 - and nobody at the moment is doing that
82:13 - so i would welcome that as a
82:15 - contribution it's something that i would
82:17 - actually be quite open to hiring
82:19 - somebody to do to like sort of go
82:21 - through the back catalog and time code
82:22 - everything
82:23 - but um you know at this point
82:27 - but also i would take a volunteer so we
82:28 - could sort of think about if anybody's
82:30 - interested in that get in touch
82:32 - um but i wanted to also just give a
82:33 - shout out because this fundraiser is
82:35 - still going
82:36 - on the tender foundation which is an
82:38 - organization that supports mothers in
82:40 - need in atlanta georgia
82:42 - you can still donate we reached the goal
82:46 - for the coding train match but i'm sure
82:48 - the tender foundation would
82:50 - appreciate additional donations if
82:51 - you're if you feel so inclined and are
82:54 - able to donate
82:55 - so i'm going what i'm going to do now is
82:58 - i'm going to open up blender
83:00 - i can't believe i'm opening a blender
83:02 - wait what happened
83:05 - is blender gone uh finder
83:09 - applications blender i don't know what
83:13 - happened
83:14 - it's like let's see if it runs
83:17 - i do not have oh you know what happened
83:20 - that's so weird hold on i think i can
83:22 - fix this
83:26 - hold on
83:30 - give me a moment here talk amongst
83:32 - yourselves
83:35 - [Music]
84:14 - duplicate stop i can't believe what i'm
84:18 - doing right now
84:21 - you don't want to know permissions
84:25 - permissions permissions
84:31 - permissions permissions
84:34 - [Music]
84:42 - permissions
84:46 - [Music]
84:54 - after all of that
85:03 - all right let's just reinstall it
85:06 - [Music]
85:09 - why do you forsake me
85:14 - [Music]
85:16 - replace
85:16 - [Music]
85:25 - wow kay wickman joined as a patron
85:29 - after watching the mender sponge
85:31 - challenge
85:32 - when was that
85:35 - let's first of all see it do i appear no
85:38 - oh
85:40 - [Music]
85:43 - [Applause]
85:44 - april 17th you've been a patron
85:48 - since 2016 oh that was cody challenge
85:51 - number
85:53 - oh two goodness oh thank you k week fun
85:56 - maybe
85:56 - the longest i don't know who the longest
85:58 - patron is
85:59 - i'm gonna have to look that up that's a
86:01 - thing i can look up i'm sure
86:03 - you're definitely in the running
86:11 - by the way i paid my children in robux
86:16 - to decorate all of these
86:17 - [Music]
86:20 - so last night they were up very late at
86:23 - night
86:23 - coloring and decorating these lovely
86:26 - children they are
86:29 - [Music]
86:30 - um ethan writes hey dad what you coding
86:34 - the funny thing is my son and i have a
86:37 - joke
86:38 - which is that i like to say things like
86:39 - son i'm going to teach you a life lesson
86:42 - and he just starts to laugh
86:44 - falls on the floor laughing it's so
86:45 - ridiculous
86:47 - no one takes me seriously
86:50 - all right um
86:54 - what was i doing oh yes reinstalling
86:56 - blender
86:58 - let's see let's see how did that go
87:07 - all my sound effects are in different
87:08 - places now
87:10 - yes open
87:16 - blender okay so now let's open up
87:21 - um i think this is my model coding train
87:24 - model which should be called muchu
87:29 - what's happening let me close this
87:34 - there's mewtwo so
87:37 - what i need to do is export
87:44 - um iraqi ask is there a discord without
87:46 - patreon yes there is
87:47 - i'm giving you the link right now um
87:51 - so one of the things i'm not sure about
87:53 - is
87:54 - well let's just see what happens so this
87:56 - is mewtwo
87:58 - let's uh select and let's go to
88:01 - file uh export
88:04 - and i'm going to export as an
88:07 - obj so i'm exporting as an obj
88:14 - and then oh and i think i already did
88:16 - this fortunately
88:18 - but i spelled it wrong i told a new chew
88:21 - with c-h-e-w that's hilarious
88:25 - let's spell it correctly mu
88:29 - chu coding train desktop that works
88:34 - export x wait wait hold on are there
88:37 - things selection only
88:40 - object says obj objects scale
88:43 - path mode i don't know what any of this
88:45 - stuff means
88:50 - uh i don't know what any of this stuff
88:52 - means so i maybe so let's just see
88:57 - export object okay there we go so now
89:01 - i should have on the desktop um
89:05 - here is so there's the obj file what's
89:08 - interesting is to look at these files
89:10 - so let's look at these files in
89:14 - visual studio code which of course is
89:16 - not a thing
89:17 - that's open right here
89:25 - so
89:29 - let's uh open
89:33 - uh desktop
89:36 - let's look at these two files so a
89:38 - couple things one is so
89:39 - the mtl file and by the way this is all
89:42 - totally new stuff to me i don't really
89:43 - know what i'm talking about
89:44 - this is the material file um
89:47 - so it has information about the material
89:50 - somebody in the chat will explain what
89:53 - material means
89:54 - but more what i'm kind of fascinated by
89:57 - is the obj file
89:58 - so the obj file is literally just a list
90:02 - of vertices x y z x
90:05 - z xyz xyz so it seems like oh i'm
90:08 - exporting this file like
90:10 - we could write our own code that comes
90:13 - up with a
90:14 - 3d shape calculates all these vertices
90:16 - writes it out to an obj
90:17 - file and then imports it into say a
90:21 - program like blender
90:22 - or any other 3d modeling program so
90:24 - usually the way that i
90:26 - the only way that i've known how to do
90:28 - things is by working in code
90:30 - and exporting that way an obj file but
90:32 - now the difference here is i have with
90:35 - my bare hands
90:36 - really the mouse modeled out of digital
90:39 - clay
90:40 - the beautiful wonderful mewtwo character
90:43 - i love you mewtwo if i ever get another
90:46 - pet its name is definitely gonna be
90:48 - mewtwo
90:48 - gloria where's gloria are you around
90:51 - here
90:52 - oh gloria's not here gloria's usually
90:54 - sitting right next to me this whole time
90:56 - i don't know where she went
90:57 - um but anyway uh
91:00 - gloria if i ever get you a doggy brother
91:03 - or sister
91:05 - mewtwo will be its name i don't know if
91:07 - my kids will
91:08 - go with that but but now this looks
91:10 - right i should be able to import this
91:12 - into processing so let's uh
91:15 - close out fractal flame um
91:19 - please get in touch if you work on uh on
91:21 - github
91:22 - or twitter if you uh go back and if
91:25 - you're watching my discussion of fractal
91:27 - flames and have any answers or thoughts
91:28 - for me
91:29 - i'm gonna hit don't save um let's
91:32 - i think what i'll do is let me create a
91:35 - new sketch
91:36 - um new sh mewtwo flock
91:42 - and let's add setup
91:46 - let's add draw
91:50 - we'll make a nice window
91:54 - i don't know i don't know what for old
91:57 - times sake
91:58 - we'll say background 51. and oh this is
92:02 - definitely going to need to use the 3d
92:04 - renderer
92:06 - and then i want to make a folder called
92:09 - data
92:10 - and what i want to do is get my model
92:14 - and bring it in and put it in the data
92:18 - folder
92:19 - oh do you hear that little boy
92:21 - [Music]
92:23 - i think that sound effect is happening
92:25 - it's very exciting
92:29 - apple if you want to get in touch and
92:31 - need somebody to record some new sound
92:32 - effects for you
92:33 - every time somebody drags and moves the
92:35 - file you could have
92:38 - just think about it give me a call i'm
92:40 - available
92:45 - um so now i should be able to say p
92:48 - shape
92:49 - mewtwo i think and
92:53 - chew equals load shape
92:56 - and then just the name of the file
92:59 - mutu.obj
93:03 - and then um
93:07 - translate to the center
93:12 - and draw mutu so this should be the
93:15 - basic code
93:16 - for loading an obj file into processing
93:19 - and displaying it
93:23 - what's the chance
93:27 - oh that that you you always have been
93:29 - hearing that sound effect that's so
93:30 - funny
93:31 - i just never heard it in my monitor
93:32 - before i set things up in a different
93:34 - way
93:37 - wait i think that's mewtwo there
93:41 - there's mewtwo
93:45 - i need a i need a like heavenly
93:49 - sound they don't have that do i have
93:51 - anything that fits
93:55 - yeah there's youtube youtube
93:59 - that doesn't work so that was weird that
94:01 - made me very uncomfortable
94:03 - okay um so i think
94:06 - i just need to say scale to
94:10 - make youtube bigger ah there's mewtwo
94:14 - let's add some lights
94:20 - there we go oh it's upside down uh let's
94:23 - say uh
94:24 - translate one comma negative one that
94:27 - flips the world
94:29 - has y point up no
94:33 - do i need to do that first
94:38 - wait i'm confused why is mucho upside
94:41 - down
94:43 - mewtwo you're upside down oh were you
94:45 - not upside down before and i was just
94:46 - confused
94:51 - i'm so confused let's um
94:58 - should i should i just use pz cam here
95:00 - let me do a rotation
95:01 - uh angle equals zero uh rotate
95:05 - y angle angle plus
95:08 - equal like some small rotation
95:14 - oh no mewtwo is not reference point
95:17 - around the center
95:23 - oh did i write scale oh i have scale 100
95:26 - here
95:29 - i think if i do this
95:33 - whoa yeah so i flipped mewtwo around
95:37 - the lights are weird but mewtwo is not
95:41 - oh so how someone's gonna have to help
95:43 - me figure out how to do this in blender
95:47 - shoot um i think
95:50 - okay let me go back to blender
95:54 - oh where's chrissy chrissy call chrissy
95:57 - phone a friend uh
96:01 - so frank is asking you didn't have to
96:02 - write all the code
96:04 - to read the points and connect them
96:05 - right so i didn't have to do that so
96:08 - this is a great question
96:09 - so i was showing you what's in the obj
96:11 - file and i could
96:12 - parse it and create all the geometry
96:14 - myself and that would be a
96:16 - super exciting fascinating thing to do
96:18 - however
96:22 - that's what processing has built into it
96:24 - a uh p
96:25 - shape class and it knows how to read obj
96:28 - files and render that geometry so i'm
96:30 - making
96:30 - use of that i have to make the object to
96:33 - the origin
96:34 - select the object and alt g says marcos
96:37 - okay so alt is probably option
96:41 - select option g
96:45 - maybe i have to group it first
96:48 - uh is there a way to like group it how
96:51 - do i group
96:52 - oh g
96:56 - oh no that's what i no
97:01 - i mean i could just take this now and
97:03 - move it back
97:08 - and then maybe the center is the head
97:13 - how to set mesh origin alt g won't do it
97:17 - okay hold on
97:22 - okay uh press f3 and
97:25 - origin to geometry i don't have f3 you
97:28 - think i have an
97:29 - f3 button on this apple keyboard i've
97:32 - got this magical touchpad
97:34 - that blinks and it gives me emojis i
97:37 - i do have an escape button thank
97:39 - goodness but
97:40 - there's no f3 good luck finding the f3
97:44 - function
97:44 - oh there we go function never knew how
97:46 - to do this before
97:47 - f3 um
97:50 - f3 origin to geometry
97:54 - origin snap cursor to world origin
98:01 - a to select all shift s actually i think
98:03 - i've seen this shift
98:04 - s ah which one of these
98:07 - cursor to world origin no
98:12 - did that do it
98:15 - cursor to selected selection to cursor
98:20 - that's kind of like what i did before
98:25 - uh shift s right origin
98:31 - which one now people this is definitely
98:40 - search for it no no no why
98:44 - search when i have a chat with 520
98:47 - people watching
98:48 - who are you people what is going on
98:53 - usually this i i like very specifically
98:55 - did not promote this stream at all
98:57 - because i was like i don't really want
98:59 - anybody to tune in
99:03 - i need to be in object edit mode first
99:09 - object i forgot tab gets me to edit mode
99:12 - right i thought it was tab
99:17 - am i in edit mode
99:24 - oh yeah i wish i was on a call wait
99:26 - solar liner we can make this happen
99:28 - we can make a call happen selection to
99:31 - cursor keep
99:32 - offset okay so oh this one
99:36 - thank you boom did that do it
99:40 - selection to cursor i'm doing it over
99:43 - and over again
99:44 - all right i'm i'm going to hope that
99:46 - worked this is so frustrating
99:49 - sorry solar liner uh okay
99:52 - let's see if that worked file
99:56 - export
99:59 - uh i'm reading your chat solar line i'm
100:04 - reading it directly
100:06 - uh but maybe i got it right now let's
100:09 - let's uh
100:13 - you two let's replace oh whoops
100:16 - um
100:20 - okay hold on export
100:24 - obj let's set it to
100:27 - uh documents processing mutu
100:31 - flock data let's see if this did it
100:42 - oh where'd muchu go
100:47 - oh i wrote translate one i see ah
100:51 - translate it should have been scaled all
100:52 - right let's make this call happen
100:54 - solar liner i can get you but problem is
100:57 - i don't think i can
100:58 - people can hear you but let's see uh
101:00 - solar liner let's go into a voice
101:02 - channel um
101:05 - did you friend request me okay
101:10 - where where are you solar liner
101:14 - we're gonna we're gonna make this happen
101:16 - just go into the
101:18 - um
101:24 - okay okay hold on hold on hold on solo
101:26 - let's make this call thing happen
101:28 - uh disable um how do i find my
101:32 - friend requests friend
101:35 - solar liner oh wait wait okay
101:40 - hold on i'm a professional live streamer
101:44 - people
101:45 - i've lost where i am okay solar liner
101:49 - uh view profile send message
101:54 - hello okay now
101:58 - call
102:03 - hello
102:06 - uh oh
102:09 - okay wait can people hear
102:14 - i your your audio is very
102:18 - your audio is very unclear to me you
102:21 - cannot hear it
102:28 - okay i have to hang up i can't hear you
102:31 - at all
102:34 - hello oh that's much better
102:39 - all right hold on let me see if hold on
102:40 - hold on i'm going to see if your audio
102:42 - will go into the stream
102:44 - all right now say something
102:47 - i will say something one two okay hold
102:49 - on way too loud
102:51 - try again
102:55 - okay okay so solar liner is now
102:58 - audio is now in the stream and
103:01 - um i'm also uh going to
103:05 - uh screen share with you so you can see
103:07 - what i'm doing without the delay
103:10 - so hold on a second start my obs virtual
103:14 - camera
103:15 - oh not screen share turn on camera
103:18 - and then oh i don't know why it's uh
103:21 - reversed
103:22 - so horizontal flip okay so can you see
103:25 - in discord now um
103:29 - and hear me still uh in this car it is
103:32 - flipped in discord on my end okay i
103:34 - should have fixed it now
103:35 - oh it's flipped on your end is it not
103:37 - flipped now yeah yeah yeah okay
103:39 - sorry there you go okay okay
103:42 - okay we've got a a spontaneous guest
103:45 - here who knows blender
103:47 - and uh um is going so i
103:50 - can you can see my blender screen now
103:52 - yes yes i can
103:54 - okay tell me what to do this is very
103:56 - exciting all right so
103:58 - you have basically what's happening is
103:59 - that you i don't know if you see but you
104:01 - have to when you
104:02 - it shows when you select the meshes you
104:04 - have orange points
104:06 - yes those orange points represent the
104:09 - origin
104:09 - of each of the meshes offset
104:12 - they're like in where place because what
104:14 - happened during the last room is that
104:16 - you move the geometry in edit mode which
104:18 - moves
104:18 - the vertices but not the origin
104:22 - there's a function uh in blender with
104:24 - the f3 menu
104:25 - and there's a search bar top and if you
104:28 - type
104:30 - origin to geometry yeah there's a set
104:34 - a set origin on the f3 menu
104:38 - this one set origin origin to geometry
104:43 - oh sorry i zoomed
104:47 - this one i think i've i've lost your
104:50 - video
104:51 - i messed it up probably by zooming let
104:53 - me stop and start it again
104:56 - is it back uh-oh
104:59 - right i'm back okay right there's a
105:03 - uh um origin to geometry okay i'm gonna
105:06 - select that yep okay like an option on
105:10 - the menu
105:10 - got it
105:14 - and then now what
105:17 - i'm done now uh-oh my internet
105:20 - connection is not helpful
105:21 - it's not a help photo uh yes it worked
105:23 - okay now i think you can
105:25 - maybe uh maybe you can try exposing
105:28 - that i'm not sure if uh
105:31 - i'm not sure the processing is going to
105:33 - handle both meshes maybe
105:35 - there's an option to join the matches
105:37 - okay well let me
105:39 - let me export it and let's see
105:43 - all right
105:46 - oh that looks oh wait hmm
105:50 - did you did you uh i don't think you've
105:52 - moved the new file
105:54 - i i uh i think so no these are the new
105:57 - files
105:58 - let me delete them oh because
106:02 - export
106:08 - oh volume increase on guest okay sorry
106:10 - you're very quiet i'm gonna move it up
106:12 - okay
106:13 - okay um
106:20 - all right i exported it okay so the
106:22 - second okay so
106:24 - um we're gonna try the second method the
106:26 - second method is to
106:27 - do ctrl j or command j i think on mac
106:31 - from blender that's gonna take the two
106:33 - meshes and join them into one
106:35 - yeah it also moved them around in a
106:37 - weird way and now hold on so
106:39 - ctrl j command j
106:45 - too loud now okay okay okay too loud now
106:49 - uh um
106:53 - command or command my my internet is not
106:56 - it's not being cooperative right now um
107:01 - i think that's only one mesh yeah
107:04 - yes now you can try the l the alt g
107:08 - uh key to center the
107:12 - center dimension oh no that's two meshes
107:14 - actually
107:17 - you can add any more like you can you
107:19 - can work with the f3 menu if you search
107:22 - but one thing couldn't i just do this a
107:25 - join
107:26 - selection to
107:29 - cursor to world origin and then
107:32 - selection to cursor
107:34 - and then can i just move this one yes
107:39 - like what if i do this that's not gonna
107:41 - work
107:45 - uh that's not that's not gonna work no
107:49 - that's not gonna work because what you
107:51 - need to do is you need to bring mucho to
107:53 - the center of the grid in blender
107:58 - hold on let's see here i've lost the
108:01 - regular chat
108:03 - right click set origin geometry to
108:06 - origin
108:09 - oh yeah i was not
108:13 - i was not aware that this was an option
108:15 - in the new versions of blender
108:19 - i used to i used to use blender back
108:21 - before there was
108:22 - back in the times where you had to right
108:24 - click to select if that uh
108:26 - thanks to people select both control
108:30 - control j okay ah there we go
108:34 - i got it joined it's one mesh now
108:38 - yes okay and now so now the origin is
108:42 - still
108:42 - lopsided uh still in a weird place so
108:45 - you can try that
108:46 - trick of uh setting the origin to
108:48 - geometry again
108:49 - so that was
108:53 - the right click set origin origin to
108:55 - geometry i don't have
108:57 - i don't have a right click option
109:01 - i have shift s whoops
109:05 - you can't you can't right click on the
109:07 - mac os what is this
109:08 - cursor which one of these i feel like
109:10 - this selection the cursor oops
109:14 - should work that sets the origin to the
109:17 - cursor but the origin is still
109:19 - blocked like it's still an offset from
109:21 - the mesh so you need to reset the origin
109:23 - you need to make the origin at the
109:25 - center of the mesh and then you can
109:27 - use that to sometimes so that was
109:29 - function f3
109:31 - yeah um set origin origin
109:35 - origin to symmetry oh but that messes up
109:38 - the model
109:43 - oh because yes uh let me see the
109:46 - under on the right is a wrench tab
109:49 - on the bottom right that's the modifiers
109:51 - panel
109:54 - on
110:00 - uh on the right of the app
110:05 - there's a there's a set of tabs colorful
110:08 - icons
110:09 - oh yeah these and then there's a wrench
110:12 - yeah
110:14 - uh yeah so apply that modifier
110:17 - there's an apply button on the top yep
110:20 - there we go and now you can do again the
110:22 - set origin trick
110:24 - so function f3 set origin origin to
110:28 - geometry
110:30 - oh i see that look there we go there's a
110:32 - little dot look at that dot
110:34 - it's so perfect that represents okay
110:37 - okay file export
110:40 - no no no no wait wait wait wait wait
110:42 - wait wait wait there's one more step
110:44 - okay one last trick for my final trick i
110:47 - will make it centered
110:49 - now you can do the shift s um selection
110:52 - textures or
110:53 - selection the correction and then oh
110:56 - look at that
110:58 - okay and now you can export it uh
111:03 - export to obj
111:08 - right here and now open up processing
111:12 - and there we go
111:16 - we did
111:19 - myself it but i did it okay
111:22 - thank you thank you for that all right
111:24 - i'm hanging up this call
111:26 - and because i think now i'm ready to
111:27 - move into processing thank you so much
111:29 - go back to okay
111:35 - all right we're back everybody whoo that
111:38 - was rough
111:39 - that was rough but i learned something
111:41 - there uh
111:43 - and i'm just trying to get all my
111:46 - monitor stuff back i
111:48 - was like some real technical gymnastics
111:50 - virtual cam go away now why is the light
111:54 - so weird but that i'm not too worried
111:56 - about i could let me translate i have an
111:58 - idea
111:58 - let me translate this back a little bit
112:03 - yeah i mean
112:07 - uh let's see what other kind i want to
112:10 - be able to see it
112:12 - so this is really now a processing issue
112:17 - let me see this is really what i meant
112:21 - to do
112:29 - let's set the world back a little bit
112:30 - more
112:34 - okay there we go so i'm not seeing any
112:36 - of the nice shading of mewtwo
112:39 - um but i
112:42 - am seeing muchoo so great so i i can i
112:46 - can maybe try some other kind of
112:47 - lighting
112:49 - oh i took the lights out whoops
112:58 - interesting so oh maybe because the
113:00 - material
113:01 - let's um let's go to uh processing
113:04 - reference
113:06 - for 10 minutes people it's okay
113:09 - uh lights ambient light let's try
113:12 - ambient light light specular
113:16 - so many options directional light let's
113:20 - try
113:21 - i like how this looks so let's try this
113:24 - directional light and ambient light
113:28 - see how that looks
113:34 - hmm i wonder if it's like something to
113:38 - do with the material
113:40 - um
113:47 - it might be it might be actually an
113:49 - issue with the model itself
113:52 - um
113:56 - let's put in uh
113:57 - [Music]
113:59 - let's put in a box
114:04 - and see what that looks like no
114:13 - the box is also
114:22 - no stroke this is like this example
114:29 - is it because it's like directly in the
114:31 - center maybe i need to move the
114:33 - light what if i use a point light
114:38 - because i think a point light is like
114:43 - yeah let's try this
115:02 - weird
115:04 - oh wait what is going on
115:14 - okay there we go now i'm seeing
115:17 - something
115:24 - i think i have an idea i have an idea
115:29 - i know this seems crazy but i have an
115:31 - idea
115:32 - ambient light let's try this
115:42 - yeah okay i have an idea
115:45 - which is um
115:49 - i'm going to re-export
115:52 - i think there's an option let me just
115:54 - change the scale in here
115:56 - so i'm going to change the scale here
115:58 - and see if that i mean this seems like a
116:00 - crazy
116:03 - and now
116:10 - okay that's a oh that's because the box
116:14 - is there
116:17 - okay
116:21 - the normals are inverted because of the
116:23 - scaling and processing
116:24 - change the direction with the up axis oh
116:27 - i see
116:28 - all right let's um let's get rid of this
116:33 - oh yeah look at that ah
116:37 - ah look at that okay also the the
116:40 - mutual's really all deform okay oh okay
116:43 - i have an idea
116:44 - so let's just uh rotate
116:48 - uh flip it around the x-axis
116:54 - 180 degrees pi
117:00 - is that right there we go and now let's
117:03 - get rid of the box
117:10 - [Music]
117:16 - out of its head
117:21 - okay so i could have changed the export
117:24 - uh i could have changed the export why
117:26 - what did i do i did something to the
117:28 - model where it's all
117:29 - like um right because oh no no
117:32 - that slice this was not
117:36 - i did something to the model where it
117:37 - lost that's fine mewtwo has a little
117:39 - slice cut out of it
117:41 - no problem no problem okay people
117:44 - ready for this now i've got a crazy idea
117:48 - let's go to examples
117:52 - let's go to uh
117:57 - topics simulate
118:00 - flocking okay so this is the flocking
118:04 - example
118:06 - so what i want to do is change this to
118:10 - flocking it's not really i'm not really
118:11 - doing 3d flocking i'm going to do
118:14 - i'm going to call it flocking plane but
118:16 - i'm going to change this to
118:18 - a p3d i'm going to change
118:23 - i want to
118:26 - and then i want to draw um just want to
118:30 - rotate it by like a little bit
118:32 - let's if i'm looking at it this way i
118:35 - want to just
118:35 - offset the x-axis by like 45 degrees
118:41 - yeah so okay perfect so now i want these
118:46 - voids
118:47 - to be
118:50 - at zero zero and
118:54 - the flock the voids the edges
119:00 - should be um well i'm just going to make
119:03 - up something
119:11 - i mean this is ridiculous what i'm doing
119:14 - because i should put that into a
119:15 - variable
119:22 - okay so the flocking is now happening on
119:25 - this like plane
119:27 - whoa watch i would like to be able to
119:30 - see
119:31 - so let's draw now a
119:36 - uh rectangle rectmode
119:40 - center so let's do let's call
119:43 - let's let's create a variable that's
119:45 - like the dimensions
119:47 - make that 500. so i want to make draw a
119:51 - rectangle at 0
119:52 - 0 dimension times 2 dimension times 2
119:56 - let's say stroke 255
119:59 - and a fill let's give this
120:02 - a fill with some alpha should see
120:06 - yeah that's the plane
120:10 - so when they get to the edge great so
120:13 - what i want to do is and let's uh
120:16 - let's uh send this out a little bit
120:24 - um i mean i've got some like major
120:27 - perspective
120:28 - issues
120:31 - uh and let's make the plane
120:36 - like much bigger so it sort of like
120:38 - fills the space
120:42 - okay and let's also actually let's do
120:44 - let's get pz cam
120:48 - because i think pz cam is gonna be a
120:51 - nice thing
120:53 - for me to have and
120:57 - i always forget how it works so i'm
121:00 - going to go to contributed libraries oh
121:02 - come on
121:02 - processing i'm going to restart
121:06 - processing
121:19 - um let's open up
121:24 - just to have um contributed libraries
121:28 - pisa cam i just want this basic one
121:34 - so this allows me to sort of like zoom
121:37 - in and out
121:38 - and move around the space so
121:41 - um let me
121:44 - go back to my flocking plane
121:52 - and a piece of cam
121:55 - over here flocking plane
122:00 - so i just need to create a piece of cam
122:05 - and cam equals new
122:09 - pisa cam
122:14 - and import
122:18 - piece of cam
122:21 - and i think that's all i need to do
122:24 - to have like a basic pz cam
122:28 - and now i don't i think i don't need
122:30 - this anymore or this
122:33 - let's see what i get
122:37 - yeah so i can fly around
122:41 - i don't know what and see
122:45 - the like little ants i kind of need a
122:48 - bigger window here
122:53 - um and maybe let's make this 200
122:58 - whoa okay i like this
123:01 - let's rotate
123:06 - let's put that rotate x back in just to
123:09 - have it start a little bit offset
123:13 - and actually let's zoom out
123:16 - further
123:21 - i like actually seeing the plane
123:29 - uh
123:37 - okay this works
123:41 - so now i can i've got this little world
123:44 - this little
123:44 - plane and it's got like the flocks
123:47 - moving on it
123:49 - and what i want to do now
123:52 - is put my mewtwo characters there
123:56 - so let's go to
124:00 - uh open recent um
124:04 - mewtwo flock which is what the other
124:07 - thing is
124:08 - so uh and i need to just transfer over
124:11 - the data file
124:14 - the data folder i would like to fix the
124:17 - model
124:18 - so maybe someone can help help me with
124:19 - that um
124:22 - but what i thought actually is like
124:23 - maybe i could get one of the community
124:25 - uh created models um
124:29 - so now oops yeah that's fine
124:32 - so oh i didn't want that to go away come
124:34 - back
124:36 - so i want to create p shape mewtwo
124:40 - load mewtwo
124:46 - and then in the flock no in the boyd
124:54 - um i'm gonna have to i want this
125:00 - so where before i was drawing a triangle
125:04 - translating to the position and rotating
125:07 - by the angle which i still want to do
125:09 - i don't want the triangle anymore i want
125:12 - to
125:13 - flip let's first flip muchu
125:17 - oh and probably mewtwo is going to be
125:19 - sitting at the center of the plane
125:21 - so i'll have to translate up a little
125:23 - bit but let's just see what happens
125:30 - i think muchu is huge
125:34 - scale
125:45 - what's going on oh there's too many
125:48 - calls to push me oh i forgot the pop
125:49 - matrix
125:51 - that's important there we go
125:55 - you two where are you
125:58 - there you are
126:03 - this is not exactly what i had dreamed
126:05 - of oh yeah
126:06 - so if you choose like in sliced down the
126:09 - middle
126:12 - uh so let's see here um
126:16 - let's translate
126:19 - up a little bit um like to translate
126:22 - let's offset
126:26 - let's rotate mutual and then translate
126:29 - off by like 50.
126:34 - whoa what did i just do that's is that
126:38 - the wrong
126:39 - no no no yeah i want to
126:42 - orient mewtwo and then pop it up a
126:45 - little bit
126:47 - like let's just make it oh scale is
126:50 - happening aft
126:51 - what is going on
126:59 - uh oh god
127:04 - position x y
127:07 - then rotate oh no
127:11 - no no no no no i want to move i need
127:14 - something to translate here
127:21 - right because oh not y
127:25 - what z z translate up
127:28 - like z i want
127:32 - so this would be there we go so now the
127:35 - flock is like above the plane
127:37 - but i only need to translate by like
127:41 - 55 i think
127:46 - yeah still let's try i mean
127:49 - i'm sure there's a scientific way of
127:51 - doing it
127:54 - there we go
127:57 - is my scale i want to just i want to
128:00 - just mute you to be smaller
128:03 - yeah so let's see if i add some lights
128:06 - now if that'll do something
128:14 - there's my little creatures go run
128:17 - around
128:17 - flock with each other this is
128:21 - this is not turning out like i had hoped
128:23 - let's try
128:24 - adding some lights
128:28 - can i do something with material oh
128:31 - there we go
128:33 - oh wait mewtwo is sideways
128:36 - mutual is sideways
128:42 - oh the zooming is like mewtwo is
128:46 - sideways okay all right so
128:50 - this rotate
128:54 - by x by pi
129:02 - is wrong
129:05 - still sideways
129:10 - oh i just need to also no that's right
129:13 - but i also need to rotate by
129:14 - y 90.
129:18 - is it y or z
129:22 - no z is rotating like this x
129:26 - yeah this should be no no no not not
129:27 - that by
129:30 - not x rotate y pi divided by two this
129:32 - should get mutual to stand up
129:36 - there we go
129:43 - why are they wiggling like that
129:46 - i like that look at that little just
129:49 - flocking around wiggling
129:53 - i think they're wiggling because
129:58 - of this rotation this root
130:02 - so first first stand it up
130:05 - flip it over
130:08 - then rotate along z yeah they should be
130:11 - turning the direction they're moving
130:14 - yeah no it's right
130:17 - uh-oh i'm so confused
130:21 - okay hold on let's do these one at a
130:24 - time
130:25 - this should stand them up
130:29 - no that didn't stand them up
130:36 - i'm so lost i'm just going to try every
130:39 - axis
130:40 - yes that stood them up okay rotate
130:43 - x stands them up and they're actually i
130:46 - that also they're in the right
130:49 - orientation their head is on top
130:51 - so now i should be able to just rotate
130:53 - by the direction that they're going in
131:01 - not along z is that so if they've stood
131:04 - up
131:05 - oh maybe i'm y then is the direction
131:07 - that they're moving in
131:10 - there we go now they're rotated
131:14 - in the direction they're moving there we
131:16 - go
131:22 - there we go
131:25 - so this is exactly what i meant to
131:28 - happen
131:30 - now let's do let's have them be
131:35 - half the size
131:44 - that's better
131:47 - and let's make um
131:53 - let's make many more of them
132:04 - there we go
132:11 - so muse fly sort of fitting to have them
132:13 - above
132:14 - now i could add
132:18 - z there's absolutely no reason
132:23 - now that i'm in 3d why i couldn't give
132:26 - them a z
132:28 - and have their
132:32 - vector a little bit all the vector mass
132:35 - should be the same
132:39 - um give them an initial
132:50 - give them an initial 3d velocity vector
132:54 - oh they're flying
132:59 - oh my god flocking in 3d the problem is
133:04 - i need to give their i need to give them
133:06 - a bounding box
133:08 - also along z
133:12 - and this should be right now that i have
133:15 - that global
133:16 - variable
133:19 - and then i should do it for
133:28 - z
133:39 - now let me draw the box
133:43 - let me draw instead of a rectangle
133:47 - i think if i do box dimensions times two
133:51 - and i should say no fill
133:55 - stroke weight eight let's make it
134:00 - this should be their bounding box
134:07 - [Laughter]
134:11 - okay this is pretty wild not what i
134:13 - expected to make
134:16 - now i feel like the flocking is
134:20 - very clumpy
134:23 - so what do what parameter this is just
134:26 - the sort of like
134:27 - core example so a couple things i could
134:30 - do
134:31 - is let's wait the separation
134:34 - much more let's wait separation more
134:41 - because it'll make them a little more
134:44 - and
134:46 - i think i also need to
134:49 - think about their distance that they see
134:51 - each other
134:52 - like their desired separation is just
134:54 - 25.
134:55 - so let's make this uh 10
134:59 - of the dimension and then i think
135:02 - in alignment let's make this
135:05 - 20 percent
135:09 - and cohesion let's also make that 20
135:12 - so i think this should keep
135:23 - how to paint them pink
135:27 - um can i i
135:30 - think in i can do this
135:39 - i think i can apply a fill
135:43 - no
135:48 - let me
135:51 - have this zoomed out
135:56 - i guess that's i don't know what this
135:58 - argument does
136:02 - okay it does do what i think it does
136:07 - no it's like the like something about
136:09 - like the field of view or something
136:12 - i think i was i'm confused about what
136:14 - this argument is
136:16 - um and then because i can do this
136:27 - whoa
136:31 - what is going on
136:38 - there we go this is what i was looking
136:39 - to see oh no no that's bad
136:44 - oh i don't know how to use pz cam let me
136:47 - actually just take off pz cam
136:55 - oh wow that perspective is so weird
137:09 - that's sort of what i expected to see
137:12 - and
137:19 - what happened to my angle oh i don't
137:21 - have it anymore
137:33 - oh okay okay okay relax everybody
137:37 - that was kind of fast pink
137:40 - ambient light okay we'll try that
137:46 - oh they're sideways again because i did
137:49 - something
137:51 - i guess not using pz cam
137:56 - um
138:04 - this is what i wanted to see but i kind
138:06 - of want to have pz cam
138:08 - also so let's see if i can make that
138:11 - happen
138:12 - so if i change this to
138:21 - put the pz cam back in what if i do this
138:30 - whoa
138:36 - i don't know i don't know what's
138:37 - happening anymore
138:44 - oh i'm above everything there we go
138:48 - this works
138:52 - all right
138:57 - use pizza cam with mouse okay there's so
139:00 - now all right
139:01 - i gotta i gotta slow down stop
139:05 - let me try
139:08 - oh i rotated space not the cam
139:11 - oh i can rotate the cam
139:15 - right
139:18 - but this is fine i like this i like
139:20 - being in the middle actually
139:22 - so let's see if i can get um ambient
139:25 - light that's pink
139:26 - let's try that
139:31 - um if i say ambient light 255
139:35 - 50 255. let's see what this does
139:41 - yeah there we go okay
139:45 - now we're talking all right does
139:48 - anybody have yeah i should do and avoid
139:51 - the boundary
139:52 - i should have a force that pushes them
139:54 - back in
139:55 - but i i gotta stop this is enough
139:59 - i gotta go this is the project i wanted
140:01 - to make
140:02 - now the question is could i get a i mean
140:04 - i love mute my mewtwo
140:07 - but does anybody marcos
140:10 - does is your model available
140:14 - could you export your mu
140:17 - your mute your mu model
140:27 - because i would like to see how this
140:29 - looks with a
140:31 - um a better a better or different model
140:35 - also i want to see how many i can really
140:37 - fit in
140:39 - so how many
140:42 - oh this is i don't need this
140:46 - how many do i have 300 let's try 500.
140:56 - oops
141:08 - i like how they're actually just
141:09 - rotating along the x y plane
141:12 - it is in another computer oh well
141:16 - did anybody is i forgot to ask chrissy
141:20 - for her
141:21 - uh mew model but i can get i can get
141:24 - that i can just share it on social media
141:26 - um
141:31 - what happens by the way so
141:34 - maybe well i think i'm done
141:40 - let's try making this uh full screen
141:45 - i think i'm done for today it is 10 20
141:47 - i'm 20 minutes past where i meant to be
141:57 - i mean one thing that would be
141:58 - interesting here is
142:00 - i kind of like so i sort of have a weird
142:02 - idea
142:04 - which is let me get rid of this box
142:09 - and
142:12 - now i'm just in the middle here now of a
142:15 - world
142:20 - of i'm upside down they're so far away
142:24 - without the box i'm really lost
142:31 - oh there we go this is what i wanted to
142:34 - see
142:37 - remove the mewtwo fill line
142:41 - is that really going to make a
142:42 - difference
142:49 - oh yeah
142:58 - the other kind of question i have is i
143:01 - have both
143:01 - lights and ambient light
143:08 - so that's with just the ambient light
143:12 - so i guess it's good to have them both
143:14 - does it matter what order this is in
143:18 - oh interesting it does matter
143:24 - so maybe this light doesn't need to be
143:26 - as bright
143:38 - oh is youtube's compression having a
143:39 - hard time with this sorry
143:42 - so if you can make a now imagine if i
143:46 - had multiple models
143:50 - i don't know i kind of want to fix the
143:52 - little like
143:54 - cutout there or maybe that's just sort
143:56 - of like a nice quality
143:59 - um i would want to put in like an octree
144:01 - or quad tree so i could just have so
144:02 - many more
144:06 - um but i think i'm done for today
144:09 - [Laughter]
144:11 - unless anybody has like a really really
144:14 - like
144:16 - great suggestion of something i should
144:17 - absolutely do
144:19 - or a mew model
144:24 - there can be only one oh interesting
144:28 - so am i doing yeah
144:35 - let's see what other i mean part of me
144:38 - wants to
144:39 - actually follow the perspective of one
144:43 - of them use
144:44 - all right that's the last thing i'm
144:46 - gonna do
144:49 - um but i think that's gonna mess up oh
144:51 - no because
144:52 - all right let me look at pz cam
144:55 - let me understand pz cam a little bit
144:57 - more because i can't stop
145:00 - hello pc cam off screen
145:04 - hello pc head up display no camera
145:06 - states
145:08 - what's that
145:13 - does this do
145:23 - so i think if i wanted to follow one of
145:26 - them
145:27 - i couldn't use pz cam instead
145:32 - what i would do is oh i'm in the wrong
145:35 - thing like right
145:36 - if so let's take let me take out pz cam
145:39 - again
145:46 - and this is just the default view but if
145:49 - i want to
145:49 - follow one of the muse for example
145:53 - if i were to say
145:57 - void follow
146:01 - equals
146:04 - and let's get rid of this rotate y for a
146:07 - second
146:08 - equals flock dot boyds.getzero
146:14 - flock.boyds.get0.
146:16 - so that's the very first void in the
146:19 - array
146:20 - couldn't i just translate to the center
146:23 - of that void
146:24 - follow dot what is it called position
146:32 - position
146:36 - i mean like there is a look at function
146:38 - and a camera function in
146:40 - but what if i just translate to
146:43 - that void's location
146:51 - and everything is drawn relative to it
146:54 - oh negative
147:06 - oh but then i would need to draw
147:08 - everything offset from
147:11 - now wouldn't this work
147:16 - like if i translate the world then it's
147:19 - going to be at 0 0.
147:24 - oh but i also need to translate to the
147:28 - center
147:40 - but i feel like i should be flying
147:44 - through
147:56 - can't you move the cameras yeah but
148:00 - like this particular boy
148:03 - should always be at the center
148:09 - let's zoom out a little bit
148:23 - it's a bit off-center i know
148:27 - what am i missing here
148:34 - we're tracking it but we're too far away
148:39 - but it should be if it's being drawn at
148:42 - its
148:42 - position its position should be
148:45 - at
148:48 - oh this isn't really where the camera is
148:56 - maybe i do need to use the processing
148:57 - camera all right let's try that
149:00 - or look at isn't there like a look at or
149:02 - camera
149:04 - wait i wrote a tutorial about this
149:17 - p3d look there's a tutorial about this
149:23 - uh
149:23 - [Music]
149:27 - lighting okay perspective
149:31 - okay camera eye position
149:34 - scene center upwards axis
149:38 - okay let's use the actual camera
149:46 - i'm gonna keep this
149:51 - all right
149:56 - okay great so that's this is with the
150:00 - camera
150:02 - being at the sort of like
150:10 - so the arguments are i position
150:17 - so the i position i actually want it to
150:19 - be at zero zero
150:23 - what happens if i just make it zero zero
150:24 - zero
150:26 - then the scene center
150:30 - is also
150:33 - zero zero zero and the upwards axis
150:39 - is zero one zero right so
150:42 - i position scene center up
150:46 - axis
150:50 - oh there's everything let's also not
150:53 - make this full screen anymore just
150:55 - a little easier to see
150:58 - so typically
151:02 - if the eye position now should be offset
151:05 - from this right
151:11 - okay yes so i'm above the scene
151:16 - okay i'm above the scene
151:20 - but now what i want to be is i want to
151:22 - be at
151:24 - oh no no i want the scene center
151:30 - to be this particular
151:43 - boyd okay
151:46 - so i'm getting closer here
151:53 - but what do i where do i want the
151:57 - oh the eye position should just be like
152:00 - a little bit
152:00 - offset what if i had the eye position
152:05 - where that boy is
152:10 - oh but i'm looking i can't that doesn't
152:12 - make sense
152:15 - can the oh can the scene center still be
152:17 - this
152:19 - but the eye
152:27 - i don't feel like i'm flying around
152:33 - i think i am though
152:40 - did i oh z
152:45 - i thank you
152:53 - yeah this is me flying around you can't
152:55 - really see because i just jumped
152:57 - and uh looking up is x
153:06 - what if looking up is z
153:11 - there we go up
153:16 - other way
153:21 - here i am flying around oh i'm always
153:24 - looking at the
153:33 - i'm always looking i'm at that boy but
153:35 - i'm not looking straight ahead
153:37 - i'm always looking at the center of the
153:39 - scene
153:43 - so that's kind of weird maybe what i
153:46 - wanted to
153:46 - use is look at
154:00 - is there a look at function
154:07 - no i think the camera so i suppose what
154:10 - i could do is i could have my eye
154:13 - oh and i could just look straight ahead
154:16 - so i could always say like hey you know
154:17 - where i'm looking
154:19 - i'm looking at where i am plus straight
154:21 - at so if x
154:24 - if y were up straight ahead would be
154:30 - z let's try looking straight ahead
154:33 - plus like 50.
154:40 - minus 50.
154:47 - not do i need to like look really much
154:49 - further away
154:55 - yeah uh look in the y direction
155:03 - where are all you people where are you
155:07 - i just want to look oh there we go yeah
155:10 - this is me looking straight ahead now
155:15 - it's funny they don't look like they're
155:17 - flying because i'm flying with them i
155:19 - guess let's put the box back in
155:28 - yeah now we see i'm flying around the
155:30 - box
155:39 - oh i could look in the i should be
155:41 - looking in the direction of my velocity
155:44 - ah so i should be able to say
156:21 - so position is where i am and the
156:24 - direction is my position plus that where
156:26 - i'm going
156:27 - i can look in the direction of my
156:28 - velocity so this would be
156:30 - pause dot x pause dot y pause dot z
156:34 - and look in direction.x direction.y
156:39 - direction.z that should work right
156:47 - my velocity is very i'm looking behind
156:49 - myself i think
156:58 - oh my god
157:04 - the velocity is very shaky shaky camera
157:07 - work there
157:13 - i could smooth it out
157:16 - all right let's do um i got an idea here
157:21 - p vector d i r equals new p vector
157:27 - and then i'm going to say that's uh
157:32 - uh i'm gonna say like
157:38 - let's call this smooth let's let's call
157:39 - this dir and let's
157:42 - let's call this i'm actually gonna call
157:44 - this look at
157:46 - i'm going to call that look at i'm going
157:48 - to say look at
157:50 - dot lerp direction 0.1
157:53 - so this should smooth it out
157:58 - oh but then i need to
158:01 - put look at in here
158:10 - smoother let's say point zero one
158:16 - there we go
158:25 - this is what i meant all along
158:28 - now i don't love that every time i hit
158:30 - the edge
158:36 - oh this is fun the question is do we
158:40 - like having the box there
158:45 - let's make the background a color
158:51 - let me get the coding train color
158:54 - palette
158:57 - let's try some coding train colors um
159:00 - this is the only way i know how to get
159:02 - there the cj made this website which i
159:05 - really need to be
159:06 - i need to like permanently
159:10 - let's try this color for
159:14 - the ambient light and let's try
159:18 - like this color for the background
159:28 - well i like this um now the question is
159:32 - can i what happens if i give the box
159:37 - a slight fill like just out of curiosity
159:40 - what happens if i give the box this
159:42 - fill okay so the box is white
159:46 - that's interesting what if i go
159:50 - here and get like this yellow color
159:54 - but give it like a lot of alpha
160:00 - it's just blending with the background
160:12 - is there an issue i wonder one thing i
160:15 - should do
160:16 - is i shouldn't render that first
160:19 - void so hmm
160:25 - oh this is kind of annoying the way that
160:27 - i've written this code
160:32 - run
160:40 - render oh i see
160:46 - um
160:52 - let's just do this and then
160:56 - first is false i just want to treat the
160:58 - first one differently
161:00 - um so
161:04 - um
161:09 - so just in case that's messing anything
161:11 - up let's not render that first one it's
161:13 - just the camera
161:14 - okay i don't think that changed anything
161:22 - hit the box and bounce off i know
161:25 - that's not really going to work with
161:27 - flocking
161:29 - i guess i could try it let's try it
161:31 - that'll be the last thing
161:33 - let's try um switching what the edges do
161:38 - this is definitely going to be a problem
162:04 - all right this is going to be really
162:06 - annoying but i'm going to do it
162:09 - i'm going to do them each individually
162:12 - well let's see else if
162:14 - position dot x is greater than dimm
162:26 - so that's x
162:30 - y
162:38 - y i was going to make a force but let's
162:41 - just try this
162:42 - see
162:50 - did i get this right
162:55 - okay let's see what happens
163:04 - oh hi gloria
163:20 - it's looking back no that's not intended
163:23 - it should be looking where it's going
163:31 - yeah it really has to be a force
163:40 - but that's going to take me a lot longer
163:42 - to write that code
163:46 - negative z is forward
163:49 - i know this is kind of doing something
163:51 - along the lines of what i had hoped
163:57 - it's going to get stuck around the edge
163:59 - quite a bit
164:04 - so how do i fix it from looking forward
164:12 - like it's it's looking in the direction
164:15 - of its velocity
164:16 - how would i change that is that this
164:26 - no now it's just upside down
164:33 - you need to keep the direction not to
164:35 - look at
164:36 - i don't understand
164:45 - add the position after the lerp
164:49 - oh right
164:53 - thank you okay okay
164:56 - okay gloria's here everybody hi
165:00 - good doggie yes i know you probably need
165:03 - me to take you for a walk
165:04 - okay okay yes this is
165:08 - you're making it hard for me to code yes
165:10 - i know
165:11 - you're such a good girl they can't
165:12 - really see you
165:14 - [Laughter]
165:16 - okay
165:20 - okay okay come on can you take a break
165:22 - please
165:26 - i know i know i love you too you could
165:29 - taco
165:32 - okay wait let me just fix this one thing
165:35 - let me just fix this one thing please
165:37 - i think if i look away from her she will
165:39 - decide to go to sleep
165:42 - it worked um
165:48 - okay absolutely right that this
165:53 - i have to lerp with the velocity
165:58 - and then
166:03 - oh no no and then
166:07 - so i need a smooth
166:12 - lerp v
166:16 - so i always lerp the velocity and then
166:19 - position dot
166:21 - and then
166:24 - look at is
166:28 - the position plus the lerp velocity i
166:31 - don't know what that's really going to
166:36 - do
166:39 - but that's this is more correct
166:49 - oh no i feel like i'm flying now yes
166:59 - i'm stuck at the edge
167:03 - i gotta go back to my other borders i i
167:05 - gotta stop
167:07 - so we're gonna this is this is not
167:10 - really a great solution
167:12 - so just for right now we're gonna go
167:14 - with the wrap around borders okay
167:46 - i think i liked it better with and this
167:49 - is the last thing i'm going to do
167:51 - without a fill for the box
167:58 - we can make the stroke color of the box
168:02 - that yellow and then
168:06 - let's make this full screen and i think
168:09 - we're done
168:28 - uh
168:34 - oh i still think i need to say
168:38 - no phil
168:45 - there we go okay everybody
168:53 - what's some good music to go with this
169:02 - [Music]
169:11 - thank you for watching today's episode
169:18 - of the coding train
169:21 - where we're flying through a world
169:25 - of views flocking
169:30 - in beautiful space
169:42 - bit behind no we oh behind the
169:47 - oh oh come on that's a good idea
169:54 - oh oh why do i have to do this idea now
169:58 - i'm just curious
170:00 - okay so first
170:05 - i would have to render it
170:09 - this is definitely the last thing i'm
170:10 - doing oh my god it's almost eleven
170:11 - o'clock
170:14 - so uh subtract
170:20 - so couldn't i then if i subtract
170:23 - the velocity and i switch the order of
170:27 - these
170:32 - am i going to see it
170:35 - i think i'm looking backwards
170:46 - and i also need to scale this up
170:54 - position minus that times like 50.
171:01 - i think i'm looking backwards
171:14 - if i'm looking backwards oh
171:19 - weird
171:29 - somebody else is going to have to figure
171:30 - this out for me i'm too tight brain is
171:32 - totally
171:32 - i'm totally brain dead uh
171:36 - so i'm at the lookout position and i'm
171:39 - looking at the position subtract
171:44 - the position from the the velocity minus
171:47 - the position
171:47 - i mean like this couldn't possibly be it
171:49 - could it
171:52 - oh boy look at that oh now i'm
171:55 - definitely looking backwards
172:01 - the camera zener is clipping the void
172:04 - and i'm looking at it from above
172:06 - negative look at no
172:08 - no no
172:11 - yeah i could pick a random one but
172:13 - picking the first one is the same
172:14 - you need to bring the near plane back to
172:16 - let closer objects be drawn reduce the
172:19 - near plane value on the
172:20 - 3d render this is kind of interesting
172:22 - though whatever i
172:24 - i don't know how to do that in
172:25 - processing affect the z near plane
172:27 - i was just trying to go like really
172:29 - really far away
172:31 - like i figured like multiplying the
172:33 - velocity by 250
172:38 - i think i'm actually following it i'm
172:41 - just really far away
172:42 - so you don't see it near
172:48 - add minus that's what i'm doing add
172:50 - minus oh but let's try subtracting it
172:59 - yeah yeah i like this
173:05 - i don't know if i i'm behind it by quite
173:07 - a bit
173:08 - let's try being behind it by less
173:11 - it's sort of like where i start also it
173:14 - makes such a difference
173:16 - because now i've sort of like started
173:17 - near the edge
173:26 - so
173:31 - let's go back
173:34 - to thank you for everyone
173:39 - for tuning in to the
173:43 - world of flying news flying news
173:50 - oh we're flying through the world
173:53 - [Music]
173:57 - seeing all the news yeah i am fault
174:01 - there's one that i'm following
174:02 - does it can't you sort of see that
174:04 - there's one that i'm following
174:08 - um i don't know if i'm going to make
174:09 - this into a p5.js version that would be
174:11 - interesting to try
174:12 - i will i will upload this um
174:16 - all of the voids spawn at the center
174:20 - so i'm pretty sure i'm spawning them all
174:24 - at the center but i don't know
174:32 - i'm this is my last live stream probably
174:35 - until
174:37 - me i would say september i was gonna say
174:39 - maybe like
174:40 - the last couple days of august i might
174:42 - have one but this is probably the last
174:44 - live stream until september
174:46 - um oh my god my desktop audio is still
174:53 - highlight the follow i don't know how to
174:55 - do that
175:04 - okay i'm going to release this code
175:07 - this is what i suggest highlighting the
175:10 - follow one
175:11 - cleaning up using a different model so
175:13 - many possibilities
175:14 - let me upload this somewhere right now
175:20 - and please make a version of this and
175:22 - share it with me
175:30 - [Music]
175:51 - where is this
176:00 - [Music]
176:05 - on the desktop
176:12 - music is quite hilarious so
176:15 - i am going to say thank you to everybody
176:18 - i
176:18 - it's not the end of the year that seems
176:20 - like because it's just
176:22 - a random date in july but for me i kind
176:24 - of my life so
176:25 - operates on the academic calendar this
176:27 - is kind of like really the end of the
176:28 - year for me
176:30 - so uh thank you everybody for your
176:33 - support
176:34 - whether it's watching it's tweeting it's
176:36 - giving your community contributions
176:38 - it's joining as a member um all this
176:40 - stuff is really meaningful to me i
176:42 - really enjoy having the chance to
176:43 - connect and code and do weird stuff like
176:45 - this
176:46 - um i'm gonna leave this running for a
176:48 - little bit to read your messages in the
176:50 - chat
176:51 - um i'm gonna take you out with by
176:54 - readings also some random numbers
176:56 - and please join the discord here's the
176:59 - link to the discord
177:01 - stay tuned hopefully for some other
177:02 - videos will come out get in touch with
177:04 - me if you want to help me with the
177:05 - fractal flame stuff
177:07 - and i'm going to read you some random

Cleaned transcript:

do oh hmm good morning sound check one two three starting in just about 35 seconds good morning and welcome to the coding train with your host dan who seems to be sort of sitting in the dark i don't guess i don't usually stream this early and if i do maybe the last time i did it the sun was not out and so you can see the sun is coming in and shining behind me i do have these two lights pointed straight at my face but nonetheless oh now it seems to have come around and i can see myself in my monitor over here this is why i always look over here because i have this monitor over here where i should be looking at you the viewers the people of the internet um thank you for joining me this morning i i don't know i don't i don't know how this is gonna go i don't have two i actually do have a plan not to say i don't have a plan but i do have a plan um this is probably the last live stream of the summer um never say never but i will be back in full force in september i am teaching um two multiple classes at nyu this fall and i have a lot of content i hoped and planned to make for those courses um but um so this is my last little just like hurrah here for the summer um i do have some other videos that will be coming out um you know that i'm doing some of you might be uh i've followed the fact that i'm doing a guest conductor series i've got a couple more of those planned um i also have another coding in the cabana video planned um first of all i just want to say good morning to rose because i saw in the chat very briefly that rose woke up at 5am to watch this stream and i'm so so sorry hopefully this goes well it is interesting and you uh enjoy yourself learn something maybe just have it on the background and because you're got lots of other things to do that's totally fine but thank you for tuning in um i know that it's a bunch of people it's the evening for them um but it's it's it's uh it's it's not that early to be honest it's it's it's eight and usually this wouldn't be early for me i'm an early riser lots to do but this whole quarantine situation i scheduled just gotten pushed back and back and back my sleep is all messed up if i had known how it's gonna feel this morning i would not have scheduled this live stream yesterday but once i schedule it it's scheduled so my kids are still sleeping because we're on such a late schedule although they do very shortly have an online chess class that they're taking which is why at nine o'clock which is why i am here was able to sort of work out to stream this morning i hope to be done around 10 is the plan you know how i always go late but i don't get all day people got lots of stuff to do um yeah so how are you i hope you're well um so let's let me let me sort of set the stage here set the table if you will um i have been doing so if you've never tuned in before this is the coding train um i do have a new sponsor for the coding train today which i will briefly just mention oh wait i have to go here and then i have to go here and then there it is notion i'm waking up people i'm actually excited to talk to you about notion um notion is a whoops all my things in the wrong place is a is um productivity software uh that breaks the mold by combining all essential work tools so i'll come back and talk to you a little bit more about notion uh later i have i'm slightly allergic to project management systems that i tend to just email myself things to do but i've been working with notion um and and actually quite enjoying it so you can check it out at um what was it again oh i'm fired i'm so fired bit.lee notion coding train you can get a free uh personal plans they used to be five dollars a month but now you can get a personal plan for free um so go check that out i will come back and um talk a little more about that later um let's see so okay so also it's i i don't know what the temperature is outside i do have the one of these old oldtimey oldfashioned um thermometers downstairs um and i seem to have just gotten a new member because these lights behind me are blinking oh i'm so in the dark what is going on daniel garden has joined wait i can't i'm all over the place here oh where's my bell and my random number book and my music cube daniel garden uh really you should be a member of the coding garden with a name like daniel garden but thank you very much for joining i'm just about there you have won with your membership to the coding train a person sitting in the dark in the morning it's so bright in here and so hot what i was gonna say is it's like i turn the air conditioning off so it makes a loud noise but i think i need to turn it back on so there will be a little bit of a hum in the background for this live stream and here's your random number daniel 79 454. thank you okay um oh daniel garden is a moderator on the coding garden excellent um uh thank you pedro it's not going very well it's not going well do you think it's going well i don't think it's going well okay i'm turning the air conditioner back on cold for comedy there's no comedy here that's by the way one of the um one of the most frequently commented comments on my uh videos is i don't know why you think you're funny you're not funny like i never said i was funny not funny not funny not funny not funny okay um now come on wake get into the light camera adjust your white balance thingy whatever now the sun will rise it will keep going this way you know that way is that way it's north so that way it's east sunrises in the east right so it's going to go like this let's see yes marcos thank you [Laughter] marcos is after my heart with his quote of acting thank you um and let's go here uh oh my goodness my stream deck is bugging out all right so i was setting the table the fork i don't know where the does anybody know how to set the table i don't i just put the forks and the plates and the cups remember how coating train used to be brought to you by water those are the days i had a recording studio i didn't have all this hair i was in the light i didn't know this would happen the sun is really uh messing with me so um what i've been doing with these summer live streams which i actually really quite enjoy is just working on random stuff i worked on a discord bot did train some machine learning text generation models we tried playing around with my hue lights uh tried the youtube api i had a whole list i don't know where that list went i mean i know where it went but i erased it so um but uh today this morning there are a few kind of random things i want to work on one is and let me just bring this up here fork and knife to the right says frank spoon to the left thank you very much then you put like the salad fork does it go like on the top no that's the soup spoon so one of the things i definitely want to do i'm really excited about this is if i come back to the most recent guest conductor video with guest artist chrissy brimmage who helped us learn uh who taught me and whoever tuned in blender the basics of blender i'm just looking and made this like beautiful um model of mew i made my own model of mew which i will show you which i'm naming mewtwo and i want to try importing my model of mewtwo into processing and see what i can do with that um let's take a look by the way at twitter.com and let's take a look at mewtrain because mutrain is the hashtag for everybody to post their blender models that they um so if you didn't tune in to that stream go usually i don't tell anyone to go back and watch something because you know please don't don't but uh chrissy is amazing and that stream was mindblowing to me and you should definitely go back and watch it and make your own uh 3d model in blender if you've never done that before um you can see this is my isn't it beautiful oh mewtwo you are you are my love um vadim made this incredible um mew which i don't even understand there's like shadow and a floor and there's like a ball over here and look at these eyes just gorgeous um this is um tweet great detailed explanation colby's mew marcos says look at that with the rainbow little i like the arms like i'm a trex um but with the rainbow there is amazing um this is the coding trains tweet this is uh chrissy's oh so you know if you if you're not familiar with chrissy's artwork this is a reel of her artwork it's fantastic uh soarin from denmark followed along and i um this was so interesting to me like i never occurred to me that that you might like place a reference image in 3d space it's almost like you're tracing an image or painting by numbers or um and that was really mindblowing to me it's super fun it's i can tell immediately that it's like a thing that i'm not gonna be very good at like i have trouble with um it's almost like like mechanical analog physical things in the world i have trouble putting them together let's just put it that way but interestingly enough like in software and coding is the thing that i it's not that i find it easy but it's something that i uh that fits with the way that i think and work and blender 3d modeling seems to be somewhere in between because there's a bit of like manual dexterity and sort of artisticness to how you sort of and you can see where what i ended up with here but i i actually really i really love mine youtube have i lost all my viewers left let yet oh we can't talk all right so that's uh item number one is um playing around with mewtwo in processing very excited about that and um now item number two if i go to thecodingtrain.com my most recent coding in the cabana video i don't know why everyone's telling me it's lina gomez's birthday i've seen this in both the discord chat and the youtube chat i made a video about marching squares so i would like to look at community contributions to marching squares if you made your own marching squares uh variation you can maybe possibly still get that in right now and a couple people in the chat asked about the interpolation step so i'd like to go over that code because it's not it's not something i went over in the video but it makes quite a difference in the quality of the visuals that you get so that's probably actually where i'm gonna start i'm gonna start with the marching squares and then work on the mewtwo stuff the things that i won't get to but i would like to are thinking about marching cubes like how would i take the marching squares into 3d so in marching squares let me pull up a little diagram here that i know is on the wikipedia page all right where's my video people should come up maybe it hasn't been around long enough um this is the diagram i'm looking at so looking for so with marching squares there are 16 configurations because there are four corners to a square if each corner has two possibilities that's two to the fourth power or 16. marching cubes let's see if there's a similar diagram somewhere that i can find here we go 15 oh the originally published 15 but i was going to say there's got to be 256. what is going on here this is wacko wait anyway i have not looked at this in advance but i was going to assume that with a cube given that our there are eight corners and each one could have a zero or a one that there would be two hundred two to the eighth power which if i'm correct is 256 possibilities and i believe there are techniques and strategies probably for creating some kind of like lookup table for based on the configuration which which uh polygon should be drawn uh and there's a cool of course there's a video from sebastian lag about marching cubes um which uh i guess we could all watch it together but um there are only 15 unique possibilities i don't understand that oh because you could rotate it maybe with rotations i see that's interesting so there must be some way um there's yes there's 256 but each but there are probably each variation can be a rotated version of another one that must make sense it's written 256 possibilities look at the text beside this image the algorithm proceeds through the scalar field taking eight neighbor locations at a time determining the polygons needed to represent the part of the iso surface that passes through this queue okay this is done by creating an index to a precalculated array of 256 possible polygon configurations yeah by treating each of the eight scalar values as a bit in an 8bit integer so how do i create that array of 256 possible polygon configurations is that a thing that i could just pull out of a json file like that would be cool right someone's got must have made one because if that were the case i feel like i could do this rather quickly json file marching cubes configuration uh lookup table like lookup table maybe configuration is wrong by the way can i just make a random plug i never i'm never able to um use google in search engines the same way after reading this book um algorithms of oppression by dr safiya um noble fantastic book highly recommended i'm part of a book club right now that's reading it and discussing it it's fantastic uh okay ah original marching cubes look up table i just want like a data file that has like all of the vertices for me uh that i can just maybe that's the thing i should make how to construct the marching cubes table algorithmically why would you want to do this well of course i want to do this don't ask me why um okay so simon thanks thankfully simon is watching this morning because i know i can get i could use google or i could just ask simon there are 256 possibilities but there are only uh 15 unique ones the others are just rotations and reflections you can just download the list off the interwebs yes but where i need a url or or better yet i need some keywords to type in to this search engine here to find that for me but that's not what i'm doing right now oh paul bork oh my gosh first of all speaking of amazing things to plug i have used this website basically my entire life as a programmer i think i started using this website probably in as early as 2001. you can see this is an article from me 1994. just about i mean i you know i could skip my whole way i could just basically use paul bork's site as entire means for looking for all of my coding challenges i probably referenced it a bunch of times there's so much amazing stuff in here highly recommend um an alternative table oh look at this look at this this is what i'm looking for the following code was generated from the above here is a table 256 and 13 points so what do those 13 i need i don't have my white board set up shoot i didn't think i would need it today but clearly if i'm going to talk about marching cubes i really really need that whiteboard uh sebastian lag has a link to a list all right let's see sebastian lag marching cubes uh look in here um project files oh look at this so there's that link that i was just looking at let's see what these two are and let's take a look at this one generating complex procedural trains okay marching cubes right right here's the 15 configurations a lookup table okay i i should this is actually could just this this could be a i could make a followup coding in the cabana there's enough here that i could do that i don't know that it makes sense for me to really get to try to do this today or i could when i can get back to i know a couple of you in the chat mentioned i missed the coding challenges and i agree um this would be a good sort of coding challenge video this is the paper that i've already read and this is the github page so i wonder if in here there is like somewhere in here the lookup table scripts boy wow amazing i guess this is what happens when you code in unity um all right so that's great that i found that let me put that aside so we have mewtwo loading into processing marching squares looking at community variations and um talking about the interpolation step we have trying to code marching cubes not gonna happen and then what i am what i was planning to do as my next coding in the cabana video is uh fractal flame so fractal flame um and i want to look for the original paper here it is um where's the pdf um let's see maybe that will show up if i just put pdf here yeah that's here we go yeah this is what i'm looking for so uh here's the url if you want to take a look at this yourself so um this is a particular algorithm invented by scott draves and a collaborator eric recase um and if you go to my uh twitter which is twitter.com shiffman am i still in the dark you can see the sun is moving um we'll see here oh first of all uh james schloss from i don't know how to say this lee ios lee leo is also working on fractal flame we've been messaging about this um you can see these are results that i've gotten with some of my early experiments but i'm not entirely sure that i'm doing it correctly but what i've been reading i read over this paper and i'd be happy to start walking through some of the code even in today's live stream because i do want to make a video kind of coding this thing from you know all the way from nothing to the end um but this paper describes it really quite well there's a lot of math notation which can be a little bit intimidating and tricky but the thing that's always helped me is going to these um pseudo code little spots which really do explain um which are very helpful to me and sort of like figuring out how to write the code for it um and so um and then there's all these different uh uh transformation uh functions where you just take an x y and so like this is just making a copy of the x y this is taking the x y and giving you back sine of x sine of y so these are these are things that um that looks a little scary but are actually quite um quite not easy but are quite transferable into code um but what i wanted to ask about if anyone's going to look at this uh later and maybe want to engage with me on twitter to help is i don't what i really don't understand is like i've got my images uh look without a lot of the extra sort of like blurring and fancy work with coloring that i think i'm missing my images look kind of like this so i think i'm on the right track however what i really don't understand is how these images are are were created because i mean i don't want to get too far into the weeds with this basically there it's a threestep process you apply a transformation uh then one of these variations and then another trans linear transformation and one of these variations and another linear transformation and i can't and i get sort of like all sorts of wacky fun results when i'm sort of throwing all the spaghetti at the wall but this i feel like i must be missing something because this these particular examples are showing i can't reproduce these so that i would if that is something that i would love some help with if you want to look at my code so far to compare with the paper um if you go to github.com codingtrain um and i think if i go under repositories it's probably the most recent one fractal flame right here so we can see and i'll just show this to you by the way like so just look you'll see i mean i've done this in a sort of awkward way but but um you can see so i what the way that i have this is i have this idea of a ver um a class called variation and it keeps track of its name and some color information and these coefficients for these transformation steps but then every single one of these variations like if we look at spherical v2 of x x the function which gets as input x y returns 1 divided by r squared which is the magnitude of the vector x y times x y if we go back to my code and i look for spherical you can see this is what i'm just doing exactly that but with vector notation so r is v is v dot x v dot y r is then magnitude squared and i return a copy of it divided by r and so you can see swirl is like okay r is magnitude squared and then i return x times sine of r minus y times cosine of r and if i went back to the paper and i look for swirl you can see here's exactly that formula x times sine of r i'm saying r for r squared uh minus y so um and and transferring this to p5.js wouldn't be um so first of all there's so i could i could yes um ashik is asking about translating this to p5.js that would be somewhat trivial at least for me who's so used to like moving back and forth between these two environments the reason why i would hold off a little bit on that is um these images the way that i'm doing it take an incredibly long time to render let me just pull down my code this is i'm talking about this now so why not go with it so let me pull down my code and i'll try to run it oh wait hold on to show you what i show you what i mean i have to sneeze a sneeze is coming can i try mute my microphone put on some music this is good sneezing music it won't now that i said i was gonna sneak this i'm not going to okay um so what i i don't remember where i left this when i um committed it oops i can't use the computer today thank you so um you can see here these are all the different variations so i'm adding them all in um creating a pixel map and um there's a lot to talk about with this but what i let me just run it see what happens see what we get so you can see this is how long it's taking to render what just happened did something go crazy with the sound oh um so there you go there you see there you see the image i got but um the reason why is it has done a total of that's a total of 100 million points and i'm doing 1 million point per points per frame so that's why i'm able to draw this loading bar and like if i just change this to like 1 million points and like a thousand points per frame well this is silly it doesn't need to it doesn't need to take this long now i'm just animating it for no reason so let's do all the points per frame i just want to see what i get actually that's not so bad so uh but the the the the amount of detail the quality of the image is not as fleshed out if you will as it really requires like a lot of points so let me put back to 100 million points and we'll let this render um certainly a job for the graphics card makes sense there probably is a way so anyway i would like to make a video to and this is what i was thinking of doing as a coding in the cabana video but i'm not ooh i like that one i'm not entirely sure i've gotten this right so and often with the coding of the cabana videos like um i don't really practice or figure it out in advance but this one like i really i was reading the paper and thinking okay well i'll just read the paper and then i'll go do it a coding challenge i would just that's how i would do it but this one i'm really intrigued by and i couldn't resist and plus i feel like i need to prepare for it so anyway that's there that's there for you to look at stay tuned um i will come back um and um and um hopefully you'll see a video about this maybe even in august because i if i'm going to do this coding in the gabano video i've got to record it this week marcos in the chat is asking was this linear or did you add a transformation function so the way that i'm doing this and let's see if i can kind of show it in the paper so the way that this works is um it's a threestep process where where first you apply a transformation a pretransformation so there's a post transform which is right here and let's see if there's a pretransform so each one of these transformations um you you have an input x y and then you have coefficients a b c d e f and so you take you say a times x plus b times y plus c this is like um applying a matrix transformation i think this is kind of like similar to what i've done in some of those in matrix transformation videos i've made so there's six coefficient that's the pretransform and then there is also a post transform which is here uh again uh alpha beta gamma delta epsilon i don't know if i'm doing this right oh i'm so embarrassed but whatever six more coefficients so that's the pre and post and in between those two you you are applied one of these variations so in my code again i'm not entirely sure i'm doing this correctly but in my code if i look at the variation code um i have a function called flame where i get an input vector that's an input x and y so you can think of anything that's the p vectors in x and y and i apply a pretransformation to that then i apply one of the variation functions to it then i apply the post transformation and that's just i have an array of coefficients zero you know coefficient zero times x one times y plus two three times x plus four times y plus five and then i return that vector and then i create when i create a variation i make those arrays they each have six things in it and i just pick the coefficients randomly so uh breaking news what's this is this is this what i'm looking for my marching cubes look up table simon i can't really get to it easily on the computer where i'm looking at the chat you might have to tell me more what that is um but um so so that's how i'm doing it so i'm doing a pretransformation step applying any one of these variations like you can see this sinusoidal one is very simple it's just sine of x sine of y and then a posttransformation what uh what's and then so i could what i could do here is i could show you like what happens if i just do linear and let's let's just do like 10 million instead of so it's a little faster so i get nothing i've got nothing is it is it because i have so few points lars is making an excellent comment in the chat about the marching squares video would you mind adding that as a github issue on codingtrain website or just leaving it as a comment on the actual youtube video itself i'd like to return to that so i'm not getting anything let's try like what if i do just swirl so this is why i feel like i'm doing something wrong uh oh it's a triangulation table okay thank you simon i can get to it from from there so i'm not getting anything for these if i just use one variation maybe that's correct but it's clearly not because in the paper described in the paper there are these really nice examples of these visualizations of the singular variation i would really like to be able to reproduce these so i feel like until i can reproduce those diagrams i'm not ready to make that coding of the cabana video because i'm not entirely sure i'm doing this in the correct way now fortunately the creator of this algorithm themselves scott draves um uh messaged me on twitter and uh said they would look at a code so maybe i'll hear from scott draves um let me see if i can pull up what simon created really quickly just.github.com simon tiger i hope you made it public otherwise i won't be able to get it yep so this is an array of configurations each configuration is another array the numbers are the vertices of the cube every triple triple of numbers represents a triangle oh fantastic i think i understand how to use this i'm not entirely sure but this is perfect thank you simon i feel like maybe i've got till 10 and you know you can see i've done nothing it's 8 40 i'm just talking um swiom is saying how do you choose which variation to apply great question let me go back to my fractal flame code so let's say i put all the variations back in the way i'm running the code and you can you can create a more sophisticated probability map but i am picking um one of these randomly so um i so i have all of these variations in an arraylist of variations and then each frame um i pick a random number between zero and the size of the arraylist then i pick that or variation and then i apply that variation to the current vector and i have a new vector so this is an iterative iterated function system by the way i i should have led with this the prerequisite so to speak for this particular uh algorithm if you want to if you want to like before you read the fractal flame paper and look at my code you should look at um coding challenge uh 123 the chaos game part one and part two because essentially a fractal flame is a uh an augmentation of exactly this particular algorithm the chaos game so but there's the addition of these nonlinear transformations with polar coordinates and sine and cosine and all sorts of other extra stuff and mixing and matching so you can see if i just did a sort of more stan you know you could get these very specific fractal algorithms like the sir pinsky triangle with applying just a singular linear transformation okay um so oh alka is here hello i haven't seen alca in a while or maybe i'm just not paying enough attention nice to see you here all right where was i uh at nine o'clock i'll be taking a short break i'm gonna make sure my kids get set up with their chess class oh by the way hmm is anybody a roblox player out there because i am learning roblox coding and my kids and i are making a roblox game they made one called sword blocks i don't know how to find it maybe if they're when they're when they're in here i'll ask how do i if i could find i think they're the username on roblox um can i i don't i don't want to log in um if i know their username is there a url that i can just go to their page this is really sorry i'll come back to that i'll look for it when i take a break show you their roblox game they wanted people to play it but i was not really ready yet so um okay alka is confirming that i do pay attention alka's not been around that much okay welcome back all right let's get to the good stuff let's start looking at some of the variations that post over some people made so first of all uh we've got a little thing go so thank you to violet who does uh and so many people niko and many others as well but i wanted to thank violet in particular um they do a lot of work on the coding train website and github repositories um and created a new methodology for when a coding video has many many examples involved that here's all the p5 versions you can download the code view the code go to the web editor here's all the processing versions i love that it has the little logo this is this is mostly it doesn't look so crazy because if i go to like a particular video like let's say i just go to uh tictactoe like we just got this one p5.js so it looks sort of normal and then i think we recently realized like oh this uh particular coding in the cabana uh example has so many so i think it might be nice to redo this design a little bit if anybody's a designer out there has some ideas maybe it makes more sense to uh compact this horizontally and like just put it up here i don't know but um so if you have ideas about that but that's why there's this sea of examples and i'm gonna come to some of them but we don't have um i i didn't do a big push in discord i know that kobe has really helped with this in the past of getting people to post encouraging people to post their contributions even if you just play with one of the examples you change some colors i think one thing that you could really try that i didn't that i wish i had emphasized in the video is change what's being drawn you have eight possible possible configurations for what you would draw in a square you don't have to draw the lines exactly like you could draw circles you could draw triangles you could draw the lines in the wrong places like what kind of patterns would you get so i encourage you to make your own um version of it but let's look at what people have created so first let's look i don't know so some of these i might not be able to run uh if um for example i don't know that i can easily run python pi game although that would be fun to try to figure out right now but let's look at re24's source code and well thank you ari for your beautiful community contribution let's just look at it python so this is cool because what ari seems to have done here is write their own um vector like like p5 vector ported p5 vector to python that is so cool lerp all the functions are here that is amazing great job i think a train whistle for that for sure um that is wonderful so that's really nice to see if i knew how to run pygame quickly i would run this so again i know i've mentioned this but something you can do that i would recommend ari if you're watching is add a readme file and then in the readme file you can embed an image and so that way if somebody's looking at it coming to there and they want to see like you could explain a little more about it you know i don't know how much traffic these community contributions generate but that's what i would want to see if i'm browsing the internet and looking for different examples and i wasn't familiar with pygame that i would want to see a readme file there with some annotations so it's as easy as pip install pie game okay um marching squares in a purlin noise field let's take a look at that so maybe by the way i should very very briefly just show um the example from the video so this is the example from the video just so we can sort of get a sense of what people have done that's different this is just the raw marching squares algorithm over a field of per of open simplex noise so let's go back and look at greg kreisman's marching squares in a perlin noise field oh cool oh look at this so anytime i see some sliders i get very excited that means i can play with this in real time zoom so that's cool because oh what i like about this i like the fact that i see the full square there and you know it looks so interesting about this algorithm it looks like these continuous paths but really they only connect because of the sort of cleverness of the algorithm if you will really each square is looked at individually with a line drawn so that's what i mean what would happen if you just drew the lines in a completely different way i think that's some creative possibility artistic possibilities here let me zoom all the way back out oh cool and uh let's what does this one do the noise step oh so that's just like how fast so one of the things that's interesting about purlin noise i don't know how well we'll be able to see this so this look wow it looks like is it just me or are we panning over the noise field vertically i think we are uh that's a pretty interesting way of doing this also i mean which is totally fine but one of the things that i did in my video is i add oh no maybe this is just because of the zoom yeah that's just because of the zoom the zoom level i had it didn't make it all the way to the edge just just could you bear with me for a moment to sneeze was i muted all that time do okay i'm back sorry about that um so with with so a couple things one is um i don't know whether this is you uh it says purlin noise which i know there's a lot of not controversy sort of speed but there's a lot of different uh stages of development that pearl and noise that the sort of purlin noise went through so in processing and p5 uh when when i say pearly noise i'm really referring back to the sort of classic early 1980s perlin noise algorithm but um that particular algorithm has a lot of sort of repeating patterns in it and has a different quality than open simplex noise so that's one thing i was curious to see if we could notice but also um the way that i animate is in the way that i animate it in my example is by using the third dimension uh sort of step through slices of noise 2d noise in a 3d space whereas this looks like it's taking noise in a 2d space and panning down that but i'm not entirely sure that's true i mean we could look at the code let's look at the code uh and let's see um where there yeah so this is using the just the noise function in p5 and it says noise z and z is interesting going up by rows so i think that's sort of like it looks like this is one dimensional noise somehow but the way that it's like being used is maybe going over the columns and then sort of panning i don't know oh gregory's in the chat so that's my question for gregory in the chat is this is a surprise to me to see only one argument here in the noise function if you look for example at my code and again i'm not saying one's a correct way or an incorrect way of doing it that's no such thing i i love the quality this like panning quality that's happening it's quite beautiful and unique i just i'm interested in comparing it so if i go back to mine and i go here to web editor and i look for where am i calculating noise right i am calc my noise function has three arguments x y z by the way the sun has now moved and i'm in the light again it would appear ah simon is by the way i missed something in ari's python contribution i would love to go back to it but i'll just mention it one of the things that it always makes it tricky in processing or p5 and java or javascript is with vectors you have to use these add functions or call these functions to do vector math you can't use the plus minus multiply um operators but in python you can overload those operators so you can actually say vector one plus vector two um i'm not saying an answer to this question which is fine i don't need one right now but that's an interesting that's an interesting uh difference to note okay let's come back to um oh another python one okay i might have to might have to figure out how to run some python stuff today since there's two of them i just did the most simple noise from one dimension yes so that's interesting because uh gregory figured out something very very clever and i'd have to go back and really un unpack the code a bit more but i it never occurred to me that there might be a method for using onedimensional noise but spreading it out over a twodimensional field and then even animating it over time and i think there must be some combination of using like a global starting variable and then incrementing over the 2d space and then moving the starting variable with each frame of animation super interesting technique um okay let's look at marching squares with 3d purlin noise by josh um oh great see readme file that's a ding and a train whistle for both gregory and josh here so first of all rainbow colors you had me you had me at rainbow colors i love how you figured out to sort of like fill in this area um and that's really quite and and fill it in with these with this sort of rainbow gradient that's very unique um weighted colors based on average of each cell's corners uh it looks a bit smoother but the gif has some quality loss oh look at that so that's interesting so i again i think a lot of times um just by varying the drawing style and the color you can come up with some really unique artistic uh variations of the sort of core algorithm so i really appreciate that here's some terrain deformation oh look at that so that's kind of cool to like just use it to create this terrain and then it's almost like it's like food that this little square is running around and eating whoa oh this is didn't make it yeah so this is what i was assuming i would get if i take marching squares into marching cubes and run it over like a 3d open simplex noise field this is what i was kind of assuming i'd get so i'd love to tackle that i don't know when sometimes i i don't know sometimes i wonder so thank you for this this is fantastic i love that you have the documentation and the code that people can look at beautiful work and we've got one more here by fan by principle uh marching squares with square contours p5.js so oh yeah so this is what i was saying so i love this so this is the idea of instead of using the original sort of like iso lines that go from the midpoints what this variation does by fan by principle is uses like straight horizontal and vertical lines which has a really nice quality to it um it feels very kind of retro in a way switch solution wait where's my mouse so now we see the original and switch background oh look at that so that's really nice to see thank you so these are these are wonderful so i i tend to try i really do try to look at all of these i do miss some um and um i know that david isn't here for this live stream but i'm going to pull up something so let's let's just say that you are watching today you didn't realize that you could submit your own community contribution and have it appear on this page so the links you want to look at are this you can also add your own version see how so i think if i click on see how this will give a bit of a page hey i have a little video walkthrough that you can watch um i think it's still a date and then there's a little bit of a text explanation for how to do it and uh if i click on this link add your own version it's going to take me right to the page that you need to edit it's actually going to open it up as so you do the only thing you need is you do need to sign up for a github account there's probably some way to do it without signing up for github account i don't know what that is um um but um so and there it's it's confusing which uses this weird a markup language called yaml yet another markup language or i think there's some other um variations of that why aml um but basically uh you need to follow this format of uh contra under where is it under contributions where's that contributions you can see that you just need a title an author with a name and a url and a source oh but you can also have a url for your project and then a source url so um you know it's tricky so what i would do is i would just take this i would copy it i would like sort of paste it in here i would try to get the indentation to be the same and i would say like marching wacky and i would put my name daniel schiffman and i would change the url and stuff and then i would go down here and i would hit uh well i wants me to be able to commit it directly it's not going to let you do that it's going to create a new branch and start a pull request and you can follow through i'm not going to do this right now to follow through these steps it looks like oh my god am i going to break things i'm going to do it wrong is someone going to yell at me am i doing don't worry think of hearts and rainbows when you're on the coding train github we are here and say we being the community and some people that are specifically helped maintain the repos along with myself are here to help are here to encourage you are here to welcome you in with open arms if you've never filed a pull request before if your variation is exactly the same as the example well that's fine too there's no threshold of achievement we just want you to share uh and feel a sense of accomplishment and participation um in the community so i really encourage you to do so no matter your experience level no matter your background and you know if you run into any issues i guess probably emailing info at thecodingtrain.com is an email address but you can tweet at shiffman or at the coding train and you can also but but really what i would say if you want to help in particular with github and submitting your contribution i'm going to leave this page the best way to do that is to go to the issues page and click new issue so you could click new issue and you could say i would love some help and then you could write here is my question that i would love help with now one thing i'll say is um this isn't really the place for getting uh help with debugging your code uh what i mean more is like help making a contribution or a pull request if you want to if you want help of debugging your code or have a code question the best place for that is actually the discord and so i think i have a little button here um if all goes well the discord will now appear in the chat appeared twice you can join the discord and there's a lot of help channels there where the community will answer questions um yeah okay that's marching squares it is nine o'clock it is time look at me on schedule sort of and it's time for me to check in with my children and their chess class i but hey here's my segue i found a new way to stay on task and stay on schedule and so i'm so excited to tell you about a new sponsor for the coding trade and i'm going to press the button correctly notion and what i oh the thing that i'm really excited about this is i don't even have to ask you to buy anything um there of course there are premium plans and different things that you can get but um with notion which is a productivity software that breaks the mold by combining all essential work tools notes docs databases did i say databases databases you know the way that i'm using it right now so uh if you're a coding trained member you're probably missing your rewards i'm supposed to mail you a sticker or a notebook and i do have piles of envelopes and labels i have these new thank you cards over here i'll give you a little more of a closeup view of it on these thank you cards that i'm sending out um i'm so so late with these and i'm so so sorry um but one of the ways i'm organized with it now is i have all of the members names in the notion database and with the address that i need to send stuff to what i can check off when it's done so i am getting organized with um notion um let me click over to here so notion works like a box of software legos letting you flexibly stack these tools however you want to build your own productivity system so it used to be that to get a personal plan it was five dollars a month but now all personal plans are free forever so free users will be able to add as many blocks as they like to their personal notion database students are using notion for class notes managing tasks organizing job applications you can learn about this at notion.so students high school and college oh high school and college educators use notion to create syllabi communicate with their students and easily publish information the web guess what i'm a well i'm not a high school i'm a college educator in addition to just playing one on tv youtube oh i hear the chess classes started um can you hear oh and i've got a new member um so i didn't actually even realize that until i started looking into notion that's something i will definitely consider maybe there's a way that i can even spin up a coding train course using notion that might be fun to try um and oh and this is this is what there's a mobile app this is what it looks like uh on the mobile app um you know i have to say like i was saying earlier that the way that i have traditionally kept track of my like task lists and todo list is by just emailing myself or use a text file all right once i tried using github for a while and didn't like issues with my todo list but i'm i'm really excited i've been trying in the last couple weeks since uh notion got in touch with setting up and keep keep with a todo list and it's working quite well but really the the the game changer for me has been organizing all of the coding train uh member rewards and things like that so um notion is great for the office has been used by the wall street journal verizon and even pixar i love pixar uh create a company wiki wiki see database wiki i love these terms i have a feeling that there's an api or notion is working on an api i feel like i saw something on the website that's something that would be really exciting to me if i could uh you know as a coder and programmer work with it that way so you can answer questions at scale onboard new employees and track every project catalog logos fonts and assets so thank you so much uh to notion for being a sponsor of the coding train i'm going to take a short break and check on my kids and their chess class uh about five minutes um and if you're interested in checking it out please go to bit.lee notion coding train because that will let them know that you found it through the coding train and you know just a little bit a little bit you can do to that that helps me out as well okay um that's all uh i have to say and i will be back in just a short a bit and the laptop sound is not working where is the music what happened here there we go okay i'll be right back dog do so do and we're back how's it going i just made it just back the whole time thank you notion again bit.lean ocean coding train um the whole time i was trying to log into my roblox account and the password wasn't working i was trying to reset the password i failed oh well i believe my roblox username is actually codingtrain no i don't mean it's actually codingtrain i mean it's actually codingtrain the word actually coding train and if i could log into that i could find i think i have i think i'm in my kids like game studios called ducky studio and then there's a game in there called sword blocks i couldn't find it sometime in the future i will come back and live stream some roblox coding um um in fact i've been just as a little plug i've been watching the alvin blocks youtube channel part of i'm a member of the alvin block's youtube channel and part of their discord where i've been learning uh roblox coding so my uh my roblox game development empire is starting now and probably not going to happen there was something else that i wanted to just mention ah yes so where am i off to next on the coding train uh alka says i hope you look at my marching squares it's not finished but it's a nice effect oh was there another contribution that i missed i don't know where i find it is there a pull request open aha oh wait wait wait open 43 minutes ago i don't see alca oh so unfortunately if you send it to me in the discord there's no way for me to access it on the stream that's way too much technology for me i have the link on this computer right over here and there's just no way i could ever possibly get it onto this computer i mean i could type it in manually so please um add it uh add it as an issue if you want to just put it as an issue here i will look at it but let's look at these two um update marching squares so so here so one of the things that i uh really asked people to do um and no worries srakshan 98 um it's not entirely clear but in addition if you could the reason why the template um has a this part in it is please add a link to it here because this way i could just click um i could just click on it right here to look at it otherwise i have to go into here then i have to find it here then i have to sort of manually copy it out which is no problem just a little bit of an extra step but let's take a look at this cool so this is marching squares playable oh look at that with the with the keyboard i can move this little dot around super fun and i think this was done with typescript train whistle for typescript great work thank you for sharing that and next we have um so same thing only holy um please when you file your issue um if you could also just link to the project right here that way i see it i click on it because that's honestly like they come onto my email um and i can just click on and look at him in my email otherwise i've got to go to the webpage and click around thank you my anime jim very kind of you and i'm going to go here to interpolated contour lines oh i like the sound of this um and let's run this whoa whoa that is really cool oh i love that so i'm curious like how did you create the number field to make this kind of pattern i mean it has a very simplexy noisy like quality but it's different let's see if we can take a quick peek here um move myself up here for a second um so where is the feel oh it's just it's just using a different set of values for noise and i guess with interpolation and the colors it really has a different quality to it so that's amazing to me that this is using the basically the exact same code but just through tweaking different parameters and using color in a creative way i really thought like oh there's something different underlying here so that's wonderful issue alka's version is now as an issue and let's work in progress marching squares contribution and let's go over here on oh i love that let's take a look whoa that is wow so i assume there's some kind of like interesting blending that's going on i love the sort of like 3d quality to this um it's really lovely i feel like it's like a little portals into another dimension or being opened up for me to look through quite beautiful so what i wanted to mention is i do try to look at these community contributions and this reminded me that if i go back to the issues gypsy dangerous here a coding train contributor and viewer and member created this wheel of contributions which randomly picks so we're going to look i'm going to just do one because i want to move on to uh importing a 3d model into processing that'll be kind of where i finish off today um so what this does is it looks back through all of the contributions that i have never shown on a live stream it loads i guess one two three four five six internet ten of them randomly and then i can spin the wheel wow that's right on the line looks like it's in the red well actually we can tell it's in the red because the background is red so i can also say remove and view selected and what we've got is asteroid field by bossy smacks the original challenge is uh this one ah this is coding challenge number one which was done and i just like when was this done let's go over to youtube how long ago look at me look at this youthful glowing shorthaired oh it was a simpler time back in april 2016. oh boy get me a time machine now oh boy let's go back to april 2016. things will things will turn around i am hopeful um uh first coding challenge um this guy has to be the happiest developer alive that's very kind of you um and uh now uh mike i still have some sleep in my eyes i think um or my glasses just need to be cleaned what was i doing okay we're looking at this contribution there it is so let's take a look at the asteroid field which is a variation of the starfield example oh awesome oh this is such a perfect transition to talking about 3d because it looks like to me that these are little like 3d models um i don't know how i'm sure there's a way that i could get to the source code since this is hosted on glitch oh boy do i have some interesting glitch tutorials coming up for you in the fall i have figured out how to run a twitter bot off glitch with web hooks and reply all this stuff oh i'm so excited about it uh if you want to like enter into a very random i know i'm just like mr tangent today i guess i'm always that way let me go up uh and just to go into a completely other tangent austin is asking me if i've checked out standup maths video on complex fibonacci numbers no but everybody keeps telling me to maybe that should just be my next coding in the cabana video that was suggested yeah 2016 was pretty beautiful so okay not anyway um so when i'm up time out focus focus i've got 40 minutes left what i love about this is it looks like it's taking that star field example which was just using um 2d dots and maybe replacing them with 3d models or something that has a more of an asteroid like quality to it i think i could probably move over to glitch and find the source code but um thank you if you if you bossie happen to be in the chat please say hello um but i'm gonna move on so close a bunch of these windows that was when i tried to use a timer uh i will get back i will get back to doing coding challenges again um some people it's interesting the feedback that i get um uh it's very mixed in term i think people mostly the feedback i get is positive thank you very much people like the coding cabana videos they like the coding challenge videos some people seem to very strongly prefer the coding challenge style of just like in a studio with green screen coding coding coding some people like the sort of zen quality i mean i'm not i don't think it's very sad but the different style of the coding cabana with a bit more editing and being sort of in this outdoor space um my plan was always to do both but having trouble finding the time these days okay oh it wasn't 2020. sorry i get everything wrong ah deep breath all right we are here ready to load mewtwo into processing and let's make a world of flocking you choose that's what i'm going to attempt to do in about the next 40 minutes and i will hope that you will take your so so if you want to uh follow along and make your own version the first thing you'll need to do is go back and watch this blender tutorial from chrissy one of the things i really want to get into a better habit of is if i just put time codes in the video description it will make it into chapters and you could find the specific things you're looking for i have a lot of people who work on different coding train projects and nobody at the moment is doing that so i would welcome that as a contribution it's something that i would actually be quite open to hiring somebody to do to like sort of go through the back catalog and time code everything but um you know at this point but also i would take a volunteer so we could sort of think about if anybody's interested in that get in touch um but i wanted to also just give a shout out because this fundraiser is still going on the tender foundation which is an organization that supports mothers in need in atlanta georgia you can still donate we reached the goal for the coding train match but i'm sure the tender foundation would appreciate additional donations if you're if you feel so inclined and are able to donate so i'm going what i'm going to do now is i'm going to open up blender i can't believe i'm opening a blender wait what happened is blender gone uh finder applications blender i don't know what happened it's like let's see if it runs i do not have oh you know what happened that's so weird hold on i think i can fix this hold on give me a moment here talk amongst yourselves duplicate stop i can't believe what i'm doing right now you don't want to know permissions permissions permissions permissions permissions permissions after all of that all right let's just reinstall it why do you forsake me replace wow kay wickman joined as a patron after watching the mender sponge challenge when was that let's first of all see it do i appear no oh april 17th you've been a patron since 2016 oh that was cody challenge number oh two goodness oh thank you k week fun maybe the longest i don't know who the longest patron is i'm gonna have to look that up that's a thing i can look up i'm sure you're definitely in the running by the way i paid my children in robux to decorate all of these so last night they were up very late at night coloring and decorating these lovely children they are um ethan writes hey dad what you coding the funny thing is my son and i have a joke which is that i like to say things like son i'm going to teach you a life lesson and he just starts to laugh falls on the floor laughing it's so ridiculous no one takes me seriously all right um what was i doing oh yes reinstalling blender let's see let's see how did that go all my sound effects are in different places now yes open blender okay so now let's open up um i think this is my model coding train model which should be called muchu what's happening let me close this there's mewtwo so what i need to do is export um iraqi ask is there a discord without patreon yes there is i'm giving you the link right now um so one of the things i'm not sure about is well let's just see what happens so this is mewtwo let's uh select and let's go to file uh export and i'm going to export as an obj so i'm exporting as an obj and then oh and i think i already did this fortunately but i spelled it wrong i told a new chew with chew that's hilarious let's spell it correctly mu chu coding train desktop that works export x wait wait hold on are there things selection only object says obj objects scale path mode i don't know what any of this stuff means uh i don't know what any of this stuff means so i maybe so let's just see export object okay there we go so now i should have on the desktop um here is so there's the obj file what's interesting is to look at these files so let's look at these files in visual studio code which of course is not a thing that's open right here so let's uh open uh desktop let's look at these two files so a couple things one is so the mtl file and by the way this is all totally new stuff to me i don't really know what i'm talking about this is the material file um so it has information about the material somebody in the chat will explain what material means but more what i'm kind of fascinated by is the obj file so the obj file is literally just a list of vertices x y z x z xyz xyz so it seems like oh i'm exporting this file like we could write our own code that comes up with a 3d shape calculates all these vertices writes it out to an obj file and then imports it into say a program like blender or any other 3d modeling program so usually the way that i the only way that i've known how to do things is by working in code and exporting that way an obj file but now the difference here is i have with my bare hands really the mouse modeled out of digital clay the beautiful wonderful mewtwo character i love you mewtwo if i ever get another pet its name is definitely gonna be mewtwo gloria where's gloria are you around here oh gloria's not here gloria's usually sitting right next to me this whole time i don't know where she went um but anyway uh gloria if i ever get you a doggy brother or sister mewtwo will be its name i don't know if my kids will go with that but but now this looks right i should be able to import this into processing so let's uh close out fractal flame um please get in touch if you work on uh on github or twitter if you uh go back and if you're watching my discussion of fractal flames and have any answers or thoughts for me i'm gonna hit don't save um let's i think what i'll do is let me create a new sketch um new sh mewtwo flock and let's add setup let's add draw we'll make a nice window i don't know i don't know what for old times sake we'll say background 51. and oh this is definitely going to need to use the 3d renderer and then i want to make a folder called data and what i want to do is get my model and bring it in and put it in the data folder oh do you hear that little boy i think that sound effect is happening it's very exciting apple if you want to get in touch and need somebody to record some new sound effects for you every time somebody drags and moves the file you could have just think about it give me a call i'm available um so now i should be able to say p shape mewtwo i think and chew equals load shape and then just the name of the file mutu.obj and then um translate to the center and draw mutu so this should be the basic code for loading an obj file into processing and displaying it what's the chance oh that that you you always have been hearing that sound effect that's so funny i just never heard it in my monitor before i set things up in a different way wait i think that's mewtwo there there's mewtwo i need a i need a like heavenly sound they don't have that do i have anything that fits yeah there's youtube youtube that doesn't work so that was weird that made me very uncomfortable okay um so i think i just need to say scale to make youtube bigger ah there's mewtwo let's add some lights there we go oh it's upside down uh let's say uh translate one comma negative one that flips the world has y point up no do i need to do that first wait i'm confused why is mucho upside down mewtwo you're upside down oh were you not upside down before and i was just confused i'm so confused let's um should i should i just use pz cam here let me do a rotation uh angle equals zero uh rotate y angle angle plus equal like some small rotation oh no mewtwo is not reference point around the center oh did i write scale oh i have scale 100 here i think if i do this whoa yeah so i flipped mewtwo around the lights are weird but mewtwo is not oh so how someone's gonna have to help me figure out how to do this in blender shoot um i think okay let me go back to blender oh where's chrissy chrissy call chrissy phone a friend uh so frank is asking you didn't have to write all the code to read the points and connect them right so i didn't have to do that so this is a great question so i was showing you what's in the obj file and i could parse it and create all the geometry myself and that would be a super exciting fascinating thing to do however that's what processing has built into it a uh p shape class and it knows how to read obj files and render that geometry so i'm making use of that i have to make the object to the origin select the object and alt g says marcos okay so alt is probably option select option g maybe i have to group it first uh is there a way to like group it how do i group oh g oh no that's what i no i mean i could just take this now and move it back and then maybe the center is the head how to set mesh origin alt g won't do it okay hold on okay uh press f3 and origin to geometry i don't have f3 you think i have an f3 button on this apple keyboard i've got this magical touchpad that blinks and it gives me emojis i i do have an escape button thank goodness but there's no f3 good luck finding the f3 function oh there we go function never knew how to do this before f3 um f3 origin to geometry origin snap cursor to world origin a to select all shift s actually i think i've seen this shift s ah which one of these cursor to world origin no did that do it cursor to selected selection to cursor that's kind of like what i did before uh shift s right origin which one now people this is definitely search for it no no no why search when i have a chat with 520 people watching who are you people what is going on usually this i i like very specifically did not promote this stream at all because i was like i don't really want anybody to tune in i need to be in object edit mode first object i forgot tab gets me to edit mode right i thought it was tab am i in edit mode oh yeah i wish i was on a call wait solar liner we can make this happen we can make a call happen selection to cursor keep offset okay so oh this one thank you boom did that do it selection to cursor i'm doing it over and over again all right i'm i'm going to hope that worked this is so frustrating sorry solar liner uh okay let's see if that worked file export uh i'm reading your chat solar line i'm reading it directly uh but maybe i got it right now let's let's uh you two let's replace oh whoops um okay hold on export obj let's set it to uh documents processing mutu flock data let's see if this did it oh where'd muchu go oh i wrote translate one i see ah translate it should have been scaled all right let's make this call happen solar liner i can get you but problem is i don't think i can people can hear you but let's see uh solar liner let's go into a voice channel um did you friend request me okay where where are you solar liner we're gonna we're gonna make this happen just go into the um okay okay hold on hold on hold on solo let's make this call thing happen uh disable um how do i find my friend requests friend solar liner oh wait wait okay hold on i'm a professional live streamer people i've lost where i am okay solar liner uh view profile send message hello okay now call hello uh oh okay wait can people hear i your your audio is very your audio is very unclear to me you cannot hear it okay i have to hang up i can't hear you at all hello oh that's much better all right hold on let me see if hold on hold on i'm going to see if your audio will go into the stream all right now say something i will say something one two okay hold on way too loud try again okay okay so solar liner is now audio is now in the stream and um i'm also uh going to uh screen share with you so you can see what i'm doing without the delay so hold on a second start my obs virtual camera oh not screen share turn on camera and then oh i don't know why it's uh reversed so horizontal flip okay so can you see in discord now um and hear me still uh in this car it is flipped in discord on my end okay i should have fixed it now oh it's flipped on your end is it not flipped now yeah yeah yeah okay sorry there you go okay okay okay we've got a a spontaneous guest here who knows blender and uh um is going so i can you can see my blender screen now yes yes i can okay tell me what to do this is very exciting all right so you have basically what's happening is that you i don't know if you see but you have to when you it shows when you select the meshes you have orange points yes those orange points represent the origin of each of the meshes offset they're like in where place because what happened during the last room is that you move the geometry in edit mode which moves the vertices but not the origin there's a function uh in blender with the f3 menu and there's a search bar top and if you type origin to geometry yeah there's a set a set origin on the f3 menu this one set origin origin to geometry oh sorry i zoomed this one i think i've i've lost your video i messed it up probably by zooming let me stop and start it again is it back uhoh right i'm back okay right there's a uh um origin to geometry okay i'm gonna select that yep okay like an option on the menu got it and then now what i'm done now uhoh my internet connection is not helpful it's not a help photo uh yes it worked okay now i think you can maybe uh maybe you can try exposing that i'm not sure if uh i'm not sure the processing is going to handle both meshes maybe there's an option to join the matches okay well let me let me export it and let's see all right oh that looks oh wait hmm did you did you uh i don't think you've moved the new file i i uh i think so no these are the new files let me delete them oh because export oh volume increase on guest okay sorry you're very quiet i'm gonna move it up okay okay um all right i exported it okay so the second okay so um we're gonna try the second method the second method is to do ctrl j or command j i think on mac from blender that's gonna take the two meshes and join them into one yeah it also moved them around in a weird way and now hold on so ctrl j command j too loud now okay okay okay too loud now uh um command or command my my internet is not it's not being cooperative right now um i think that's only one mesh yeah yes now you can try the l the alt g uh key to center the center dimension oh no that's two meshes actually you can add any more like you can you can work with the f3 menu if you search but one thing couldn't i just do this a join selection to cursor to world origin and then selection to cursor and then can i just move this one yes like what if i do this that's not gonna work uh that's not that's not gonna work no that's not gonna work because what you need to do is you need to bring mucho to the center of the grid in blender hold on let's see here i've lost the regular chat right click set origin geometry to origin oh yeah i was not i was not aware that this was an option in the new versions of blender i used to i used to use blender back before there was back in the times where you had to right click to select if that uh thanks to people select both control control j okay ah there we go i got it joined it's one mesh now yes okay and now so now the origin is still lopsided uh still in a weird place so you can try that trick of uh setting the origin to geometry again so that was the right click set origin origin to geometry i don't have i don't have a right click option i have shift s whoops you can't you can't right click on the mac os what is this cursor which one of these i feel like this selection the cursor oops should work that sets the origin to the cursor but the origin is still blocked like it's still an offset from the mesh so you need to reset the origin you need to make the origin at the center of the mesh and then you can use that to sometimes so that was function f3 yeah um set origin origin origin to symmetry oh but that messes up the model oh because yes uh let me see the under on the right is a wrench tab on the bottom right that's the modifiers panel on uh on the right of the app there's a there's a set of tabs colorful icons oh yeah these and then there's a wrench yeah uh yeah so apply that modifier there's an apply button on the top yep there we go and now you can do again the set origin trick so function f3 set origin origin to geometry oh i see that look there we go there's a little dot look at that dot it's so perfect that represents okay okay file export no no no no wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait there's one more step okay one last trick for my final trick i will make it centered now you can do the shift s um selection textures or selection the correction and then oh look at that okay and now you can export it uh export to obj right here and now open up processing and there we go we did myself it but i did it okay thank you thank you for that all right i'm hanging up this call and because i think now i'm ready to move into processing thank you so much go back to okay all right we're back everybody whoo that was rough that was rough but i learned something there uh and i'm just trying to get all my monitor stuff back i was like some real technical gymnastics virtual cam go away now why is the light so weird but that i'm not too worried about i could let me translate i have an idea let me translate this back a little bit yeah i mean uh let's see what other kind i want to be able to see it so this is really now a processing issue let me see this is really what i meant to do let's set the world back a little bit more okay there we go so i'm not seeing any of the nice shading of mewtwo um but i am seeing muchoo so great so i i can i can maybe try some other kind of lighting oh i took the lights out whoops interesting so oh maybe because the material let's um let's go to uh processing reference for 10 minutes people it's okay uh lights ambient light let's try ambient light light specular so many options directional light let's try i like how this looks so let's try this directional light and ambient light see how that looks hmm i wonder if it's like something to do with the material um it might be it might be actually an issue with the model itself um let's put in uh let's put in a box and see what that looks like no the box is also no stroke this is like this example is it because it's like directly in the center maybe i need to move the light what if i use a point light because i think a point light is like yeah let's try this weird oh wait what is going on okay there we go now i'm seeing something i think i have an idea i have an idea i know this seems crazy but i have an idea ambient light let's try this yeah okay i have an idea which is um i'm going to reexport i think there's an option let me just change the scale in here so i'm going to change the scale here and see if that i mean this seems like a crazy and now okay that's a oh that's because the box is there okay the normals are inverted because of the scaling and processing change the direction with the up axis oh i see all right let's um let's get rid of this oh yeah look at that ah ah look at that okay also the the mutual's really all deform okay oh okay i have an idea so let's just uh rotate uh flip it around the xaxis 180 degrees pi is that right there we go and now let's get rid of the box out of its head okay so i could have changed the export uh i could have changed the export why what did i do i did something to the model where it's all like um right because oh no no that slice this was not i did something to the model where it lost that's fine mewtwo has a little slice cut out of it no problem no problem okay people ready for this now i've got a crazy idea let's go to examples let's go to uh topics simulate flocking okay so this is the flocking example so what i want to do is change this to flocking it's not really i'm not really doing 3d flocking i'm going to do i'm going to call it flocking plane but i'm going to change this to a p3d i'm going to change i want to and then i want to draw um just want to rotate it by like a little bit let's if i'm looking at it this way i want to just offset the xaxis by like 45 degrees yeah so okay perfect so now i want these voids to be at zero zero and the flock the voids the edges should be um well i'm just going to make up something i mean this is ridiculous what i'm doing because i should put that into a variable okay so the flocking is now happening on this like plane whoa watch i would like to be able to see so let's draw now a uh rectangle rectmode center so let's do let's call let's let's create a variable that's like the dimensions make that 500. so i want to make draw a rectangle at 0 0 dimension times 2 dimension times 2 let's say stroke 255 and a fill let's give this a fill with some alpha should see yeah that's the plane so when they get to the edge great so what i want to do is and let's uh let's uh send this out a little bit um i mean i've got some like major perspective issues uh and let's make the plane like much bigger so it sort of like fills the space okay and let's also actually let's do let's get pz cam because i think pz cam is gonna be a nice thing for me to have and i always forget how it works so i'm going to go to contributed libraries oh come on processing i'm going to restart processing um let's open up just to have um contributed libraries pisa cam i just want this basic one so this allows me to sort of like zoom in and out and move around the space so um let me go back to my flocking plane and a piece of cam over here flocking plane so i just need to create a piece of cam and cam equals new pisa cam and import piece of cam and i think that's all i need to do to have like a basic pz cam and now i don't i think i don't need this anymore or this let's see what i get yeah so i can fly around i don't know what and see the like little ants i kind of need a bigger window here um and maybe let's make this 200 whoa okay i like this let's rotate let's put that rotate x back in just to have it start a little bit offset and actually let's zoom out further i like actually seeing the plane uh okay this works so now i can i've got this little world this little plane and it's got like the flocks moving on it and what i want to do now is put my mewtwo characters there so let's go to uh open recent um mewtwo flock which is what the other thing is so uh and i need to just transfer over the data file the data folder i would like to fix the model so maybe someone can help help me with that um but what i thought actually is like maybe i could get one of the community uh created models um so now oops yeah that's fine so oh i didn't want that to go away come back so i want to create p shape mewtwo load mewtwo and then in the flock no in the boyd um i'm gonna have to i want this so where before i was drawing a triangle translating to the position and rotating by the angle which i still want to do i don't want the triangle anymore i want to flip let's first flip muchu oh and probably mewtwo is going to be sitting at the center of the plane so i'll have to translate up a little bit but let's just see what happens i think muchu is huge scale what's going on oh there's too many calls to push me oh i forgot the pop matrix that's important there we go you two where are you there you are this is not exactly what i had dreamed of oh yeah so if you choose like in sliced down the middle uh so let's see here um let's translate up a little bit um like to translate let's offset let's rotate mutual and then translate off by like 50. whoa what did i just do that's is that the wrong no no no yeah i want to orient mewtwo and then pop it up a little bit like let's just make it oh scale is happening aft what is going on uh oh god position x y then rotate oh no no no no no no i want to move i need something to translate here right because oh not y what z z translate up like z i want so this would be there we go so now the flock is like above the plane but i only need to translate by like 55 i think yeah still let's try i mean i'm sure there's a scientific way of doing it there we go is my scale i want to just i want to just mute you to be smaller yeah so let's see if i add some lights now if that'll do something there's my little creatures go run around flock with each other this is this is not turning out like i had hoped let's try adding some lights can i do something with material oh there we go oh wait mewtwo is sideways mutual is sideways oh the zooming is like mewtwo is sideways okay all right so this rotate by x by pi is wrong still sideways oh i just need to also no that's right but i also need to rotate by y 90. is it y or z no z is rotating like this x yeah this should be no no no not not that by not x rotate y pi divided by two this should get mutual to stand up there we go why are they wiggling like that i like that look at that little just flocking around wiggling i think they're wiggling because of this rotation this root so first first stand it up flip it over then rotate along z yeah they should be turning the direction they're moving yeah no it's right uhoh i'm so confused okay hold on let's do these one at a time this should stand them up no that didn't stand them up i'm so lost i'm just going to try every axis yes that stood them up okay rotate x stands them up and they're actually i that also they're in the right orientation their head is on top so now i should be able to just rotate by the direction that they're going in not along z is that so if they've stood up oh maybe i'm y then is the direction that they're moving in there we go now they're rotated in the direction they're moving there we go there we go so this is exactly what i meant to happen now let's do let's have them be half the size that's better and let's make um let's make many more of them there we go so muse fly sort of fitting to have them above now i could add z there's absolutely no reason now that i'm in 3d why i couldn't give them a z and have their vector a little bit all the vector mass should be the same um give them an initial give them an initial 3d velocity vector oh they're flying oh my god flocking in 3d the problem is i need to give their i need to give them a bounding box also along z and this should be right now that i have that global variable and then i should do it for z now let me draw the box let me draw instead of a rectangle i think if i do box dimensions times two and i should say no fill stroke weight eight let's make it this should be their bounding box [Laughter] okay this is pretty wild not what i expected to make now i feel like the flocking is very clumpy so what do what parameter this is just the sort of like core example so a couple things i could do is let's wait the separation much more let's wait separation more because it'll make them a little more and i think i also need to think about their distance that they see each other like their desired separation is just 25. so let's make this uh 10 of the dimension and then i think in alignment let's make this 20 percent and cohesion let's also make that 20 so i think this should keep how to paint them pink um can i i think in i can do this i think i can apply a fill no let me have this zoomed out i guess that's i don't know what this argument does okay it does do what i think it does no it's like the like something about like the field of view or something i think i was i'm confused about what this argument is um and then because i can do this whoa what is going on there we go this is what i was looking to see oh no no that's bad oh i don't know how to use pz cam let me actually just take off pz cam oh wow that perspective is so weird that's sort of what i expected to see and what happened to my angle oh i don't have it anymore oh okay okay okay relax everybody that was kind of fast pink ambient light okay we'll try that oh they're sideways again because i did something i guess not using pz cam um this is what i wanted to see but i kind of want to have pz cam also so let's see if i can make that happen so if i change this to put the pz cam back in what if i do this whoa i don't know i don't know what's happening anymore oh i'm above everything there we go this works all right use pizza cam with mouse okay there's so now all right i gotta i gotta slow down stop let me try oh i rotated space not the cam oh i can rotate the cam right but this is fine i like this i like being in the middle actually so let's see if i can get um ambient light that's pink let's try that um if i say ambient light 255 50 255. let's see what this does yeah there we go okay now we're talking all right does anybody have yeah i should do and avoid the boundary i should have a force that pushes them back in but i i gotta stop this is enough i gotta go this is the project i wanted to make now the question is could i get a i mean i love mute my mewtwo but does anybody marcos does is your model available could you export your mu your mute your mu model because i would like to see how this looks with a um a better a better or different model also i want to see how many i can really fit in so how many oh this is i don't need this how many do i have 300 let's try 500. oops i like how they're actually just rotating along the x y plane it is in another computer oh well did anybody is i forgot to ask chrissy for her uh mew model but i can get i can get that i can just share it on social media um what happens by the way so maybe well i think i'm done let's try making this uh full screen i think i'm done for today it is 10 20 i'm 20 minutes past where i meant to be i mean one thing that would be interesting here is i kind of like so i sort of have a weird idea which is let me get rid of this box and now i'm just in the middle here now of a world of i'm upside down they're so far away without the box i'm really lost oh there we go this is what i wanted to see remove the mewtwo fill line is that really going to make a difference oh yeah the other kind of question i have is i have both lights and ambient light so that's with just the ambient light so i guess it's good to have them both does it matter what order this is in oh interesting it does matter so maybe this light doesn't need to be as bright oh is youtube's compression having a hard time with this sorry so if you can make a now imagine if i had multiple models i don't know i kind of want to fix the little like cutout there or maybe that's just sort of like a nice quality um i would want to put in like an octree or quad tree so i could just have so many more um but i think i'm done for today [Laughter] unless anybody has like a really really like great suggestion of something i should absolutely do or a mew model there can be only one oh interesting so am i doing yeah let's see what other i mean part of me wants to actually follow the perspective of one of them use all right that's the last thing i'm gonna do um but i think that's gonna mess up oh no because all right let me look at pz cam let me understand pz cam a little bit more because i can't stop hello pc cam off screen hello pc head up display no camera states what's that does this do so i think if i wanted to follow one of them i couldn't use pz cam instead what i would do is oh i'm in the wrong thing like right if so let's take let me take out pz cam again and this is just the default view but if i want to follow one of the muse for example if i were to say void follow equals and let's get rid of this rotate y for a second equals flock dot boyds.getzero flock.boyds.get0. so that's the very first void in the array couldn't i just translate to the center of that void follow dot what is it called position position i mean like there is a look at function and a camera function in but what if i just translate to that void's location and everything is drawn relative to it oh negative oh but then i would need to draw everything offset from now wouldn't this work like if i translate the world then it's going to be at 0 0. oh but i also need to translate to the center but i feel like i should be flying through can't you move the cameras yeah but like this particular boy should always be at the center let's zoom out a little bit it's a bit offcenter i know what am i missing here we're tracking it but we're too far away but it should be if it's being drawn at its position its position should be at oh this isn't really where the camera is maybe i do need to use the processing camera all right let's try that or look at isn't there like a look at or camera wait i wrote a tutorial about this p3d look there's a tutorial about this uh lighting okay perspective okay camera eye position scene center upwards axis okay let's use the actual camera i'm gonna keep this all right okay great so that's this is with the camera being at the sort of like so the arguments are i position so the i position i actually want it to be at zero zero what happens if i just make it zero zero zero then the scene center is also zero zero zero and the upwards axis is zero one zero right so i position scene center up axis oh there's everything let's also not make this full screen anymore just a little easier to see so typically if the eye position now should be offset from this right okay yes so i'm above the scene okay i'm above the scene but now what i want to be is i want to be at oh no no i want the scene center to be this particular boyd okay so i'm getting closer here but what do i where do i want the oh the eye position should just be like a little bit offset what if i had the eye position where that boy is oh but i'm looking i can't that doesn't make sense can the oh can the scene center still be this but the eye i don't feel like i'm flying around i think i am though did i oh z i thank you yeah this is me flying around you can't really see because i just jumped and uh looking up is x what if looking up is z there we go up other way here i am flying around oh i'm always looking at the i'm always looking i'm at that boy but i'm not looking straight ahead i'm always looking at the center of the scene so that's kind of weird maybe what i wanted to use is look at is there a look at function no i think the camera so i suppose what i could do is i could have my eye oh and i could just look straight ahead so i could always say like hey you know where i'm looking i'm looking at where i am plus straight at so if x if y were up straight ahead would be z let's try looking straight ahead plus like 50. minus 50. not do i need to like look really much further away yeah uh look in the y direction where are all you people where are you i just want to look oh there we go yeah this is me looking straight ahead now it's funny they don't look like they're flying because i'm flying with them i guess let's put the box back in yeah now we see i'm flying around the box oh i could look in the i should be looking in the direction of my velocity ah so i should be able to say so position is where i am and the direction is my position plus that where i'm going i can look in the direction of my velocity so this would be pause dot x pause dot y pause dot z and look in direction.x direction.y direction.z that should work right my velocity is very i'm looking behind myself i think oh my god the velocity is very shaky shaky camera work there i could smooth it out all right let's do um i got an idea here p vector d i r equals new p vector and then i'm going to say that's uh uh i'm gonna say like let's call this smooth let's let's call this dir and let's let's call this i'm actually gonna call this look at i'm going to call that look at i'm going to say look at dot lerp direction 0.1 so this should smooth it out oh but then i need to put look at in here smoother let's say point zero one there we go this is what i meant all along now i don't love that every time i hit the edge oh this is fun the question is do we like having the box there let's make the background a color let me get the coding train color palette let's try some coding train colors um this is the only way i know how to get there the cj made this website which i really need to be i need to like permanently let's try this color for the ambient light and let's try like this color for the background well i like this um now the question is can i what happens if i give the box a slight fill like just out of curiosity what happens if i give the box this fill okay so the box is white that's interesting what if i go here and get like this yellow color but give it like a lot of alpha it's just blending with the background is there an issue i wonder one thing i should do is i shouldn't render that first void so hmm oh this is kind of annoying the way that i've written this code run render oh i see um let's just do this and then first is false i just want to treat the first one differently um so um so just in case that's messing anything up let's not render that first one it's just the camera okay i don't think that changed anything hit the box and bounce off i know that's not really going to work with flocking i guess i could try it let's try it that'll be the last thing let's try um switching what the edges do this is definitely going to be a problem all right this is going to be really annoying but i'm going to do it i'm going to do them each individually well let's see else if position dot x is greater than dimm so that's x y y i was going to make a force but let's just try this see did i get this right okay let's see what happens oh hi gloria it's looking back no that's not intended it should be looking where it's going yeah it really has to be a force but that's going to take me a lot longer to write that code negative z is forward i know this is kind of doing something along the lines of what i had hoped it's going to get stuck around the edge quite a bit so how do i fix it from looking forward like it's it's looking in the direction of its velocity how would i change that is that this no now it's just upside down you need to keep the direction not to look at i don't understand add the position after the lerp oh right thank you okay okay okay gloria's here everybody hi good doggie yes i know you probably need me to take you for a walk okay okay yes this is you're making it hard for me to code yes i know you're such a good girl they can't really see you [Laughter] okay okay okay come on can you take a break please i know i know i love you too you could taco okay wait let me just fix this one thing let me just fix this one thing please i think if i look away from her she will decide to go to sleep it worked um okay absolutely right that this i have to lerp with the velocity and then oh no no and then so i need a smooth lerp v so i always lerp the velocity and then position dot and then look at is the position plus the lerp velocity i don't know what that's really going to do but that's this is more correct oh no i feel like i'm flying now yes i'm stuck at the edge i gotta go back to my other borders i i gotta stop so we're gonna this is this is not really a great solution so just for right now we're gonna go with the wrap around borders okay i think i liked it better with and this is the last thing i'm going to do without a fill for the box we can make the stroke color of the box that yellow and then let's make this full screen and i think we're done uh oh i still think i need to say no phil there we go okay everybody what's some good music to go with this thank you for watching today's episode of the coding train where we're flying through a world of views flocking in beautiful space bit behind no we oh behind the oh oh come on that's a good idea oh oh why do i have to do this idea now i'm just curious okay so first i would have to render it this is definitely the last thing i'm doing oh my god it's almost eleven o'clock so uh subtract so couldn't i then if i subtract the velocity and i switch the order of these am i going to see it i think i'm looking backwards and i also need to scale this up position minus that times like 50. i think i'm looking backwards if i'm looking backwards oh weird somebody else is going to have to figure this out for me i'm too tight brain is totally i'm totally brain dead uh so i'm at the lookout position and i'm looking at the position subtract the position from the the velocity minus the position i mean like this couldn't possibly be it could it oh boy look at that oh now i'm definitely looking backwards the camera zener is clipping the void and i'm looking at it from above negative look at no no no yeah i could pick a random one but picking the first one is the same you need to bring the near plane back to let closer objects be drawn reduce the near plane value on the 3d render this is kind of interesting though whatever i i don't know how to do that in processing affect the z near plane i was just trying to go like really really far away like i figured like multiplying the velocity by 250 i think i'm actually following it i'm just really far away so you don't see it near add minus that's what i'm doing add minus oh but let's try subtracting it yeah yeah i like this i don't know if i i'm behind it by quite a bit let's try being behind it by less it's sort of like where i start also it makes such a difference because now i've sort of like started near the edge so let's go back to thank you for everyone for tuning in to the world of flying news flying news oh we're flying through the world seeing all the news yeah i am fault there's one that i'm following does it can't you sort of see that there's one that i'm following um i don't know if i'm going to make this into a p5.js version that would be interesting to try i will i will upload this um all of the voids spawn at the center so i'm pretty sure i'm spawning them all at the center but i don't know i'm this is my last live stream probably until me i would say september i was gonna say maybe like the last couple days of august i might have one but this is probably the last live stream until september um oh my god my desktop audio is still highlight the follow i don't know how to do that okay i'm going to release this code this is what i suggest highlighting the follow one cleaning up using a different model so many possibilities let me upload this somewhere right now and please make a version of this and share it with me where is this on the desktop music is quite hilarious so i am going to say thank you to everybody i it's not the end of the year that seems like because it's just a random date in july but for me i kind of my life so operates on the academic calendar this is kind of like really the end of the year for me so uh thank you everybody for your support whether it's watching it's tweeting it's giving your community contributions it's joining as a member um all this stuff is really meaningful to me i really enjoy having the chance to connect and code and do weird stuff like this um i'm gonna leave this running for a little bit to read your messages in the chat um i'm gonna take you out with by readings also some random numbers and please join the discord here's the link to the discord stay tuned hopefully for some other videos will come out get in touch with me if you want to help me with the fractal flame stuff and i'm going to read you some random numbers okay goodbye everybody forty five thousand six hundred seventy four ninety seven

are coming twitter bot videos are coming and hopefully a fractal flame or a 3d marching cube or something like that and i love you all have a wonderful rest of your summer and um always stay choo chewing on the choo choo train with passenger mewtwo [Laughter] as always i always forget that this stop this stop this stop this stop i'm gonna do this stop this stop i'm gonna do this this stop this
