00:00 - hello I am here to make a video to show
00:03 - you how to program a certain kind of
00:05 - thing a kind of thing like the thing you
00:06 - see behind me which is oh I have to
00:08 - stand still for this to happen but um
00:11 - what you see behind me is a flocking
00:13 - system there are all of these little
00:15 - squares floating around the screen and
00:17 - what they're doing is they're picking up
00:19 - pixel values color values from a camera
00:21 - that's in front of me and smearing those
00:22 - colors onto the screen so this is a
00:24 - project that I actually I think that I
00:26 - made around 14 years ago I'm running
00:28 - updated version of it that runs in
00:30 - processing and what I'm going to do is
00:31 - show you how to actually make something
00:33 - like this happen in the browser using
00:35 - JavaScript p5js HTML 5 canvas um so let
00:39 - me just mention a few other things about
00:40 - this that you'll see is that so if I if
00:42 - I click the mouse here which um I'm now
00:45 - I'm clearing the background and what
00:46 - you'll see is they're just all of these
00:48 - squares moving around the screen now
00:50 - they're using this kind of like bees
00:51 - swarming insect swarming sort of kind of
00:53 - like motion and you can see that's what
00:55 - the camera is actually seeing up behind
00:57 - me and so if I let go of the mouse in
00:59 - instead of clearing the background these
01:01 - agents will just simply uh you know keep
01:04 - drawing those colors but their their
01:06 - trails are being revealed so how does
01:08 - how do you program something like this
01:10 - let's so I'm going to close this down um
01:13 - and I'm going to minimize processing
01:16 - here and I've got a p5js example that
01:18 - I'm going to start with and the example
01:20 - just has a couple things it has a live
01:23 - video and it has a single particle now
01:26 - this particle comes from a previous
01:28 - video that I will magically have an
01:29 - annotation pop up that references where
01:32 - I showed you how to have something move
01:33 - around the screen and draw a trail of
01:35 - itself and you can see here and it's
01:37 - going to move randomly so the you know
01:40 - in the swarming thing they're swarming
01:41 - like insects here it's just going to
01:42 - move randomly but if you decide to take
01:45 - this example and do something with it
01:46 - you might think of different kinds of
01:47 - motion spiral Etc whatever that you
01:49 - might think of doing so let me run this
01:51 - particular
01:52 - example right here and you can see this
01:55 - is all it is you can see that there is a
01:57 - video Dom element giving me a sort of
01:59 - low res resolution image of myself that
02:01 - I can use to pick up pixel colors and
02:03 - there is a thing moving around the
02:04 - screen randomly a single particle so the
02:07 - first thing that I want to figure out
02:09 - how to do is how do I have this particle
02:12 - actually grab colors from that video and
02:15 - um so notice that I say video. load
02:18 - pixels um one thing that I'm going to do
02:20 - just right now for a second is put
02:21 - background back into
02:24 - draw and I'm going to run this again so
02:27 - you can see this is what's happening so
02:28 - what I want is for that particle to be
02:30 - colored according to what's in the video
02:32 - so this is actually kind of an easy
02:34 - thing to do surprisingly
02:37 - enough in the particle object itself
02:40 - notice how it gets a fill color which is
02:42 - always 255 comma 150 so it's white with
02:45 - a little bit of alpha but I don't want
02:47 - this to be 255 rather what I want is to
02:50 - get some sort of color from the video
02:53 - doget this.x this.y so this is kind of
02:57 - the idea here what I want is I have the
03:04 - canvas with a particle moving around and
03:08 - I have this particular video with a
03:11 - portrait you know of myself so this
03:15 - particle should look up the
03:17 - corresponding color in the video and set
03:20 - its fill and this particle's location is
03:23 - at this dox this doy so I should be able
03:26 - to just say give me the pixel value at
03:28 - this.x this .y in the video only I can't
03:32 - right because if you notice this canvas
03:35 - is actually 640 by 480 and my video is
03:39 - actually 40 by 30 so what I need to do
03:42 - is I need to scale down so wherever the
03:45 - particle is it's X and Y I need to scale
03:48 - it down dividing by 16 to find the
03:51 - corresponding pixel value in the video
03:53 - so let's come back over here and do that
03:55 - so what I think could be useful is to
03:57 - make another variable I'm going to call
03:58 - it PX for like pixel X I just made a
04:02 - weird like arm motion that I don't know
04:03 - what it means pixel X um PX and I'm
04:06 - going to say this.x divided by V scale
04:09 - if you remember V scale is a variable
04:11 - that I have that keeps track of how big
04:13 - is the canvas relative to the video and
04:15 - I'm going to make another variable
04:16 - called py which is this.y divided by V
04:20 - scale and I'm going to say now give me
04:23 - the color at PX py now there's a slight
04:25 - issue P I wonder if P5 actually doesn't
04:28 - care let's keep going there's issue
04:30 - which is that I might get the number
04:31 - 4.79 83125 which is not a valid pixel
04:35 - value pixel values are only whole
04:37 - numbers integer values pixel 4 pixel 7
04:40 - there's no pixel 7 and a half so I might
04:43 - need to add something to this to correct
04:44 - that but let's just sort of see at least
04:46 - what happens now what is in this
04:50 - variable Co let's just see if this even
04:52 - works and I'm going to so I'm going to
04:54 - add console.log the color and I'm by the
04:57 - way I'm not using the word color
05:00 - even though I have a variable that's
05:02 - describing a color color the word color
05:04 - is a keyword in P5 it's an actual
05:06 - function so I'm just saying Co for kind
05:08 - of short for color so let's now go back
05:11 - and run this again we have a view of our
05:14 - console here we can see I'm only ever
05:16 - getting black that doesn't seem right I
05:20 - don't think it should be black uh 00 255
05:23 - so let's go and let's add this thing
05:25 - that I want to add which maybe we'll fix
05:27 - it saying floor so floor does is it
05:31 - takes any number that might be a decimal
05:33 - number and lops off that decimal number
05:35 - so 3.8 becomes three 3.3 becomes 3 3.9
05:39 - becomes 3 7.2 becomes seven just takes
05:41 - that and gives me a nice integer whole
05:43 - number which is what I need and let's
05:45 - run this again still getting only black
05:48 - here oh no there we go just took a
05:49 - minute for the video to like come alive
05:51 - so you can see this is working and that
05:53 - it's pulling out color values you can
05:55 - see they're all very green because it's
05:56 - probably wandering around the green
05:58 - screen behind me so what can I do now I
06:01 - should be able to say and notice by the
06:02 - way that this is an array so the get
06:05 - function gives you a single Pixel and it
06:07 - gives you an array a red green blue and
06:10 - Alpha value so what I can do is I can
06:14 - say now fill now fill the red Val
06:18 - there's a bunch of different ways I
06:19 - could do this but and this might be sort
06:20 - of a silly way but I'm just going to say
06:22 - let me actually now take the red green
06:24 - and blue values to color that particular
06:27 - and I can take out console.log
06:30 - I can run this again and you can see
06:31 - come alive video you can see look it's
06:33 - green and you can see if my face gets in
06:36 - there there we go it's picking up colors
06:38 - so good we're getting somewhere now
06:40 - let's go back to sketch. JS let's put
06:43 - let's take out background and draw and
06:46 - put background back in setup and you can
06:48 - see now it is going to start painting me
06:52 - if I stood very still but rather slowly
06:54 - and who knows how long and how patient
06:57 - we can be here to kind of do this so
07:00 - what what would might make this better
07:01 - is to have a lot of these in the window
07:05 - so what I think would make more sense is
07:07 - for me to make an array called
07:10 - particles let's start with 100 of
07:16 - them and let's say particles index I
07:20 - equals a new particle so instead of
07:22 - having a single variable particle let's
07:23 - have an array of particles let's make a
07:25 - whole bunch of them and then
07:28 - everything
07:30 - I can do a loop here through all the
07:37 - particles and just say particles index I
07:41 - update particles index I show and now I
07:45 - can run this again and we can
07:48 - see there we go as I move around you can
07:51 - see I'm kind of getting this like very
07:53 - pointal list like portrait of myself now
07:55 - there is no swarming there is no
07:57 - flocking it's just random motion also
07:59 - these particles they're leaving the
08:01 - window they're gone forever let's see if
08:03 - we can just make a few improvements to
08:05 - this at least to keep it a bit more
08:07 - stable so one thing that I think is kind
08:09 - of important here um and might be worth
08:12 - it might be worth actually making like a
08:13 - little slider for this I'm going to add
08:15 - a
08:16 - slider uh is that that Alpha value is
08:18 - going to make a big difference in uh
08:21 - what it looks like so Alpha goes between
08:22 - zero and 255 let's start in the middle
08:25 - at 127 and so I'm going to make a slider
08:28 - and then I'm just going to take this
08:30 - Alpha value Alpha value and have it be
08:32 - the value of that slider so we can sort
08:34 - of see what happens here with like less
08:37 - Alpha you know no Alpha like uh less
08:41 - more Alpha I don't what is it you can
08:44 - get that so it's fuzzier or harsher so
08:46 - that's one thing that's sort of
08:47 - important to see the other thing that I
08:49 - think might be good to do is add some
08:52 - kind of constraints like uh this.x
08:55 - equals constrain it's valued between
08:58 - zero and width
09:00 - I could probably come up with a better
09:01 - solution
09:03 - this.y zero. height so I don't ever want
09:06 - it to leave the window um so I want to
09:10 - keep it always
09:12 - on in the window and so we can see now
09:16 - uh and they're all starting from the
09:18 - middle maybe I should maybe I want to
09:20 - have them all start from uh you know a
09:23 - random spot in the
09:26 - window just
09:29 - uh so let's do that so you can see here
09:33 - and uh now that's working let's see what
09:36 - happens if now
09:38 - I go and uh make 500 of them is it even
09:42 - going to
09:43 - run come video so you can see there's an
09:46 - issue here which is like performance is
09:49 - a bit of an issue even though I have so
09:50 - many more now that I'm kind of more
09:53 - quickly seeing the image resolve whether
09:55 - or not I want that I don't know but it's
09:57 - running rather slow so there is a limit
09:58 - to how much we can really draw on canvas
10:00 - let's try 200 and see if it's kind of a
10:03 - smoother
10:04 - animation there we go so 200 seems
10:06 - pretty good another thing that I might
10:08 - add to this I'm stop and is uh maybe a
10:11 - variable for a size so I'm drawing them
10:14 - all as a 24x 24 but maybe I should make
10:18 - a random size between like four and
10:21 - 32 and uh so each one of these particles
10:25 - will actually be a different size um
10:27 - which might be kind of an interesting
10:29 - effect to have sort of like smaller dots
10:31 - and larger dots I don't know if that's
10:33 - really helpful I'm going to try to stand
10:35 - still for a second um you get the idea I
10:37 - could keep going with this so what I
10:38 - would say there's a you know there's
10:40 - there's a few things that I want to
10:41 - mention here number one is um there's a
10:44 - couple things that I'm doing in the in
10:46 - the original example that I showed you
10:47 - that maybe I won't add right now but
10:48 - I'll
10:49 - mention one thing that you might that
10:52 - that can be an issue is that if you have
10:54 - depending on what your motion
10:57 - is if you have a particle that's here
11:00 - and then the next frame it's over here
11:02 - there's going to be this sort of jump so
11:04 - one thing that I did do in that you
11:06 - could consider doing is wherever the
11:07 - particle moves to also draw particles in
11:10 - between them so you always get this
11:12 - continuous line you could also use
11:14 - actually just the line function and keep
11:16 - track of its previous location and its
11:17 - current location that's one thing that
11:19 - you might consider the other thing that
11:21 - you might consider is averaging color
11:24 - over time so let me let me let me
11:26 - explain what I mean by this so let's say
11:30 - there is uh this is the figure that the
11:32 - camera is seeing and this is the
11:34 - particle and it's moving this way and
11:37 - this is the painting that it's making so
11:39 - and this is a red sweater and this is a
11:41 - black background what you're going to
11:44 - see based on what I've done here is red
11:47 - red red red red black right this being
11:51 - that edge the particle is going to
11:54 - instantly change to the next color cuz
11:55 - it's literally drawing the color it sees
11:57 - with the pixel but but if every time it
12:00 - moves you just average in a little more
12:03 - color then that creates a smearing
12:05 - effect so what you would see instead is
12:08 - red red red red red a little less red a
12:10 - little less a little less red blacker
12:12 - blacker blacker blacker blacker blacker
12:14 - black black black red a little more red
12:16 - so it's going to average the color as
12:18 - it's moving so in order to do that what
12:21 - you would need is for your particle
12:24 - object to actually store a color and
12:26 - when you get the color from the video to
12:28 - average that new color with the color
12:30 - that it's storing so I'll leave that as
12:31 - an exercise I'll try to post an example
12:33 - that does that there's actually a pi
12:35 - function called lur color that will do
12:38 - this math of averaging for you that you
12:40 - could look at using U boy I really kind
12:42 - want to add it right now but I'm not
12:43 - going to um but and then the other thing
12:45 - I would say is to really think about is
12:48 - what is the motion so you know if I go
12:50 - back really quickly just we remind
12:52 - ourselves what this looks like with the
12:54 - background on right you can see this is
12:57 - this is the motion of my particles that
12:59 - are painting the image but what if all
13:01 - the particles just move left and right
13:03 - or up and down or they use a flocking
13:05 - system or they're all bouncing off of
13:06 - each other or they're all spiraling
13:08 - around so what are some other ways that
13:10 - you can think of how those brush Strokes
13:12 - are created and in addition like are you
13:14 - just drawing circles or you smearing
13:16 - like you know image textures or
13:18 - rectangles there's a lot of
13:19 - possibilities here so think about all
13:21 - those possibilities maybe make some sort
13:23 - of painting thing pixel whatever and
13:26 - share it with me on Twitter in the
13:27 - comments and ask your questions and I
13:29 - look forward to see what people make
13:32 - under 50 minutes thank goodness okay

Cleaned transcript:

hello I am here to make a video to show you how to program a certain kind of thing a kind of thing like the thing you see behind me which is oh I have to stand still for this to happen but um what you see behind me is a flocking system there are all of these little squares floating around the screen and what they're doing is they're picking up pixel values color values from a camera that's in front of me and smearing those colors onto the screen so this is a project that I actually I think that I made around 14 years ago I'm running updated version of it that runs in processing and what I'm going to do is show you how to actually make something like this happen in the browser using JavaScript p5js HTML 5 canvas um so let me just mention a few other things about this that you'll see is that so if I if I click the mouse here which um I'm now I'm clearing the background and what you'll see is they're just all of these squares moving around the screen now they're using this kind of like bees swarming insect swarming sort of kind of like motion and you can see that's what the camera is actually seeing up behind me and so if I let go of the mouse in instead of clearing the background these agents will just simply uh you know keep drawing those colors but their their trails are being revealed so how does how do you program something like this let's so I'm going to close this down um and I'm going to minimize processing here and I've got a p5js example that I'm going to start with and the example just has a couple things it has a live video and it has a single particle now this particle comes from a previous video that I will magically have an annotation pop up that references where I showed you how to have something move around the screen and draw a trail of itself and you can see here and it's going to move randomly so the you know in the swarming thing they're swarming like insects here it's just going to move randomly but if you decide to take this example and do something with it you might think of different kinds of motion spiral Etc whatever that you might think of doing so let me run this particular example right here and you can see this is all it is you can see that there is a video Dom element giving me a sort of low res resolution image of myself that I can use to pick up pixel colors and there is a thing moving around the screen randomly a single particle so the first thing that I want to figure out how to do is how do I have this particle actually grab colors from that video and um so notice that I say video. load pixels um one thing that I'm going to do just right now for a second is put background back into draw and I'm going to run this again so you can see this is what's happening so what I want is for that particle to be colored according to what's in the video so this is actually kind of an easy thing to do surprisingly enough in the particle object itself notice how it gets a fill color which is always 255 comma 150 so it's white with a little bit of alpha but I don't want this to be 255 rather what I want is to get some sort of color from the video doget this.x this.y so this is kind of the idea here what I want is I have the canvas with a particle moving around and I have this particular video with a portrait you know of myself so this particle should look up the corresponding color in the video and set its fill and this particle's location is at this dox this doy so I should be able to just say give me the pixel value at this.x this .y in the video only I can't right because if you notice this canvas is actually 640 by 480 and my video is actually 40 by 30 so what I need to do is I need to scale down so wherever the particle is it's X and Y I need to scale it down dividing by 16 to find the corresponding pixel value in the video so let's come back over here and do that so what I think could be useful is to make another variable I'm going to call it PX for like pixel X I just made a weird like arm motion that I don't know what it means pixel X um PX and I'm going to say this.x divided by V scale if you remember V scale is a variable that I have that keeps track of how big is the canvas relative to the video and I'm going to make another variable called py which is this.y divided by V scale and I'm going to say now give me the color at PX py now there's a slight issue P I wonder if P5 actually doesn't care let's keep going there's issue which is that I might get the number 4.79 83125 which is not a valid pixel value pixel values are only whole numbers integer values pixel 4 pixel 7 there's no pixel 7 and a half so I might need to add something to this to correct that but let's just sort of see at least what happens now what is in this variable Co let's just see if this even works and I'm going to so I'm going to add console.log the color and I'm by the way I'm not using the word color even though I have a variable that's describing a color color the word color is a keyword in P5 it's an actual function so I'm just saying Co for kind of short for color so let's now go back and run this again we have a view of our console here we can see I'm only ever getting black that doesn't seem right I don't think it should be black uh 00 255 so let's go and let's add this thing that I want to add which maybe we'll fix it saying floor so floor does is it takes any number that might be a decimal number and lops off that decimal number so 3.8 becomes three 3.3 becomes 3 3.9 becomes 3 7.2 becomes seven just takes that and gives me a nice integer whole number which is what I need and let's run this again still getting only black here oh no there we go just took a minute for the video to like come alive so you can see this is working and that it's pulling out color values you can see they're all very green because it's probably wandering around the green screen behind me so what can I do now I should be able to say and notice by the way that this is an array so the get function gives you a single Pixel and it gives you an array a red green blue and Alpha value so what I can do is I can say now fill now fill the red Val there's a bunch of different ways I could do this but and this might be sort of a silly way but I'm just going to say let me actually now take the red green and blue values to color that particular and I can take out console.log I can run this again and you can see come alive video you can see look it's green and you can see if my face gets in there there we go it's picking up colors so good we're getting somewhere now let's go back to sketch. JS let's put let's take out background and draw and put background back in setup and you can see now it is going to start painting me if I stood very still but rather slowly and who knows how long and how patient we can be here to kind of do this so what what would might make this better is to have a lot of these in the window so what I think would make more sense is for me to make an array called particles let's start with 100 of them and let's say particles index I equals a new particle so instead of having a single variable particle let's have an array of particles let's make a whole bunch of them and then everything I can do a loop here through all the particles and just say particles index I update particles index I show and now I can run this again and we can see there we go as I move around you can see I'm kind of getting this like very pointal list like portrait of myself now there is no swarming there is no flocking it's just random motion also these particles they're leaving the window they're gone forever let's see if we can just make a few improvements to this at least to keep it a bit more stable so one thing that I think is kind of important here um and might be worth it might be worth actually making like a little slider for this I'm going to add a slider uh is that that Alpha value is going to make a big difference in uh what it looks like so Alpha goes between zero and 255 let's start in the middle at 127 and so I'm going to make a slider and then I'm just going to take this Alpha value Alpha value and have it be the value of that slider so we can sort of see what happens here with like less Alpha you know no Alpha like uh less more Alpha I don't what is it you can get that so it's fuzzier or harsher so that's one thing that's sort of important to see the other thing that I think might be good to do is add some kind of constraints like uh this.x equals constrain it's valued between zero and width I could probably come up with a better solution this.y zero. height so I don't ever want it to leave the window um so I want to keep it always on in the window and so we can see now uh and they're all starting from the middle maybe I should maybe I want to have them all start from uh you know a random spot in the window just uh so let's do that so you can see here and uh now that's working let's see what happens if now I go and uh make 500 of them is it even going to run come video so you can see there's an issue here which is like performance is a bit of an issue even though I have so many more now that I'm kind of more quickly seeing the image resolve whether or not I want that I don't know but it's running rather slow so there is a limit to how much we can really draw on canvas let's try 200 and see if it's kind of a smoother animation there we go so 200 seems pretty good another thing that I might add to this I'm stop and is uh maybe a variable for a size so I'm drawing them all as a 24x 24 but maybe I should make a random size between like four and 32 and uh so each one of these particles will actually be a different size um which might be kind of an interesting effect to have sort of like smaller dots and larger dots I don't know if that's really helpful I'm going to try to stand still for a second um you get the idea I could keep going with this so what I would say there's a you know there's there's a few things that I want to mention here number one is um there's a couple things that I'm doing in the in the original example that I showed you that maybe I won't add right now but I'll mention one thing that you might that that can be an issue is that if you have depending on what your motion is if you have a particle that's here and then the next frame it's over here there's going to be this sort of jump so one thing that I did do in that you could consider doing is wherever the particle moves to also draw particles in between them so you always get this continuous line you could also use actually just the line function and keep track of its previous location and its current location that's one thing that you might consider the other thing that you might consider is averaging color over time so let me let me let me explain what I mean by this so let's say there is uh this is the figure that the camera is seeing and this is the particle and it's moving this way and this is the painting that it's making so and this is a red sweater and this is a black background what you're going to see based on what I've done here is red red red red red black right this being that edge the particle is going to instantly change to the next color cuz it's literally drawing the color it sees with the pixel but but if every time it moves you just average in a little more color then that creates a smearing effect so what you would see instead is red red red red red a little less red a little less a little less red blacker blacker blacker blacker blacker blacker black black black red a little more red so it's going to average the color as it's moving so in order to do that what you would need is for your particle object to actually store a color and when you get the color from the video to average that new color with the color that it's storing so I'll leave that as an exercise I'll try to post an example that does that there's actually a pi function called lur color that will do this math of averaging for you that you could look at using U boy I really kind want to add it right now but I'm not going to um but and then the other thing I would say is to really think about is what is the motion so you know if I go back really quickly just we remind ourselves what this looks like with the background on right you can see this is this is the motion of my particles that are painting the image but what if all the particles just move left and right or up and down or they use a flocking system or they're all bouncing off of each other or they're all spiraling around so what are some other ways that you can think of how those brush Strokes are created and in addition like are you just drawing circles or you smearing like you know image textures or rectangles there's a lot of possibilities here so think about all those possibilities maybe make some sort of painting thing pixel whatever and share it with me on Twitter in the comments and ask your questions and I look forward to see what people make under 50 minutes thank goodness okay
