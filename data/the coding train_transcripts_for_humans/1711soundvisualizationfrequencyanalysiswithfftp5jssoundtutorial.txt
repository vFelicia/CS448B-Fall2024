00:00 - hello in this video I'm going to take
00:02 - what I did previously which is uh
00:05 - drawing a kind of graph of the volume of
00:07 - song um and instead of drawing the
00:10 - volume of the song the amplitude of the
00:13 - song across all frequencies I'm going to
00:16 - use an object in P5 called the fft
00:19 - object to analyze the sound in a way
00:21 - that I can get the amplitude for low
00:24 - frequency sounds for high frequency
00:26 - sounds and in that sense I might see a
00:28 - different graph based on
00:30 - a different graph if it were somebody
00:31 - whistling and there were high pitch
00:33 - sounds versus somebody speaking in a
00:35 - very deep voice or something like that
00:37 - so we'll see what happens once I start
00:39 - to use that let me pause the music for a
00:40 - second now so in P5 the object that I'm
00:44 - interested is this P5 fft object so we
00:48 - used P5 do amplitude to get the current
00:51 - volume of a sound P5 fft analyzes the
00:55 - sound Returns the results from the
00:57 - frequency spectrum or time domain he
01:01 - what are those things the frequency
01:03 - spectrum the time domain anyway so the
01:06 - the the the issue is here there's raw
01:09 - data coming in from an MP3 file a
01:12 - microphone whatever and that raw data
01:15 - has to be processed and analyzed through
01:17 - an algorithm to pull things that we care
01:20 - about out of it one methodology for
01:23 - doing this is called fft so if I go to
01:25 - the Wikipedia page you can read a lot
01:27 - more about it fast for your trans
01:30 - transform I'm not going to write this
01:32 - algorithm from scratch or create the
01:34 - engine that does the fft analysis
01:37 - luckily for us P5 sound made by Jason
01:40 - seagull which is built on top of the web
01:43 - audio API has this built into it and so
01:46 - the idea is that what it does is it
01:48 - takes the sound and chops it up um well
01:51 - that's not really right but let me let
01:52 - me come over here for a second to see if
01:54 - we can think about
01:58 - this
02:00 - so if this is me analyzing the sound the
02:06 - amplitude amplitude object gives me a
02:10 - single value volume and I might be able
02:13 - to get I probably with the amplitude
02:14 - object I could get sort of like left and
02:16 - right channel like if it was stereo
02:17 - sound what's the amplitude of the left
02:20 - uh versus the right channel so maybe I
02:22 - could get two but with fft what I can
02:25 - actually get is something that looks we
02:28 - can and we'll make this like a graphic
02:31 - equalizer in other words what is the
02:33 - amplitude at different frequency levels
02:36 - and I can request the fft algorithm to
02:39 - give me the amount frequencies at
02:41 - various resolutions so to speak so I can
02:43 - ask for 256 bands so frequencies with a
02:48 - with a a level of detail of 256 or 512
02:51 - or whatever generally the sort of
02:53 - standard here are these um um powers of
02:56 - two so to speak but um uh I encourage
02:59 - you to I'll try to put some resources in
03:02 - the in this video's description with
03:03 - more about fft stuff and how it works
03:06 - but for right now let's actually just
03:07 - try to make it work so what one thing I
03:09 - want to do is I want to change this
03:12 - amplitude object to be an fft object and
03:16 - then I want to say instead of making a
03:18 - new P5 amplitude object I want to make a
03:20 - new P P5 fft object let's go to the
03:24 - reference and click on
03:27 - fft and let's look at what's what the
03:29 - functions are so I can waveform we'll
03:32 - look at waveform later but analyze
03:34 - computes the amplitude values along the
03:36 - frequency domain the array indic it
03:39 - gives me an array and those indices
03:41 - correspond to specific frequencies
03:44 - lowest to highest okay so let's just say
03:47 - we can look here actually one of the
03:48 - things that I think I need to do or
03:50 - maybe it does it by default let's just
03:52 - see okay so I'm going to say uh analyze
03:55 - so what I'm going to do here in draw now
03:57 - let's let's uh let's get rid of
04:00 - the circular stuff maybe we can come
04:02 - back to that in a second going to
04:03 - simplify a lot here I I want to instead
04:06 - of asking an amplitude object to give me
04:08 - a level I'm going to call this variable
04:11 - spectrum and I'm going to say amplitude
04:13 - uh
04:14 - analyze and sorry fft
04:18 - analyze and now I'm just going to say
04:20 - console.log um Spectrum so let's take a
04:24 - look at what we're getting in the
04:27 - browser oh can not read property analyze
04:30 - of undefined so I've got an issue here
04:34 - uh VAR
04:35 - fft uh oops fftt equals new P5 fft and
04:39 - now analyze okay let's try that
04:42 - again so we can see here that what I'm
04:46 - getting is this array now how big is
04:48 - that
04:49 - array that array is Spectrum oops let's
04:53 - look at the length of that
04:57 - array it is 102 4 so by default I get
05:01 - 1024 frequency
05:04 - bands I believe if I give it an argument
05:07 - like
05:09 - 512
05:11 - no smoothing bins ah so a smoothing is
05:16 - so it takes two arguments the length
05:19 - this first argument these are optional
05:20 - is a smoothing amount so we'll play with
05:22 - that later um I guess let's try doing it
05:25 - oh and I could do set input analyze get
05:28 - energy let's see get centroids smooth
05:30 - smooth fft analysis by averaging with
05:33 - the last analysis frame wow that's so
05:35 - wonderful that it does that for you so
05:37 - let's try saying um zero smoothing and
05:41 - 512
05:43 - bands uh and let's go here great so now
05:46 - you can see I'm getting 512 the reason
05:48 - why I wanted to do that is because let's
05:51 - get
05:52 - 256 you know I just want to kind of I'm
05:55 - going to make my canvas 256 by 256 now
05:58 - so what I want want is to have uh one
06:01 - pixel per band which is going to be a
06:03 - quick way of kind of drawing the result
06:06 - here um so what I'm going to do
06:09 - now let me pause that music is I'm going
06:13 - to Loop through that array I goes from
06:15 - zero to the length of the
06:19 - array and a given amplitude at any given
06:23 - time is Spectrum uh index I and now uh
06:29 - uh the Y value I want to map that which
06:32 - goes between zero and one from uh height
06:35 - to zero so I can now say once again I
06:40 - can draw a line from the bottom of the
06:45 - window oh I comma
06:47 - height to I comma
06:52 - Y and now what we have here and if I say
06:55 - stroke 255 right I want to draw a line
06:58 - for each one of these bands and we
07:00 - should see
07:01 - now ooh so I didn't do something very
07:05 - well here so what are ah interesting
07:08 - let's look at what are the values what
07:09 - is the so I'm wrong about the range the
07:12 - range is not between zero and one
07:17 - clearly let's look at that Spectrum
07:19 - array
07:21 - again so it looks like the range that
07:24 - it's actually giving me back is maybe
07:26 - between 0 and 255 that's just kind of a
07:28 - guess it's probably in the documentation
07:31 - so let me fix that
07:33 - range and we can say 256 kind of as the
07:36 - top there we go so now what we're seeing
07:40 - here is this kind of frequency analysis
07:44 - and you can see the lower frequency
07:46 - sounds are much higher than the high
07:49 - frequency sounds let's change the
07:52 - song to
07:55 - uh this Dot and we can see if there's
07:59 - like a pretty different quality as
08:01 - always I always forget the this dot this
08:03 - dot this dot yeah you can see there's
08:04 - many more with the with the percussion
08:06 - in the background and you could start to
08:09 - see how you could do more sophisticated
08:11 - analysis because if you can measure the
08:14 - amplitude of say a certain high
08:16 - frequency sound you might be able to do
08:18 - some beat detection to kind of determine
08:20 - when are those kind of high frequency
08:22 - drum beats happening and in that sense
08:25 - the the noise from my voice or whatever
08:27 - is singing or something else affect
08:30 - that okay so this is the basics of
08:33 - graphing fft analysis let's just make it
08:36 - um let's reduce the number of let's make
08:38 - it look a little more like a graphic
08:39 - equalizer give it some rainbow colors
08:42 - and kind of reduce the number of bands
08:44 - okay so what I'm going to do here is I'm
08:46 - going to change it to um give it uh
08:50 - 64 and so I also want to have a variable
08:53 - now which I'm going to call a w which is
08:56 - what's the width of each band and that
08:58 - that W whoops that W would be equal to
09:01 - the width of the window divided by the
09:03 - total number of bands or 64 and I could
09:06 - probably make that in a variable so now
09:07 - what I want to do is have I in oh I want
09:12 - to draw the bands at so now if I do this
09:14 - right as always I always for there's
09:16 - only that many bands only 64 now so what
09:20 - I want to
09:22 - do is draw it at I *
09:27 - W and you can see now
09:30 - these lines areed
09:33 - out and I could also now uh make this a
09:38 - rectangle instead so the rectangle
09:40 - starts at uh I *
09:44 - Wy and I * W and it and its its height
09:49 - is whatever height minus y then I would
09:53 - think as always I always forget the this
09:55 - dot this dot oops it width is W sorry
09:59 - kind of an interesting effect so you can
10:01 - see I'm drawing them as rectangular
10:04 - bands and now certainly I could give
10:06 - them uh a Phil and I could say Phil you
10:10 - know I 255 255 and I could make uh the
10:15 - color mode uh HSB and now you can see as
10:19 - always I always you know and I could
10:20 - obviously expand and map the colors
10:22 - differently but you can see the idea
10:24 - here now I could I could make W uh you
10:28 - know minus two whoops I could have W
10:31 - equal that you know minus 2 or something
10:35 - so there's a little spacing in between
10:37 - them as always I always forget this do
10:41 - dot dot the W should remain the same but
10:44 - when I actually go to draw the rectangle
10:46 - it's width should be a little bit less
10:48 - and maybe what I want to say
10:51 - is no stroke but I should never get into
10:54 - like visually doing anything because I
10:56 - have no visual Talent whatsoever so you
10:57 - get the idea oh let's add smoothing so
11:00 - let's see what happens if we add the
11:02 - smoothing um so remember that you can do
11:05 - this thing you can give you can actually
11:07 - smooth these values let's give it 0.
11:08 - five see what that looks like as always
11:10 - I always forget this
11:12 - do I can't tell what's going on here
11:15 - let's make that
11:17 - one as always I always forget
11:20 - this
11:22 - 0.9 as always I always forget yeah okay
11:25 - so you can see this smoothing now what
11:27 - what it's doing is it's taking frequency
11:30 - and averaging it with the value before
11:33 - so you get this quality of um of sort of
11:38 - smoother values as a as an amplitude
11:40 - gets higher instead of jumping directly
11:42 - to that value it's kind of interpolating
11:43 - to that value and we could program this
11:45 - oursel using say the lurp function
11:47 - what's interesting about this is another
11:49 - idea I have going back and find I've got
11:50 - this like pearing noise terrain video
11:54 - What If you were to take fft values and
11:56 - map those to the sort of terrain and
11:58 - sort of threedimensional
11:59 - of some type of landscape that could be
12:01 - an interesting thing to try Okay um
12:04 - people in the chat are requesting the
12:06 - circle so why not right let's do the
12:08 - circle you can stop watching this video
12:10 - if you don't want to see it anymore so
12:11 - what I'm going to do is first of all
12:13 - will it let me just ask for 360
12:17 - bands uh let's make the canvas
12:22 - 360 as always I always yeah so one thing
12:24 - it will not the value provided is not a
12:26 - power of two so this is going to make
12:29 - doing the
12:33 - um this is going to make the circular
12:36 - thing a little bit trickier but not
12:38 - really that much not that tricky so
12:39 - let's let's make this
12:42 - happen uh let's um so let's uh
12:50 - first I always forget okay so the first
12:52 - thing I need to do here is uh translate
12:55 - to the center we saw this translate to
12:58 - the center
12:59 - Cent now I want to
13:03 - have a radius r equal to map that
13:09 - amplitude which goes from 0 to
13:12 - 256 to something like 0 to or let's
13:15 - let's give it a minute 40 to 200 okay so
13:19 - then I'm going to use a line here I'm
13:23 - going to say uh let's actually use begin
13:26 - shape and end shape the same way we did
13:27 - that before I could there's going to be
13:30 - there's some things I could do that'll
13:31 - be let's let's get it working the way I
13:33 - had before and I'll show you some other
13:34 - things you could do to do do in a
13:35 - slightly different way so what I'm going
13:37 - to do now is say varx = R * cosine of
13:42 - that angle VAR yal R * s of that angle
13:45 - being I at this point um let's oh angle
13:48 - mode is already set to degrees um and
13:50 - then I'm going to say uh
13:53 - vertex uh X comma y so let's see what we
13:57 - get uh now
14:00 - uh line 58 unexpected token so I think I
14:02 - have somehow I have an astray bracket
14:05 - there we can get rid of this stuff is
14:07 - unnecessary now and I'm going to run it
14:09 - again whoa I did something
14:12 - crazy well this is an interesting effect
14:14 - so let's go look what's wrong
14:16 - here oh let's I don't need this W thing
14:20 - anymore what am I missing here I don't
14:21 - need volume history so much extra
14:24 - stuff go okay I don't know what I had
14:27 - wrong so you can see ah so I just don't
14:30 - have the full 360° yet so how do I deal
14:34 - with that so if I'm getting say um 256
14:38 - bands but there's
14:40 - 360° what I actually want this angle to
14:44 - be angle equals map I which goes from 0o
14:49 - to spectrum. length from 0 to 360 pretty
14:53 - easy enough and then instead of I I can
14:55 - use angle
14:57 - here and uh now we can do this again as
15:01 - always I always forget dot
15:05 - angle as always
15:08 - forget oh yeah so there's just not a lot
15:10 - of high frequency sounds and the low
15:12 - frequency sound is really
15:14 - loud so my mapping is a little bit
15:19 - off there now you can sort of see what's
15:21 - going on here um and we can uh we can
15:25 - kind of mess with this a little bit
15:27 - remember I had that fill in there why
15:29 - not just add that here let's see if it
15:32 - if I fill per
15:37 - vertex uh I should be able to fill it
15:39 - per vertex I don't have a stroke um but
15:43 - anyway I'll let you guys kind of mess
15:45 - around with that you know I could rotate
15:47 - lines around it let's let me make it
15:48 - different colors
15:51 - um also say every height has a certain
15:54 - color and you can map the song two
15:56 - dimensionally so I I really should stop
15:57 - this but I can't help myself so one
16:00 - thing I want to do is actually what I
16:03 - want to do is draw a line I'm going to
16:06 - instead of saying begin shape end shape
16:09 - I could use rotate but since I've
16:11 - already done the calculation I'm going
16:13 - to draw a line from the center to that
16:17 - XY and uh uh what I'll do is I'll say uh
16:23 - stroke I 255 255 and now as always I
16:29 - it's really much slower so you can see
16:32 - um it's slow because that's a lot of
16:35 - lines to
16:37 - draw I am getting a nice um so I guess
16:42 - what I probably want to do is reduce the
16:45 - number of bands as you can see it's
16:49 - running more smoothly now anyway I could
16:51 - play with the color in a different way
16:53 - um I could use rotate and have these be
16:55 - rectangles um I could think about the
16:58 - mappings I have it spin I could connect
17:00 - it there's all sorts of possibilities
17:02 - here but I'm kind of showing you a range
17:04 - so hopefully you enjoyed this and got
17:05 - something out of it you know obviously I
17:07 - would hope that you watching this could
17:09 - come up with sort of more cre I want say
17:13 - more creative ideas or your own take on
17:15 - what it means to visualize the fft uh
17:18 - Spectrum array from uh sound file okay
17:21 - and I'll see you in a future video I'm
17:23 - going to do a few more videos that'll be
17:25 - next in this playlist and I don't know
17:27 - what it's going to be in them yet but
17:28 - yeah if you're watching this now and the
17:29 - video is already there then you know you
17:31 - know before I do although because you're
17:33 - in the future or I'm in the present past
17:35 - something like that
17:40 - [Music]
17:45 - goodbye

Cleaned transcript:

hello in this video I'm going to take what I did previously which is uh drawing a kind of graph of the volume of song um and instead of drawing the volume of the song the amplitude of the song across all frequencies I'm going to use an object in P5 called the fft object to analyze the sound in a way that I can get the amplitude for low frequency sounds for high frequency sounds and in that sense I might see a different graph based on a different graph if it were somebody whistling and there were high pitch sounds versus somebody speaking in a very deep voice or something like that so we'll see what happens once I start to use that let me pause the music for a second now so in P5 the object that I'm interested is this P5 fft object so we used P5 do amplitude to get the current volume of a sound P5 fft analyzes the sound Returns the results from the frequency spectrum or time domain he what are those things the frequency spectrum the time domain anyway so the the the the issue is here there's raw data coming in from an MP3 file a microphone whatever and that raw data has to be processed and analyzed through an algorithm to pull things that we care about out of it one methodology for doing this is called fft so if I go to the Wikipedia page you can read a lot more about it fast for your trans transform I'm not going to write this algorithm from scratch or create the engine that does the fft analysis luckily for us P5 sound made by Jason seagull which is built on top of the web audio API has this built into it and so the idea is that what it does is it takes the sound and chops it up um well that's not really right but let me let me come over here for a second to see if we can think about this so if this is me analyzing the sound the amplitude amplitude object gives me a single value volume and I might be able to get I probably with the amplitude object I could get sort of like left and right channel like if it was stereo sound what's the amplitude of the left uh versus the right channel so maybe I could get two but with fft what I can actually get is something that looks we can and we'll make this like a graphic equalizer in other words what is the amplitude at different frequency levels and I can request the fft algorithm to give me the amount frequencies at various resolutions so to speak so I can ask for 256 bands so frequencies with a with a a level of detail of 256 or 512 or whatever generally the sort of standard here are these um um powers of two so to speak but um uh I encourage you to I'll try to put some resources in the in this video's description with more about fft stuff and how it works but for right now let's actually just try to make it work so what one thing I want to do is I want to change this amplitude object to be an fft object and then I want to say instead of making a new P5 amplitude object I want to make a new P P5 fft object let's go to the reference and click on fft and let's look at what's what the functions are so I can waveform we'll look at waveform later but analyze computes the amplitude values along the frequency domain the array indic it gives me an array and those indices correspond to specific frequencies lowest to highest okay so let's just say we can look here actually one of the things that I think I need to do or maybe it does it by default let's just see okay so I'm going to say uh analyze so what I'm going to do here in draw now let's let's uh let's get rid of the circular stuff maybe we can come back to that in a second going to simplify a lot here I I want to instead of asking an amplitude object to give me a level I'm going to call this variable spectrum and I'm going to say amplitude uh analyze and sorry fft analyze and now I'm just going to say console.log um Spectrum so let's take a look at what we're getting in the browser oh can not read property analyze of undefined so I've got an issue here uh VAR fft uh oops fftt equals new P5 fft and now analyze okay let's try that again so we can see here that what I'm getting is this array now how big is that array that array is Spectrum oops let's look at the length of that array it is 102 4 so by default I get 1024 frequency bands I believe if I give it an argument like 512 no smoothing bins ah so a smoothing is so it takes two arguments the length this first argument these are optional is a smoothing amount so we'll play with that later um I guess let's try doing it oh and I could do set input analyze get energy let's see get centroids smooth smooth fft analysis by averaging with the last analysis frame wow that's so wonderful that it does that for you so let's try saying um zero smoothing and 512 bands uh and let's go here great so now you can see I'm getting 512 the reason why I wanted to do that is because let's get 256 you know I just want to kind of I'm going to make my canvas 256 by 256 now so what I want want is to have uh one pixel per band which is going to be a quick way of kind of drawing the result here um so what I'm going to do now let me pause that music is I'm going to Loop through that array I goes from zero to the length of the array and a given amplitude at any given time is Spectrum uh index I and now uh uh the Y value I want to map that which goes between zero and one from uh height to zero so I can now say once again I can draw a line from the bottom of the window oh I comma height to I comma Y and now what we have here and if I say stroke 255 right I want to draw a line for each one of these bands and we should see now ooh so I didn't do something very well here so what are ah interesting let's look at what are the values what is the so I'm wrong about the range the range is not between zero and one clearly let's look at that Spectrum array again so it looks like the range that it's actually giving me back is maybe between 0 and 255 that's just kind of a guess it's probably in the documentation so let me fix that range and we can say 256 kind of as the top there we go so now what we're seeing here is this kind of frequency analysis and you can see the lower frequency sounds are much higher than the high frequency sounds let's change the song to uh this Dot and we can see if there's like a pretty different quality as always I always forget the this dot this dot this dot yeah you can see there's many more with the with the percussion in the background and you could start to see how you could do more sophisticated analysis because if you can measure the amplitude of say a certain high frequency sound you might be able to do some beat detection to kind of determine when are those kind of high frequency drum beats happening and in that sense the the noise from my voice or whatever is singing or something else affect that okay so this is the basics of graphing fft analysis let's just make it um let's reduce the number of let's make it look a little more like a graphic equalizer give it some rainbow colors and kind of reduce the number of bands okay so what I'm going to do here is I'm going to change it to um give it uh 64 and so I also want to have a variable now which I'm going to call a w which is what's the width of each band and that that W whoops that W would be equal to the width of the window divided by the total number of bands or 64 and I could probably make that in a variable so now what I want to do is have I in oh I want to draw the bands at so now if I do this right as always I always for there's only that many bands only 64 now so what I want to do is draw it at I * W and you can see now these lines areed out and I could also now uh make this a rectangle instead so the rectangle starts at uh I * Wy and I * W and it and its its height is whatever height minus y then I would think as always I always forget the this dot this dot oops it width is W sorry kind of an interesting effect so you can see I'm drawing them as rectangular bands and now certainly I could give them uh a Phil and I could say Phil you know I 255 255 and I could make uh the color mode uh HSB and now you can see as always I always you know and I could obviously expand and map the colors differently but you can see the idea here now I could I could make W uh you know minus two whoops I could have W equal that you know minus 2 or something so there's a little spacing in between them as always I always forget this do dot dot the W should remain the same but when I actually go to draw the rectangle it's width should be a little bit less and maybe what I want to say is no stroke but I should never get into like visually doing anything because I have no visual Talent whatsoever so you get the idea oh let's add smoothing so let's see what happens if we add the smoothing um so remember that you can do this thing you can give you can actually smooth these values let's give it 0. five see what that looks like as always I always forget this do I can't tell what's going on here let's make that one as always I always forget this 0.9 as always I always forget yeah okay so you can see this smoothing now what what it's doing is it's taking frequency and averaging it with the value before so you get this quality of um of sort of smoother values as a as an amplitude gets higher instead of jumping directly to that value it's kind of interpolating to that value and we could program this oursel using say the lurp function what's interesting about this is another idea I have going back and find I've got this like pearing noise terrain video What If you were to take fft values and map those to the sort of terrain and sort of threedimensional of some type of landscape that could be an interesting thing to try Okay um people in the chat are requesting the circle so why not right let's do the circle you can stop watching this video if you don't want to see it anymore so what I'm going to do is first of all will it let me just ask for 360 bands uh let's make the canvas 360 as always I always yeah so one thing it will not the value provided is not a power of two so this is going to make doing the um this is going to make the circular thing a little bit trickier but not really that much not that tricky so let's let's make this happen uh let's um so let's uh first I always forget okay so the first thing I need to do here is uh translate to the center we saw this translate to the center Cent now I want to have a radius r equal to map that amplitude which goes from 0 to 256 to something like 0 to or let's let's give it a minute 40 to 200 okay so then I'm going to use a line here I'm going to say uh let's actually use begin shape and end shape the same way we did that before I could there's going to be there's some things I could do that'll be let's let's get it working the way I had before and I'll show you some other things you could do to do do in a slightly different way so what I'm going to do now is say varx = R * cosine of that angle VAR yal R * s of that angle being I at this point um let's oh angle mode is already set to degrees um and then I'm going to say uh vertex uh X comma y so let's see what we get uh now uh line 58 unexpected token so I think I have somehow I have an astray bracket there we can get rid of this stuff is unnecessary now and I'm going to run it again whoa I did something crazy well this is an interesting effect so let's go look what's wrong here oh let's I don't need this W thing anymore what am I missing here I don't need volume history so much extra stuff go okay I don't know what I had wrong so you can see ah so I just don't have the full 360° yet so how do I deal with that so if I'm getting say um 256 bands but there's 360° what I actually want this angle to be angle equals map I which goes from 0o to spectrum. length from 0 to 360 pretty easy enough and then instead of I I can use angle here and uh now we can do this again as always I always forget dot angle as always forget oh yeah so there's just not a lot of high frequency sounds and the low frequency sound is really loud so my mapping is a little bit off there now you can sort of see what's going on here um and we can uh we can kind of mess with this a little bit remember I had that fill in there why not just add that here let's see if it if I fill per vertex uh I should be able to fill it per vertex I don't have a stroke um but anyway I'll let you guys kind of mess around with that you know I could rotate lines around it let's let me make it different colors um also say every height has a certain color and you can map the song two dimensionally so I I really should stop this but I can't help myself so one thing I want to do is actually what I want to do is draw a line I'm going to instead of saying begin shape end shape I could use rotate but since I've already done the calculation I'm going to draw a line from the center to that XY and uh uh what I'll do is I'll say uh stroke I 255 255 and now as always I it's really much slower so you can see um it's slow because that's a lot of lines to draw I am getting a nice um so I guess what I probably want to do is reduce the number of bands as you can see it's running more smoothly now anyway I could play with the color in a different way um I could use rotate and have these be rectangles um I could think about the mappings I have it spin I could connect it there's all sorts of possibilities here but I'm kind of showing you a range so hopefully you enjoyed this and got something out of it you know obviously I would hope that you watching this could come up with sort of more cre I want say more creative ideas or your own take on what it means to visualize the fft uh Spectrum array from uh sound file okay and I'll see you in a future video I'm going to do a few more videos that'll be next in this playlist and I don't know what it's going to be in them yet but yeah if you're watching this now and the video is already there then you know you know before I do although because you're in the future or I'm in the present past something like that goodbye
