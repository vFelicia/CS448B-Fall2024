00:00 - hello welcome to a video tutorial about
00:02 - something related to p5 called p5
00:06 - manager now p5 manager is by chin how
00:10 - you thank you for making this wonderful
00:12 - tool I hope that it's okay that I'm
00:13 - making a video about it I am NOT an
00:15 - expert I did not I can take no credit
00:17 - whatsoever for this wonderful thing
00:18 - called p5 manager but I knew about it
00:20 - and I can use it in class the other day
00:22 - and it really helped me out so I wanted
00:23 - to make a video so other people would
00:25 - learn about it so ok so what is p5
00:29 - minute or you guys might be aware that
00:31 - one of the things that I do it's a
00:32 - really bad habit sometimes when I want
00:35 - to make a new sketch I go to p5.js org
00:37 - it's a great technique here then I go to
00:39 - download then I'm like oh which leg
00:42 - download oh ok I'm gonna download p5 GS
00:44 - complete and I click on that and it
00:46 - download something and then I find it
00:48 - you can see look at me this is how
00:50 - ridiculously horrible I am you could see
00:52 - that I have done this is like big 95 the
00:55 - same thing I just download it and then I
00:57 - like opened it up and when I find
01:00 - somewhere in here like oh there's like
01:01 - empty example and I rename it or I copy
01:03 - it somewhere and that's like my new
01:05 - sketches i'ma do this is not a great
01:07 - workflow p5 manager is a command-line
01:10 - tool that you can execute from the
01:12 - command line what's the command line you
01:14 - know have you since some videos you
01:15 - might it uses it's built on top of
01:17 - something called node and I have another
01:19 - video that I'll link to about what is
01:20 - know but you don't really need to know
01:21 - what note it is you do need to install
01:24 - node to use this so you can go to
01:26 - node.js org install node and then you
01:30 - can use this node comes with something
01:32 - called NPM which is stands for node
01:35 - package manager which is a way to manage
01:37 - the packages you want to use with node
01:38 - and but why is this relevant because p5
01:42 - manager is a node package a node is a
01:47 - server-side programming framework in
01:49 - JavaScript and there's a lot that we
01:50 - could say about things that you could do
01:51 - with it but we're not really doing
01:52 - anything with node whatsoever we're just
01:54 - lucky to bask in the glory and somebody
01:57 - else bothered to make something with
01:58 - node called p5 manager so if I've
02:00 - installed dode the next thing I can do
02:02 - is go here and I can run this command so
02:05 - what I want to say is NPM node package
02:08 - manager install I won't install
02:10 - something - G - G is an
02:13 - kind of an important detail but not so
02:14 - important for us right now it means I
02:16 - want to install this globally meaning
02:18 - it's not part of an individual project
02:20 - it's this thing that I just want to use
02:21 - always on my computer from now on p5
02:23 - manager is my thing now so I can take
02:27 - this and I can say copy it and I can
02:33 - then go to here and I'm gonna just paste
02:35 - it in I could have just typed it might
02:37 - give me an error it might give me an
02:39 - error this might happen to you
02:40 - we're in a hope this error doesn't
02:42 - happen but it might happen in fact I
02:43 - mean good if it happens because if it
02:44 - happens then you'll see it happen and
02:45 - you'll know how to fix it
02:52 - oh yeah they got the error alright so
03:02 - what is the error now the air is
03:04 - permission denied and this is actually
03:06 - has to do with the fact that we we want
03:09 - to install it globally the if we'd salty
03:12 - means it has to go in the like depths of
03:14 - your computer where only the
03:16 - administrator whoever that is maybe you
03:19 - can like you've got to like get into the
03:22 - guts of the system files in all sorts of
03:24 - fancy places that you have to have
03:25 - permission for so there's a way to get
03:29 - permission to do that and the way to do
03:32 - that with terminal is by saying a sudo
03:35 - which stands for Super User do Super
03:38 - User do NPM - G no no I don't know I
03:42 - don't know what the order this really
03:43 - matters install - G was in back out p5 -
03:48 - manager and now oh it asked for my
03:50 - password and good thing I think I know
03:53 - think I know the password
03:57 - sorry about that hopefully you're
03:59 - watching this and I'm now just
04:00 - reappeared and I figured out the
04:01 - password and entered it so I'm gonna run
04:03 - the sudo command for Hewitt can with the
04:05 - correct password so you can watch
04:17 - okay hey that seemed to have worked so
04:21 - now I have installed forevermore the p5
04:26 - manager with note so there are a bunch
04:29 - of things you can do with the p5 manager
04:31 - and I encourage you maybe I'll come back
04:34 - to these if it's interesting or but I
04:36 - want to show you like these kind of like
04:38 - the simplest way ever to use it so the
04:39 - p5 manager will actually allow you to
04:41 - create a collection of sketches and you
04:44 - can you can serve them up and run us and
04:46 - like makes it like a little like web
04:48 - page with a like a table of contents of
04:51 - all the things you've made but and you
04:53 - should you could follow these
04:54 - instructions for that but I'm actually
04:55 - going to scroll down and what I want to
04:58 - do is just generate a standalone project
05:01 - so I for me in making examples and I put
05:05 - them in all different places it's less
05:06 - about a collection right now and then
05:07 - individual like standalone projects so I
05:10 - want to do this anytime I write now that
05:13 - I've installed that package I can just
05:15 - write p5 anytime in my terminal window
05:17 - now and it's gonna say look hey you've
05:20 - installed p5 manager zero point three
05:22 - point two so but whenever I want to run
05:25 - a specific p5 command like p5 generate
05:29 - that's going to generate a project and
05:31 - then I have to give it some specific
05:34 - parameters arguments of what kind of
05:35 - project I want to generate so what I
05:37 - want to do is I want to generate a
05:38 - bundle with a particular name and for
05:41 - short you can also just type p5 G - B
05:44 - but I'm gonna be long-winded about it
05:45 - for the purpose of this video tutorial -
05:48 - - bundle and coding train will be the
05:53 - name of my project and I'm going to hit
05:56 - enter so now that this worked I realized
06:00 - I kind of did something pretty terrible
06:02 - which is when you first open at least on
06:03 - the Mac your terminal window it just
06:06 - plops you right into the root directory
06:08 - of your computer and that's probably not
06:10 - where I want to put my coding train
06:12 - project so you know this is a bit of an
06:15 - aside but I can you can change
06:17 - directories I could say like CD
06:19 - documents because really what I want to
06:20 - do is be in the documents and I can make
06:22 - a folder called something like p5
06:24 - project which already exists
06:26 - there and I could say CVP five projects
06:28 - and then now what I want to do is go
06:30 - back and run this one more time to get
06:34 - it right I'm gonna run that one more
06:36 - time you can see it created those
06:37 - projects I can go back to the finder I
06:39 - can go into p5 projects and I can see
06:41 - look at what I've got I have now have a
06:43 - folder called coding train which really
06:46 - is just one project it's got the HTML
06:48 - file it's got the sketch J's file it's
06:50 - got that whoops which I just opened up
06:51 - by accident and it's got the the
06:54 - libraries folder with the p5 libraries
06:56 - so this is the way to create an
06:58 - individual single p5 project I can do
07:01 - this all the time now I'm gonna do it in
07:03 - one of my future videos I can edit and
07:05 - work on it that way and we'll always get
07:08 - the most current version to the p5
07:10 - library and I encourage you to explore
07:12 - also the collection the collection
07:19 - functionality of this as well which you
07:21 - can make a nice little like what page it
07:23 - doesn't automatically with all your
07:24 - projects ok so thank you for watching
07:26 - about the p5 manager hopefully it's
07:29 - useful to you I will see you in a future
07:30 - video or you might see me using the p5
07:33 - manager thank you very much
07:38 - [Music]
07:45 - you
