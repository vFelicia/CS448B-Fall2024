00:00 - hello happy May 4th I'm gonna do Cody
00:04 - challenge for May 4th on the coding
00:08 - spaceship this Cody challenge I'm going
00:11 - to make some scrolling text that looks
00:13 - as if it is scrolling off into the
00:15 - distance and it is the return of the
00:18 - 15-minute timer which when has that ever
00:22 - gone wrong I mean it's always been so
00:24 - great to have the time for nothing if it
00:26 - goes wrong with the timer
00:27 - so um why am I doing this challenge
00:29 - today it's I don't know it's the 4th of
00:31 - May and I thought it might be
00:32 - appropriate and maybe someday I'll get a
00:34 - sponsorship and then I'll be able to you
00:36 - know have all these logos and music
00:38 - happening at the same time ok here we go
00:43 - let's start the timer and let's begin
00:46 - all right so I'm gonna do this in
00:48 - processing processing is a Java based
00:50 - programming environment if you were
00:52 - anybody else or if you were born after
00:53 - 1990 you would probably do some kind of
00:55 - like CSS transforms and have some crazy
00:58 - cool 3d text scrolling thing in the
01:00 - browser I'm old and I'd like to draw my
01:03 - pixels one at a time so here we go let's
01:07 - make a window that is let's just start
01:11 - with like 800 by 600 and let's let's
01:14 - just admit the fact that we're going to
01:15 - be doing this in 3d and I'm going to add
01:17 - the p 3d renderer then in draw I'm gonna
01:21 - say background 0 oh and I need some text
01:23 - hmm
01:24 - so let's make a text file but first let
01:26 - me save this and I'm gonna call this I'm
01:29 - gonna just say this is the desktop under
01:31 - May 4th challenge and I'm just checking
01:40 - the chat because I'm gonna need help
01:41 - definitely gonna need help I'm at 14
01:43 - minutes ok and don't get distracted
01:46 - don't get distracted ok text edit on the
01:49 - e key still doesn't work on this
01:51 - computer so many things going wrong
01:52 - format plain text so let's get some text
01:54 - I am using in this coding challenge
01:57 - processing org and so I don't know this
02:01 - looks like some good text oh yeah this
02:04 - is great let's look at this let's use
02:05 - this okay so I'm going to save this as
02:12 - I'm gonna go to the desktop and I'm
02:14 - gonna go to May 4th challenge and I'm
02:16 - going to go to space dot txt no e on
02:22 - fingers ok there we go
02:25 - so now in back in my sketch here I want
02:28 - you access that text so I'm going to
02:31 - create actually I'm gonna create a
02:35 - variable I'm gonna call it a txt I don't
02:38 - want to call it text because there's a
02:39 - function called texted processing and
02:41 - just so I don't confuse myself and once
02:44 - I'm gonna use the load strings function
02:46 - and I'm gonna load look at I call that
02:51 - file space space dot txt but the thing
02:56 - is you might be wondering here I really
02:58 - don't have time to explain I'm going to
03:00 - anyway why do I have this array of
03:02 - strings called lines well it so happens
03:03 - that the load strings function loads a
03:06 - text file and takes every line from that
03:08 - text file it makes it a separate element
03:10 - in an array and this is actually very
03:12 - convenient in most cases but not so much
03:14 - right now
03:14 - so I am then going to instead say
03:18 - actually this might actually be really
03:20 - useful because I might I might want to
03:22 - make use of that array but right now I'm
03:23 - just gonna say T XT equals joint lines
03:27 - lines dot join and then I will join them
03:32 - with the line break character and join
03:36 - I'm going to join them with the line
03:38 - breaker lines that join hmm maybe I need
03:40 - to give it double quotes because it's
03:41 - not a character it's a string no oh
03:45 - let's check our errors cannot invoke
03:49 - join string on the type of string array
03:51 - oh oh right let's do this this is a
03:56 - processing function that exists lines
03:59 - that's called join that's written into
04:02 - processing there's no join function for
04:04 - an array in Java I guess and the join
04:09 - function is part of the processing API
04:11 - where I can take an array and join them
04:13 - with a line break ok now we are going to
04:16 - say a fill 255 because I want my text to
04:20 - be white on a black background then I'm
04:22 - going to say text
04:25 - txt and I'm gonna say I'm gonna give it
04:27 - a bounding box of the full window and
04:30 - let's just run this and see what we got
04:33 - okay there we go there's our text it is
04:36 - in this window there it is alright let's
04:38 - do some stuff I really should think
04:40 - about the font oh I didn't even think
04:42 - about this do I have time to go look for
04:44 - the appropriate font for this particular
04:47 - simulation that I then I'm attempting to
04:49 - code without buzz marketing for free a
04:52 - particular commercial process is really
04:55 - pointless what I'm attempting to do here
04:56 - oh it's a single anyway text font Oh
05:02 - text size let's just try text size
05:04 - sixty-four okay I also want to use it
05:09 - that's pretty good I also want to use
05:11 - text align and I want to full justify
05:15 - that's not gonna work let's try Center
05:17 - just out of curiosity what does that do
05:19 - uh it centers it okay centers it within
05:24 - that box well let's we use that for
05:25 - right now okay we're doing well what is
05:27 - I got 10 minutes I have time to eat some
05:29 - melon there's gonna be really weird I
05:31 - I'm so confident about this code
05:33 - challenge this piece of melon which
05:36 - you're wondering what is the deal with
05:38 - this piece of melon it's purple it's
05:40 - blue this is the magical space melon
05:44 - that they eat on the planet ma Phooey
05:49 - that's the only planet I know
06:03 - delicious very good very low pH soothing
06:07 - of the throat okay sponsored by alien
06:15 - melon okay now what I want to do is I
06:19 - need a variable I'm gonna say I was
06:22 - about to say let but I'm in processing I
06:24 - need to specify the type float y equals
06:26 - zero lets you let's set the text at zero
06:29 - comma Y and let's say Y minus - so Y is
06:34 - just going to change by one every frame
06:38 - and now we have scrolling text where'd
06:44 - it go oh look at this
06:45 - I gave it a bounding box which was the
06:47 - high OH
06:49 - this was gonna be a no edit this is
06:52 - gonna be a no edit coding challenge
06:54 - can't edit that out the camera went off
06:56 - it's fine it fixed it so I need to can I
06:59 - possibly make this bounding box without
07:02 - I mean I could just do this and here's
07:09 - the thing I want it to start right I
07:12 - want it to Y to start at height okay I'm
07:19 - getting some so now here we go
07:25 - processing is a flexible software
07:27 - sketchbook and a language for learning
07:30 - how to code okay this is great
07:33 - I'm we're wasting time here alright I'm
07:37 - told there is a specific color that I'm
07:41 - supposed to use so let's change that r75
07:45 - 2 1 3 2 3 8 all right cross the finger
07:55 - is a flexible software sketchbook I
07:57 - there must be a specific font it also
07:59 - needs to be full justified I'm gonna see
08:02 - if I can manage that but here's the
08:04 - thing it's so this is just scrolling up
08:05 - but I I have made this do not forget AP
08:11 - 3d sketch
08:12 - which means what I can do right now is I
08:15 - want to rotate the scene this way now if
08:18 - this is if this train whistle is
08:20 - representing my axis of rotation this is
08:23 - the z-axis that would be something
08:25 - spinning around if I were to just say
08:27 - for example whoops move them back out
08:30 - here and say something like oh let me
08:32 - rotate by you know 45 degrees which is
08:36 - radians of 45 or I'm gonna say PI pi
08:39 - divided by 8
08:41 - no pi divided by 2 is 90 so pi divided
08:44 - by 4 is 45 degrees we should see the
08:48 - text is completely gone why I need to
08:53 - blick I need to rotate around the center
08:55 - I need to rotate around the center of
08:58 - this look at that there it goes here it
09:00 - comes it's kind of like this
09:09 - that should be the sound effect that
09:11 - goes along with this all right so I what
09:13 - I want to do is rotate by X but let's I
09:15 - think actually what's going to make more
09:16 - sense is for the world of this universe
09:19 - that I'm building to be have its origin
09:22 - point in the center so really what I
09:24 - want is for I'm going to take out the
09:27 - rotate really what I want is to
09:28 - translate that the top left is the
09:31 - default origin point zero zero so now I
09:33 - want that origin point to be in the
09:35 - middle and you're going to see it now
09:37 - why am I not seeing anything I will
09:39 - eventually it's very slow the scrolling
09:42 - text way too overconfident about this
09:46 - but so now what I want is for the text
09:49 - actually to not be at zero comma Y but
09:53 - to be at negative width divided by two
09:55 - so offset it and then Y can start at
09:59 - height divided by two and now we should
10:02 - see back to what I had before and now
10:09 - hopefully I can now rotate right this
10:13 - was this will now rotate my text along
10:17 - the z axis so it's doing that but what I
10:20 - really want to do is I want to rotate it
10:22 - along the x axis I wanted to like sort
10:25 - of fold down so I don't say rotate X and
10:34 - processing is a flexible software is it
10:39 - too slow or it's not actually the
10:40 - appropriate speed I also can't see it at
10:43 - all so let's make it much wider Oh wrong
10:48 - color I'm told 238 to 1375 I did it
10:55 - backwards ok processing is a flexible
11:02 - software sketchbook and a language for
11:07 - learning how to code within the context
11:13 - of the visual arts I don't know it's
11:16 - going kind of slow let's uh let's have
11:17 - this go a little bit faster what else
11:20 - does this need this is done
11:22 - done four minutes ago yeah there we go
11:32 - what else should I do that is
11:36 - approximately the right speed yeah so
11:37 - the one thing is I pretty sure that if I
11:39 - were being true to this particular
11:41 - design it really should be full
11:44 - justified I'm trying to think of how to
11:46 - do that
11:47 - make it like 80% of the width yeah so I
11:51 - guess what I should do also the bounding
11:53 - box I guess I can adjust the bounding
12:00 - box ya know but that's not doing me any
12:05 - good because why doesn't that Oh No okay
12:14 - so negative width so hold on so I need
12:18 - to let me just make this so this should
12:22 - be negative W device so I want the
12:25 - bounding box and the text to be centered
12:27 - based on the bounding box so I've got a
12:29 - and I want that bounding box not have to
12:31 - be the full width so I'm shrinking it by
12:33 - like eighty percent and I probably
12:35 - should have the font the text size be
12:37 - related to the width as well so what it
12:39 - was like twelve hundred divided by 64
12:41 - mph it was sixty point that would be a
12:44 - hundred two hundred so I could say width
12:47 - divided by two hundred right oh no I
12:52 - meant to say not 220 so let's do this
12:57 - and so that's right
13:03 - I guess the size is too big actually so
13:05 - let's make the text size width divided
13:07 - with times 0.15 and now whoa
13:17 - I meant oh one five I don't know what
13:23 - I'm doing anymore
13:23 - just just make up numbers so no point
13:31 - force can be really thick
13:35 - Oh 5% oh yeah 5% 5% is good let's make a
13:40 - little smaller let's make it like 3%
13:43 - this is really the way this is the way
13:45 - to program just try different numbers
13:47 - oh the width is still too wide ah this
13:52 - is the problem I liked my size I wanted
13:58 - to enter there we go thank you
14:02 - that only took me a minute 42 seconds
14:05 - left processing is a flexible software
14:07 - sketchbook and a language for learning
14:09 - how to code within the context of the
14:11 - visual arts okay what else do I need to
14:13 - do in my minute and a half that I have
14:14 - left text mode is model or shape yeah
14:17 - yeah so there is a text mode thing oh
14:19 - the full justify no I have a challenge -
14:22 - you try - oh and the reason why I was
14:26 - doing this is because I wanted to
14:27 - demonstrate Processing's wonderful
14:29 - fullscreen function and whoa that's
14:43 - weird why did that happen when I went
14:46 - full screen huh do I just need to rotate
14:54 - much more what did I what did I do to
14:58 - deserve this
15:01 - that's so weird what if I do this how am
15:07 - i doing on time
15:19 - yeah that's so weird why would I went
15:22 - full scope from p.3d thank you I wonder
15:25 - I'm so of course size is where you
15:31 - specify the width and height manually
15:33 - and a particular renderer if I say full
15:36 - screen I still need to specify the
15:38 - renderer so it was working but it just
15:40 - defaulted to a 2d renderer and rotate X
15:42 - didn't work oh the timer went off
15:47 - I finished here we go we're done I can't
16:00 - do the gibreel sleng I can't talk while
16:02 - I'm eating how does he do it somebody's
16:05 - gotta have told me we don't know who I'm
16:08 - talking about
16:09 - check out de brillz YouTube channel I
16:10 - have now made a sideways scrolling
16:13 - yellow text thing with no theme music or
16:16 - branding whatsoever with some processing
16:20 - text in the amount of time that I was
16:23 - given it really should have it really
16:27 - should be full justified I will leave
16:29 - that to you I hope you make a version of
16:30 - this please make some but that timer do
16:33 - you hear the timer or you just hear it
16:37 - because I really want to hit okay okay
16:40 - make your own version of this add stuff
16:44 - to it to make it more fun or different
16:46 - or with your own style I'll try to make
16:49 - a JavaScript version of this with p5 and
16:50 - the WebGL renderer of p5 we could make a
16:52 - 3 J s1 and then of course all of you who
16:57 - know more than I do
16:58 - prop many of you could probably make a
17:00 - CSS one with transforms and all that
17:03 - fancy new stuff I know Sarah Dresner who
17:07 - is like my CSS probably knows a way to
17:11 - do this ok put a star field behind it
17:14 - yes you can do that good bye I'm gonna
17:15 - finish this I'm just like I'm just gonna
17:17 - be done with this Kody's down goodbye
17:22 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hello happy May 4th I'm gonna do Cody challenge for May 4th on the coding spaceship this Cody challenge I'm going to make some scrolling text that looks as if it is scrolling off into the distance and it is the return of the 15minute timer which when has that ever gone wrong I mean it's always been so great to have the time for nothing if it goes wrong with the timer so um why am I doing this challenge today it's I don't know it's the 4th of May and I thought it might be appropriate and maybe someday I'll get a sponsorship and then I'll be able to you know have all these logos and music happening at the same time ok here we go let's start the timer and let's begin all right so I'm gonna do this in processing processing is a Java based programming environment if you were anybody else or if you were born after 1990 you would probably do some kind of like CSS transforms and have some crazy cool 3d text scrolling thing in the browser I'm old and I'd like to draw my pixels one at a time so here we go let's make a window that is let's just start with like 800 by 600 and let's let's just admit the fact that we're going to be doing this in 3d and I'm going to add the p 3d renderer then in draw I'm gonna say background 0 oh and I need some text hmm so let's make a text file but first let me save this and I'm gonna call this I'm gonna just say this is the desktop under May 4th challenge and I'm just checking the chat because I'm gonna need help definitely gonna need help I'm at 14 minutes ok and don't get distracted don't get distracted ok text edit on the e key still doesn't work on this computer so many things going wrong format plain text so let's get some text I am using in this coding challenge processing org and so I don't know this looks like some good text oh yeah this is great let's look at this let's use this okay so I'm going to save this as I'm gonna go to the desktop and I'm gonna go to May 4th challenge and I'm going to go to space dot txt no e on fingers ok there we go so now in back in my sketch here I want you access that text so I'm going to create actually I'm gonna create a variable I'm gonna call it a txt I don't want to call it text because there's a function called texted processing and just so I don't confuse myself and once I'm gonna use the load strings function and I'm gonna load look at I call that file space space dot txt but the thing is you might be wondering here I really don't have time to explain I'm going to anyway why do I have this array of strings called lines well it so happens that the load strings function loads a text file and takes every line from that text file it makes it a separate element in an array and this is actually very convenient in most cases but not so much right now so I am then going to instead say actually this might actually be really useful because I might I might want to make use of that array but right now I'm just gonna say T XT equals joint lines lines dot join and then I will join them with the line break character and join I'm going to join them with the line breaker lines that join hmm maybe I need to give it double quotes because it's not a character it's a string no oh let's check our errors cannot invoke join string on the type of string array oh oh right let's do this this is a processing function that exists lines that's called join that's written into processing there's no join function for an array in Java I guess and the join function is part of the processing API where I can take an array and join them with a line break ok now we are going to say a fill 255 because I want my text to be white on a black background then I'm going to say text txt and I'm gonna say I'm gonna give it a bounding box of the full window and let's just run this and see what we got okay there we go there's our text it is in this window there it is alright let's do some stuff I really should think about the font oh I didn't even think about this do I have time to go look for the appropriate font for this particular simulation that I then I'm attempting to code without buzz marketing for free a particular commercial process is really pointless what I'm attempting to do here oh it's a single anyway text font Oh text size let's just try text size sixtyfour okay I also want to use it that's pretty good I also want to use text align and I want to full justify that's not gonna work let's try Center just out of curiosity what does that do uh it centers it okay centers it within that box well let's we use that for right now okay we're doing well what is I got 10 minutes I have time to eat some melon there's gonna be really weird I I'm so confident about this code challenge this piece of melon which you're wondering what is the deal with this piece of melon it's purple it's blue this is the magical space melon that they eat on the planet ma Phooey that's the only planet I know delicious very good very low pH soothing of the throat okay sponsored by alien melon okay now what I want to do is I need a variable I'm gonna say I was about to say let but I'm in processing I need to specify the type float y equals zero lets you let's set the text at zero comma Y and let's say Y minus so Y is just going to change by one every frame and now we have scrolling text where'd it go oh look at this I gave it a bounding box which was the high OH this was gonna be a no edit this is gonna be a no edit coding challenge can't edit that out the camera went off it's fine it fixed it so I need to can I possibly make this bounding box without I mean I could just do this and here's the thing I want it to start right I want it to Y to start at height okay I'm getting some so now here we go processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code okay this is great I'm we're wasting time here alright I'm told there is a specific color that I'm supposed to use so let's change that r75 2 1 3 2 3 8 all right cross the finger is a flexible software sketchbook I there must be a specific font it also needs to be full justified I'm gonna see if I can manage that but here's the thing it's so this is just scrolling up but I I have made this do not forget AP 3d sketch which means what I can do right now is I want to rotate the scene this way now if this is if this train whistle is representing my axis of rotation this is the zaxis that would be something spinning around if I were to just say for example whoops move them back out here and say something like oh let me rotate by you know 45 degrees which is radians of 45 or I'm gonna say PI pi divided by 8 no pi divided by 2 is 90 so pi divided by 4 is 45 degrees we should see the text is completely gone why I need to blick I need to rotate around the center I need to

flexible software is it too slow or it's not actually the appropriate speed I also can't see it at all so let's make it much wider Oh wrong color I'm told 238 to 1375 I did it backwards ok processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts I don't know it's going kind of slow let's uh let's have this go a little bit faster what else does this need this is done done four minutes ago yeah there we go what else should I do that is approximately the right speed yeah so the one thing is I pretty sure that if I were being

I could say width divided by two hundred right oh no I meant to say not 220 so let's do this and so that's right I guess the size is too big actually so let's make the text size width divided with times 0.15 and now whoa I meant oh one five I don't know what I'm doing anymore just just make up numbers so no point force can be really thick Oh 5% oh yeah 5% 5% is good let's make a little smaller let's make it like 3% this is really the way this is the way to program just try different numbers oh the width is still too wide ah this is the problem I liked my size I wanted to enter there we go thank you that only took me a minute 42 seconds left processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts okay what else do I need to do in my minute and a half that I have left text mode is model or shape yeah yeah so there is a text mode thing oh the full justify no I have a challenge you try oh and the reason why I was doing this is because I wanted to demonstrate Processing's wonderful fullscreen function and whoa that's weird why did that happen when I went full screen huh do I just need to rotate much more what did I what did I do to deserve this that's so weird what if I do this how am i doing on time yeah that's so weird why would I went full scope from p.3d thank you I wonder I'm so of course size is where you specify the width and height manually and a particular renderer if I say full screen I still need to specify the renderer so it was working but it just defaulted to a 2d renderer and rotate X didn't work oh the timer went off I finished here we go we're done I can't do the gibreel sleng I can't talk while I'm eating how does he do it somebody's gotta have told me we don't know who I'm talking about check out de brillz YouTube channel I have now made a sideways scrolling yellow text thing with no theme music or branding whatsoever with some processing text in the amount of time that I was given it really should have it really should be full justified I will leave that to you I hope you make a version of this please make some but that timer do you hear the timer or you just hear it because I really want to hit okay okay make your own version of this add stuff to it to make it more fun or different or with your own style I'll try to make a JavaScript version of this with p5 and the WebGL renderer of p5 we could make a 3 J s1 and then of course all of you who know more than I do prop many of you could probably make a CSS one with transforms and all that fancy new stuff I know Sarah Dresner who is like my CSS probably knows a way to do this ok put a star field behind it yes you can do that good bye I'm gonna finish this I'm just like I'm just gonna be done with this Kody's down goodbye
