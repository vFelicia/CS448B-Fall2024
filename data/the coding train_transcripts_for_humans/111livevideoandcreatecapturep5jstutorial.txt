00:01 - hello in this video I'm going to look at
00:03 - create capture in p5js and how the
00:07 - create capture function allows you to
00:08 - get a live image from your webcam so I
00:12 - want to talk briefly just about what the
00:14 - create capture function does technically
00:16 - behind the scenes um before I start
00:18 - typing into the code and seeing the
00:20 - results so let's come with me over here
00:22 - look I'm over here now hello so um as
00:25 - you know a P5 I don't know if you know
00:27 - this but if You' watched any other
00:29 - videos you do P5 has these functions
00:31 - setup and draw setup being the thing
00:33 - that runs at the beginning of a p5js
00:36 - sketch and the thing that you typically
00:38 - have in a P5 GS sketch is a function
00:42 - called create canvas this is not
00:43 - necessarily required which gets a width
00:45 - and a height and what does that function
00:47 - do it places a
00:50 - canvas in the browser window
00:53 - itself so the goal for this video by the
00:56 - end of this video is to say you know
00:59 - you're laptop which has a like a webcam
01:02 - at the top I want to see the image you
01:06 - know from that webcam I want to see that
01:09 - in the canvas so the way that you can
01:12 - connect to the default camera of your
01:14 - computer and anybody's computer happens
01:17 - to be loading your sketch in their
01:18 - browser is with the function create
01:21 - capture so the create capture function
01:24 - and then you pass it one argument video
01:27 - what the create capture function does is
01:30 - it creates a connection to like I think
01:32 - it's called in web language like user
01:34 - get media something like that but what
01:37 - what it does behind the scenes is it
01:39 - actually creates a separate Dom element
01:41 - Dom referring to document object model
01:44 - this being the document there being
01:45 - objects in the document the one thing we
01:48 - created is a canvas as you know in P5
01:50 - you can also create things like a
01:51 - paragraph with create P you could create
01:54 - things like a slider with create slider
01:58 - you could create button with create
01:59 - button so you can make all these
02:01 - elements that live on the web page and
02:02 - create capture actually what it does is
02:05 - creates a
02:08 - video Dom element which contains the
02:12 - image from that camera so on the one
02:15 - hand this might be what you want you
02:16 - want to have a canvas and a video
02:18 - element separate from each other but in
02:21 - a sort of classic creative coding sense
02:23 - whatever whatever that means um you
02:26 - might just want to be doing some kind of
02:27 - Animation or abstract visual art
02:30 - thingamabob based on what's in that
02:32 - video so you don't actually want to see
02:33 - that Dom element you just want to paint
02:34 - it to the canvas and mess with it on the
02:36 - canvas so that's what I need to look at
02:39 - how to do with code um and and and and
02:43 - and we'll see in a second but I think
02:44 - it's important to point out that create
02:46 - capture is actually part of the
02:49 - P5 Dom library and actually creates a
02:53 - separate element on the page and so
02:55 - let's go look at
02:57 - that okay so here I am back over here
03:00 - and I've got a sketch I'm working just
03:02 - in Sublime Text today running a local
03:04 - server um and looking at the results in
03:06 - the Chrome browser if you don't know how
03:08 - to do that I made a separate video that
03:09 - I will link to that shows how to get
03:11 - that setup going but you can use any any
03:14 - web editor thing of your choice to do
03:16 - all of this so what I'm going to do is
03:18 - I'm going to say create capture and pass
03:21 - in the argument video so I'm adding that
03:23 - to my code I'm going to go over to the
03:25 - browser and I'm going to hit refresh and
03:27 - you can see now there it is
03:30 - the canvas is there and the capture is
03:32 - there now what is the resolution of this
03:34 - capture make it a little smaller you can
03:36 - see that this capture looks bigger than
03:38 - the canvas it's actually my made my
03:40 - canvas 320x 240 the capture the video is
03:43 - 640 x480 that only I guess happens to be
03:46 - whatever Default Resolution the browser
03:48 - the camera who knows making who's making
03:50 - that decision but that's what you're
03:52 - getting now if I wanted to change the
03:55 - size of this element it's a Dom element
03:57 - so I can use for example the P5 function
04:01 - size ah but how do I do that so what if
04:04 - I want to now
04:06 - manipulate what if I want to manipulate
04:09 - sorry I I lost my train of thought for a
04:10 - second what if I want to manipulate the
04:13 - the capture element itself I need to
04:16 - store a reference to it in a variable so
04:19 - what I'm going to do is add a variable
04:20 - to the top I'll call it video I will say
04:23 - video equals create capture I could have
04:25 - called it anything cam capture whatever
04:28 - and I can now also say video. size 320x
04:32 - 240 so now what I've done is I've
04:35 - created that connection it made that Dom
04:37 - element and I've sized it
04:39 - down and you can see here and you can
04:42 - see now I have on my web page I have the
04:44 - canvas and the video hooray so now we
04:48 - can start to do some more things I said
04:52 - what if I want to ultimately not see
04:54 - this separate image but actually paint
04:56 - into the canvas so I can do other stuff
04:58 - on top of it well one of the nice things
05:00 - about uh working in P5 is uh P5 has
05:04 - already set up the landscape of things
05:07 - for you so that this video Dom element
05:10 - can act just like any other image would
05:13 - act in P5 so for example in draw if I
05:16 - just say oh I didn't set up my settings
05:19 - correctly if I just say image my Sublime
05:21 - settings I'll do that later video I like
05:23 - to have two spaces for the indent you
05:25 - know it's very important to me my life
05:27 - feels very out of control if my
05:28 - indentation is working correctly the way
05:30 - that I like it I'll take a deep breath
05:33 - move on okay so if I say image video.
05:36 - z00 um um and I do that and now I hit
05:40 - refresh we can see there it is so I've
05:44 - got now I've got the actual video Dom
05:46 - element and I have the canvas where I'm
05:48 - drawing the video onto the canvas but
05:50 - you can see I can do things like now
05:52 - with the canvas I can add other
05:54 - functions like tint you know I could
05:57 - make it very uh let's see what happens
05:59 - if I get kind of
06:01 - pinkish we can see here oh you know what
06:04 - interesting ah so a little bug happened
06:07 - I'm going to fix this bug um and it's
06:09 - actually there's already a GitHub issue
06:10 - file so by the time you run this with
06:12 - your P5 in the future this won't happen
06:14 - to you I'm going to just fix it by um by
06:18 - enforcing the size here but what
06:21 - happened is uh when I added tint the
06:24 - pixels got manipulated and suddenly it
06:27 - went back to 640 x 480 even though
06:29 - shouldn't that shouldn't have happened
06:30 - so this video is going to have a
06:31 - historical error in it which will get
06:33 - fixed but I in my code I was able to fix
06:36 - it by just enforcing the size that I'm
06:38 - drawing the image so you can see that in
06:40 - the canvas I can do various things to
06:43 - manipulate the image itself and while I
06:45 - was altering the size I might as well
06:47 - see I could do something like ah let me
06:48 - make mouse X the width and now you can
06:51 - see I have this video that I can kind of
06:53 - like shrink and make myself kind of like
06:55 - skinny or wider or a little bit skinnier
06:58 - and you can see I'm not drawing the
06:59 - background so I'm getting these weird
07:00 - Trails so anything that you can do with
07:03 - images shapes I could add translate I
07:05 - could add rotate I could spin it I could
07:06 - shrink it I could flip it all of those
07:08 - types of things I can do with the video
07:10 - and if I it's nice to have this Dom
07:13 - element as a reference of what the
07:15 - original video looks like but if I
07:17 - didn't want to have that one thing I'll
07:19 - show you is I could add video. hiide so
07:21 - the hide function hides a particular Dom
07:24 - element and if I hit refresh you can now
07:27 - see that the only thing is the canvas
07:30 - and the video so that concludes what I
07:33 - originally set out as the goal which was
07:36 - to be able to
07:38 - capture video from the camera and draw
07:41 - it into the canvas however I must alert
07:44 - you to something that will trip you up I
07:47 - probably should have led with this and
07:49 - not finished with it notice how it
07:52 - didn't ask me for permission it didn't
07:55 - say like oh can I have access to your
07:56 - camera is that okay what you are doing
07:59 - if you took this sketch and uploaded it
08:01 - to your website potentially if somebody
08:04 - came to your website it could
08:06 - automatically turn on their camera you
08:08 - could take pictures of them and save
08:09 - that to your server so typically
08:11 - speaking what you're the user is going
08:12 - to see is like oh can I have access to
08:14 - the camera but some browsers in
08:17 - particular the Chrome browser will only
08:19 - actually let you do this if you are
08:21 - serving your website from what's known
08:24 - as
08:26 - https the S being secure
08:30 - so if you ever go to the address bar in
08:33 - your browser it'll sometimes say HTTP
08:36 - and it'll sometimes say https if you're
08:39 - like on your bank's website it's I hope
08:41 - it says https because you need a level
08:44 - of encryption and security there so
08:46 - depending on where you're uploading your
08:48 - thing uh if you're just working locally
08:50 - on your own computer and making whatever
08:52 - and experimenting it's always going to
08:53 - work but if you're uploading it to your
08:55 - own website you need to have https
08:58 - enabled some web servers might have this
09:00 - as a feature for you like Heroku I
09:02 - believe if you're using that that's a
09:04 - web service Thing company others won't
09:07 - um and so you need to like purchase and
09:09 - get a certificate and maybe I can make a
09:11 - video about that if I even knew how to
09:13 - do that but one thing I'll point out
09:14 - that someone pointed to me recently is
09:16 - there is something called let's encrypt
09:19 - let's encrypt is free automated and open
09:21 - it's a new certificate Authority so that
09:23 - might be something you could look into
09:24 - if you need to resolve this issue in
09:26 - terms of where you're uploading I do
09:28 - know for example though that GitHub
09:29 - pages I believe if you're using GitHub
09:31 - Pages as a way of Hosting something um
09:33 - that I believe you can use https with
09:35 - anyway but also you could just not use
09:37 - Chrome and it might work in a different
09:38 - browser yada Yad yada this will all be
09:40 - irrelevant and I'm GNA have to dub the
09:42 - robots of the future will dub over me
09:44 - and explain this correctly because this
09:46 - is all going to become totally not
09:49 - relevant anymore probably a week from
09:50 - now two weeks from now two months from
09:51 - now Etc okay thanks for watching this
09:53 - video in the next video you know so I
09:55 - would say if you're looking for
09:56 - something to do try to get this to work
09:58 - mess around manipulate the video in the
09:59 - next video I'm going to show you how to
10:00 - save snapshots over time from a live
10:04 - source

Cleaned transcript:

hello in this video I'm going to look at create capture in p5js and how the create capture function allows you to get a live image from your webcam so I want to talk briefly just about what the create capture function does technically behind the scenes um before I start typing into the code and seeing the results so let's come with me over here look I'm over here now hello so um as you know a P5 I don't know if you know this but if You' watched any other videos you do P5 has these functions setup and draw setup being the thing that runs at the beginning of a p5js sketch and the thing that you typically have in a P5 GS sketch is a function called create canvas this is not necessarily required which gets a width and a height and what does that function do it places a canvas in the browser window itself so the goal for this video by the end of this video is to say you know you're laptop which has a like a webcam at the top I want to see the image you know from that webcam I want to see that in the canvas so the way that you can connect to the default camera of your computer and anybody's computer happens to be loading your sketch in their browser is with the function create capture so the create capture function and then you pass it one argument video what the create capture function does is it creates a connection to like I think it's called in web language like user get media something like that but what what it does behind the scenes is it actually creates a separate Dom element Dom referring to document object model this being the document there being objects in the document the one thing we created is a canvas as you know in P5 you can also create things like a paragraph with create P you could create things like a slider with create slider you could create button with create button so you can make all these elements that live on the web page and create capture actually what it does is creates a video Dom element which contains the image from that camera so on the one hand this might be what you want you want to have a canvas and a video element separate from each other but in a sort of classic creative coding sense whatever whatever that means um you might just want to be doing some kind of Animation or abstract visual art thingamabob based on what's in that video so you don't actually want to see that Dom element you just want to paint it to the canvas and mess with it on the canvas so that's what I need to look at how to do with code um and and and and and we'll see in a second but I think it's important to point out that create capture is actually part of the P5 Dom library and actually creates a separate element on the page and so let's go look at that okay so here I am back over here and I've got a sketch I'm working just in Sublime

I'm going to go over to the browser and I'm going to hit refresh and you can see now there it is the canvas is there and the capture is there now what is the resolution of this capture make it a little smaller you can see that this capture looks bigger than the canvas it's actually my made my canvas 320x 240 the capture the video is 640 x480 that only I guess happens to be whatever Default Resolution the browser the camera who knows making who's making that decision but that's what you're getting now if I wanted to change the size of this element it's a Dom element so I can use for example the P5 function size ah but how do I do that so what if I want to now manipulate what if I want to manipulate sorry I I lost my train of thought for a second what if I want to manipulate the the capture element itself I need to store a reference to it in a variable so what I'm going to do is add a variable to the top I'll call it video I will say video equals create capture I could have

see here and you can see now I have on my web page I have the canvas and the video hooray so now we can start to do some more things I said what if I want to ultimately not see this separate image but actually paint into the canvas so I can do other stuff on top of it well one of the nice things about uh working in P5 is uh P5 has already set up the landscape of things for you so that this video Dom element can act just like any other image would act in P5 so for example in draw if I just say oh I didn't set up my settings correctly if I just say image my Sublime settings I'll do that later video I like to have two spaces for the indent you know it's very important to me my life feels very out of control if my indentation is working correctly the way that I like it I'll take a deep breath move on okay so if I say image video. z00 um um and I do that and now I hit refresh we can see there it is so I've got now I've got the actual video Dom element and I have the canvas where I'm drawing the video onto the canvas but you can see I can do things like now with the canvas I can add other functions like tint you know I could make it very uh let's see what happens if I get kind of pinkish we can see here oh you know what interesting ah so a little bug happened I'm going to fix this bug um and it's actually there's already a GitHub issue file so by the time you run this with your P5 in the future this won't happen to you I'm going to just fix it by um by enforcing the size here but what happened is uh when I added tint the pixels got manipulated and suddenly it went back to 640 x 480 even though shouldn't that shouldn't have happened so this video is going to have a historical error in it which will get fixed but I in my code I was able to fix it by just enforcing the

have to dub the robots of the future will dub over me and explain this correctly because this is all going to become totally not relevant anymore probably a week from now two weeks from now two months from now Etc okay thanks for watching this video in the next video you know so I would say if you're looking for something to do try to get this to work mess around manipulate the video in the next video I'm going to show you how to save snapshots over time from a live source
