03:39 - hi everyone test one two it looks like
03:42 - to me like the audio is only coming
03:44 - through in one year
03:47 - assuming you're listed with your ears
03:50 - uh one side the left channel so let me
03:52 - work on
03:53 - fixing that give me one moment and if
03:56 - you can confirm in the chat you hear me
03:57 - but only through the left channel that's
04:00 - helpful information
04:01 - i realized my ball is probably low
04:03 - relative to music as well i gotta fix
04:05 - that
04:09 - [Music]
04:27 - all right i'm back and hopefully in both
04:29 - of your ears um the mic is mono but it
04:33 - needs to be
04:34 - sent to both channels and i believe it
04:36 - is and i'm just switching to the next
04:39 - song
04:40 - this song means there is one minute and
04:43 - three seconds left so it's time for me
04:45 - to begin
04:46 - and boy am i uh trying to get together

05:05 - myself
05:26 - [Music]
05:32 - do
05:34 - [Music]
05:48 - hello good morning happy coding train
05:52 - friday i am coming to you live from the
05:54 - hudson valley of new york state uh in a
05:57 - garage with new lights a new monitor car
06:01 - a little confidence monitor attached to
06:03 - my camera am i looking at you does this
06:05 - look like i'm speaking directly to you
06:07 - because right now i'm just looking at
06:08 - myself but if i look at the camera lens
06:11 - now i'm really looking at the lens but
06:12 - typically my eye goes up to look this
06:14 - way and i would just like to know
06:17 - if i look at myself while i'm talking do
06:19 - you feel the connection between us i
06:21 - know it might seem a little bit forced
06:23 - and fake now that you realize that i
06:25 - can't actually see you
06:27 - oh there's an airplane flying overhead
06:29 - there's a truck delivering something
06:31 - gloria is hanging out in the grass and
06:34 - the sunshine
06:37 - programmer 171 is writing in the chat i
06:39 - am 13 years old and i love your videos i
06:42 - code in java for most of my games and i
06:44 - like your videos because they can be
06:45 - easily understood by anyone ah
06:47 - programmer 171 you just made my day
06:51 - thank you for that wonderful feedback
06:53 - um
06:55 - my son is also 13 years old his new
06:58 - hobby i guess maybe i shouldn't be
06:59 - broadcasting this all across the
07:00 - internet but i'm about to do it anyway
07:02 - is building mechanical keyboards so stay
07:05 - tuned for a future coding train live
07:08 - session here in this garage where i
07:09 - build a mechanical keyboard and if you
07:11 - happen to be a mechanical keyboard
07:13 - builder expert person i would love to
07:15 - hear from you
07:16 - you could write messages in the chat but
07:18 - i'm only going to very rarely turn my
07:20 - head this way to see them i see right
07:22 - now julian is saying first time catching
07:24 - you live welcome first timers to
07:27 - codingtrain live
07:29 - a little like ding dong discord sound
07:31 - just went off i have no idea where
07:33 - that's from or if i got a message
07:35 - somewhere i have too many screens many
07:37 - screens oh i have so many new things to
07:38 - show you before i do any of that
07:41 - let me quickly thank and boy boy all of
07:44 - you should really thank this sponsor uh
07:47 - curiositystream you can sign up at
07:49 - curiositystream.com
07:52 - codingtrain um it helps
07:55 - curiosity stream keeps the engine
07:57 - running um what is curiosity stream you
07:59 - might be asking oh i'm going to show you
08:01 - i'm going to do like a better sponsor
08:03 - segment in the middle because i have
08:04 - some things i want to show you but let
08:05 - me test out some of my new technology
08:08 - oh look
08:10 - this is curiosity stream
08:12 - um it is a wonderful streaming
08:14 - documentary uh uh um is a streaming
08:18 - thing oh i can't i'm not prepared
08:21 - did i mention i'm not prepared i'm sorry
08:23 - curiosity stream i'm doing my best
08:27 - i'm doing my best please don't fire me
08:29 - um
08:31 - curiosity stream is a streaming service
08:32 - with lots of wonderful documentaries um
08:35 - so many things
08:37 - related to let's see if i can do this ah
08:39 - now i'm in the screen too uh related to
08:41 - this channel um
08:43 - i particularly love the nature and
08:45 - environment stuff
08:46 - that's kind of what i enjoy watching but
08:48 - i think if you're a coding trained
08:50 - viewer the science on the map i'm
08:52 - looking for any of dr hannah fry's uh
08:55 - videos
08:56 - um
08:57 - uh ancient engineering becoming a
08:59 - martian look at all this stuff i have
09:00 - not there's just so much stuff to watch
09:02 - there it is magic numbers it's for me
09:05 - yes it is for me but uh even better than
09:08 - just uh telling you about curiosity
09:10 - stream
09:11 - um and but i'm not even doing so i have
09:13 - a whole script for my sponsor segment
09:14 - later
09:15 - and this was just me like warming up i'm
09:18 - kind of going off into my script but
09:19 - it's not scripted and i'm not prepared
09:21 - i'm sorry i'm doing my best
09:24 - uh
09:25 - we're gonna get to coding today some
09:27 - coding is gonna happen um but um i am
09:30 - part of a streaming service called
09:32 - nebula which is a bunch of educational
09:34 - creators on youtube got together uh from
09:36 - standard and started this streaming
09:38 - service i think if i go here and the
09:41 - thing about curiosity stream is if you
09:43 - sign up through that link um you're
09:45 - gonna get a uh it says it in the
09:48 - description of this video
09:50 - see how unprepared i am without my
09:52 - script um i i think it's i just don't
09:55 - want to say the wrong
09:56 - uh amount
09:58 - oh i'm doing so well
10:01 - this is good thank you uh the practice
10:03 - later where where where is my uh
10:05 - oh yeah here's my uh no um

12:01 - now
12:02 - let's see here
12:04 - all right now that we got that all out
12:06 - of the way
12:07 - um
12:09 - what am i going to do today so first
12:11 - things first um i want to just sort of
12:15 - talk you through
12:16 - what i've got going on here in the
12:18 - studio at some point i would very much
12:20 - like to make a
12:22 - studio sorry there's a huge truck do you
12:25 - hear that
12:27 - so i moved
12:29 - and the truck is delivering a bed i've
12:32 - been sleeping on the floor for quite a
12:34 - while the mattress on the floor it's
12:35 - perfectly fine the bed has been
12:37 - delivered
12:38 - this giant truck is trying to get out of
12:40 - the driveway now it already was
12:41 - delivered i'm feeling very stressed out
12:43 - about it
12:44 - uh anyway
12:47 - live live i would say like welcome to
12:50 - live tv but this is not tv
12:52 - nope never never made it onto tv
12:55 - i'm an old person who who uh i don't
12:58 - know if i ever even auditioned to be on
12:59 - tv but nobody ever nobody said to me hey
13:01 - you should be on tv i just said to
13:02 - myself i should be on tv and then i made
13:05 - a youtube channel and here i am on your
13:07 - tubes
13:11 - so let's talk about the new studio so um
13:14 - what you're seeing is camera one
13:17 - camera one is pointing at this desk uh
13:20 - you can actually see i don't know why
13:22 - this button is broken but i'm just gonna
13:24 - go to here this is actually what the
13:26 - camera is seeing it is me standing in
13:28 - front of a green curtain i have a new
13:30 - light over here you can see how bright
13:32 - that is i'm to turn it off for a second
13:36 - i don't this is not hooked up it has a
13:38 - network plug
13:40 - but it is not hooked up so now it is
13:42 - darker i also have another light over
13:45 - here which i have hooked up to the
13:46 - network so i can press a button on my
13:48 - steam stream deck and it goes off
13:50 - so i'm turning this one on
13:52 - i'm going to turn the other one on
13:54 - um
13:55 - one thing that i haven't really had a
13:57 - chance to do is sort of sort out all the
14:00 - settings on my camera like it's a sony
14:04 - uh alpha 7 3 is the camera that i'm
14:07 - using and i've it's at some arbitrary
14:09 - iso
14:11 - i think there's other camera settings uh
14:13 - white balance color temperature so i'm
14:15 - curious in general
14:17 - if you happen to be a video expert or
14:20 - just a person watching any feedback i'm
14:23 - not going to really get it now i would
14:25 - suggest joining the discord and that's a
14:27 - place where you can more reliably pass
14:29 - along some feedback that will get to me
14:31 - uh in terms of the lighting and setup of
14:33 - this view
14:35 - um i would um and you can see like i've
14:38 - got the full
14:39 - uh full green here um and now this is
14:43 - open broadcast studio in a stream deck i
14:45 - press this button it switches me to this
14:47 - view i have another button for the
14:48 - banner just have a background my dream
14:50 - now is to have i mean i've been doing
14:52 - this forever and it's essentially the
14:53 - same thing that you've always been
14:54 - watching but it's just sort of set up a
14:56 - new i mean uh david and the discord was
14:58 - pointing out to me that like i've set up
15:00 - a new studio like four times in the last
15:02 - two years
15:03 - this is going to be i'm hoping the
15:06 - studio for the next well at least one
15:08 - year and probably two years and then
15:10 - we'll sort of see from there i mean
15:12 - maybe forever
15:13 - uh
15:14 - or three months from now i'll be like
15:15 - hey i'm moving again
15:18 - um but um
15:20 - i forgot what i was saying ah so this is
15:22 - it keyed oh my dream is to start having
15:24 - like coding train uh code examples and
15:27 - animations and easter eggs popping up
15:29 - and maybe some real-time interaction
15:31 - stuff so all of that is coming i just
15:33 - want to be able to see the chat here
15:35 - oh so over here i have like a monitor
15:39 - which has open broadcast studio running
15:41 - i see the youtube chat in theory i see
15:43 - the discord chat but i unfortunately
15:45 - that disappeared
15:46 - um you hear the truck says
15:49 - prathamesh in the discord chat um hi
15:52 - again to naresh so uh i'm trying to do a
15:55 - better job one of the reasons why i got
15:56 - this extra confidence monitor is it
15:58 - encourages me to look this way and look
16:01 - at the camera i often find myself live
16:03 - streaming like this but the reason why i
16:05 - like having a monitor over here is the
16:07 - other view that i have takes this laptop
16:11 - hdmi out brings it in i have a brand new
16:13 - streaming pc that's really the big
16:15 - difference here and i've had to like
16:16 - install and set everything up and has
16:18 - been doing it since about 8 30 a.m i
16:20 - thought two hours will be enough but
16:23 - we'll see i did some of it last friday
16:24 - so if i switch here i believe if i press
16:27 - this button this is just the raw laptop
16:30 - you can see i've got my october spooky
16:32 - month
16:33 - background here if i press this button i
16:36 - appear i didn't i can i didn't use any
16:39 - of the transitions that are in obs to
16:41 - have me fade in
16:42 - um
16:44 - and i see that uh programmer 170 oh no
16:46 - rusty nail uh whiteboard yeah programmer
16:49 - so ah it's coming so rusty now asked i'm
16:51 - gonna join your discord i don't think
16:53 - this button
16:54 - let's see if this button it doesn't work
16:56 - so for some reason my youtube button's
16:58 - on my stream deck i have a button that
16:59 - should
17:00 - post something to the chat it's not
17:01 - working i also have a button that should
17:03 - show me how many people are watching
17:05 - which is also not working anyway so you
17:07 - can see here the reason why i like to
17:09 - have this view is i often as if i'm
17:12 - reporting the weather to you
17:15 - uh i like to open up
17:18 - uh p5.js web editor
17:21 - and uh make the font
17:25 - quite a bit bigger
17:26 - and then i can say tomorrow's weather
17:29 - will be 400 by 400 canvas with gray
17:32 - skies uh you know what let's make it
17:34 - have blue skies
17:37 - tomorrow's weather
17:38 - p5 weather is blue skies so that is all
17:42 - the setup here now what is this you
17:45 - might ask this is a new ipad
17:48 - uh i even have a pencil
17:53 - it's not a real pencil it's an apple
17:54 - pencil not a sponsor though i'm totally
17:57 - available apple i'm available
18:00 - no chance of that
18:03 - so i think it's procreate
18:08 - pro create is the software that i
18:11 - installed
18:12 - i have for example this beautiful um
18:16 - so this has hdmi out as well and it's
18:18 - going into another capture oh
18:20 - unsupported signal okay came back and if
18:22 - i press this button ooh i think this
18:25 - cable is a little bit wonky i think this
18:28 - i need to i
18:30 - this um particular
18:32 - uh usbc to hdmi out dongle is uh kind of
18:37 - unhappy but i do have
18:40 - um
18:41 - i do now have this
18:43 - that i can draw and and do diagrams too
18:45 - but i really don't i i it you know
18:48 - interesting option um i can also and see
18:51 - it just keeps going in and out so i
18:53 - might not use that too much today but i
18:55 - also um
18:56 - today i was sort of like oh this is
18:58 - interesting since i want to talk about
19:00 - curiosity stream and nebula um i can
19:03 - open those up
19:04 - let me just go to the nebula main
19:07 - uh screen here and show you um that
19:10 - so um so this is i thought is useful
19:13 - it's another way for me to
19:15 - show and display content while streaming
19:17 - i kind of is like this ugly like hunk of
19:20 - thing metal here so i don't i don't love
19:23 - what that adds and maybe i guess i could
19:25 - put some stickers on it or maybe i don't
19:26 - want to use it i'll take that away but
19:30 - what you've all been waiting for
19:34 - ah wait no okay hold on you don't hear
19:36 - that
19:37 - so one of the things that i neglected to
19:39 - do
19:40 - was set up the audio routing correctly
19:43 - um it's is it here is the question
19:46 - so i need to in this if i want you to be
19:48 - able to hear
19:50 - audio i've got to go to audio input
19:52 - capture add existing laptop audio okay
19:56 - now in this view wait what what view did
19:59 - i just end up in this view
20:01 - this view
20:03 - yes now you should hear oh do you not
20:05 - hear me
20:07 - no you do hear me okay there's just too
20:09 - many things here remove can i remove
20:11 - this
20:12 - hi
20:14 - no
20:16 - remove delete there's like so many
20:19 - can i move this up
20:21 - come on obs i guess i could just do hide
20:23 - just gonna do hide gloria it's okay
20:26 - uh all right
20:28 - that drum roll really didn't lead to
20:29 - anything did it
20:31 - okay here it comes
20:32 - ready i have no idea if this is gonna
20:33 - work
20:35 - here comes everybody
20:36 - look at that
20:38 - okay
20:39 - uh you hear me the drum roll has gone
20:41 - away because i didn't add that audio i'm
20:42 - walking over
20:43 - i'm gonna get a marker
20:47 - i'm walking over
20:48 - i'm walking over in
20:50 - here i am now there's a there's a couple
20:52 - issues with this setup i do have a light
20:54 - i've had to position the light in such a
20:56 - way oh boy i'm a little bit taller than
20:58 - what the camera is seeing i want to work
21:00 - on that i had to position the light in
21:01 - such a way that it doesn't reflect off
21:03 - of this very glossy finish
21:06 - so i can see it's a little shadowy oh i
21:08 - have an extra light that i didn't hook
21:10 - up
21:10 - so i do have one more light that i
21:12 - definitely want to add should i put it
21:15 - on now that will help
21:17 - give me a second
21:19 - let's do that it says i need an
21:21 - extension cord for it but i can plug it
21:23 - in i think i can plug it in here i just
21:25 - have to not trip over it
21:27 - um
21:29 - and then let's see i need it's this one
21:30 - is connected to
21:32 - uh the internet
21:35 - over here
21:37 - uh where am i here so like i i think
21:39 - this button which turns off this light
21:41 - should also turn on the other light
21:45 - did that happen
21:47 - no
21:48 - oh it needs to be plugged in it is now
21:51 - on
21:54 - okay so now i'm going back i can't see
21:56 - uh
21:58 - uh
22:00 - um
22:01 - take double-sided tape and put the
22:02 - adapter on the back of the ipad rack oh
22:04 - that's very smart marvin thank you for
22:06 - that suggestion all right so now i'm
22:08 - coming back it's a little bit better
22:09 - because i have one extra
22:11 - very
22:12 - light so so here we go here i am uh if i
22:15 - need to draw a diagram
22:17 - like
22:19 - here is a velocity vector
22:22 - and here is the target for the vehicle
22:25 - and its desired velocity
22:27 - uh i am now able to do that as well but
22:30 - i think that this so first of all the
22:32 - only extra tripod i had
22:35 - maybe goes at best like
22:37 - five feet
22:38 - so uh it needs to be higher i think
22:41 - um
22:42 - and it i think it's probably a skew and
22:44 - it's sort of pointed down so i need to
22:46 - have it point up uh hopefully the focus
22:48 - is okay i can see some shadowing
22:51 - so i'm not sure i this i could
22:54 - so your feedback is welcome and
22:56 - appreciated first day using this i
22:58 - probably should get some more lights or
23:01 - maybe just some different camera
23:02 - settings to brighten it up um and try to
23:05 - reduce the shadowing
23:07 - incidentally
23:11 - i just want to
23:13 - move this for a second
23:15 - what's here
23:18 - is this locked i think i locked this
23:24 - are you seeing this is this chris is
23:25 - reading
23:27 - wait how do i unlock this door
23:31 - there we go ah there we go
23:38 - it's the great outdoors
23:42 - so i don't know hopefully the mic is
23:43 - still working you can still hear me but
23:45 - i have some dreams like maybe i could
23:47 - set up my laptop here
23:49 - it's a beautiful day you hear the birds
23:50 - the sun is out
23:52 - breathe in the nature this roof of the
23:55 - garage i think needs to be replaced it's
23:57 - gonna be a big project so there's a lot
23:59 - of things that have got to happen to
24:00 - make this all come together but anyway
24:03 - uh i'm completely barefoot so now my
24:06 - feet are kind of wet uh
24:09 - a little natural green screen background
24:12 - uh let's see if i can close this
24:16 - do i do this to lock it
24:23 - i can't figure it out i'll lock it later
24:26 - bring the white board back
24:29 - uh
24:30 - there we go so uh now you've seen pretty
24:33 - much all of the elements of the new
24:35 - studio one of the things that is true
24:37 - about being over here is i absolutely
24:40 - cannot see the chat whatsoever so for
24:42 - all i know you've lost the audio
24:45 - the stream has gone out who knows i can
24:48 - out of the corner of my eye
24:50 - see open broadcast studio so i do see
24:53 - myself
24:55 - and but i can't read the chat so it
24:57 - might be worth i have a table over here
25:00 - a little work table to build the
25:02 - mechanical keyboard
25:04 - that um
25:05 - maybe i can set up an extra monitor or
25:07 - something like that to be able to watch
25:09 - the chat
25:10 - while i'm here or maybe over here
25:12 - something like that so
25:15 - yeah so that's the setup i don't know if
25:17 - i'm going to use this today
25:19 - but
25:21 - there you go
25:22 - um
25:25 - i'm looking at the chat now mike's still
25:27 - perfect outside
25:29 - uh that's good to know it's good to know
25:32 - it is a wireless lav and i've got to
25:34 - come back over here
25:35 - um so here we are
25:38 - all right
25:40 - 10 55.
25:45 - things
25:47 - are still a little rough
25:49 - with the coding train um in terms of
25:52 - content production
25:54 - um a lot of my time is uh spent teaching
25:58 - and also setting up this new space
26:01 - um i hope to be
26:06 - back
26:06 - with live regular live streams as of
26:08 - today so i plan to live stream most
26:12 - fridays next week is a little bit tbd
26:14 - i've got some plans for october 29th
26:17 - um and then there'll be streams in
26:19 - november except for thanksgiving some
26:21 - streams in december we'll do a holiday
26:24 - uh fundraiser for processing um and then
26:26 - i've got lots of new plans
26:29 - that will begin to happen hopefully in
26:30 - january so what kinds of things do i do
26:33 - if you're new if this is your first time
26:35 - watching
26:36 - i spend a lot of time
26:41 - while i live stream kind of just
26:43 - chatting chit-chatting
26:45 - um
26:46 - and
26:47 - like i'm doing now
26:49 - it is my goal to have their live streams
26:52 - be a little bit more programmed
26:54 - and so the kinds of things i like to do
26:56 - are share projects that people from the
26:58 - community have made
27:01 - i'm not really so set up to do that
27:03 - today i also like to look at the most
27:06 - recent videos that i have released
27:09 - take a look through the comments read
27:10 - some of the comments answer some of the
27:12 - questions
27:14 - and so that's what i'm going to start
27:16 - with and then the other things that i
27:18 - want to do today are i want to talk a
27:21 - little bit about
27:22 - how discord i have
27:25 - oh boy
27:27 - i signed up for this so i've got no
27:29 - there's you know it is
27:30 - no reason to complain
27:33 - but i spent a very good portion
27:36 - of last fall making a i think four-part
27:40 - uh series let's go to the coding train
27:42 - website under maybe more under learning
27:45 - discord bot
27:47 - oh six part series
27:49 - so i made these six videos on how to
27:53 - program your own discord bot an
27:55 - introduction to the concept how the
27:57 - developer portal works starting to write
28:00 - the code with discord.js
28:02 - a library for interfacing with the
28:04 - discord api
28:05 - um how to hide your api keys with dot
28:08 - env posting gifs and the com and how to
28:10 - make a command handler look at all these
28:12 - wonderful thumbnails and
28:14 - you know they're edited and produced and
28:16 - like yeah you know it's no more of these
28:18 - old days where i just press the button
28:20 - and like take talk code code code and
28:22 - express stop and release the video edit
28:25 - it and zooming in and out and
28:26 - highlighting things to help make it
28:28 - you know
28:29 - people seem to like that i don't know
28:31 - we'll see anyway but the result of that
28:33 - is you could i could spend a lot of time
28:36 - effort and money
28:38 - to produce
28:41 - a series like this and uh libraries
28:43 - change and it's pretty much out of date
28:45 - and i would say this is um
28:47 - this is quite the case for these discord
28:49 - tutorials unfortunately now the the one
28:52 - thing is true
28:53 - you could still follow these tutorials
28:56 - and absolutely get your bot to work
28:58 - if you made sure to use the same version
29:01 - of the discord.js package that i'm using
29:04 - in these videos i've tested it it still
29:06 - works
29:07 - i don't know to what extent
29:09 - the discord api itself will change in
29:12 - which case some of the things that that
29:14 - that library is doing in the older
29:16 - version will be deprecated and actually
29:17 - stop working but at the moment it still
29:20 - works however
29:21 - um it's a much better
29:24 - thing now to use the newest
29:26 - discord dot js library and it's version
29:29 - 13.
29:31 - it's not even a year ago these came out
29:32 - in november and december not even one
29:35 - year did i make it with these videos i
29:37 - would say probably the introduction is
29:39 - maybe still relevant the developer
29:41 - portal is pretty much the same although
29:43 - you've got to do a few evergreen that's
29:45 - some evergreen content
29:48 - maybe because at least working with
29:50 - this.env file is a tried and true method
29:52 - that hasn't changed
29:54 - working with the api to get gifs is the
29:57 - same but posting them to discord is a
29:59 - little bit different and command
30:00 - handling has changed
30:02 - so i don't know
30:05 - right now i do not have the capacity to
30:07 - really re-record new versions of these
30:09 - but i would like to spend some time
30:11 - just i have new examples and i've been
30:13 - teaching the new examples in my nyu
30:15 - course
30:17 - my goal with the coding terrain is i
30:18 - have my full-time day job teaching i
30:20 - have this sort of side
30:22 - business youtube channel thing
30:25 - i like to make videos that i can use in
30:27 - my classes but also uh make them
30:29 - available to the wider uh
30:32 - youtube audience so i'm trying to
30:34 - balance it all i haven't figured it out
30:36 - so i don't know what to do about that
30:37 - but
30:38 - um i at least today during the live
30:40 - stream one thing i can do is kind of go
30:43 - through
30:44 - some new examples that i've made and
30:45 - point out what the steps are and talk
30:48 - about what the changes are so if you
30:50 - wanted hopefully i can give you a head
30:52 - start
30:53 - on
30:54 - uh if you follow these tutorials and you
30:56 - made something how to upgrade to the
30:57 - next version and i should really thank
30:59 - both
31:00 - kobe and david who are
31:02 - um
31:03 - creators and maintainers of the coding
31:05 - train discord bot who uh gave me
31:08 - enormous amounts of help um in uh
31:11 - figuring out um how all this new stuff
31:12 - works
31:14 - okay um
31:16 - now let's see here so i want to do that
31:20 - today so three things
31:21 - i want to go through my most recent i
31:23 - could release a video live while i'm
31:25 - live streaming you know what i'm going
31:26 - to do at the end of today's live stream
31:28 - i'm going to release the next video in
31:29 - my nature of code series because it's
31:31 - ready to go
31:32 - so that's something you can i think look
31:34 - forward to i'll do that today
31:36 - but and maybe i'll even show you a
31:38 - little preview of what it is
31:40 - during the live stream
31:42 - so
31:43 - comments update on nature of code
31:44 - steering behavior video series that's
31:47 - going on right now
31:48 - uh update on discord stuff and then i
31:52 - would like to this will make everybody
31:54 - very happy i hope i got to watch the
31:55 - time i got to get this started probably
31:57 - by like 12 45 at the latest i would like
32:00 - to see
32:02 - uh uh i would like to take a little
32:04 - return back to the old ways of how i
32:07 - used to make coding train content which
32:09 - is during the live stream i would pick a
32:11 - coding challenge topic and give myself a
32:13 - amount of time to try to program it and
32:15 - then all the while while i'm doing that
32:17 - i would also be recording everything to
32:19 - disk so that later
32:21 - that coding challenge sequence could be
32:24 - you know edited together with some light
32:26 - editing
32:27 - um and uh released as a standalone video
32:30 - um certainly these are the most watched
32:34 - videos on my channel the ones that i did
32:35 - that way years ago so and i my new setup
32:39 - in theory
32:40 - um i'm using this um i think it's called
32:42 - the like pro cam elgato pro cam capture
32:45 - card so it has um software that will
32:49 - record all of the hdmi inputs into the
32:52 - card to one big video file which i can
32:54 - run in the background while i'm live
32:56 - streaming and i have a like
32:59 - tx nvidia
33:02 - 3080 i don't remember what it is but i
33:05 - went through a lot of research to spec
33:07 - out a machine with a graphics card that
33:10 - i would hope
33:13 - would be able to handle both live
33:15 - streaming and recording to disk uh
33:17 - multiple hdmi events so we're gonna see
33:19 - if that works i'm not holding my breath
33:21 - i'll definitely be doing it on the live
33:23 - stream whether the recording actually
33:25 - works in a way that it can be reused
33:27 - we'll see
33:28 - um
33:30 - so that's kind of my plan
33:31 - could you say that again no no i'm not
33:33 - going to say that again
33:37 - why does that happen why does the
33:38 - technology just spontaneously talk to us
33:41 - for no reason
33:43 - i mean there probably was a reason i
33:44 - probably hit something press something
33:45 - did something it asked me to say it
33:47 - again i can't say it again
33:49 - don't make me say it again
33:54 - you know what
33:56 - oh that's what i should use the outdoors
33:58 - for
33:59 - reading the random numbers
34:03 - do i have the laptop audio here let's
34:05 - see oh wait hold on press this button
34:08 - no why is that not
34:11 - how come that doesn't work
34:13 - does this button work for muting myself
34:15 - okay i'm talking i'm talking i'm about
34:16 - to mute my
34:20 - muted and now i'm back and talking again
34:21 - that button works
34:24 - um
34:27 - naresh is asking how did i get a 33
34:31 - what do you say what's the price 3008 or
34:34 - is it 3080 or is it 3080
34:38 - uh i might be wrong hold on let me get
34:40 - my little notebook
34:41 - and tell you about the specs of my new
34:43 - computer
34:45 - um i know there's a global gpu shortage
34:47 - i think i must have just lucked out
34:50 - um i'm walking over here to my
34:53 - information booklet i'm gonna i'm gonna
34:55 - do a dramatic reading
34:58 - of uh
35:00 - the specs of the new computer that i
35:02 - purchased
35:06 - you know it's very hard for me to get
35:07 - back to
35:09 - my spot
35:11 - because um
35:15 - okay so
35:16 - all right ports and connections oh no
35:18 - wait come on isn't there just like a
35:23 - star guy install setup benchmarks
35:27 - benchmarks benchmarks
35:31 - tools and recovery windows should i
35:34 - upgrade to windows 11 on it
35:36 - anybody know it i really just wanted to
35:38 - read you the main specs
35:41 - is there another piece of paper i don't
35:42 - know why it's not i have this whole
35:44 - notebook
35:50 - yeah i have an nvidia geforce rtx
35:53 - 3080 10 gigabyte founders edition video
35:56 - card
35:58 - i don't know why i don't have the
36:01 - there must be must have been like a
36:02 - separate paper and this is just like
36:04 - this is going well
36:06 - i was i was excited to do a um
36:12 - random number uh uh reading and then i
36:14 - was like oh i'll read about my computer
36:16 - but let's just let's i don't even know
36:17 - where ah here's the random digits book
36:21 - okay
36:22 - remember i'm gonna get back to that
36:23 - remember that system i had where i would
36:26 - know my goal is to do i guess i have to
36:28 - start over again now that i'm in a new
36:29 - studio
36:31 - my goal
36:33 - is to read every number
36:35 - from this book
36:37 - what book am i talking about it is the
36:39 - book uh it's very uh reflective um a
36:43 - million random digits with 100 000
36:45 - normal deviates i'm still in the market
36:48 - for a
36:49 - original print edition of this book
36:53 - um and if i think if i go into discord
36:58 - uh
36:59 - somebody somebody might tell me
37:03 - i
37:04 - i don't have oh i don't have well i
37:06 - don't have the music here
37:08 - boy i'm really uh hold on let's see
37:13 - uh
37:16 - give me one second to add
37:19 - i lost so many viewers in the last like
37:21 - 15
37:22 - 15 minutes
37:25 - uh audio input capture
37:27 - laptop audio
37:29 - uh does this mute it this button
37:32 - yeah that button works okay so now if i
37:35 - go here
37:39 - [Music]
37:42 - okay okay everybody here we go
37:44 - this would be much better for me to sit
37:46 - outside and do this
37:47 - again uh somebody
37:51 - if anybody is watching
37:53 - and could tell me where i last left off
37:57 - i know i could pull up discord but hey
37:59 - wait wait i can pull up discord on this
38:00 - computer
38:02 - don't worry i'm gonna get to something
38:03 - eventually
38:06 - okay discord coding train
38:09 - bot demo is that where i go
38:12 - um i guess i could go there
38:15 - um let's try that
38:22 - [Music]
38:28 - i used to be able to make discord bigger
38:30 - by doing shift command plus
38:32 - oh wait
38:35 - oh just command plus okay
38:38 - [Music]
38:42 - there we go
38:43 - ah
38:44 - it's there look at this thank you to
38:47 - kobe
38:48 - [Music]
38:49 - i am now in the coding train discord the
38:52 - bot the command is slash reading so
38:55 - um
38:56 - check where shiffman stopped last
38:58 - reading the book of random numbers
39:01 - and i need to continue reading the book
39:04 - at page one
39:06 - thank you
39:07 - life is good sometimes when your
39:08 - computer systems work
39:11 - and tell you where you last were in the
39:12 - book that you're reading
39:15 - ah yes
39:17 - okay
39:18 - page one
39:21 - you are all so nice to actually watch
39:23 - these live streams i mean if it were me
39:26 - i just have shut this off already
39:29 - i mean to be fair most of you did shut
39:31 - this off already probably or you just
39:33 - didn't bother to show up but not you
39:36 - you're watching you're the ones who are
39:37 - here and
39:40 - i love you very much
39:42 - uh page two
39:45 - page one boy i'm not very far
39:49 - wait a second seriously row two
39:52 - this entire book
39:54 - has many many many pages
39:57 - not just page one row two column zero
39:59 - all right we're gonna get further
40:01 - [Music]
40:06 - zero eight four two two
40:08 - six eight nine five three
40:11 - one nine six four five
40:13 - zero nine three oh three two three two
40:16 - zero nine zero two five six zero one
40:18 - five nine five three three four seven
40:20 - six four three five zero eight zero
40:23 - three
40:26 - all right
40:27 - so now i read a row next time and be on
40:29 - page one
40:30 - row two
40:31 - and column zero is that a thing that i
40:34 - can say
40:35 - can i uh
40:36 - can i um
40:39 - speaking of discord bots can i now say
40:42 - slash
40:43 - reading
40:45 - no a set or something
40:48 - set
40:51 - number i don't know maybe uh i guess
40:53 - i'll need uh
40:55 - oh look at this this is so cool get a
40:57 - picture of the coding train in your
40:58 - inventory i want this
41:02 - i need an id what
41:05 - come on
41:06 - come on give me my character
41:10 - too bad is thinking by the way i'm in a
41:12 - steps competition right now so it's
41:14 - really good that i'm doing this
41:16 - all right let's see we'll see if it
41:18 - comes through for me
41:22 - um
41:24 - but i love this is so much fun ah join
41:27 - the discord join the discord we're gonna
41:29 - do more oh look my inventory
41:31 - wow oh inventory uh whoops no i got one
41:35 - oh character i don't know why
41:36 - lots of stuff is happening here
41:38 - anyway um i got smile robot or kobe got
41:42 - smile robot that's exciting um
41:45 - is it on the blockchain maybe no i'm
41:47 - just nah
41:49 - did i did not say that backing away
41:50 - turning the stream off goodbye good
41:52 - night everybody thank you
41:54 - uh
41:57 - thank you and good night
41:58 - that was today's coding train live
42:00 - stream i will see you
42:02 - uh
42:04 - all right i'm back all right let's let's
42:06 - get going here let me get to segment
42:08 - number one which is reviewing
42:11 - um
42:12 - reviewing
42:15 - um
42:17 - codabot to read it for you
42:20 - reviewing recent videos so i'm gonna go
42:22 - to
42:22 - um the channel so the thing that i'm
42:25 - currently working on if i go here under
42:27 - videos what's gonna happen is it's going
42:29 - to show all my private videos which is
42:31 - fine i don't think i have that many
42:33 - let me switch to
42:35 - um
42:38 - this is so weird what's going on here
42:41 - uh
42:42 - i have this like fake not me channel
42:46 - and go to videos
42:49 - okay so but i want to see the uh no this
42:53 - is fine
42:54 - anyway
42:56 - i don't know how to do this it's so hard
42:59 - uh the most recent video that i uh
43:02 - produced which was um not particularly
43:05 - watched
43:06 - i would say
43:09 - um
43:12 - stig by the way is as making a
43:14 - suggestion in the chat which is
43:16 - something that i
43:18 - have already thought of or maybe it was
43:20 - already mentioned to me maybe stigma
43:22 - clint you you incepted this into my
43:24 - brain previously but this is this is a
43:26 - this is a project i really do want to
43:27 - make
43:29 - uh it's v related to my interest in v
43:31 - tubing but uh coming to you soon a new
43:35 - channel with just a 24 7 live stream of
43:37 - me reading random numbers
43:40 - okay um
43:42 - so uh here i am let's go to
43:46 - uh this video
43:47 - this video could have been in chapter
43:51 - one all right so um what this video is
43:53 - about
43:54 - and i think
43:55 - there's actually a better way for me to
43:57 - demonstrate what it's about is a concept
43:59 - known as scalar projection
44:02 - um and i'm actually just going to open
44:03 - up the code for it
44:05 - where
44:06 - oh that is not the right
44:10 - one
44:11 - looks like we might have a mistake
44:13 - uh let's see
44:16 - that's weird
44:18 - is that the thing that i just opened
44:20 - yeah so this is not the correct
44:23 - code example what's the other one here
44:26 - that's the angle between
44:28 - i think they might be inverted
44:31 - no they're both that so something went
44:33 - wrong
44:35 - where this is not the correct code well
44:37 - this is good for me to discover this
44:40 - um let's see scalar
44:43 - so it's that hmm
44:46 - let's go back angle between containment
44:49 - wander
44:51 - three beef lake bed path following
44:57 - well
44:58 - this i'm going to have to investigate
44:59 - somebody wants to file a github issue on
45:02 - the coding train website right now that
45:04 - was a uh un
45:06 - uh unforeseen error but i will just find
45:08 - the part in the video
45:10 - um
45:13 - where the code example happens
45:17 - and
45:20 - i think maybe it's here
45:21 - yeah so this is the example that i
45:23 - wanted to pull up where basically what's
45:26 - going on
45:27 - is
45:30 - i am taking
45:32 - a given vector right a particular vector
45:35 - that is in between uh green dot one that
45:38 - points from green dot one to green dot
45:40 - two
45:41 - and uh taking the projection of that
45:43 - onto this vector so as if there's a
45:45 - light above that second green dot and
45:48 - casting a shadow like this blue line
45:51 - this blue line is like the shadow of
45:54 - this vector onto this vector the reason
45:57 - this is incredibly important and useful
45:59 - is
46:00 - it allows us to find this normal point
46:03 - this projection point i'm calling it
46:06 - so if i want to look at the distance
46:08 - between any given point like that green
46:10 - dot over there and a line finding that
46:12 - normal the scalar projection
46:14 - using the vector dot product is a way of
46:16 - doing so the reason why i'm doing all
46:18 - this in the first place and if you watch
46:20 - the video
46:21 - that it'll do a deeper dive into it is
46:23 - that this technique is needed for path
46:26 - following if this blue line happened to
46:28 - be a path
46:30 - and the green dot happened to be your
46:33 - vehicle you need to see where it is
46:36 - relative to the path and have it steer
46:38 - towards the path so that um when
46:40 - if i do this where um and um
46:43 - pick out a few that i would like to
46:45 - address or that could lead me to adjust
46:47 - or change the example in a certain way
46:48 - did not have time to do that so i'm just
46:51 - going to kind of look and see what's
46:52 - kind of risen up here uh to the top
46:54 - based on whatever um youtube algorithm
46:57 - okay
46:58 - uh uh all right so i see a little
47:01 - message that there's some lag going on
47:04 - everything that i see is green lights
47:06 - everywhere but i do see people are
47:09 - saying it is lagging
47:11 - um okay
47:15 - weird i don't see any issues with the
47:17 - stream i see zero drop frames
47:21 - i see
47:22 - 30 frames per second
47:24 - um
47:29 - it's fine now it was a long hiccup okay
47:32 - i would like i do need to look into my
47:34 - open broadcast studio settings one thing
47:36 - i am getting is that youtube is telling
47:38 - me that my bit rate is low i'm looking
47:41 - in the obs
47:43 - stats page and it says my bit rate is
47:46 - 2674 kilobytes per second 2713 kilobytes
47:50 - per second so i don't know if that's a
47:52 - limit
47:54 - um
47:55 - to
47:56 - um my internet connection or that's a
47:59 - setting that i should change it lagged
48:01 - when i scroll down to the comments it's
48:02 - weird okay well we're back let's take a
48:04 - look
48:05 - okay
48:07 - um
48:10 - oh yeah look
48:11 - robert m oh i didn't see your comment
48:14 - i really need to be myself i mean i am
48:16 - myself but it's bothering me that i'm
48:18 - not really myself so i'm going to go
48:20 - here
48:21 - and switch to be me
48:23 - now i really am myself
48:26 - and i need to find
48:29 - the comments all right so robert m
48:31 - i want to heart this comment
48:35 - yes need to fix this
48:38 - you can also always post a note to the
48:43 - website github
48:46 - issues which would be where
48:49 - github.com codingtrain website
48:52 - and for all i know it's already there
48:55 - um
48:57 - but i don't see it here
48:59 - in an obvious place so i'm going to
49:02 - link it there
49:04 - and we might see it sooner
49:07 - okay there we go so thank you robert m
49:10 - for your wonderful comment that i'm
49:11 - reading live on the air
49:13 - uh thank you raj for the nice feedback
49:16 - um so let's read this from tmc
49:19 - you can have the option for that
49:21 - function to cap at the line segment but
49:24 - at the line segment endpoints it's
49:26 - actually more useful in navigating ai's
49:29 - to have the option of segment versus
49:32 - line oh yes okay so unfor i really wish
49:36 - i need to be able to run this example
49:38 - the whole point of me doing this is to
49:39 - be able to run the example
49:41 - there was always such fail on the coding
49:43 - train live streams hopefully it makes
49:45 - you feel good about
49:47 - how well things go in your life
49:53 - i'm looking at the time okay
49:56 - i have here's the thing i'm pretty sure
49:59 - i have a variation of this
50:03 - that's part of the nature of code
50:05 - examples
50:09 - um
50:09 - [Music]
50:11 - path following simple
50:15 - oh
50:18 - hold on
50:22 - i wanted to i wanted to do this capping
50:24 - thing because this is actually a really
50:26 - meaningful interesting comment so i'm
50:29 - i'm
50:30 - gonna allow myself
50:33 - five minutes to try to get the scalar
50:34 - projection code
50:36 - up and running okay
50:39 - 11 25 everybody say
50:41 - stop you've taken too long you've wasted
50:43 - too much time let's look for the path
50:44 - following example
50:47 - path falling path falling target ahead
50:49 - path capture path falling complex path
50:51 - path falling let's look at this for a
50:53 - second
50:54 - okay this is good so by the way this is
50:56 - the path following example
50:58 - the other thing by the way that i could
50:59 - use some uh knowledge about is
51:02 - if i were to unplug the hdmi out from
51:06 - this laptop this sketch would run at 60
51:09 - frames per second
51:10 - but because my capture card is capturing
51:13 - at 30 frames per second
51:15 - if i'm plugged in the p5 sketch will
51:18 - will cap at 30 frames per second which
51:20 - isn't that big of a deal maybe that's
51:21 - fine but it i find it unnerving that all
51:25 - of a sudden my sketch is running half
51:26 - the speed is when i programmed it so i
51:29 - don't know if there's a way for me to
51:30 - force the browser to run 60 frames per
51:32 - second even if the output is 30 frames
51:35 - per second anybody knows anything about
51:37 - that would love to hear from you
51:39 - not right now in the comments because i
51:41 - won't necessarily get it uh join the
51:43 - discord and the information can get
51:45 - passed along to me that way probably all
51:47 - right so let's make a new sketch
51:51 - and
51:51 - [Music]
51:53 - i'm going to keep this function
51:55 - i'm basically remaking that sketch
51:58 - [Music]
52:00 - and let's do have three points
52:04 - uh pause a and b
52:08 - pause is create vector
52:10 - um at like 100 100
52:14 - a is create vector
52:16 - and let's see here where am i standing
52:18 - kind of i guess i should move myself
52:20 - over a little bit
52:23 - um
52:25 - create a vector at
52:27 - um let's just try like
52:30 - 200 oh let's make this 100
52:34 - 200 200 100 and b
52:38 - create vector at
52:40 - 200
52:42 - um
52:44 - that may be like 300
52:47 - uh 300. so now let's say
52:51 - stroke weight 8
52:56 - stroke 255
52:59 - a dot x a dot y
53:03 - and let's run this sketch to make sure
53:05 - i'm seeing something
53:10 - and let's make these much bigger
53:21 - uh
53:22 - pause
53:24 - pause did i hit stop or something okay
53:26 - there we go so um
53:29 - now if i wanted to say stroke weight
53:33 - one and draw a line
53:36 - from
53:39 - pause x pause y to a dot x a dot y
53:44 - and the same thing to b
53:49 - um now
53:50 - i should be able to use this
53:52 - method find projection which is the
53:56 - function that i worked out in that video
53:59 - to say
54:00 - um
54:03 - let
54:05 - projection equal find projection
54:08 - pause a b
54:10 - and then let's draw that point
54:18 - and
54:20 - say stroke weight 2 24 again
54:24 - and
54:25 - let's make that green
54:29 - and let's move the point a around by the
54:32 - mouse a dot x is mouse x
54:35 - a dot y equals mouse y
54:36 - so i pretty much remade that example now
54:40 - what i would like to do to figure out
54:44 - is how could i have this green dot turn
54:47 - red if it is past the endpoints which is
54:51 - essentially
54:52 - me coming back to
54:54 - this comment
54:56 - have an option for that function to cap
54:58 - at the line segment endpoints more
54:59 - useful um to have the option of line
55:02 - segment versus line so uh you can easily
55:04 - search football steer further if your
55:06 - function is segment restricted when the
55:07 - ai follows a line at a distance to it
55:09 - will start to steer around the end point
55:11 - and never really find the next line in
55:12 - the path to follow yes so this is such a
55:15 - good point so the thing that i
55:17 - um have yet to really implement
55:21 - and um
55:26 - i'm going to go to this one i think i
55:29 - believe
55:30 - yeah so this is one of my examples that
55:34 - i demonstrate in the next video that
55:36 - hasn't been released yet but will be
55:37 - released today
55:38 - where these
55:40 - agents are following this path and this
55:42 - path is a series of multiple line
55:46 - segments so i need to know right see how
55:50 - the vehicles are finding that
55:51 - corresponding normal point to the path
55:55 - i need to know and
55:57 - um right see like over here they're
55:58 - finding it no i need to know
56:02 - which
56:03 - segment of the path is the one that they
56:05 - should follow so having some ability to
56:09 - understand whether the normal point to
56:12 - that line segment exists on the line
56:15 - segment or not would be useful
56:21 - um i think that lag message is just from
56:23 - before okay so hopefully the stream is
56:24 - still working fine so how do i go about
56:27 - doing this i kind of have no idea so
56:29 - let's think about this
56:31 - um
56:33 - well i could i oh this is a great chance
56:35 - for me to use my whiteboard let's
56:37 - practice that
56:39 - i'm going to come over here
56:41 - do i have a marker where did i put the
56:43 - marker do i have an eraser
56:46 - i have some tissues
56:50 - okay
56:53 - i think i want to order a new white
56:54 - board i said this before this one is
56:57 - very shaky
56:58 - and it would be great if i could get one
56:59 - that's like matte finish
57:01 - i also was thinking about getting like
57:04 - could i get like glass that i can draw
57:06 - in front of me and then we can have the
57:07 - beautiful background behind me i don't
57:08 - know if that would be visible but your
57:09 - suggestions are welcome okay so i have a
57:12 - line segment
57:15 - it's got uh
57:17 - i call it's a little bit weird i call
57:19 - these paws
57:22 - i guess i'll just use that same
57:24 - nomenclature pause a and b
57:29 - i don't know why did i
57:31 - it's a little bit we i i think there was
57:32 - a reason for why i called it these
57:34 - things in the video but i'm having
57:36 - trouble remembering that why
57:38 - and then we find this point
57:42 - so if a is over here
57:47 - we would find this point
57:49 - but that is off the line or if a were
57:52 - over here
57:53 - we would find this point
57:55 - so
57:57 - what are some things that i could do
58:00 - i could certainly look at
58:05 - i could normalize i could take
58:09 - this vector
58:11 - from pause this is called projection
58:14 - so if i take the vector from pause
58:17 - to projection
58:20 - and if it's in the opposite
58:23 - direction
58:24 - oh well
58:27 - i'm just looking for what's the easiest
58:29 - way to do this and the chat's probably
58:31 - explaining this to me i'm thinking this
58:32 - through live
58:34 - i mean
58:35 - right i know by definition i know this
58:38 - vector that's part of what i've worked
58:40 - out this vector
58:42 - so i guess i could do like
58:46 - um
58:48 - just look if they're if it's if it's in
58:50 - if it is if the angle between these two
58:52 - vectors is 180 degrees
58:56 - but this point that would not be the
58:58 - case
58:59 - i could look for the distance i know
59:03 - oh this is easy or easy-ish no
59:06 - yeah
59:07 - if i take the distance from this point
59:10 - to both b
59:12 - right if i take the distance from this
59:14 - point to a and to b and add them
59:16 - together i've got this magnitude
59:20 - but if i if it's past the line
59:22 - if i take its distance oh if it's
59:24 - distance to either one of those is
59:26 - greater than the line segment's length
59:27 - all right that's a way to do it maybe
59:29 - you have a better suggestion in the chat
59:31 - okay i thought of it right if i just
59:33 - look at this wherever this point is and
59:35 - look at its distance to this point of
59:37 - the line segment and its distance to
59:38 - this point of the line segment sorry the
59:40 - distance here and distance to here if
59:42 - one of those is greater than that length
59:45 - of the line segment it has to be past
59:47 - either side of the line segment maybe
59:49 - there's a more efficient way of doing it
59:52 - but that would certainly get me the
59:53 - result i think right i'm coming back
59:55 - here
59:56 - so let's just try that
59:58 - so in other words
59:59 - i have
60:01 - distance one is the vector distance
60:04 - between the projected point and pause
60:08 - uh this is vector distance
60:10 - distance two
60:12 - is the distance between the projected
60:14 - point and b
60:16 - and again i have to apologize for the
60:18 - weird naming i kind of
60:20 - i think i let and just making this
60:22 - example let's change the names
60:25 - um
60:27 - because i kind of would like it to be a
60:29 - b and i'm going to write the labels
60:30 - there i'm going to call this a
60:33 - b
60:34 - sorry this is going to be c
60:36 - and this is a and b
60:38 - so c is controlled by the mouse
60:42 - and
60:47 - i'm drawing a point at a b and c
60:49 - then i'm drawing the line between
60:52 - a
60:54 - and b
60:56 - and the line between a
60:59 - and c
61:01 - then find
61:02 - uh the projection point a c b
61:08 - and then
61:19 - what's going on here what did i mess up
61:23 - and me trying to make this make more
61:25 - sense
61:27 - no no
61:29 - hold on
61:34 - whoa okay
61:36 - oh dear
61:38 - projection point
61:40 - between
61:44 - no
61:45 - oh c
61:50 - oh my god
61:51 - what point to hold on i lost the track
61:53 - of what's what
61:57 - okay hold on hold on what do i want this
61:58 - to be oh it's so hard to like know how
62:00 - to do this it's very far away to get to
62:02 - this whiteboard
62:05 - okay i i was thinking it should be a b
62:08 - and this is c
62:09 - that makes more sense so i want to draw
62:12 - a line between a and c
62:14 - and a and b
62:16 - this is projection that's the projection
62:18 - point
62:19 - and then my
62:21 - uh
62:22 - my function should take a it was pause a
62:24 - b
62:27 - and yeah what what just happened this
62:29 - should work
62:37 - okay
62:38 - uh
62:41 - oh look at that okay there's an extra a
62:44 - there okay whoop
62:46 - okay a and b
62:54 - a is this one
62:56 - b is this c is this one
62:59 - there we go oh no you don't see sorry i
63:01 - forgot to press the button
63:03 - i forgot to press the button here we are
63:05 - okay i got it i got it
63:07 - and then
63:08 - the projection point sorry everybody
63:12 - oh my god it's 11 30 already no no no no
63:14 - no no oh i found whoa look at this
63:16 - interesting projection point
63:18 - what is going on
63:20 - uh
63:21 - a
63:25 - there we go
63:26 - i would i would
63:28 - i would really like to say abc but it's
63:30 - fine i'm going to live with that okay
63:31 - now
63:33 - the distance
63:36 - distance one is the projection point
63:37 - between
63:38 - projection and a distance two is the
63:41 - projection point between is the distance
63:43 - projection point and b i was going to
63:45 - label the points but now
63:48 - if i say if
63:50 - d1 is greater than
63:53 - so i have somewhere in this
63:55 - function i made this vector already
63:58 - pause a b i'm totally losing it
64:01 - uh so
64:02 - let distance equal p5 vector now i'm i'm
64:06 - not worrying about doing this
64:07 - particularly efficiently right now i
64:08 - might be able to repurpose knowing this
64:10 - distance from somewhere else in the code
64:12 - which i almost certainly do
64:14 - but if i just get the distance between a
64:16 - and b if d1 is greater than d
64:19 - or d2 is greater than d
64:24 - fill
64:24 - 255 a stroke
64:27 - red
64:29 - and then
64:31 - where is
64:33 - uh where is that
64:36 - this so and then i'm going to
64:38 - do this here
64:42 - so now
64:43 - i should yeah there we go
64:46 - if it's past the line segment it turns
64:48 - red
64:54 - if a dot b absolute value divided by the
64:57 - absolute value of a is between 0 and 1
65:00 - the projected point is on the vector b
65:03 - that makes a lot of sense now why is
65:04 - that the case let's go back to the white
65:06 - board if a
65:08 - dot b
65:12 - this this if a
65:14 - dot b
65:16 - divided by the not the absolute value
65:18 - but the the length of vector
65:21 - is between 0 and 1.
65:24 - this makes sense i have heard of this
65:26 - formula before this is familiar to me
65:29 - i've worked this out before and it's
65:30 - just not fresh in my memory right now so
65:33 - why is that the
65:34 - case uh eight let's
65:38 - it has to do with the angle between i'm
65:40 - looking for my eraser which i don't have
65:42 - one
65:46 - so
65:47 - let's think about this
65:49 - let's work out this math
65:51 - because
65:52 - okay apparently i need to lock the
65:54 - wheels of this white board
65:57 - and get an eraser
65:59 - [Laughter]
66:00 - okay
66:01 - so
66:03 - a dot b
66:05 - equals
66:09 - um
66:12 - okay well we can do it two ways a sub x
66:17 - times b sub x and this is just for two
66:19 - dimensions obviously
66:21 - plus a sub y
66:22 - times b sub y the other formula which
66:25 - uses which i'm uh neglecting which i'm
66:27 - blanking on right now which uses
66:30 - the formula
66:32 - let's find that in the nature of code
66:34 - book
66:40 - and i'm going to go to
66:43 - chapter
66:45 - 6
66:46 - dot product
66:49 - um i want to look for this is the
66:51 - formula yeah yeah okay this is the
66:53 - formula i'm looking for here the
66:55 - magnitude of a times the magnitude of b
66:56 - times cosine of the angle thank you
67:00 - um
67:06 - the magnitude of a and i don't know why
67:08 - i'm using capital letters all of a
67:09 - sudden the magnitude of a
67:11 - times the magnitude of b times cosine of
67:15 - the angle in between
67:18 - so
67:19 - if we take this
67:21 - and divide it by the magnitude of a
67:27 - we now have the magnitude of b
67:30 - times cosine of the angle between so
67:33 - this makes sense because if the angle
67:35 - between these two vectors
67:41 - is
67:43 - um
67:45 - right if
67:46 - if we go back to this drawing
67:48 - once again we're talking about this
67:50 - angle
67:51 - if this angle goes beyond
67:54 - 90 degrees
67:56 - then the projection point is going to be
67:58 - off to this direction
68:01 - or
68:02 - if the length
68:05 - right if the angle is or
68:08 - right if the angle is somewhere in here
68:11 - then it comes down to the length so if
68:13 - it's otherwise the cosine of the angle
68:15 - if it's passed is going to give you a
68:16 - negative number so you always would get
68:18 - a negative value
68:21 - or if you're getting a positive value
68:23 - then it has to do with the length
68:25 - so if the length over here is like past
68:28 - what this would be so this this is
68:30 - making sense to me
68:32 - um
68:33 - it's all back to this whole scalar
68:35 - projection thing
68:36 - right the whole pinpoint ah the whole
68:38 - point of the scalar projection oh i'm so
68:41 - silly
68:42 - i'm so silly the whole point of the
68:43 - scalar projection
68:46 - is as if i didn't record an entire video
68:48 - tutorial all about this
68:50 - that makes sense now it's uh the whole
68:53 - point of the scalar projection is it
68:55 - gives me
68:56 - this length
68:58 - so if that's a negative number it's off
69:00 - the side if that length is greater than
69:03 - the length of
69:04 - uh this vector
69:07 - yeah yeah so i don't need to do all of
69:10 - this because it's kind of built into my
69:12 - scalar projection code okay i'm going to
69:14 - leave this
69:18 - um
69:20 - uh i'm gonna leave this uh aside now
69:23 - because it's already 11 40.
69:25 - and i that's what i said 11 45 i was
69:28 - going to do a coding challenge that was
69:30 - that was a good one
69:31 - uh
69:33 - so
69:34 - you know
69:35 - this was a great rehearsal again once
69:37 - again this is a great rehearsal i'm kind
69:38 - of learning how this all works uh let's
69:41 - just uh um so thank you again for your
69:43 - comments this one definitely sparked a
69:44 - lot and uh the the path following video
69:47 - uh will
69:49 - there's there's there's a whole third
69:51 - part of the path of this sequence that i
69:52 - haven't recorded yet right there's what
69:54 - is scalar projection how do you follow a
69:57 - simple path and then how do you follow a
69:58 - complex path so this concept that we've
70:01 - been working on um
70:03 - um is definitely
70:05 - um
70:06 - is definitely relevant to that um
70:09 - uh path what uh that third part that i
70:11 - haven't recorded four minutes in i
70:12 - already have five wikipedia pages open i
70:14 - love that comment
70:16 - uh
70:17 - um okay can we learn physics this way
70:21 - you can learn the basics this way but it
70:23 - won't be enough to learn physics in
70:24 - detail this is definitely true okay
70:27 - um by the way this um so i just wanted
70:29 - to address this comment um
70:34 - i just want to say like it
70:35 - one thing you will notice here is if you
70:37 - go to the end of the video
70:41 - it's going to show you this happens from
70:43 - time to time
70:44 - as far as my release sequence
70:46 - um
70:50 - uh
70:53 - i'm reading the comments that maybe i'm
70:55 - not
70:56 - coding getting some good coding
70:58 - challenge suggestions
71:00 - um
71:01 - okay
71:03 - sponsor break reminder boy let me let me
71:05 - address what i want to address right now
71:07 - which is that um
71:10 - often the next video that i am about to
71:13 - publish is available on the channel
71:15 - before it is finished and what do i mean
71:17 - by finished
71:19 - um i use a third-party service to close
71:22 - caption my videos that often takes like
71:24 - three or four days so i have the video
71:27 - uploaded and present on the channel it
71:29 - could be the thumbnails not finished it
71:30 - could be the code examples and the
71:31 - description is not finished but just to
71:34 - have everything right and also to give a
71:37 - bonus to the coding terrain members
71:39 - that's of the people who subscribe
71:41 - to join there's like a join button
71:43 - somewhere on the channel yeah this join
71:44 - button here
71:45 - um
71:47 - uh this would this is available to um i
71:50 - often will have the video as part of the
71:51 - playlist and locked to members only so
71:54 - before it's really finished and ready
71:57 - the members can get a sneak preview of
71:58 - it also that helps me often catch errors
72:01 - so i've had members watch the sneak
72:02 - preview and be like ah there's a big
72:04 - problem here and i will then take the
72:06 - upload down fix it and re-upload much
72:08 - better to do that before it's become a
72:10 - public video
72:12 - so if i click on this
72:14 - right now
72:51 - all right i'm back
72:53 - apologies for that the
72:56 - batteries just don't last
72:59 - all right i'm gonna wait till
73:03 - uh i'm gonna wait till the chat
73:06 - figures it out
73:09 - yes you did just watch a mic die this
73:11 - keeps happening break
73:17 - okay yeah sorry about that everyone i
73:18 - don't know what i was last saying
73:21 - i was explaining
73:23 - uh so i have these rechargeable
73:24 - batteries i'm sorry that i still haven't
73:26 - corrected this they used to last for
73:28 - hours and it's going to happen again
73:30 - unfortunately this shows two bars though
73:33 - i should probably just replace it now to
73:35 - be safe
73:36 - i'm sorry about that
73:41 - i'm upgrading my equipment uh as you see
73:44 - i have a new streaming computer i have
73:46 - some new lights a new ipad uh
73:49 - guess what i didn't get
73:52 - new rechargeable batteries actually i
73:54 - kind of want to just get a new lav mic
73:56 - this lab mic i don't know if you know
73:57 - also does a lot of like rustling
73:59 - it's just one that i've had for years
74:01 - uh it might be good to get a new one if
74:03 - you have a suggestion of like what's
74:05 - top of the line i mean i don't want to
74:07 - you know i got a budget i'm working with
74:09 - here but i would like to have a very
74:10 - high quality lav mic that's wireless
74:13 - that i could use so if you have a good
74:15 - suggestion for that you could let me
74:17 - know
74:18 - i guess this is a good point
74:20 - for me to
74:22 - talk about today's sponsor
74:27 - all right everyone today's coding train
74:30 - is sponsored by
74:32 - curiositystream what's curiosity stream
74:35 - you might ask i'm going to play a little
74:36 - video for you
74:37 - from the founder of discovery channel
74:40 - comes a new independent streaming
74:42 - service
74:43 - curiosity stream
74:46 - home of groundbreaking documentaries
74:51 - and award-winning original series
74:58 - follow your curiosity
75:03 - this is curiosity stream
75:11 - all right i'm back here let's see um so
75:14 - uh this is a curiosity stream it is
75:17 - um curiosity stream is the award-winning
75:20 - destination for documentary films and tv
75:22 - shows covering every topic from space
75:23 - exploration to adventure to the secret
75:25 - lives of wild animals so the link that i
75:28 - have on the screen the one that's right
75:29 - above me right now if you sign up with
75:32 - that link you will get a 26 discount on
75:35 - the annual hd plan that's fourteen
75:38 - dollars like i love that i have this
75:39 - huge picture of levar burton here they
75:41 - actually have this wonderful series
75:42 - called beyond the spotlight which is
75:43 - about different you can see there's mr
75:45 - beast over here um
75:47 - i've been really enjoying this series
75:48 - i'm a huge levar burton fan so
75:51 - that was a uh that was a real pleasure
75:53 - to watch um i'm the magic numbers from
75:56 - um dr hannah fry this is one of my
75:58 - favorite um
76:00 - oops
76:01 - wait i pressed the wrong button no
76:04 - wait what's going on
76:06 - that's so weird
76:09 - oh it's like trying to play it through
76:10 - the monitor that's so strange
76:14 - oh look at that so my hdmi out
76:17 - you're not actually seeing what i'm
76:19 - seeing on my ipad screen because i've
76:21 - got it hooked through hdmi out it wants
76:22 - to play the series to
76:25 - the output which is at the correct
76:27 - aspect ratio which i'm not going to do
76:29 - right now i'm just going to come back to
76:30 - this
76:32 - uh you as you know i love numbers i love
76:34 - random numbers what's better than random
76:36 - numbers
76:37 - magic numbers so there are so many
76:39 - excellent
76:41 - um
76:43 - um so many excellent um documentaries
76:46 - here and award-winning original series
76:49 - now i've also talked about before how
76:52 - i'm part of a group of educational uh
76:54 - youtube creators um and we together
76:57 - started a streaming service called
76:59 - nebula
77:01 - and um if i come back to here
77:03 - um
77:05 - you know
77:06 - basically nebula has ad-free content and
77:09 - experiments with all different kinds of
77:11 - content and it's partnered with
77:12 - curiosity streams so if you sign up for
77:15 - curiosity stream using the link with the
77:17 - coupon for 14.79 for the whole year you
77:19 - will also this is not a promotion not a
77:21 - trial forever you will um also have um
77:25 - access to nebula and one of the things i
77:27 - want nebula has all these wonderful
77:28 - originals actually this bad law word's
77:31 - good i haven't gotten to watch it yet
77:32 - but i'm a big legal eagle fan on youtube
77:35 - so i'm definitely looking forward to
77:36 - checking that out um the one that i'm
77:38 - really been enjoying and i've just got
77:40 - to find it here called better elevation
77:46 - is a sort of compilation i would
77:48 - actually really like to make one of
77:49 - these it's a compilation of our series
77:52 - of different videos from different
77:53 - creators about
77:56 - next level technology and new tools to
77:58 - supercharge their production so like
78:00 - here's one from patrick williams how to
78:02 - switch how how switching codecs can
78:04 - speed up from cat black using creative
78:06 - color
78:07 - correction so like you know i'm kind of
78:09 - like a fan basically of all of these
78:11 - channels
78:12 - i hope i really adam neely has a grandma
78:14 - in creative use of 6k
78:16 - for youtube um jordan herrod one shot
78:19 - shooting saves time for the better i
78:21 - didn't know jordan made one of these
78:22 - actually i had not seen that one yet so
78:24 - um davinci resolve i gotta learn that so
78:27 - many great things so if you want access
78:30 - to these nebula originals um you can
78:33 - uh tom scott has one also
78:36 - um
78:37 - you can get it through the link so um
78:41 - it's a great way to support my channel
78:43 - uh educational content as a whole 14.79
78:46 - per year it's 26 percent off uh just go
78:49 - to curiositystream.com codingtrain i am
78:52 - hoping to make i would like to propose
78:55 - to make a nebula original at some point
78:57 - um different kind of content than the
78:58 - sort of stuff that i'm doing on youtube
79:00 - maybe something about like live
79:01 - streaming in my setup so as you can see
79:03 - i've got a lot of technical things to
79:05 - work out before i feel like i can make a
79:06 - good better elevation video but if you
79:08 - have ideas uh for what you might want to
79:10 - see from me on a streaming service like
79:12 - nebula uh please let me know okay
79:16 - so thanks uh if you've got a minute take
79:18 - the time to sign up while i take a short
79:20 - break i'm gonna switch to this ah nope
79:23 - don't have a button for that i'm gonna
79:25 - take just like a two to three minute
79:27 - break
79:28 - um
79:29 - i'm going to i still have my mic going
79:31 - i'm adding
79:33 - the
79:34 - uh
79:36 - audio input capture for the laptop audio
79:39 - which means i can play this piece of
79:42 - music
79:45 - and i will be back
79:47 - in
79:50 - just
79:51 - a few minutes to try to do i wanted to
79:53 - talk about the discord.js stuff so i'll
79:55 - address that briefly
79:57 - you are not healing in the laptop audio
79:59 - there you go and then i will
80:01 - do a sort of trial run of some kind of
80:03 - coding challenge i got two or three
80:05 - minutes to think of what i'm gonna do
80:07 - see you in a few
80:09 - [Music]
80:16 - [Music]
80:49 - [Music]
80:54 - [Music]
81:04 - [Music]
81:22 - do
81:23 - [Music]
81:30 - [Music]
81:42 - [Music]
82:03 - do
82:11 - [Music]
82:41 - [Music]
83:19 - hey isn't there like a thing that's like
83:21 - a generative art prompt for every day of
83:23 - october
83:25 - jen tober
83:27 - i feel like i saw something like that on
83:29 - twitter does anybody have that can you
83:30 - link it to me i'm looking for that right
83:32 - now maybe that's what i'll do
83:34 - back in about a minute and 30 seconds
83:41 - [Music]
83:48 - [Music]
84:00 - bye
84:03 - [Music]
85:04 - okay
85:06 - i'm back
85:08 - how's everybody doing
85:10 - um
85:12 - it is 11 55.
85:15 - thank you uh of course to curiosity
85:17 - stream for sponsoring i don't know maybe
85:20 - uh actually like my entirely like
85:23 - incompetent
85:24 - haphazard like mess of talking about a
85:28 - sponsor will actually result in the most
85:31 - what is it called when somebody clicks
85:34 - on your link
85:35 - and then they they get the thing that
85:37 - you were that you were advertising for i
85:40 - don't even know anymore
85:42 - conversions
85:44 - okay thank you curacy stream and uh
85:47 - thank you nebula and all of my friends
85:50 - who are making wonderful educational
85:51 - content all around the world um
85:55 - a chaos pendulum oh and i see stig i see
85:58 - your comment yes
86:00 - um
86:01 - okay what am i going to do
86:07 - by the way there's a wonderful three
86:08 - blue one brown video that came out and
86:10 - it was uh suggested
86:14 - uh in the rainbow topics issues i don't
86:18 - uh i i don't i need something really
86:20 - simple that i can do
86:23 - um
86:23 - [Music]
86:26 - um
86:28 - great does advent of code so there's
86:30 - something
86:31 - i'm not am i
86:35 - there's something um
86:38 - that i
86:40 - um
86:42 - saw on twitter
86:44 - uh that was a generative art prompt or
86:47 - theme or challenge for every day of
86:49 - october or is it like upcoming in
86:51 - november
86:53 - does anybody know what i'm talking about
86:58 - did i already make have i made the um
87:05 - did i already do the dinosaur game
87:09 - it's funny how i'm like oh that would be
87:10 - a good one
87:13 - coding challenge
87:15 - oh with speech commands
87:23 - what is the simple what is something
87:25 - really simple that i can do
87:28 - now
87:30 - i'm taking your dick and your
87:31 - suggestions look at inktober
87:35 - inktober
87:38 - inktober prompts okay
87:42 - but i thought this was something
87:47 - that yes inktober but there's like a
87:49 - particular variation of this
87:53 - although i could just
87:55 - use the prompt what is today the 15th
87:57 - helmet
88:01 - peggle
88:04 - peggle what is peggle
88:15 - whoa
88:17 - okay that's interesting
88:20 - um
88:25 - oh you're not see what i'm looking at i
88:27 - i'm really bad at like having the right
88:30 - screen up here
88:32 - code vember is that it
88:38 - but that's for november yeah
88:40 - yes
88:42 - oh so is this like last
88:44 - ah it hasn't no but there's something
88:46 - going on now i saw people talking about
88:48 - it on twitter but this is kind of fun
88:51 - it's not november 15 2019
88:54 - but if i clicked on this what would it
88:56 - say there is no project for this day
89:00 - [Music]
89:03 - by the way in case you're wondering i
89:04 - replaced the battery in um
89:08 - the other the mic receiver during the
89:10 - break all right this is this is not
89:12 - going very well
89:13 - um
89:16 - let's see if there's one of these that i
89:17 - could do
89:18 - wave collapse mathematical marbling
89:21 - sl oh slide puzzle perfect all right all
89:24 - right everybody
89:29 - generative inktober i like i like the
89:31 - slide puzzle idea it's done
89:33 - generative inktober
89:38 - that's from 2020
89:41 - is there one going on now
89:49 - all right we're we're doing this we are
89:52 - doing
89:54 - a coding train
89:56 - slide puzzle all right let me try to get
89:59 - out let me so
90:00 - uh and i'm going to give myself 30
90:02 - minutes
90:03 - this is going to be such a mess um
90:07 - okay so i am going to
90:11 - i should have done my spin the wheel
90:13 - thing but um
90:14 - all right so let's see i'm looking for
90:18 - the elgato application
90:21 - 4k capture utility i think that's it
90:26 - 4k devices in use by other software no i
90:30 - totally was doing this
90:32 - before do i have to run it first
90:39 - all right i have another idea
90:44 - wait why
90:50 - that's so weird i did i did this the
90:52 - other day though and i ran both
90:54 - obs and 4k capture utility you know how
90:57 - would you how would you all feel
90:59 - about me quitting obs for a second
91:03 - and seeing if i run obs second
91:07 - that'll probably work
91:09 - all right everybody
91:11 - um
91:13 - all right everybody
91:19 - all right everyone this is this is a
91:20 - little bit unorthodox
91:22 - and i deeply apologize
91:24 - i'm not turning the stream off i'm just
91:27 - going to press stop
91:29 - on open broadcast studio quit open
91:31 - broadcast studio so it'll look like your
91:33 - stream is
91:34 - broken for a moment i'm going to launch
91:36 - my 4k capture utility to hit record on
91:39 - it
91:40 - then i'm going to start obs back up
91:42 - again and see what happens okay i will
91:44 - be back
91:45 - i'm coming back i'm definitely coming
91:47 - back don't go anywhere i'll be right
91:49 - back
91:51 - okay
91:55 - okay am i back
92:02 - i think i'm back now
92:10 - um okay i uh sorry i've lost
92:15 - so much
92:17 - for example
92:19 - i have no longer have the chat open
92:26 - uh
92:27 - okay okay everybody relax i'm getting
92:29 - the chat open
92:32 - uh pop out chat there we go
92:36 - welcome to live chat okay
92:40 - all right now
92:43 - i have
92:47 - this working now i don't remember
92:51 - how do i select
92:59 - is it this button
93:01 - no
93:02 - settings must be settings
93:05 - there we go picture
93:06 - recording
93:08 - device ah one
93:12 - multiview okay
93:14 - apply
93:21 - no
93:23 - uh oh
93:26 - all right this is a
93:31 - little screen
93:36 - picture
93:43 - this is a total failure by the way
93:47 - okay
93:48 - the multi-view
93:50 - thing that
93:53 - has completely stopped working
94:03 - stream link no
94:06 - just out of curiosity
94:10 - okay
94:11 - capture device
94:14 - quad i i know you can't see what i'm
94:16 - doing here i'm very frustrated that it's
94:18 - not working because i tested this
94:20 - earlier
94:21 - it was working earlier i don't really
94:24 - need to record
94:25 - all this to disk it just would be nice
94:28 - all right i'm going to just test
94:29 - something here
94:30 - very briefly
94:34 - um
94:34 - [Music]
94:36 - so hold on a second now i'm going to go
94:39 - to
94:40 - here it's not over
94:42 - i'm going to just here for a second
94:43 - actually i'm making a new scene
94:46 - multi-view
94:49 - and then i'm going to
94:50 - [Music]
94:53 - do video capture device
94:58 - multi
95:00 - and do
95:02 - one
95:03 - there we go so this ah no signal
95:08 - no no this is fine it's this is 4k
95:11 - so i just need to
95:14 - fit to
95:16 - fit to screen there we go so this
95:20 - is
95:21 - oh and i don't know why the whiteboard
95:23 - one so i have this system
95:25 - which is set up to record
95:28 - this view of all of the feeds
95:32 - and i don't know why the whiteboard one
95:33 - now is missing
95:37 - oh because the camera went off
95:44 - okay
95:45 - so
95:52 - it's on no car did this come out
95:57 - so much technical oh there we go
95:59 - okay
96:01 - so this totally works
96:03 - i'm here
96:05 - i have
96:07 - nothing plugged into one of the ports
96:09 - which is that one
96:11 - whiteboard is over here if i walk over
96:13 - here
96:15 - now i'm over here
96:17 - and then
96:22 - laptop is over there
96:26 - so if i go back to here now i've got
96:28 - those combined
96:31 - um
96:32 - now why
96:35 - is my capture utility
96:37 - that should
96:39 - that's working
96:41 - there's no reason why i shouldn't be
96:43 - able to see all of them
96:46 - in the other
96:49 - software
96:52 - if i just hit record
96:54 - maybe it's actually recording it but i
96:56 - just don't see it
97:01 - let's see
97:04 - just bear with me i'm going to give up
97:05 - on this
97:09 - in a second
97:12 - i like that everyone's giving some
97:14 - docker help
97:15 - i like this obs challenge
97:18 - i guess i could just run two obs at once
97:21 - that might be actually my best bet
97:24 - where did it record this
97:26 - 4k capture
97:28 - test 4k
97:30 - today is 10 15 october 15th right so i'm
97:33 - opening up
97:36 - this
97:37 - video file view
97:39 - details good thing good thing i'm really
97:41 - getting this coding challenge i said i
97:43 - was going to do 5 12 p.m
97:46 - that's weird
97:49 - it's not 5 12 p.m
97:53 - okay okay clearly it's another recording
97:55 - is not working
97:56 - all right i have one other idea
98:01 - if you will just bear with me just a
98:03 - little bit longer
98:06 - um i am going to
98:11 - run a second instance
98:14 - of obs on this computer
98:19 - uh
98:20 - where
98:21 - if quick access now i don't want quick
98:23 - access
98:25 - i want to go to this pc
98:28 - and i want to go to view list i wish i
98:30 - could show i guess i could show you what
98:32 - i'm doing but
98:33 - uh where is obs
98:36 - is this in program files
98:38 - x86
98:40 - or just in obs studio is here plugins
98:43 - bin
98:44 - 64-bit
98:46 - okay obs 64. that must be what i'm
98:48 - running
98:49 - so if i just create a whole additional
98:52 - copy of it
98:54 - i need
98:57 - let's just copy it to the desktop just
99:00 - just for right now
99:02 - bear with me everybody
99:08 - copy
99:10 - paste
99:12 - okay i'm closing 4k capture utility
99:16 - thank you for bearing with me i know i
99:19 - said i had to leave at 12 30 but don't
99:21 - worry i'm gonna do something at the end
99:23 - i'm gonna make something happen here
99:25 - everybody
99:28 - now
99:29 - let's see will this actually run
99:31 - an entirely separate instance of obs
99:37 - obs is already running unless you meant
99:39 - to do this please shut down any existing
99:41 - instances before trying no i have meant
99:42 - to do this
99:46 - okay
99:48 - now
99:49 - oh what
99:50 - oh it needs to have a local
99:53 - profile
99:55 - okay hold on
99:58 - multiview oh this is working
100:02 - okay hold on
100:04 - how do i tell obs i've done this before
100:07 - i really should have done this before i
100:09 - started
100:11 - but i want to make this work i really
100:12 - want to make this work you could go you
100:14 - could do something else with your day
100:15 - it's fine i totally understand
100:17 - i totally understand this is going to
100:19 - help us out for next week or the week
100:21 - after the fact that i'm taking the time
100:23 - to do this now it's very hard to find
100:25 - time otherwise
100:28 - all right let's look there's a way like
100:30 - there is um
100:31 - run multiple
100:34 - instances of obs local
100:37 - like with separate
100:40 - like profiles or something
100:43 - um i've done this before
100:45 - um
100:46 - desktop shortcut properties
100:52 - okay
100:52 - is this what i'm
100:55 - um
100:58 - two instances with different settings is
100:59 - what i'm trying to do from 2019.
101:05 - yeah but i i can load
101:09 - okay
101:14 - uh okay
101:15 - portable mode portable mode that's what
101:17 - i want to do portable mode
101:21 - although maybe i can actually just use a
101:22 - different profile
101:27 - because there are profiles let's see if
101:28 - i try another profile
101:31 - uh so i'm going to do a make a 4k
101:34 - profile
101:36 - optimize for recording
101:40 - use
101:42 - uh
101:43 - no no no base canvas i want a custom how
101:46 - do i have a custom canvas
101:50 - i want it to be
101:54 - 3840
101:56 - by 2160.
102:00 - base canvas is not giving me that as an
102:02 - option
102:11 - that's so weird
102:12 - i mean like
102:16 - 30.
102:19 - all right let's just
102:22 - do this right now
102:29 - so profile oh whoops oh no is it
102:38 - so weird
102:42 - um
102:44 - people are probably telling me things in
102:45 - the chat let me let me get the chat open
102:48 - here
102:53 - i'm going to give myself some extra time
102:57 - all right i've got the members live chat
103:00 - open here now whoops
103:04 - nothing nothing there okay hold on let
103:05 - me look at the youtube chat
103:11 - coding challenge
103:13 - okay
103:14 - okay
103:15 - all right i don't all right i want to do
103:16 - the portable thing
103:18 - so i need to do this portable thing
103:20 - so i need to run obs
103:23 - i think it was actually telling me this
103:25 - shortcut
103:30 - uh
103:33 - oh i saw this i saw this where's the
103:34 - portable
103:40 - command line parameter dash dash
103:42 - portable okay i think i know how to do
103:44 - this so if i create a shortcut
103:49 - i can add a command line argument in
103:51 - windows i believe so i'm going to the
103:53 - desktop
103:57 - oh my goodness
104:00 - um no i don't want this quick access
104:02 - thing is not helping me
104:04 - i don't want quick access
104:08 - i want to see my computer
104:10 - all the files
104:12 - what the hey-ho
104:17 - how do i get out of this windows quick
104:19 - access thing there we go this pc thank
104:22 - you
104:24 - users
104:26 - daniel
104:27 - desktop obs studio
104:30 - bin 64-bit i know i'm
104:33 - a create shortcut i wish i could show
104:35 - you what i'm doing because this is very
104:36 - exciting create shortcut now i'm going
104:39 - to put that shortcut on the desktop
104:42 - then i'm going to hit properties
104:44 - and it has a target
104:47 - obs 64
104:50 - exe shortcut key run
104:53 - can i just write in windows
104:57 - can i just do dash dash
105:02 - dash dash portable
105:06 - um
105:07 - just in the start in or just in their
105:09 - target
105:11 - in the windows shortcut i was like
105:13 - space dash dash
105:16 - portable
105:17 - okay apply
105:19 - let's see if this works
105:22 - it worked
105:24 - it worked everybody i have an entirely
105:26 - separate instance of obs
105:28 - going optimize for recording
105:35 - base canvas all right hold on i'm gonna
105:37 - get out of this auto configuration
105:39 - wizard
105:40 - uh
105:42 - so obs
105:44 - base canvas resolution where do i set
105:47 - that
105:50 - well i guess i could probably find a
105:51 - canvas size
105:53 - um
105:55 - all right i bet you i can find this i'm
105:57 - just going to go to settings no not
105:59 - studio mode
106:01 - settings
106:03 - uh output
106:06 - simple advanced no video
106:09 - base canvas here we go
106:12 - why does it not give me that as an
106:14 - option
106:17 - okay this is so crazy
106:22 - i've never had this problem before
106:28 - all right
106:29 - so like what what the issue i have 4k
106:32 - based canvas
106:34 - open broadcast
106:36 - studio
106:44 - well let's see here this is pretty
106:46 - recent
106:47 - this is the resolution it's missing
106:56 - settings
107:01 - you need you can now type the resolution
107:04 - manually
107:06 - oh was it gonna let me type it manually
107:09 - oh i could just type over it
107:12 - it has a drop down menu
107:15 - but it's not an option in the drop down
107:17 - menu but i could just type over it okay
107:20 - 3840 by two one six zero is that right
107:25 - and then the output resolution should be
107:26 - three four zero okay
107:28 - 30 frames per second
107:31 - okay
107:32 - now uh settings
107:35 - output
107:38 - um
107:39 - video
107:41 - output
107:42 - oh
107:43 - mp4
107:45 - apply
107:47 - uh add
107:49 - a
107:50 - video capture device
107:54 - create new okay this is uh
107:57 - i'm going to call it multi
108:00 - and then i'm going to grab cam link pro
108:04 - 1 multi-view
108:06 - which should be 4k perfect
108:09 - i'm in business everybody i'm in
108:11 - business
108:12 - and i have the mic
108:14 - so it's going to record the mic
108:16 - but i'm going to
108:18 - change
108:19 - the properties to mono
108:22 - advanced audio properties
108:25 - uh
108:26 - make it mono
108:29 - so now i have an entirely separate okay
108:32 - so just in case you're following along i
108:35 - mean all like
108:37 - three of you that are left i can't see
108:39 - who's here i can see the chat but i've
108:41 - lost all my other like control panels
108:44 - um
108:47 - i now have
108:48 - um
108:49 - two instances of obs running one
108:52 - instance is the one that is live
108:55 - streaming right now it is not recording
108:57 - anything to disk it could be recording
108:59 - to disk but it's not and it has all the
109:02 - different views that is like tied to my
109:06 - uh nice little uh stream deck here
109:10 - so i can switch and go to just this view
109:13 - or this view or this view et cetera and
109:15 - i totally messed up the whiteboard in
109:16 - the camera but that's up and of course
109:18 - the camera goes off
109:21 - oh what excellent timing okay hold on
109:24 - everybody
109:26 - about two hours in this always seems to
109:28 - happen
109:29 - this coding challenge might not happen
109:31 - but i'm making progress people
109:33 - you might not see it or believe it
109:36 - this is plugged in so it's not the
109:37 - battery
109:39 - oh it's like it's actually losing
109:42 - its charge i think i probably should
109:44 - take the battery out it's kind of crazy
109:45 - how this is plugged in
109:48 - and yet
109:51 - is this not
109:54 - yeah it's plugged this camera is plugged
109:56 - in and yet the full battery is now at
109:59 - half charge
110:02 - who knows why
110:04 - okay
110:06 - and then i have a separate obs and you
110:08 - know what uh i'm just gonna
110:11 - uh i'm just so this the other obs in
110:14 - case you're wondering
110:15 - looks like this
110:17 - so the other obs looks like this
110:19 - actually in 4k what you're seeing is not
110:21 - in 4k i have sampled it back down
110:24 - and so as soon as i hit start recording
110:29 - i am now recording all of these separate
110:31 - feeds to disk
110:33 - at the same time
110:35 - as live streaming this this is actually
110:37 - by the way what i have done previously
110:41 - just uh not at the same time so i have
110:44 - with members of the coding train when i
110:46 - record a new video i live stream the
110:49 - actual 4k layout while i'm recording but
110:52 - now i have the possibility in theory if
110:54 - this works
110:55 - of both live streaming
110:59 - uh and recording all of these feeds to
111:01 - disk so that whatever i do during the
111:04 - live stream could be re-edited and
111:06 - things could be like
111:08 - mixed and matched in different ways if
111:09 - necessary into a video so
111:16 - let's try a coding challenge let's try a
111:19 - slide puzzle now if i'm being perfectly
111:21 - honest um i have a feeling that this is
111:24 - not going to go well i'm probably not
111:26 - going to make it work or finish this or
111:28 - end up editing this into a separate
111:30 - video so this is just a trial run no
111:32 - pressure i would really like to do this
111:34 - as a coding challenge video so consider
111:36 - this a rehearsal
111:38 - i mean the point of the coding challenge
111:39 - videos is to not rehearse but it might
111:41 - that just might have to happen now i
111:43 - also would like to give myself a timer
111:46 - and i'm i'm just going to send a text
111:48 - message to explain that i'm going to be
111:50 - a little bit late
111:51 - i don't know where my phone is here it
111:53 - is because i need to give myself an
111:55 - extra 30 minutes here
111:57 - um
112:00 - oh awesome
112:03 - need uh 30 more minutes
112:10 - so 1pm i'm going to turn into a pumpkin
112:15 - at 1 pm i'm turning into a pumpkin i
112:17 - really should check that this is
112:18 - recording to disk
112:19 - all right i'm just going to hit stop
112:22 - i'm just going to hit stop recording to
112:23 - disk i'm just going to look at the file
112:25 - very briefly i mean if it's not working
112:27 - i'm not doing the setup anymore i'm just
112:29 - going to go into the coding challenge
112:30 - but i would like to know if it's working
112:33 - videos
112:35 - today is october 15th here is the file
112:40 - um
112:41 - i think it looks good
112:44 - it looks like there might be some
112:45 - choppiness to the frame rate
112:48 - i think i know why that is
112:51 - and i'm not going to worry about it
112:52 - right now
112:53 - and i will deal with fixing that later i
112:55 - have an idea for a way of doing this
112:57 - better but i'm just going to record
112:58 - again so now once again i'm recording
113:00 - the disk i have live streaming
113:02 - i'm going to close
113:05 - all of these things out
113:07 - we're going to say
113:09 - slide puzzle
113:11 - this is actually really good because i
113:13 - do have a coding challenge video that
113:15 - has been recorded that hasn't come out
113:17 - yet about the copy function and i think
113:19 - i need to use the copy function for this
113:21 - tim rhodenbrecker
113:25 - let me just introduce you
113:27 - to the most
113:29 - patient
113:30 - person in the world
113:32 - tim
113:34 - i'm going to accept i accept all of your
113:36 - cookies please send me cookies i love
113:38 - cookies actually if you uh vegan cookies
113:41 - please if possible it's just kind of
113:43 - like the non-dairy thing i mean eggs i
113:44 - do eat eggs anyway we don't need to get
113:46 - into that
113:47 - but um
113:49 - no one's sending me cookies who am i
113:50 - kidding
113:52 - you should check out um tim
113:54 - rodenbrooker's and i'm apologies if i'm
113:56 - mispronouncing the name
113:58 - um website
114:00 - live streams videos creative coding
114:02 - stuff um tim gave a donation to the
114:04 - processing foundation last year's
114:06 - holiday fundraiser i am still a half to
114:08 - the end i have until the day of the next
114:10 - holiday fundraiser to finish releasing
114:13 - the videos based on those donations this
114:15 - one is recorded tim i like probably owe
114:17 - you an email from like six months ago if
114:19 - you're listening uh please everybody
114:21 - check out
114:22 - tim's wonderful work and stay tuned this
114:25 - video is coming out of the coding train
114:26 - about the copy function
114:28 - um
114:30 - okay
114:31 - um
114:32 - so now
114:34 - now that i did that little ad for tim
114:37 - uh i need uh a
114:40 - um
114:41 - i need an image
114:43 - to do as the slide puzzle
114:46 - all right i guess we're gonna use
114:48 - the coding train train
114:51 - and um
114:56 - coding train train
114:58 - i must have that somewhere let me just
115:01 - i'm going to go into my google drive for
115:03 - a second oh let's we could use choo choo
115:05 - bot i love choo choo bot choo choo bot
115:07 - is like one of my favorite coding
115:09 - trained character
115:11 - so oh you gotta be kidding me you don't
115:14 - need to make me put in my password right
115:16 - now i've got a time
115:18 - time limit here folks it's 12 30 already
115:21 - all right it's got to be on
115:26 - choo choo bot png
115:29 - perfect
115:33 - well
115:34 - okay
115:38 - i'm showing you so i'm gonna go back to
115:39 - um
115:40 - this is the choo choo bot
115:46 - and
115:48 - so the good news about like doing this
115:50 - kind of thing where i'm recording
115:51 - everything to disc if i forget to switch
115:53 - to the right feed like i have all that
115:55 - material
115:57 - so even if it's sort of messed up in the
115:58 - live stream you can repackage it later
116:00 - to be better so choo choo bot
116:03 - i kind of want to do this in processing
116:04 - but i'll do this in p5
116:08 - so i just need to upload choo choo bot
116:12 - upload file
116:13 - where is this file can i like see it
116:16 - show in finder
116:18 - i'm just gonna do save save as okay
116:22 - choo choo bot
116:24 - on the
116:26 - desktop uh let's just keep it a png
116:31 - well those are some loud birds
116:38 - uh
116:40 - whoops okay
116:41 - uh
116:48 - okay what is this
116:50 - what's the size of this file by the way
116:52 - 400 by 400 perfect couldn't be more
116:55 - perfect
116:58 - okay so i just want to before i begin
117:00 - the coding challenge
117:09 - i'm going to make a variable called
117:11 - source
117:13 - and source is going to load image
117:16 - ch
117:18 - choo choo
117:20 - bot.png
117:24 - and i don't need this open anymore which
117:26 - will give me more room for the code
117:29 - um we're going to just draw we don't
117:32 - need draw right now
117:34 - well i mean we do need draw right now
117:35 - i'm just going to draw the image
117:41 - source zero zero
117:48 - what did i do wrong here
117:50 - oh yeah choo choo but
117:59 - choo choo
118:00 - up
118:02 - can i just rename it here
118:04 - choo choo bot
118:12 - okay
118:14 - okay everybody so one thing though that
118:17 - i think that i might try to be mindful
118:18 - of
118:19 - if the idea is to actually repurpose
118:21 - this is to not do a lot of my own
118:23 - zooming because now that can happen
118:25 - better in post-production
118:28 - uh
118:31 - okay
118:32 - um okay everybody
118:38 - yes there we go ready everyone do their
118:40 - spread
118:43 - okay by the way i have the discord
118:46 - member live chat going on here so i can
118:49 - see that here and i have the youtube
118:51 - chat over here this is actually a really
118:52 - good way of doing it
118:54 - and incidentally i suppose
118:57 - i mean i don't want to this is a way
118:58 - that i could actually show what's
119:00 - happening in discord on the live stream
119:02 - by switching over to it but i don't want
119:03 - to do that right now because
119:05 - i guess i could go to like uh yeah
119:06 - anyway
119:07 - um okay so
119:13 - slide puzzle where's my timer
119:16 - i'll do a timer
119:19 - on my phone
119:26 - okay
119:27 - clock
119:29 - timer
119:32 - 30 minutes this is
119:36 - 30 minutes okay i'm going to try to make
119:39 - a slide puzzle in 30 minutes you won't
119:41 - be able to see the timer i'm sure we
119:43 - could create some type of better system
119:46 - for doing this that would be ah the
119:47 - camera no no not the camera
119:52 - not the camera
119:54 - jeez louise people
119:57 - what if i take the battery out would
119:58 - that help
120:02 - it's plugged in
120:04 - are you overheating
120:10 - why why do you go off
120:16 - you look you've got you're plugged in
120:18 - you've got a charge
120:22 - i see no reason for you to turn yourself
120:24 - off camera
120:26 - all right
120:28 - i don't wanna i guess i'm just gonna
120:29 - have to like reset you and i have to
120:31 - like walk half a mile around
120:34 - to get back to my desk area here
120:37 - okay everybody
120:40 - okay stop i haven't started the timer
120:42 - yet ready everybody
120:47 - welcome folks to a coding challenge i
120:50 - haven't done one of these in a while i'm
120:51 - gonna set myself a timer here 30 seconds
120:55 - 30 seconds oh my god 30 minutes
120:58 - and i'm going to attempt to make a slide
121:00 - puzzle so this is the source image that
121:03 - i'm going to use i need to chop it up
121:04 - into a bunch of pieces
121:06 - allow you to like click to move the
121:08 - pieces around and see if you could solve
121:10 - it to put it back together and have
121:12 - something detect when it's put back
121:14 - together that it works there's almost no
121:16 - chance that i'm going to get this done
121:18 - in 30 minutes but
121:20 - you know
121:23 - c'est la vie here i go
121:25 - all right so one of the things that we
121:27 - need to use that i need to use for this
121:29 - is the copy function
121:30 - because what i want to do first is just
121:32 - take this image and chop it up into a
121:34 - bunch of smaller images so let me call
121:37 - those
121:38 - uh the pieces and i'll make an array
121:42 - and then in setup
121:44 - uh and i should figure out how many
121:46 - columns and rows that i want so let's
121:48 - just make it it's right now it's a 400
121:51 - by 400 so let's just make it four by
121:53 - four
121:56 - um and so
121:57 - the um and i also i'm going to probably
121:59 - want to keep track of like the width and
122:01 - height of each piece
122:03 - i probably should do this in like an
122:04 - object-oriented way where there's like
122:06 - class piece and but
122:08 - that's not happening right now
122:10 - um
122:11 - so we i'm going to say
122:14 - uh
122:15 - 4 let i equal 0 i is less than the
122:18 - number of columns
122:22 - and then
122:25 - j
122:26 - is less than 0 j less than the number of
122:29 - rows
122:33 - and then
122:36 - w o w is the width of the canvas
122:41 - divided by the number of columns h is
122:44 - the height of the canvas divided by the
122:45 - number of rows
122:48 - okay
122:49 - and then
122:51 - for each one of these i need to make a
122:53 - new image or the new the image is a
122:55 - piece of the larger image
122:58 - i'm going to turn off auto refresh for a
123:00 - second so i need to take the source
123:03 - image and copy from it
123:06 - oh i think i could just use get i'm
123:08 - really obsessed with the idea of using
123:09 - copy because hopefully by the time this
123:11 - video comes out there will be an entire
123:13 - video all about the copy function and
123:15 - processing in p5 let's look at the
123:17 - reference
123:21 - um
123:23 - oh i know i remember i think i remember
123:24 - how copy works but maybe i could just
123:26 - use get
123:30 - because get
123:32 - i believe
123:36 - it returns an array of rgba values which
123:38 - is not what i want i want an actual like
123:40 - image i want a sub image
123:43 - p5 image oh so
123:45 - array of sub image from a p5 image yeah
123:48 - that's what this is
123:51 - well i i maybe copy is what i want i
123:54 - know copy will work um
123:57 - in the sense that i can copy from this
124:00 - image onto this image let's use copy
124:03 - so this is fine i'm going to use copy
124:05 - because i know it's going to work and
124:06 - the first thing i'll do is create a
124:08 - blank image
124:12 - that is
124:14 - the size of one of the pieces
124:16 - i really want to use the whiteboard just
124:18 - because i have a whiteboard
124:20 - this is going to take up too much time
124:21 - i've got 26 minutes left but if you
124:23 - don't mind humoring me for a second i'm
124:25 - gonna go over here to oh and i'm gonna
124:27 - have to erase the whiteboard that's
124:28 - gonna take quite a bit of time
124:31 - and i i don't have an eraser i'm in a
124:33 - new space this is the first this is
124:35 - momentous this is the first coding
124:36 - challenge
124:37 - in my new space this whiteboard it rolls
124:40 - around
124:41 - it's very shaky i put it together myself
124:44 - it did a terrible job putting it
124:45 - together i hope this is all recording i
124:47 - need to find a marker
124:49 - okay this is great oh i feel i feel
124:51 - alive
124:53 - oh this
124:57 - okay
124:58 - so the idea here is i have a source
125:00 - image
125:03 - and what i first want to do is on my
125:05 - canvas
125:09 - i want to take
125:10 - i'm going to chop this up one two three
125:13 - one two three into four by four and i
125:16 - want to take this section of the image
125:19 - and place it on the canvas but keep this
125:21 - as a separate variable like a piece so
125:24 - that these pieces
125:26 - can be locked to a part of the original
125:28 - oh i really need it i just need a knot
125:30 - i'm going to i got to do this object
125:31 - oriented right because the piece should
125:34 - know where its home base is as well as
125:36 - where it currently is so if they're
125:38 - being shuffled when all the pieces are
125:39 - in the right place we've won so what do
125:42 - i need to make a class
125:44 - a piece class
125:46 - that has the um
125:50 - it's like cur it's like a current index
125:54 - like if i number all these zero one two
125:56 - three four five six seven blah blah blah
125:58 - blah i wanna keep track of where it
126:00 - currently is
126:01 - as well as
126:02 - um
126:03 - [Music]
126:05 - as well as where it's original spot it's
126:07 - it's home bases so we know when the
126:08 - puzzle solved all right let's let's do
126:10 - that it's worth it it'll be worth it
126:14 - how's this going
126:16 - uh all right
126:18 - um i'm looking at the chat okay
126:22 - let's see um now
126:24 - so let me i gotta open this up here i'm
126:27 - gonna make a new javascript file and i'm
126:29 - going to call it piece.js
126:31 - tile it's probably tile is what they are
126:33 - right let's call it
126:35 - tile.js
126:37 - so i have a tile class
126:40 - and
126:41 - what does it have in it
126:43 - it has
126:44 - the index
126:49 - so i'm going to pass that in as an
126:50 - argument and
126:52 - it has its image
126:58 - okay so i mean there's probably more to
127:01 - do with this but i'm basically just want
127:03 - to wrap the idea of the image's piece
127:05 - and where it's supposed to be in to this
127:08 - constructor okay good here we go uh so
127:11 - now what i'm actually doing is i'm still
127:13 - creating the image
127:14 - then i'm saying copy
127:17 - uh
127:18 - what am i copying i'm copying from the
127:20 - source
127:22 - zero zero oh no no no no
127:25 - the in the source the x location is i
127:28 - times the width
127:30 - the y location is j times
127:33 - h
127:34 - and i'm copying from the source
127:37 - i
127:38 - j with height
127:40 - 2
127:41 - 0 0 with height so if this is confusing
127:44 - to you
127:46 - thank goodness i have a white board even
127:48 - though my lighting needs to be fixed and
127:50 - there's so many issues but let me
127:52 - explain what's going on here right
127:55 - each one of these pieces
127:58 - is an image i didn't switch the button
128:00 - but that's okay because i'm recording it
128:02 - all but i'm running over here there now
128:03 - at least you can see it if you're
128:04 - watching this live
128:06 - each one of these pieces is a standalone
128:08 - image where this is zero zero and its
128:11 - height is with an h but if i'm copying
128:14 - this one
128:15 - and it's
128:17 - column two
128:19 - row one boy this is like so messy this
128:21 - whiteboard but that's fine um then
128:24 - basically i need to know what is this
128:25 - location this location is column times
128:28 - width
128:30 - height
128:31 - row times height and then so take this
128:34 - section and copy it to this part of the
128:35 - piece
128:39 - all right so now
128:42 - um and i think this is right right it's
128:44 - um
128:46 - it should be the source image source x
128:49 - source y source to the destination
128:52 - so
128:54 - um
128:56 - it doesn't show you calling this on an
128:58 - image but that's fine
129:00 - that's what i'm doing i want to copy the
129:02 - source image at this location to this
129:05 - destination which is image at this
129:07 - location great then i need to make a
129:11 - a tile is a new tile with an index oh
129:14 - the camera went off the camera went off
129:16 - it's just it's like just like the old
129:18 - days nothing has changed on the cutting
129:20 - trade doesn't matter how many years i do
129:22 - this
129:23 - i have to reset the camera it's part of
129:24 - the time
129:28 - why why it's plugged in you're plugged
129:30 - in there's no reason for your power to
129:32 - go dark
129:34 - okay
129:35 - i have to run
129:36 - this is good i'm gonna get so many steps
129:38 - for my steps challenge okay um
129:41 - index and then the image now what is the
129:44 - index
129:46 - the index
129:48 - is the uh i'm not going to use any
129:50 - two-dimensional arrays here i'm just
129:52 - going to keep track of um the the the
129:56 - individual index counting zero one two
129:58 - three four five six seven eight nine ten
130:00 - eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen
130:01 - zero three fifteen sixteen total tiles
130:05 - uh press this button so the index
130:09 - is i
130:10 - plus j times the number of columns
130:14 - um
130:16 - and
130:17 - the so that's a new tile
130:19 - and then i should be able to
130:24 - let's just put let's call this tiles
130:28 - let's just put all the tiles into an
130:30 - array
130:33 - just out of curiosity now
130:37 - let me loop through that array
130:42 - and
130:44 - uh say
130:48 - and actually you know what might be good
130:50 - this is just gonna make my life so much
130:52 - easier i'm gonna keep track of the index
130:55 - the column
130:57 - and the row
130:59 - because i actually just want to give it
131:00 - its
131:03 - uh well no because it's going to move
131:05 - around
131:06 - i don't know what i'm doing right now
131:08 - let's do
131:10 - ah okay i have an idea
131:13 - let's make let's make a variable called
131:15 - board
131:16 - so this is the board the board is an
131:18 - array of all of the elements in the
131:20 - order that they're in
131:22 - so um
131:25 - and i'm gonna eventually need to put a
131:26 - negative one for the empty one but
131:29 - um
131:31 - so board
131:34 - push index
131:35 - so basically i'm gonna have an array
131:38 - that keeps track of the positions of all
131:41 - of the tiles
131:43 - and then
131:47 - this is a little bit silly but i'm going
131:49 - to do it this way
131:50 - i'm gonna i'm gonna just always use a
131:52 - nested loop just to get that index
131:55 - and then i'm going to say board
131:57 - index
132:00 - uh
132:01 - um
132:02 - i guess show so let me just do
132:04 - uh
132:06 - yeah which why would make sense to keep
132:08 - track of uh you know what
132:11 - uh
132:13 - this is a little bit weird what i'm
132:14 - doing
132:18 - okay
132:21 - i have to think i have to think i have
132:22 - to think i have to think
132:24 - just you know
132:25 - rain going churning
132:28 - i have 18 minutes left this is wonderful
132:30 - oh so much time
132:32 - so much time
132:35 - ah my by the way this this came alive
132:37 - the uh stream deck buttons
132:39 - uh now now there's the coding coding
132:41 - train discord and there's 205 of you
132:43 - supposedly watching this right now all
132:45 - right um
132:47 - okay
132:48 - let me think about this for a second let
132:50 - me be a little bit more thoughtful here
132:59 - i was trying to avoid using a
133:01 - two-dimensional array
133:02 - but maybe that's silly
133:05 - so
133:08 - ah yes so i want to have this array
133:10 - which i'm going to call board
133:12 - and it's going to have like it'll be
133:15 - all of the numbers shuffled in random
133:17 - order so as i go through
133:20 - i yes i draw the image
133:23 - at that spot
133:25 - like the zero spot what the zero spot
133:28 - would be x and y but i go look up
133:32 - image
133:33 - three or index three from my uh array of
133:37 - all the tiles i don't know if that made
133:39 - sense
133:40 - to you
133:41 - but i had to walk over to the whiteboard
133:42 - to sort of think through that in other
133:44 - words x is this is exactly what i'm
133:47 - doing
133:49 - x is i times w y is j times h
133:53 - and then the image i want to draw is
133:55 - board
133:56 - index
133:58 - well it's not yeah board
134:01 - uh
134:02 - is it's actually like tiles board
134:06 - index i mean this is like a crazy way to
134:08 - write it but i basically want the number
134:10 - the index that's in the array called
134:13 - board to tell me which tile to look up
134:16 - so
134:18 - so this is tile i'll call it like tile
134:21 - index or
134:25 - i think this might be a nice way of
134:26 - writing it right now they'll be in order
134:28 - because i haven't shuffled it right i'm
134:30 - putting them all in order and then i
134:31 - should be able to say image image
134:34 - x comma y
134:37 - so i'm hoping that when i run this
134:39 - sketch i'm going to identically see the
134:42 - image because the only things that i've
134:44 - done is chop it up into a bunch of tiles
134:47 - put those tiles in order
134:50 - no
134:51 - i should just
135:01 - i don't like does anybody know this is a
135:03 - sony alpha seven it doesn't just go off
135:07 - after a certain amount of time because
135:09 - it's obviously been on
135:11 - it was on for the whole first hour of
135:13 - the stream
135:14 - without going off and now it just keeps
135:16 - going off um
135:18 - right and lucas is saying in the chat
135:20 - that i could do index modulus columns y
135:24 - index divided by columns i don't know
135:25 - why i'm like for some reason i that math
135:27 - like hurts my brain i was like i'm doing
135:30 - i'm doing all this like gymnastics to
135:32 - avoid doing that but that would
135:34 - certainly make a lot of sense
135:36 - all right what i want to say is when i
135:37 - run this
135:39 - i chopped up the image put them into an
135:42 - array in order
135:44 - and then i'm going and getting them one
135:46 - at a time and showing
135:48 - them
135:50 - all right what happened
135:52 - there's an errors copy could not be
135:54 - called as a function
135:56 - create image was expecting a string
136:01 - oh oh am i supposed to do create
136:04 - imedge yeah so i think i did the dom
136:06 - image element by accident
136:10 - tile is not defined oh so no problem
136:13 - no problem yep tile.js that's a file i'm
136:17 - working with
136:18 - thank you very much
136:22 - uh
136:24 - failed to execute draw load
136:27 - pixels hmm
136:32 - all right hold on
136:34 - let's just do create
136:36 - okay p5 reference
136:44 - uh
136:47 - yeah create image load picks maybe i
136:48 - just need to call load pixels i thought
136:50 - to do copy i don't need to but i must
136:54 - oh and all sorts of weirdness happened
136:56 - here
136:57 - and then let's do like image update
137:00 - pixels
137:02 - let's try that
137:06 - signature not supported what is going on
137:14 - what just happened
137:18 - what
137:30 - signature not supported
137:34 - what is going on
137:35 - well let me take this out
137:50 - okay
137:51 - the sketch is running
137:55 - uh
137:56 - let's do this one okay uh
137:59 - okay we're good
138:02 - create image
138:07 - load pixels
138:10 - oh wait it's source that i need to load
138:12 - pixels
138:14 - i need to load the pixels from source
138:18 - but what is this signature not
138:22 - supported
138:29 - did i forget to say like rgb here i
138:31 - don't think that usually matters
138:50 - copy oh like
138:52 - i guess like the way that i am
138:57 - okay i'm just gonna google copy i'm sure
138:59 - that is a path towards me solving this
139:01 - problem
139:03 - no not right now
139:14 - i've totally done this
139:16 - is is this why i switched to processing
139:18 - in my other video
139:22 - checkline 25 parameters are wrong i know
139:25 - uh oh look at this i deleted some stuff
139:28 - ah i when i was like mucking around some
139:31 - stuff got deleted i need all those
139:32 - numbers all those numbers and i want to
139:35 - sort copy it from x comma y
139:38 - yikes
139:40 - okay
139:43 - i don't need this rgb thing
139:46 - okay now we're getting somewhere
139:49 - uh i don't know if i need all these load
139:51 - pixels and update pixels
139:54 - still good
139:56 - okay everybody
140:00 - oh
140:03 - hold on
140:05 - oh image equals tile dot image so i need
140:08 - to pull the image property out of the
140:10 - tiles
140:15 - no okay
140:19 - update pixels copy
140:22 - all right
140:22 - [Music]
140:25 - hold on
140:28 - tiles oh hold on let's take a look at
140:30 - what's going on here
140:35 - how do i find the uh
140:38 - must be this
140:43 - usually this lets me
140:48 - find and like log the
140:56 - right now this is like ah there we go
140:58 - all right so tiles
141:03 - there is
141:07 - okay so let's console.log
141:10 - tile index
141:15 - um
141:20 - the camera went off again yeah it's got
141:22 - to be overheating which is weird
141:28 - this one doesn't seem to be overheating
141:30 - i should switch cameras
141:33 - it's on the same amount of time it did
141:35 - go off at one point
141:38 - i told you this would be
141:40 - a total fail this year i camera keeps
141:43 - going off then i got stuck on a weird
141:44 - bug
141:51 - okay
141:52 - um let's look at the uh let me put no
141:55 - loop in here
141:57 - oh i have eight minutes left nine
141:58 - minutes left
142:00 - okay so all those numbers came out
142:02 - okay
142:04 - so am i getting an image
142:11 - so there's an image
142:19 - where's the x and y
142:23 - those are the right locations
142:29 - let's take out all these like
142:31 - load pixels and update pixels
142:35 - ah
142:37 - so somehow
142:40 - load was it load pixels and update
142:42 - pixels
142:43 - very much unnecessary
142:47 - do i need this one yeah okay i didn't
142:49 - need any of the low pixels and update
142:50 - pixels there's a little bit of a mystery
142:52 - here i definitely want to use the pixels
142:57 - but i have a feeling
142:59 - that and sometimes when you need access
143:01 - to the pixel array directly you've got
143:03 - to like in advance load the pixels and
143:05 - when you change the pixel array you have
143:07 - to update the pixels i have a feeling
143:08 - here copy is doing the work for us so
143:12 - we're good now you might not believe me
143:14 - now this is actually showing it as
143:16 - separate tiles now let me let me prove
143:18 - this
143:19 - by
143:20 - um
143:21 - trying to think of like by just drawing
143:23 - some lines over it
143:26 - um
143:26 - this is going to be a slightly awkward
143:28 - way of doing it
143:29 - but let me just do stroke weight
143:32 - two
143:33 - no fill
143:35 - oh but this is silly i'm just drawing
143:37 - the lines for
143:39 - they're actually like
143:40 - if i change this to like width minus
143:44 - with minus 10 height minus like if i
143:46 - make the images smaller
143:48 - right okay i just wanted to show you
143:50 - that i am actually they are separate
143:52 - pieces okay
143:54 - so uh i i visually it might help i think
143:58 - to actually just draw little thin lines
144:01 - over it with the rectangles
144:03 - and this is very
144:06 - silly this extraneous
144:08 - kind of code that i'm doing but um
144:13 - i think
144:14 - this will help
144:15 - yeah so i just wanted to draw some lines
144:17 - over it now
144:19 - now we are really getting somewhere
144:21 - because in theory
144:24 - if all i do is shuffle this array right
144:28 - have all of the elements of the array
144:32 - in random order
144:34 - then i should see the image
144:37 - chopped up and moved around so let's do
144:38 - that
144:39 - six minutes left
144:42 - so i'm going to write a function
144:45 - called shuffle
144:47 - which receives an array
144:49 - and then i'm going to
144:54 - just say like um a hundred times
144:58 - pick
144:59 - element one
145:01 - well let's do r1 is array dot rand a
145:05 - random number
145:07 - floor a random number between zero and
145:09 - the length of the array
145:13 - r2
145:15 - is floor
145:16 - a random number between zero and the
145:18 - length of the right now in theory i
145:19 - don't want these two elements to be the
145:20 - same but i'm doing it a bunch of times i
145:22 - want to swap i'm just the way i'm going
145:23 - to shuffle the array is by picking any
145:25 - two elements and swapping their place
145:27 - so now
145:29 - temp
145:30 - is
145:32 - that arrays r1 value
145:36 - then and you know i'm going to need i'm
145:39 - going to write a swap function
145:42 - because i'm going to need that i think
145:43 - also when i move the pieces
145:46 - so function swap
145:49 - is
145:50 - swap
145:51 - index i and j of an array
145:54 - so temp is index i
145:57 - and then that arrays
145:59 - i element
146:01 - is
146:02 - the j element and the j element is that
146:05 - temporary value now you might be
146:07 - wondering like what what and there's a
146:08 - way i know there's some like spread
146:11 - operator or oh maybe there's like
146:12 - deconstructing an array like can i do
146:14 - something like this
146:16 - array
146:19 - like there's some kind of like i there's
146:21 - some kind of um object deconstruction
146:23 - way i can do a swap and i'll put it up
146:25 - on the screen if i ever make this into
146:27 - an edited video but basically the
146:30 - old-fashioned oh the old old way that we
146:33 - used to swap our elements in an array is
146:35 - we take element one
146:37 - store it somewhere temporary because we
146:39 - need to put a new thing in that spot
146:41 - and then we saved it temporarily we
146:43 - could put that thing we saved in the
146:45 - spot that just the other thing came out
146:46 - of so if i just did this
146:53 - if i just did this it looks right like i
146:55 - should be j and j should be i but if i
146:57 - is j then j will be j because i is now j
146:59 - and oh it's just not good
147:01 - so
147:02 - temporary stuff
147:04 - okay so now i want to swap
147:08 - r1 r2 in that array
147:12 - so let's shuffle
147:14 - the array
147:18 - um
147:20 - let's i don't need to shuffle the tiles
147:22 - the tiles is just an array of elements
147:24 - i'm shuffling the array that's keeping
147:26 - track of the index indices of all of
147:27 - them maybe i didn't need these two
147:29 - arrays but
147:30 - it's the way that i'm thinking of it
147:31 - right now shuffle the board
147:39 - oh hmm
147:44 - board is
147:50 - what did i miss
147:52 - i missed something obvious
147:54 - probably uh
148:18 - oh
148:19 - i'm already using shuffle as a variable
148:27 - ah
148:28 - maybe is that oh is that up oh you know
148:30 - what i think there might be a p5
148:32 - function already for this
148:37 - there's a p5
148:38 - shuffle and it uses probably a fancier
148:41 - algorithm whatever this fischer yates
148:43 - shuffle algorithm is
148:45 - which has all these beautiful
148:46 - visualizations and of course my camera
148:48 - is off
148:55 - what a
148:56 - what a mess
149:04 - how long ago did it go off
149:09 - come back
149:15 - well good thing i wrote that p5 shuffle
149:17 - function
149:18 - i'm sorry well good
149:20 - well good thing i wrote my own shuffle
149:22 - function p5 the reason i'm getting that
149:23 - error is there already is a global
149:25 - function in p5 called shuffle and it
149:27 - uses this uh fischer yates shuffle
149:30 - algorithm which i can only assume is
149:32 - better than whatever i did although is
149:35 - it the same i don't know we could read
149:36 - this page and discover we should it
149:38 - could be another coding challenge the
149:40 - fischer yates shuffle algorithm okay but
149:43 - thankfully for us what was what's this
149:45 - argument
149:46 - modified a past array optional
149:50 - what does that do
149:52 - is it oh modifying the array or keeping
149:54 - the additional one well you know what
149:57 - i'm gonna do uh
150:00 - i'm just gonna call this a simple
150:02 - shuffle
150:05 - that way and i could use the p5 one you
150:07 - should try it yourself
150:08 - there we go look
150:10 - i have mixed up the elements
150:13 - all right so one thing that for it to be
150:15 - a slide puzzle that i need to do
150:18 - is
150:19 - i need to be able to
150:26 - i'm thinking i'm thinking i'm thinking
150:28 - remove one of them
150:29 - so i should also pick a random one
150:32 - simple shuffle
150:34 - and then i should pick i mean
150:36 - i and then i should pick a random one to
150:38 - remove or do i always want to remove
150:40 - like the top left one
150:42 - how do slide puzzles work is it always
150:44 - the bottom right one that's missing
150:50 - does anybody know
150:55 - that's the timer going off
150:58 - [Laughter]
151:02 - oh and then by shuffling the tiles
151:04 - randomly you could end up with an
151:05 - unsolvable sliding puzzle
151:07 - oh bottom right so actually
151:12 - i don't want to shuffle this way because
151:14 - i want to remove the bottom right one
151:18 - so
151:19 - uh columns and then
151:21 - let's just
151:22 - delete the last one
151:26 - pop is it pop
151:32 - and
151:36 - that'll be empty
151:39 - okay great so as long as
151:42 - uh
151:44 - as long as if tile index is greater than
151:48 - zero
151:49 - draw the image
151:52 - so now
151:53 - whoops oh greater than greater than
151:56 - negative one
151:58 - okay so now i have made the board
152:02 - um
152:03 - and i i could shuffle it
152:06 - i could still shuffle it now
152:08 - now but this isn't going to be
152:10 - this is not what i want to do but this
152:12 - shuffling is no good
152:15 - because in theory now is it possible
152:16 - that it's unsolvable or is is it always
152:19 - possible to move
152:22 - them around
152:23 - because what i could do
152:26 - is
152:26 - i could instead of i need a move
152:29 - basically i need a function that like
152:33 - moves
152:34 - one element
152:37 - so i need to know where the negative one
152:39 - is oh
152:41 - oh this is a hard problem and it is 108
152:43 - p.m
152:46 - i can do this i'm so close i'm so close
152:50 - um let me just get a move function going
152:57 - okay i'm gonna take out this no loop
152:59 - okay so function
153:03 - move
153:04 - so the function is going to receive a
153:07 - given index
153:09 - so the first thing i need to know is is
153:11 - that so the idea is i'm clicking on an
153:13 - index like i'm going to click on one of
153:14 - them and it's only a valid move if it's
153:17 - above below to the right or to the left
153:20 - so i do need this function like
153:23 - uh
153:23 - the column is index
153:27 - well you know what i couldn't
153:29 - i could pick a random
153:31 - column or row so that function so then
153:35 - uh
153:36 - i need to know where the negative one is
153:38 - so let's let's just have a variable
153:42 - blank spot is
153:44 - uh and then the blank spot
153:48 - is i guess i could always
153:50 - oh this is so bad you know what i'm
153:52 - going to do i'm going to write a
153:53 - function
153:55 - find blank
153:58 - uh
154:00 - um obviously there's better ways to
154:03 - track all this
154:11 - so this is a way to quickly check all of
154:14 - it to find which one is blank
154:22 - and then
154:25 - so i have that index
154:27 - so the blank
154:29 - the blank column is
154:32 - the blank
154:35 - the blank spot modulus the number of
154:36 - columns
154:39 - and the blank row is
154:42 - floor the blank
154:45 - index divided by the number of rows
154:47 - that's the inverse of putting it back i
154:50 - should just use the two-dimensional
154:51 - array
154:53 - okay so
154:55 - that's the blank column in row
154:57 - so now if
154:59 - so i and j if i and j is a neighbor if
155:02 - is
155:03 - neighbor
155:05 - i j
155:07 - blank
155:11 - um
155:13 - there's got to be an easier way to check
155:15 - if it's a neighbor right
155:17 - so if it's a neighbor
155:19 - then swap
155:21 - blank
155:24 - with
155:25 - i plus j
155:26 - j times columns of that array
155:29 - so the move
155:33 - basically the idea of doing a move is
155:36 - uh there's a spot that i want to move
155:39 - and i need to find if it's if it's a
155:41 - proper neighbor to the blank spot then
155:43 - it can be swapped with it
155:45 - oh no that's not yeah yeah yeah when you
155:47 - move a thing and tile into it it becomes
155:49 - the blank spot okay
155:51 - so i just need now an is neighbor
155:52 - function
155:54 - you the viewer will write this in a so
155:56 - much better way i'm on a time crunch
155:58 - here i'm way over my 30 minute
156:01 - limit uh
156:02 - function is neighbor
156:05 - of
156:06 - uh i'm just doing x1 y1 x2 y2
156:12 - so
156:13 - um
156:14 - let me do i j
156:15 - i j x y
156:17 - so it's a valid neighbor
156:19 - if
156:21 - so first
156:23 - if
156:23 - i is not equal to x
156:27 - and j is not equal to y
156:31 - return
156:35 - return false
156:37 - so
156:38 - it's either got to be in the same column
156:40 - or the same row
156:41 - so if they're both not the same
156:45 - then it's not a neighbor
156:47 - then
156:49 - if
156:52 - the absolute value of i minus x
156:58 - equals
156:59 - 1
157:00 - it's one spot away
157:03 - or
157:06 - the absolute value of
157:08 - j minus y
157:09 - if it's one spot away
157:12 - return true and i know i could return
157:14 - like the result or whatever
157:16 - and yeah so otherwise
157:19 - otherwise it's the same spot so i'm just
157:21 - gonna say return false
157:23 - if it gets to the end i think this will
157:25 - work
157:26 - just did that kinda like awkwardly
157:29 - right it's gotta both be
157:33 - in either the same column or row and one
157:36 - spot away
157:43 - so now
157:44 - shuffling so what shuffling is should be
157:50 - picking a move
157:54 - random uh columns
157:57 - and random rows
157:59 - obviously i could pick from the valid
158:01 - neighbors but that's too much work
158:03 - that's just fine i'm just going to pick
158:04 - randomly enough times that they'll be
158:06 - valid moves
158:09 - camera
158:10 - cool down
158:12 - it's very cool here in the garage it's a
158:13 - nice cool day
158:15 - i really need to get going i'm 45
158:17 - minutes over
158:22 - but i'm so close
158:25 - i'm so close
158:29 - all right so now i i know i'm gonna just
158:32 - repeat what i was saying
158:35 - i know
158:36 - i could
158:38 - uh just i know i could just pick from
158:39 - valid neighbors to do a move but if i do
158:42 - it enough times i'll pick valid
158:43 - neighbors enough times that this should
158:45 - work so now i should just say move
158:48 - r1 and r2
158:50 - and
158:51 - move if it's a
158:53 - finds the blank spot and if the blank
158:55 - spot is a neighbor it swaps it with i
158:57 - don't know if this is going to work
158:58 - let's just try it
159:00 - uh
159:02 - array ah move
159:06 - i guess move should the function should
159:08 - get the array i mean i'm only using one
159:10 - array
159:11 - so it's a little bit silly
159:14 - um
159:15 - but uh yeah
159:16 - there we go okay
159:18 - so that that's a valid shuffling now i'm
159:20 - just curious
159:24 - let me make this a random move function
159:30 - again i will refactor this later i mean
159:32 - i don't know if i will
159:35 - uh let's do random move so like if i do
159:38 - a thousand moves
159:42 - oh uh array
159:46 - it's a little bit silly how i have to
159:48 - like i'm not using global variables well
159:50 - okay so that should be a random
159:51 - shuffling that's possible but just out
159:53 - of curiosity
159:55 - in draw
159:57 - if i just said
159:58 - random move
160:01 - of the tiles
160:05 - this is very silly how i have arguments
160:07 - that somewhere and not other places yeah
160:09 - i got to fix this up later
160:12 - but i don't want to shuffle it i just
160:13 - want to see it do a one move per
160:16 - okay cannot read properties undefined
160:18 - image
160:20 - why
160:26 - random move
160:28 - of tiles
160:29 - hold on
160:32 - why can't i just do a random move
160:37 - all right what's going on here
160:39 - it works to do a bunch of them do i need
160:41 - to do it i mean this doesn't make any
160:42 - sense
160:43 - i mean if i do it at the beginning or
160:45 - not
160:56 - oh board it's the board
161:00 - there we go
161:06 - oh i'm not drawing the background so the
161:08 - old piece is there
161:11 - okay
161:14 - so this is it shuffling the puzzle
161:16 - randomly
161:18 - oh i love this so fun
161:22 - okay
161:23 - so now
161:25 - all i need to do now is have a mouse
161:27 - pressed function
161:33 - and i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna go
161:35 - back to shuffling it to start
161:38 - uh where where where where where where
161:39 - where so take out this
161:42 - and mouse press function is so the
161:45 - column that i'm clicking on is
161:48 - floor mouse x divided by the number of
161:51 - columns
161:52 - right
161:53 - and the row and i'm going to call this i
161:56 - and the row that i'm clicking on
161:59 - is floor mouse y
162:01 - divided by the number of rows and then
162:04 - move i
162:06 - j tiles
162:08 - now i'm not giving myself any feedback
162:10 - or i'm not seeing an animation all of
162:12 - those are things that i hope that you
162:14 - will add
162:18 - but in theory if i click on this one
162:21 - and i know the camera just went off
162:45 - but i know if i
162:48 - but but in theory if i click on one of
162:50 - them
162:51 - it should move if it's a valid neighbor
162:53 - what what did i
162:56 - i j array find blank
162:59 - so console log i
163:02 - j
163:08 - 60 whoops
163:10 - no no no divided by w and h
163:13 - not divided by the number of columns
163:15 - divided by the width of the column is it
163:16 - zero one or two okay
163:18 - it's like what am i losing my mind here
163:20 - okay
163:22 - no
163:23 - oh not the tiles not the tiles the board
163:25 - the board
163:30 - yeah look at that
163:32 - now i'm pressing the buttons
163:34 - and so now it is solved
163:38 - um
163:40 - if is solved
163:44 - if the board
163:45 - uh if so console log
163:48 - solved we will not have any fanfare just
163:51 - a console log solved so i'm going to
163:53 - write a function
163:55 - is solved
163:57 - where i'm going to go 4 let i equal 0 i
164:00 - is less than
164:01 - board dot length
164:04 - minus one i don't need to check the last
164:06 - one
164:08 - i plus plus
164:10 - and then if
164:11 - board
164:13 - index i is not equal to
164:16 - tiles index i dot index right isn't that
164:20 - didn't i save where it's supposed to be
164:23 - yes in the tile class
164:26 - then that's a piece that's in the wrong
164:27 - place
164:29 - so return false
164:31 - and if you get through everything
164:34 - all of them are in the right place
164:36 - return true so if i don't shuffle
164:40 - the board at all
164:43 - in
164:44 - setup
164:46 - it's solved it's showing me it's solved
164:49 - now if i shuffle it in setup
164:52 - it's not solved and i can solve it okay
164:54 - let's make it easier for me to solve oh
164:56 - my god i think i got this i think i did
164:57 - it you did it i think i made a slide
164:59 - puzzle
165:01 - um
165:03 - uh so let's just shuffle it
165:06 - simple shuffle like
165:08 - five times
165:10 - okay no
165:11 - it didn't pick oh there we go okay great
165:13 - so in theory
165:17 - all i need to do
165:19 - and i think it's this is left over from
165:21 - from the previous
165:24 - timer is just click on this element
165:27 - it will move up and go into place
165:31 - solved
165:33 - yay okay awesome so um just for fun
165:37 - because what are we doing but having fun
165:40 - i am going to
165:42 - [Music]
165:44 - uh have it be eight by eight
165:47 - and i am going to let it shuffle a
165:51 - hundred times
165:56 - well i guess i guess with more pieces
165:58 - it's not going to pick the thing
165:59 - randomly but hold on this is a little
166:00 - bit harder
166:05 - solved i did it
166:07 - no let's keep it but this is kind of fun
166:09 - because you realize you could do like
166:11 - you know
166:12 - a 20 by 20 slide puzzle here
166:16 - right and how many times do i need like
166:18 - you know obviously again i need a better
166:21 - shuffling algorithm but if i do it 10
166:22 - 000 times you know that's a lot of
166:24 - interesting moves there but let's go
166:26 - back
166:28 - let's go back to making it four by four
166:30 - and make this puzzle solvable for myself
166:33 - i'm gonna shuffle it just i'm gonna do a
166:35 - hundred random moves okay
166:37 - camera's off this is the last thing i'm
166:38 - doing
166:52 - let me and let me try
166:57 - this is the last thing i'm going to do
167:00 - i'm going to make it four by four
167:03 - i'm going to shuffle it just 100 times
167:06 - and let's see if i can solve this
167:12 - oh shoot
167:17 - oh wait a sec
167:27 - i think i did it
167:30 - yes
167:31 - i solved it all right
167:35 - so what can you do well you can be more
167:37 - thoughtful about what image you pick you
167:39 - could add animations there's a million
167:41 - opportunities to refactor this code to
167:43 - make it more s make more sense i mean
167:45 - this object could do so much i started
167:48 - like i need to make this object oriented
167:49 - but i did not follow through with that
167:51 - but also one prompt that i would have
167:53 - for you is there's no reason you
167:54 - couldn't do this with a video or some
167:56 - abstract generative art drawing i mean
167:58 - so many possibilities there because as
168:00 - long as you have an image even if it's
168:01 - an image that's changing over time you
168:03 - can shuffle it and you can solve it and
168:06 - a move counter for scoring so many
168:09 - things
168:10 - thank you for watching this coding
168:11 - challenge and i will see you next time
168:13 - on the coding train
168:16 - all right everybody
168:18 - uh that's all i got time for today uh i
168:20 - don't know if this i i think it's
168:22 - probably pretty unlikely that this is
168:24 - actually gonna get edited into something
168:25 - although i do think it's a nice
168:28 - um so if it doesn't work to edit what i
168:30 - did today i probably will off live
168:33 - streaming sometime on my own just kind
168:35 - of recreate this process so when you
168:38 - know i look forward to when all of you
168:39 - be like see the edited video that's
168:41 - released being like what you're wearing
168:42 - different clothes you did it so much
168:43 - more easily you really made it nicely
168:45 - object oriented so it might be a second
168:47 - pass of doing this but i'm gonna see if
168:49 - this can be edited uh and see what
168:52 - happens all right um i gotta go so i'm
168:54 - just gonna put on music and get out of
168:56 - here sorry they don't have time to
168:57 - answer any questions or say goodbye i
168:59 - might be back next friday or two weeks
169:01 - from today it could also be live
169:02 - streaming instead on a monday it all
169:04 - rains to be seen thank you again let me
169:07 - just give a big shout out to
169:09 - curiositystream sign up at
169:11 - curiositystream.comcodingtrain
169:13 - you get uh 26 off it's 15 for the entire
169:17 - year for all of the documentary
169:19 - documentaries plus access to watch
169:22 - nebula and all nebula and all the
169:24 - originals and things that are there and
169:25 - all these wonderful content creators you
169:27 - should definitely support nebula and
169:28 - curacao stream and me i think they're
169:30 - great
169:31 - and i'll see you
169:33 - next time
169:37 - goodbye
174:47 - you

Cleaned transcript:

do do so do hi everyone test one two it looks like to me like the audio is only coming through in one year assuming you're listed with your ears uh one side the left channel so let me work on fixing that give me one moment and if you can confirm in the chat you hear me but only through the left channel that's helpful information i realized my ball is probably low relative to music as well i gotta fix that all right i'm back and hopefully in both of your ears um the mic is mono but it needs to be sent to both channels and i believe it is and i'm just switching to the next song this song means there is one minute and three seconds left so it's time for me to begin and boy am i uh trying to get together this together at last minute so i'll see you in about a minute a few more things to plug in and unplug oh i don't have my headphones on you know what we're going to live without those for today i will see you in a moment of muting myself do hello good morning happy coding train friday i am coming to you live from the hudson valley of new york state uh in a garage with new lights a new monitor car a little confidence monitor attached to my camera am i looking at you does this look like i'm speaking directly to you because right now i'm just looking at myself but if i look at the camera lens now i'm really looking at the lens but typically my eye goes up to look this way and i would just like to know if i look at myself while i'm talking do you feel the connection between us i know it might seem a little bit forced and fake now that you realize that i can't actually see you oh there's an airplane flying overhead there's a truck delivering something gloria is hanging out in the grass and the sunshine programmer 171 is writing in the chat i am 13 years old and i love your videos i code in java for most of my games and i like your videos because they can be easily understood by anyone ah programmer 171 you just made my day thank you for that wonderful feedback um my son is also 13 years old his new hobby i guess maybe i shouldn't be broadcasting this all across the internet but i'm about to do it anyway is building mechanical keyboards so stay tuned for a future coding train live session here in this garage where i build a mechanical keyboard and if you happen to be a mechanical keyboard builder expert person i would love to hear from you you could write messages in the chat but i'm only going to very rarely turn my head this way to see them i see right now julian is saying first time catching you live welcome first timers to codingtrain live a little like ding dong discord sound just went off i have no idea where that's from or if i got a message somewhere i have too many screens many screens oh i have so many new things to show you before i do any of that let me quickly thank and boy boy all of you should really thank this sponsor uh curiositystream you can sign up at curiositystream.com codingtrain um it helps curiosity stream keeps the engine running um what is curiosity stream you might be asking oh i'm going to show you i'm going to do like a better sponsor segment in the middle because i have some things i want to show you but let me test out some of my new technology oh look this is curiosity stream um it is a wonderful streaming documentary uh uh um is a streaming thing oh i can't i'm not prepared did i mention i'm not prepared i'm sorry curiosity stream i'm doing my best i'm doing my best please don't fire me um curiosity stream is a streaming service with lots of wonderful documentaries um so many things related to let's see if i can do this ah now i'm in the screen too uh related to this channel um i particularly love the nature and environment stuff that's kind of what i enjoy watching but i think if you're a coding trained viewer the science on the map i'm looking for any of dr hannah fry's uh videos um uh ancient engineering becoming a martian look at all this stuff i have not there's just so much stuff to watch there it is magic numbers it's for me yes it is for me but uh even better than just uh telling you about curiosity stream um and but i'm not even doing so i have a whole script for my sponsor segment later and this was just me like warming up i'm kind of going off into my script but it's not scripted and i'm not prepared i'm sorry i'm doing my best uh we're gonna get to coding today some coding is gonna happen um but um i am part of a streaming service called nebula which is a bunch of educational creators on youtube got together uh from standard and started this streaming service i think if i go here and the thing about curiosity stream is if you sign up through that link um you're gonna get a uh it says it in the description of this video see how unprepared i am without my script um i i think it's i just don't want to say the wrong uh amount oh i'm doing so well this is good thank you uh the practice later where where where is my uh oh yeah here's my uh no um uh there it is no find find ah find your secret key no that's my instructions for one password um yes 26 percent off that's less than 26 off um the for the whole year curiosity stream for 14.79 that's like a little bit more than a dollar per month if you do the math and you get a nebula for free well i was telling you about nebula uh nebula has all this amazing stuff i want to talk to you about this better elevation series i got to do that later and bring my break if you want to support the coding train there are so many ways you could do so and one of those ways is to sign up uh for curiosity stream at curiositystream.com codingtrain okay this was rehearsal right everybody okay great rehearsal i'm gonna get ready to live stream now let's go to the um let's go to the um starting animation oh i don't have a button for that because i forgot to set that button there it is let's put the music on okay i'm going to mute my audio that was a great rehearsal everybody everybody my whole team here production team director producer cube card holder uh hair and makeup department all of you here with me in the garage just me there's nobody else but me uh and here we go i'm ready to go live in three two one hello welcome to the coding train coming to you live from the hudson valley of new york thank you today's sponsor curiosity stream sign up for garage free stream at crossroadsteam.com codingtrain for 26 off 14.79 cents for the whole year a whole amazing library of wonderful documentaries for you to watch and you get nebula the streaming service for free i'll come back later and tell you a bit more about that during my sponsor segment okay now let's see here all right now that we got that all out of the way um what am i going to do today so first things first um i want to just sort of talk you through what i've got going on here in the studio at some point i would very much like to make a studio sorry there's a huge truck do you hear that so i moved and the truck is delivering a bed i've been sleeping on the floor for quite a while the mattress on the floor it's perfectly fine the bed has been delivered this giant truck is trying to get out of the driveway now it already was delivered i'm feeling very stressed out about it uh anyway live live i would say like welcome to live tv but this is not tv nope never never made it onto tv i'm an old person who who uh i don't know if i ever even auditioned to be on tv but nobody ever nobody said to me hey you should be on tv i just said to myself i should be on tv and then i made a youtube channel and here i am on your tubes so let's talk about the new studio so um what you're seeing is camera one camera one is pointing at this desk uh you can actually see i don't know why this button is broken but i'm just gonna go to here this is actually what the camera is seeing it is me standing in front of a green curtain i have a new light over here you can see how bright that is i'm to turn it off for a second i don't this is not hooked up it has a network plug but it is not hooked up so now it is darker i also have another light over here which i have hooked up to the network so i can press a button on my steam stream deck and it goes off so i'm turning this one on i'm going to turn the other one on um one thing that i haven't really had a chance to do is sort of sort out all the settings on my camera like it's a sony uh alpha 7 3 is the camera that i'm using and i've it's at some arbitrary iso i think there's other camera settings uh white balance color temperature so i'm curious in general if you happen to be a video expert or just a person watching any feedback i'm not going to really get it now i would suggest joining the discord and that's a place where you can more reliably pass along some feedback that will get to me uh in terms of the lighting and setup of this view um i would um and you can see like i've got the full uh full green here um and now this is open broadcast studio in a stream deck i press this button it switches me to this view i have another button for the banner just have a background my dream now is to have i mean i've been doing this forever and it's essentially the same thing that you've always been watching but it's just sort of set up a new i mean uh david and the discord was pointing out to me that like i've set up a new studio like four times in the last two years this is going to be i'm hoping the studio for the next well at least one year and probably two years and then we'll sort of see from there i mean maybe forever uh or three months from now i'll be like hey i'm moving again um but um i forgot what i was saying ah so this is it keyed oh my dream is to start having like coding train uh code examples and animations and easter eggs popping up and maybe some realtime interaction stuff so all of that is coming i just want to be able to see the chat here oh so over here i have like a monitor which has open broadcast studio running i see the youtube chat in theory i see the discord chat but i unfortunately that disappeared um you hear the truck says prathamesh in the discord chat um hi again to naresh so uh i'm trying to do a better job one of the reasons why i got this extra confidence monitor is it encourages me to look this way and look at the camera i often find myself live streaming like this but the reason why i like having a monitor over here is the other view that i have takes this laptop hdmi out brings it in i have a brand new streaming pc that's really the big difference here and i've had to like install and set everything up and has been doing it since about 8 30 a.m i thought two hours will be enough but we'll see i did some of it last friday so if i switch here i believe if i press this button this is just the raw laptop you can see i've got my october spooky month background here if i press this button i appear i didn't i can i didn't use any of the transitions that are in obs to have me fade in um and i see that uh programmer 170 oh no rusty nail uh whiteboard yeah programmer so ah it's coming so rusty now asked i'm gonna join your discord i don't think this button let's see if this button it doesn't work so for some reason my youtube button's on my stream deck i have a button that should post something to the chat it's not working i also have a button that should show me how many people are watching which is also not working anyway so you can see here the reason why i like to have this view is i often as if i'm reporting the weather to you uh i like to open up uh p5.js web editor and uh make the font quite a bit bigger and then i can say tomorrow's weather will be 400 by 400 canvas with gray skies uh you know what let's make it have blue skies tomorrow's weather p5 weather is blue skies so that is all the setup here now what is this you might ask this is a new ipad uh i even have a pencil it's not a real pencil it's an apple pencil not a sponsor though i'm totally available apple i'm available no chance of that so i think it's procreate pro create is the software that i installed i have for example this beautiful um so this has hdmi out as well and it's going into another capture oh unsupported signal okay came back and if i press this button ooh i think this cable is a little bit wonky i think this i need to i this um particular uh usbc to hdmi out dongle is uh kind of unhappy but i do have um i do now have this that i can draw and and do diagrams too but i really don't i i it you know interesting option um i can also and see it just keeps going in and out so i might not use that too much today but i also um today i was sort of like oh this is interesting since i want to talk about curiosity stream and nebula um i can open those up let me just go to the nebula main uh screen here and show you um that so um so this is i thought is useful it's another way for me to show and display content while streaming i kind of is like this ugly like hunk of thing metal here so i don't i don't love what that adds and maybe i guess i could put some stickers on it or maybe i don't want to use it i'll take that away but what you've all been waiting for ah wait no okay hold on you don't hear that so one of the things that i neglected to do was set up the audio routing correctly um it's is it here is the question so i need to in this if i want you to be able to hear audio i've got to go to audio input capture add existing laptop audio okay now in this view wait what what view did i just end up in this view this view yes now you should hear oh do you not hear me no you do hear me okay there's just too many things here remove can i remove this hi no remove delete there's like so many can i move this up come on obs i guess i could just do hide just gonna do hide gloria it's okay uh all right that drum roll really didn't lead to anything did it okay here it comes ready i have no idea if this is gonna work here comes everybody look at that okay uh you hear me the drum roll has gone away because i didn't add that audio i'm walking over i'm gonna get a marker i'm walking over i'm walking over in here i am now there's a there's a couple issues with this setup i do have a light i've had to position the light in such a way oh boy i'm a little bit taller than what the camera is seeing i want to work on that i had to position the light in such a way that it doesn't reflect off of this very glossy finish so i can see it's a little shadowy oh i have an extra light that i didn't hook up so i do have one more light that i definitely want to add should i put it on now that will help give me a second let's do that it says i need an extension cord for it but i can plug it in i think i can plug it in here i just have to not trip over it um and then let's see i need it's this one is connected to uh the internet over here uh where am i here so like i i think this button which turns off this light should also turn on the other light did that happen no oh it needs to be plugged in it is now on okay so now i'm going back i can't see uh uh um take doublesided tape and put the adapter on the back of the ipad rack oh that's very smart marvin thank you for that suggestion all right so now i'm coming back it's a little bit better because i have one extra very light so so here we go here i am uh if i need to draw a diagram like here is a velocity vector and here is the target for the vehicle and its desired velocity uh i am now able to do that as well but i think that this so first of all the only extra tripod i had maybe goes at best like five feet so uh it needs to be higher i think um and it i think it's probably a skew and it's sort of pointed down so i need to have it point up uh hopefully the focus is okay i can see some shadowing so i'm not sure i this i could so your feedback is welcome and appreciated first day using this i probably should get some more lights or maybe just some different camera settings to brighten it up um and try to reduce the shadowing incidentally i just want to move this for a second what's here is this locked i think i locked this are you seeing this is this chris is reading wait how do i unlock this door there we go ah there we go it's the great outdoors so i don't know hopefully the mic is still working you can still hear me but i have some dreams like maybe i could set up my laptop here it's a beautiful day you hear the birds the sun is out breathe in the nature this roof of the garage i think needs to be replaced it's gonna be a big project so there's a lot of things that have got to happen to make this all come together but anyway uh i'm completely barefoot so now my feet are kind of wet uh a little natural green screen background uh let's see if i can close this do i do this to lock it i can't figure it out i'll lock it later bring the white board back uh there we go so uh now you've seen pretty much all of the elements of the new studio one of the things that is true about being over here is i absolutely cannot see the chat whatsoever so for all i know you've lost the audio the stream has gone out who knows i can out of the corner of my eye see open broadcast studio so i do see myself and but i can't read the chat so it might be worth i have a table over here a little work table to build the mechanical keyboard that um maybe i can set up an extra monitor or something like that to be able to watch the chat while i'm here or maybe over here something like that so yeah so that's the setup i don't know if i'm going to use this today but there you go um i'm looking at the chat now mike's still perfect outside uh that's good to know it's good to know it is a wireless lav and i've got to come back over here um so here we are all right 10 55. things are still a little rough with the coding train um in terms of content production um a lot of my time is uh spent teaching and also setting up this new space um i hope to be back with live regular live streams as of today so i plan to live stream most fridays next week is a little bit tbd i've got some plans for october 29th um and then there'll be streams in november except for thanksgiving some streams in december we'll do a holiday uh fundraiser for processing um and then i've got lots of new plans that will begin to happen hopefully in january so what kinds of things do i do if you're new if this is your first time watching i spend a lot of time while i live stream kind of just chatting chitchatting um and like i'm doing now it is my goal to have their live streams be a little bit more programmed and so the kinds of things i like to do are share projects that people from the community have made i'm not really so set up to do that today i also like to look at the most recent videos that i have released take a look through the comments read some of the comments answer some of the questions and so that's what i'm going to start with and then the other things that i want to do today are i want to talk a little bit about how discord i have oh boy i signed up for this so i've got no there's you know it is no reason to complain but i spent a very good portion of last fall making a i think fourpart uh series let's go to the coding train website under maybe more under learning discord bot oh six part series so i made these six videos on how to program your own discord bot an introduction to the concept how the developer portal works starting to write the code with discord.js a library for interfacing with the discord api um how to hide your api keys with dot env posting gifs and the com and how to make a command handler look at all these wonderful thumbnails and you know they're edited and produced and like yeah you know it's no more of these old days where i just press the button and like take talk code code code and express stop and release the video edit it and zooming in and out and highlighting things to help make it you know people seem to like that i don't know we'll see anyway but the result of that is you could i could spend a lot of time effort and money to produce a series like this and uh libraries change and it's pretty much out of date and i would say this is um this is quite the case for these discord tutorials unfortunately now the the one thing is true you could still follow these tutorials and absolutely get your bot to work if you made sure to use the same version of the discord.js package that i'm using in these videos i've tested it it still works i don't know to what extent the discord api itself will change in which case some of the things that that that library is doing in the older version will be deprecated and actually stop working but at the moment it still works however um it's a much better thing now to use the newest discord dot js library and it's version 13. it's not even a year ago these came out in november and december not even one year did i make it with these videos i would say probably the introduction is maybe still relevant the developer portal is pretty much the same although you've got to do a few evergreen that's some evergreen content maybe because at least working with this.env file is a tried and true method that hasn't changed working with the api to get gifs is the same but posting them to discord is a little bit different and command handling has changed so i don't know right now i do not have the capacity to really rerecord new versions of these but i would like to spend some time just i have new examples and i've been teaching the new examples in my nyu course my goal with the coding terrain is i have my fulltime day job teaching i have this sort of side business youtube channel thing i like to make videos that i can use in my classes but also uh make them available to the wider uh youtube audience so i'm trying to balance it all i haven't figured it out so i don't know what to do about that but um i at least today during the live stream one thing i can do is kind of go through some new examples that i've made and point out what the steps are and talk about what the changes are so if you wanted hopefully i can give you a head start on uh if you follow these tutorials and you made something how to upgrade to the next version and i should really thank both kobe and david who are um creators and maintainers of the coding train discord bot who uh gave me enormous amounts of help um in uh figuring out um how all this new stuff works okay um now let's see here so i want to do that today so three things i want to go through my most recent i could release a video live while i'm live streaming you know what i'm going to do at the end of today's live stream i'm going to release the next video in my nature of code series because it's ready to go so that's something you can i think look forward to i'll do that today but and maybe i'll even show you a little preview of what it is during the live stream so comments update on nature of code steering behavior video series that's going on right now uh update on discord stuff and then i would like to this will make everybody very happy i hope i got to watch the time i got to get this started probably by like 12 45 at the latest i would like to see uh uh i would like to take a little return back to the old ways of how i used to make coding train content which is during the live stream i would pick a coding challenge topic and give myself a amount of time to try to program it and then all the while while i'm doing that i would also be recording everything to disk so that later that coding challenge sequence could be you know edited together with some light editing um and uh released as a standalone video um certainly these are the most watched videos on my channel the ones that i did that way years ago so and i my new setup in theory um i'm using this um i think it's called the like pro cam elgato pro cam capture card so it has um software that will record all of the hdmi inputs into the card to one big video file which i can run in the background while i'm live streaming and i have a like tx nvidia 3080 i don't remember what it is but i went through a lot of research to spec out a machine with a graphics card that i would hope would be able to handle both live streaming and recording to disk uh multiple hdmi events so we're gonna see if that works i'm not holding my breath i'll definitely be doing it on the live stream whether the recording actually works in a way that it can be reused we'll see um so that's kind of my plan could you say that again no no i'm not going to say that again why does that happen why does the technology just spontaneously talk to us for no reason i mean there probably was a reason i probably hit something press something did something it asked me to say it again i can't say it again don't make me say it again you know what oh that's what i should use the outdoors for reading the random numbers do i have the laptop audio here let's see oh wait hold on press this button no why is that not how come that doesn't work does this button work for muting myself okay i'm talking i'm talking i'm about to mute my muted and now i'm back and talking again that button works um naresh is asking how did i get a 33 what do you say what's the price 3008 or is it 3080 or is it 3080 uh i might be wrong hold on let me get my little notebook and tell you about the specs of my new computer um i know there's a global gpu shortage i think i must have just lucked out um i'm walking over here to my information booklet i'm gonna i'm gonna do a dramatic reading of uh the specs of the new computer that i purchased you know it's very hard for me to get back to my spot because um okay so all right ports and connections oh no wait come on isn't there just like a star guy install setup benchmarks benchmarks benchmarks tools and recovery windows should i upgrade to windows 11 on it anybody know it i really just wanted to read you the main specs is there another piece of paper i don't know why it's not i have this whole notebook yeah i have an nvidia geforce rtx 3080 10 gigabyte founders edition video card i don't know why i don't have the there must be must have been like a separate paper and this is just like this is going well i was i was excited to do a um random number uh uh reading and then i was like oh i'll read about my computer but let's just let's i don't even know where ah here's the random digits book okay remember i'm gonna get back to that remember that system i had where i would know my goal is to do i guess i have to start over again now that i'm in a new studio my goal is to read every number from this book what book am i talking about it is the book uh it's very uh reflective um a million random digits with 100 000 normal deviates i'm still in the market for a original print edition of this book um and if i think if i go into discord uh somebody somebody might tell me i i don't have oh i don't have well i don't have the music here boy i'm really uh hold on let's see uh give me one second to add i lost so many viewers in the last like 15 15 minutes uh audio input capture laptop audio uh does this mute it this button yeah that button works okay so now if i go here okay okay everybody here we go this would be much better for me to sit outside and do this again uh somebody if anybody is watching and could tell me where i last left off i know i could pull up discord but hey wait wait i can pull up discord on this computer don't worry i'm gonna get to something eventually okay discord coding train bot demo is that where i go um i guess i could go there um let's try that i used to be able to make discord bigger by doing shift command plus oh wait oh just command plus okay there we go ah it's there look at this thank you to kobe i am now in the coding train discord the bot the command is slash reading so um check where shiffman stopped last reading the book of random numbers and i need to continue reading the book at page one thank you life is good sometimes when your computer systems work and tell you where you last were in the book that you're reading ah yes okay page one you are all so nice to actually watch these live streams i mean if it were me i just have shut this off already i mean to be fair most of you did shut this off already probably or you just didn't bother to show up but not you you're watching you're the ones who are here and i love you very much uh page two page one boy i'm not very far wait a second seriously row two this entire book has many many many pages not just page one row two column zero all right we're gonna get further zero eight four two two six eight nine five three one nine six four five zero nine three oh three two three two zero nine zero two five six zero one five nine five three three four seven six four three five zero eight zero three all right so now i read a row next time and be on page one row two and column zero is that a thing that i can say can i uh can i um speaking of discord bots can i now say slash reading no a set or something set number i don't know maybe uh i guess i'll need uh oh look at this this is so cool get a picture of the coding train in your inventory i want this i need an id what come on come on give me my character too bad is thinking by the way i'm in a steps competition right now so it's really good that i'm doing this all right let's see we'll see if it comes through for me um but i love this is so much fun ah join the discord join the discord we're gonna do more oh look my inventory wow oh inventory uh whoops no i got one oh character i don't know why lots of stuff is happening here anyway um i got smile robot or kobe got smile robot that's exciting um is it on the blockchain maybe no i'm just nah did i did not say that backing away turning the stream off goodbye good night everybody thank you uh thank you and good night that was today's coding train live stream i will see you uh all right i'm back all right let's let's get going here let me get to segment number one which is reviewing um reviewing um codabot to read it for you reviewing recent videos so i'm gonna go to um the channel so the thing that i'm currently working on if i go here under videos what's gonna happen is it's going to show all my private videos which is fine i don't think i have that many let me switch to um this is so weird what's going on here uh i have this like fake not me channel and go to videos okay so but i want to see the uh no this is fine anyway i don't know how to do this it's so hard uh the most recent video that i uh produced which was um not particularly watched i would say um stig by the way is as making a suggestion in the chat which is something that i have already thought of or maybe it was already mentioned to me maybe stigma clint you you incepted this into my brain previously but this is this is a this is a project i really do want to make uh it's v related to my interest in v tubing but uh coming to you soon a new channel with just a 24 7 live stream of me reading random numbers okay um so uh here i am let's go to uh this video this video could have been in chapter one all right so um what this video is about and i think there's actually a better way for me to demonstrate what it's about is a concept known as scalar projection um and i'm actually just going to open up the code for it where oh that is not the right one looks like we might have a mistake uh let's see that's weird is that the thing that i just opened yeah so this is not the correct code example what's the other one here that's the angle between i think they might be inverted no they're both that so something went wrong where this is not the correct code well this is good for me to discover this um let's see scalar so it's that hmm let's go back angle between containment wander three beef lake bed path following well this i'm going to have to investigate somebody wants to file a github issue on the coding train website right now that was a uh un uh unforeseen error but i will just find the part in the video um where the code example happens and i think maybe it's here yeah so this is the example that i wanted to pull up where basically what's going on is i am taking a given vector right a particular vector that is in between uh green dot one that points from green dot one to green dot two and uh taking the projection of that onto this vector so as if there's a light above that second green dot and casting a shadow like this blue line this blue line is like the shadow of this vector onto this vector the reason this is incredibly important and useful is it allows us to find this normal point this projection point i'm calling it so if i want to look at the distance between any given point like that green dot over there and a line finding that normal the scalar projection using the vector dot product is a way of doing so the reason why i'm doing all this in the first place and if you watch the video that it'll do a deeper dive into it is that this technique is needed for path following if this blue line happened to be a path and the green dot happened to be your vehicle you need to see where it is relative to the path and have it steer towards the path so that um when if i do this where um and um pick out a few that i would like to address or that could lead me to adjust or change the example in a certain way did not have time to do that so i'm just going to kind of look and see what's kind of risen up here uh to the top based on whatever um youtube algorithm okay uh uh all right so i see a little message that there's some lag going on everything that i see is green lights everywhere but i do see people are saying it is lagging um okay weird i don't see any issues with the stream i see zero drop frames i see 30 frames per second um it's fine now it was a long hiccup okay i would like i do need to look into my open broadcast studio settings one thing i am getting is that youtube is telling me that my bit rate is low i'm looking in the obs stats page and it says my bit rate is 2674 kilobytes per second 2713 kilobytes per second so i don't know if that's a limit um to um my internet connection or that's a setting that i should change it lagged when i scroll down to the comments it's weird okay well we're back let's take a look okay um oh yeah look robert m oh i didn't see your comment i really need to be myself i mean i am myself but it's bothering me that i'm not really myself so i'm going to go here and switch to be me now i really am myself and i need to find the comments all right so robert m i want to heart this comment yes need to fix this you can also always post a note to the website github issues which would be where github.com codingtrain website and for all i know it's already there um but i don't see it here in an obvious place so i'm going to link it there and we might see it sooner okay there we go so thank you robert m for your wonderful comment that i'm reading live on the air uh thank you raj for the nice feedback um so let's read this from tmc you can have the option for that function to cap at the line segment but at the line segment endpoints it's actually more useful in navigating ai's to have the option of segment versus line oh yes okay so unfor i really wish i need to be able to run this example the whole point of me doing this is to be able to run the example there was always such fail on the coding train live streams hopefully it makes you feel good about how well things go in your life i'm looking at the time okay i have here's the thing i'm pretty sure i have a variation of this that's part of the nature of code examples um path following simple oh hold on i wanted to i wanted to do this capping thing because this is actually a really meaningful interesting comment so i'm i'm gonna allow myself five minutes to try to get the scalar projection code up and running okay 11 25 everybody say stop you've taken too long you've wasted too much time let's look for the path following example path falling path falling target ahead path capture path falling complex path path falling let's look at this for a second okay this is good so by the way this is the path following example the other thing by the way that i could use some uh knowledge about is if i were to unplug the hdmi out from this laptop this sketch would run at 60 frames per second but because my capture card is capturing at 30 frames per second if i'm plugged in the p5 sketch will will cap at 30 frames per second which isn't that big of a deal maybe that's fine but it i find it unnerving that all of a sudden my sketch is running half the speed is when i programmed it so i don't know if there's a way for me to force the browser to run 60 frames per second even if the output is 30 frames per second anybody knows anything about that would love to hear from you not right now in the comments because i won't necessarily get it uh join the discord and the information can get passed along to me that way probably all right so let's make a new sketch and i'm going to keep this function i'm basically remaking that sketch and let's do have three points uh pause a and b pause is create vector um at like 100 100 a is create vector and let's see here where am i standing kind of i guess i should move myself over a little bit um create a vector at um let's just try like 200 oh let's make this 100 200 200 100 and b create vector at 200 um that may be like 300 uh 300. so now let's say stroke weight 8 stroke 255 a dot x a dot y and let's run this sketch to make sure i'm seeing something and let's make these much bigger uh pause pause did i hit stop or something okay there we go so um now if i wanted to say stroke weight one and draw a line from pause x pause y to a dot x a dot y and the same thing to b um now i should be able to use this method find projection which is the function that i worked out in that video to say um let projection equal find projection pause a b and then let's draw that point and say stroke weight 2 24 again and let's make that green and let's move the point a around by the mouse a dot x is mouse x a dot y equals mouse y so i pretty much remade that example now what i would like to do to figure out is how could i have this green dot turn red if it is past the endpoints which is essentially me coming back to this comment have an option for that function to cap at the line segment endpoints more useful um to have the option of line segment versus line so uh you can easily search football steer further if your function is segment restricted when the ai follows a line at a distance to it will start to steer around the end point and never really find the next line in the path to follow yes so this is such a good point so the thing that i um have yet to really implement and um i'm going to go to this one i think i believe yeah so this is one of my examples that i demonstrate in the next video that hasn't been released yet but will be released today where these agents are following this path and this path is a series of multiple line segments so i need to know right see how the vehicles are finding that corresponding normal point to the path i need to know and um right see like over here they're finding it no i need to know which segment of the path is the one that they should follow so having some ability to understand whether the normal point to that line segment exists on the line segment or not would be useful um i think that lag message is just from before okay so hopefully the stream is still working fine so how do i go about doing this i kind of have no idea so let's think about this um well i could i oh this is a great chance for me to use my whiteboard let's practice that i'm going to come over here do i have a marker where did i put the marker do i have an eraser i have some tissues okay i think i want to order a new white board i said this before this one is very shaky and it would be great if i could get one that's like matte finish i also was thinking about getting like could i get like glass that i can draw in front of me and then we can have the beautiful background behind me i don't know if that would be visible but your suggestions are welcome okay so i have a line segment it's got uh i call it's a little bit weird i call these paws i guess i'll just use that same nomenclature pause a and b i don't know why did i it's a little bit we i i think there was a reason for why i called it these things in the video but i'm having trouble remembering that why and then we find this point so if a is over here we would find this point but that is off the line or if a were over here we would find this point so what are some things that i could do i could certainly look at i could normalize i could take this vector from pause this is called projection so if i take the vector from pause to projection and if it's in the opposite direction oh well i'm just looking for what's the easiest way to do this and the chat's probably explaining this to me i'm thinking this through live i mean right i know by definition i know this vector that's part of what i've worked out this vector so i guess i could do like um just look if they're if it's if it's in if it is if the angle between these two vectors is 180 degrees but this point that would not be the case i could look for the distance i know oh this is easy or easyish no yeah if i take the distance from this point to both b right if i take the distance from this point to a and to b and add them together i've got this magnitude but if i if it's past the line if i take its distance oh if it's distance to either one of those is greater than the line segment's length all right that's a way to do it maybe you have a better suggestion in the chat okay i thought of it right if i just look at this wherever this point is and look at its distance to this point of the line segment and its distance to this point of the line segment sorry the distance here and distance to here if one of those is greater than that length of the line segment it has to be past either side of the line segment maybe there's a more efficient way of doing it but that would certainly get me the result i think right i'm coming back here so let's just try that so in other words i have distance one is the vector distance between the projected point and pause uh this is vector distance distance two is the distance between the projected point and b and again i have to apologize for the weird naming i kind of i think i let and just making this example let's change the names um because i kind of would like it to be a b and i'm going to write the labels there i'm going to call this a b sorry this is going to be c and this is a and b so c is controlled by the mouse and i'm drawing a point at a b and c then i'm drawing the line between a and b and the line between a and c then find uh the projection point a c b and then what's going on here what did i mess up and me trying to make this make more sense no no hold on whoa okay oh dear projection point between no oh c oh my god what point to hold on i lost the track of what's what okay hold on hold on what do i want this to be oh it's so hard to like know how to do this it's very far away to get to this whiteboard okay i i was thinking it should be a b and this is c that makes more sense so i want to draw a line between a and c and a and b this is projection that's the projection point and then my uh my function should take a it was pause a b and yeah what what just happened this should work okay uh oh look at that okay there's an extra a there okay whoop okay a and b a is this one b is this c is this one there we go oh no you don't see sorry i forgot to press the button i forgot to press the button here we are okay i got it i got it and then the projection point sorry everybody oh my god it's 11 30 already no no no no no no oh i found whoa look at this interesting projection point what is going on uh a there we go i would i would i would really like to say abc but it's fine i'm going to live with that okay now the distance distance one is the projection point between projection and a distance two is the projection point between is the distance projection point and b i was going to label the points but now if i say if d1 is greater than so i have somewhere in this function i made this vector already pause a b i'm totally losing it uh so let distance equal p5 vector now i'm i'm not worrying about doing this particularly efficiently right now i might be able to repurpose knowing this distance from somewhere else in the code which i almost certainly do but if i just get the distance between a and b if d1 is greater than d or d2 is greater than d fill 255 a stroke red and then where is uh where is that this so and then i'm going to do this here so now i should yeah there we go if it's past the line segment it turns red if a dot b absolute value divided by the absolute value of a is between 0 and 1 the projected point is on the vector b that makes a lot of sense now why is that the case let's go back to the white board if a dot b this this if a dot b divided by the not the absolute value but the the length of vector is between 0 and 1. this makes sense i have heard of this formula before this is familiar to me i've worked this out before and it's just not fresh in my memory right now so why is that the case uh eight let's it has to do with the angle between i'm looking for my eraser which i don't have one so let's think about this let's work out this math because okay apparently i need to lock the wheels of this white board and get an eraser [Laughter] okay so a dot b equals um okay well we can do it two ways a sub x times b sub x and this is just for two dimensions obviously plus a sub y times b sub y the other formula which uses which i'm uh neglecting which i'm blanking on right now which uses the formula let's find that in the nature of code book and i'm going to go to chapter 6 dot product um i want to look for this is the formula yeah yeah okay this is the formula i'm looking for here the magnitude of a times the magnitude of b times cosine of the angle thank you um the magnitude of a and i don't know why i'm using capital letters all of a sudden the magnitude of a times the magnitude of b times cosine of the angle in between so if we take this and divide it by the magnitude of a we now have the magnitude of b times cosine of the angle between so this makes sense because if the angle between these two vectors is um right if if we go back to this drawing once again we're talking about this angle if this angle goes beyond 90 degrees then the projection point is going to be off to this direction or if the length right if the angle is or right if the angle is somewhere in here then it comes down to the length so if it's otherwise the cosine of the angle if it's passed is going to give you a negative number so you always would get a negative value or if you're getting a positive value then it has to do with the length so if the length over here is like past what this would be so this this is making sense to me um it's all back to this whole scalar projection thing right the whole pinpoint ah the whole point of the scalar projection oh i'm so silly i'm so silly the whole point of the scalar projection is as if i didn't record an entire video tutorial all about this that makes sense now it's uh the whole point of the scalar projection is it gives me this length so if that's a negative number it's off the side if that length is greater than the length of uh this vector yeah yeah so i don't need to do all of this because it's kind of built into my scalar projection code okay i'm going to leave this um uh i'm gonna leave this uh aside now because it's already 11 40. and i that's what i said 11 45 i was going to do a coding challenge that was that was a good one uh so you know this was a great rehearsal again once again this is a great rehearsal i'm kind of learning how this all works uh let's just uh um so thank you again for your comments this one definitely sparked a lot and uh the the path following video uh will there's there's there's a whole third part of the path of this sequence that i haven't recorded yet right there's what is scalar projection how do you follow a simple path and then how do you follow a complex path so this concept that we've been working on um um is definitely um is definitely relevant to that um uh path what uh that third part that i haven't recorded four minutes in i already have five wikipedia pages open i love that comment uh um okay can we learn physics this way you can learn the basics this way but it won't be enough to learn physics in detail this is definitely true okay um by the way this um so i just wanted to address this comment um i just want to say like it one thing you will notice here is if you go to the end of the video it's going to show you this happens from time to time as far as my release sequence um uh i'm reading the comments that maybe i'm not coding getting some good coding challenge suggestions um okay sponsor break reminder boy let me let me address what i want to address right now which is that um often the next video that i am about to publish is available on the channel before it is finished and what do i mean by finished um i use a thirdparty service to close caption my videos that often takes like three or four days so i have the video uploaded and present on the channel it could be the thumbnails not finished it could be the code examples and the description is not finished but just to have everything right and also to give a bonus to the coding terrain members that's of the people who subscribe to join there's like a join button somewhere on the channel yeah this join button here um uh this would this is available to um i often will have the video as part of the playlist and locked to members only so before it's really finished and ready the members can get a sneak preview of it also that helps me often catch errors so i've had members watch the sneak preview and be like ah there's a big problem here and i will then take the upload down fix it and reupload much better to do that before it's become a public video so if i click on this right now all right i'm back apologies for that the batteries just don't last all right i'm gonna wait till uh i'm gonna wait till the chat figures it out yes you did just watch a mic die this keeps happening break okay yeah sorry about that everyone i don't know what i was last saying i was explaining uh so i have these rechargeable batteries i'm sorry that i still haven't corrected this they used to last for hours and it's going to happen again unfortunately this shows two bars though i should probably just replace it now to be safe i'm sorry about that i'm upgrading my equipment uh as you see i have a new streaming computer i have some new lights a new ipad uh guess what i didn't get new rechargeable batteries actually i kind of want to just get a new lav mic this lab mic i don't know if you know also does a lot of like rustling it's just one that i've had for years uh it might be good to get a new one if you have a suggestion of like what's top of the line i mean i don't want to you know i got a budget i'm working with here but i would like to have a very high quality lav mic that's wireless that i could use so if you have a good suggestion for that you could let me know i guess this is a good point for me to talk about today's sponsor all right everyone today's coding train is sponsored by curiositystream what's curiosity stream you might ask i'm going to play a little video for you from the founder of discovery channel comes a new independent streaming service curiosity stream home of groundbreaking documentaries and awardwinning original series follow your curiosity this is curiosity stream all right i'm back here let's see um so uh this is a curiosity stream it is um curiosity stream is the awardwinning destination for documentary films and tv shows covering every topic from space exploration to adventure to the secret lives of wild animals so the link that i have on the screen the one that's right above me right now if you sign up with that link you will get a 26 discount on the annual hd plan that's fourteen dollars like i love that i have this huge picture of levar burton here they actually have this wonderful series called beyond the spotlight which is about different you can see there's mr beast over here um i've been really enjoying this series i'm a huge levar burton fan so that was a uh that was a real pleasure to watch um i'm the magic numbers from um dr hannah fry this is one of my favorite um oops wait i pressed the wrong button no wait what's going on that's so weird oh it's like trying to play it through the monitor that's so strange oh look at that so my hdmi out you're not actually seeing what i'm seeing on my ipad screen because i've got it hooked through hdmi out it wants to play the series to the output which is at the correct aspect ratio which i'm not going to do right now i'm just going to come back to this uh you as you know i love numbers i love random numbers what's better than random numbers magic numbers so there are so many excellent um um so many excellent um documentaries here and awardwinning original series now i've also talked about before how i'm part of a group of educational uh youtube creators um and we together started a streaming service called nebula and um if i come back to here um you know basically nebula has adfree content and experiments with all different kinds of content and it's partnered with curiosity streams so if you sign up for curiosity stream using the link with the coupon for 14.79 for the whole year you will also this is not a promotion not a trial forever you will um also have um access to nebula and one of the things i want nebula has all these wonderful originals actually this bad law word's good i haven't gotten to watch it yet but i'm a big legal eagle fan on youtube so i'm definitely looking forward to checking that out um the one that i'm really been enjoying and i've just got to find it here called better elevation is a sort of compilation i would actually really like to make one of these it's a compilation of our series of different videos from different creators about next level technology and new tools to supercharge their production so like here's one from patrick williams how to switch how how switching codecs can speed up from cat black using creative color correction so like you know i'm kind of like a fan basically of all of these channels i hope i really adam neely has a grandma in creative use of 6k for youtube um jordan herrod one shot shooting saves time for the better i didn't know jordan made one of these actually i had not seen that one yet so um davinci resolve i gotta learn that so many great things so if you want access to these nebula originals um you can uh tom scott has one also um you can get it through the link so um it's a great way to support my channel uh educational content as a whole 14.79 per year it's 26 percent off uh just go to curiositystream.com codingtrain i am hoping to make i would like to propose to make a nebula original at some point um different kind of content than the sort of stuff that i'm doing on youtube maybe something about like live streaming in my setup so as you can see i've got a lot of technical things to work out before i feel like i can make a good better elevation video but if you have ideas uh for what you might want to see from me on a streaming service like nebula uh please let me know okay so thanks uh if you've got a minute take the time to sign up while i take a short break i'm gonna switch to this ah nope don't have a button for that i'm gonna take just like a two to three minute break um i'm going to i still have my mic going i'm adding the uh audio input capture for the laptop audio which means i can play this piece of music and i will be back in just a few minutes to try to do i wanted to talk about the discord.js stuff so i'll address that briefly you are not healing in the laptop audio there you go and then i will do a sort of trial run of some kind of coding challenge i got two or three minutes to think of what i'm gonna do see you in a few do do hey isn't there like a thing that's like a generative art prompt for every day of october jen tober i feel like i saw something like that on twitter does anybody have that can you link it to me i'm looking for that right now maybe that's what i'll do back in about a minute and 30 seconds bye okay i'm back how's everybody doing um it is 11 55. thank you uh of course to curiosity stream for sponsoring i don't know maybe uh actually like my entirely like incompetent haphazard like mess of talking about a sponsor will actually result in the most what is it called when somebody clicks on your link and then they they get the thing that you were that you were advertising for i don't even know anymore conversions okay thank you curacy stream and uh thank you nebula and all of my friends who are making wonderful educational content all around the world um a chaos pendulum oh and i see stig i see your comment yes um okay what am i going to do by the way there's a wonderful three blue one brown video that came out and it was uh suggested uh in the rainbow topics issues i don't uh i i don't i need something really simple that i can do um um great does advent of code so there's something i'm not am i there's something um that i um saw on twitter uh that was a generative art prompt or theme or challenge for every day of october or is it like upcoming in november does anybody know what i'm talking about did i already make have i made the um did i already do the dinosaur game it's funny how i'm like oh that would be a good one coding challenge oh with speech commands what is the simple what is something really simple that i can do now i'm taking your dick and your suggestions look at inktober inktober inktober prompts okay but i thought this was something that yes inktober but there's like a particular variation of this although i could just use the prompt what is today the 15th helmet peggle peggle what is peggle whoa okay that's interesting um oh you're not see what i'm looking at i i'm really bad at like having the right screen up here code vember is that it but that's for november yeah yes oh so is this like last ah it hasn't no but there's something going on now i saw people talking about it on twitter but this is kind of fun it's not november 15 2019 but if i clicked on this what would it say there is no project for this day by the way in case you're wondering i replaced the battery in um the other the mic receiver during the break all right this is this is not going very well um let's see if there's one of these that i could do wave collapse mathematical marbling sl oh slide puzzle perfect all right all right everybody generative inktober i like i like the slide puzzle idea it's done generative inktober that's from 2020 is there one going on now all right we're we're doing this we are doing a coding train slide puzzle all right let me try to get out let me so uh and i'm going to give myself 30 minutes this is going to be such a mess um okay so i am going to i should have done my spin the wheel thing but um all right so let's see i'm looking for the elgato application 4k capture utility i think that's it 4k devices in use by other software no i totally was doing this before do i have to run it first all right i have another idea wait why that's so weird i did i did this the other day though and i ran both obs and 4k capture utility you know how would you how would you all feel about me quitting obs for a second and seeing if i run obs second that'll probably work all right everybody um all right everybody all right everyone this is this is a little bit unorthodox and i deeply apologize i'm not turning the stream off i'm just going to press stop on open broadcast studio quit open broadcast studio so it'll look like your stream is broken for a moment i'm going to launch my 4k capture utility to hit record on it then i'm going to start obs back up again and see what happens okay i will be back i'm coming back i'm definitely coming back don't go anywhere i'll be right back okay okay am i back i think i'm back now um okay i uh sorry i've lost so much for example i have no longer have the chat open uh okay okay everybody relax i'm getting the chat open uh pop out chat there we go welcome to live chat okay all right now i have this working now i don't remember how do i select is it this button no settings must be settings there we go picture recording device ah one multiview okay apply no uh oh all right this is a little screen picture this is a total failure by the way okay the multiview thing that has completely stopped working stream link no just out of curiosity okay capture device quad i i know you can't see what i'm doing here i'm very frustrated that it's not working because i tested this earlier it was working earlier i don't really need to record all this to disk it just would be nice all right i'm going to just test something here very briefly um so hold on a second now i'm going to go to here it's not over i'm going to just here for a second actually i'm making a new scene multiview and then i'm going to do video capture device multi and do one there we go so this ah no signal no no this is fine it's this is 4k so i just need to fit to fit to screen there we go so this is oh and i don't know why the whiteboard one so i have this system which is set up to record this view of all of the feeds and i don't know why the whiteboard one now is missing oh because the camera went off okay so it's on no car did this come out so much technical oh there we go okay so this totally works i'm here i have nothing plugged into one of the ports which is that one whiteboard is over here if i walk over here now i'm over here and then laptop is over there so if i go back to here now i've got those combined um now why is my capture utility that should that's working there's no reason why i shouldn't be able to see all of them in the other software if i just hit record maybe it's actually recording it but i just don't see it let's see just bear with me i'm going to give up on this in a second i like that everyone's giving some docker help i like this obs challenge i guess i could just run two obs at once that might be actually my best bet where did it record this 4k capture test 4k today is 10 15 october 15th right so i'm opening up this video file view details good thing good thing i'm really getting this coding challenge i said i was going to do 5 12 p.m that's weird it's not 5 12 p.m okay okay clearly it's another recording is not working all right i have one other idea if you will just bear with me just a little bit longer um i am going to run a second instance of obs on this computer uh where if quick access now i don't want quick access i want to go to this pc and i want to go to view list i wish i could show i guess i could show you what i'm doing but uh where is obs is this in program files x86 or just in obs studio is here plugins bin 64bit okay obs 64. that must be what i'm running so if i just create a whole additional copy of it i need let's just copy it to the desktop just just for right now bear with me everybody copy paste okay i'm closing 4k capture utility thank you for bearing with me i know i said i had to leave at 12 30 but don't worry i'm gonna do something at the end i'm gonna make something happen here everybody now let's see will this actually run an entirely separate instance of obs obs is already running unless you meant to do this please shut down any existing instances before trying no i have meant to do this okay now oh what oh it needs to have a local profile okay hold on multiview oh this is working okay hold on how do i tell obs i've done this before i really should have done this before i started but i want to make this work i really want to make this work you could go you could do something else with your day it's fine i totally understand i totally understand this is going to help us out for next week or the week after the fact that i'm taking the time to do this now it's very hard to find time otherwise all right let's look there's a way like there is um run multiple instances of obs local like with separate like profiles or something um i've done this before um desktop shortcut properties okay is this what i'm um two instances with different settings is what i'm trying to do from 2019. yeah but i i can load okay uh okay portable mode portable mode that's what i want to do portable mode although maybe i can actually just use a different profile because there are profiles let's see if i try another profile uh so i'm going to do a make a 4k profile optimize for recording use uh no no no base canvas i want a custom how do i have a custom canvas i want it to be 3840 by 2160. base canvas is not giving me that as an option that's so weird i mean like 30. all right let's just do this right now so profile oh whoops oh no is it so weird um people are probably telling me things in the chat let me let me get the chat open here i'm going to give myself some extra time all right i've got the members live chat open here now whoops nothing nothing there okay hold on let me look at the youtube chat coding challenge okay okay all right i don't all right i want to do the portable thing so i need to do this portable thing so i need to run obs i think it was actually telling me this shortcut uh oh i saw this i saw this where's the portable command line parameter dash dash portable okay i think i know how to do this so if i create a shortcut i can add a command line argument in windows i believe so i'm going to the desktop oh my goodness um no i don't want this quick access thing is not helping me i don't want quick access i want to see my computer all the files what the heyho how do i get out of this windows quick access thing there we go this pc thank you users daniel desktop obs studio bin 64bit i know i'm a create shortcut i wish i could show you what i'm doing because this is very exciting create shortcut now i'm going to put that shortcut on the desktop then i'm going to hit properties and it has a target obs 64 exe shortcut key run can i just write in windows can i just do dash dash dash dash portable um just in the start in or just in their target in the windows shortcut i was like space dash dash portable okay apply let's see if this works it worked it worked everybody i have an entirely separate instance of obs going optimize for recording base canvas all right hold on i'm gonna get out of this auto configuration wizard uh so obs base canvas resolution where do i set that well i guess i could probably find a canvas size um all right i bet you i can find this i'm just going to go to settings no not studio mode settings uh output simple advanced no video base canvas here we go why does it not give me that as an option okay this is so crazy i've never had this problem before all right so like what what the issue i have 4k based canvas open broadcast studio well let's see here this is pretty recent this is the resolution it's missing settings you need you can now type the resolution manually oh was it gonna let me type it manually oh i could just type over it it has a drop down menu but it's not an option in the drop down menu but i could just type over it okay 3840 by two one six zero is that right and then the output resolution should be three four zero okay 30 frames per second okay now uh settings output um video output oh mp4 apply uh add a video capture device create new okay this is uh i'm going to call it multi and then i'm going to grab cam link pro 1 multiview which should be 4k perfect i'm in business everybody i'm in business and i have the mic so it's going to record the mic but i'm going to change the properties to mono advanced audio properties uh make it mono so now i have an entirely separate okay so just in case you're following along i mean all like three of you that are left i can't see who's here i can see the chat but i've lost all my other like control panels um i now have um two instances of obs running one instance is the one that is live streaming right now it is not recording anything to disk it could be recording to disk but it's not and it has all the different views that is like tied to my uh nice little uh stream deck here so i can switch and go to just this view or this view or this view et cetera and i totally messed up the whiteboard in the camera but that's up and of course the camera goes off oh what excellent timing okay hold on everybody about two hours in this always seems to happen this coding challenge might not happen but i'm making progress people you might not see it or believe it this is plugged in so it's not the battery oh it's like it's actually losing its charge i think i probably should take the battery out it's kind of crazy how this is plugged in and yet is this not yeah it's plugged this camera is plugged in and yet the full battery is now at half charge who knows why okay and then i have a separate obs and you know what uh i'm just gonna uh i'm just so this the other obs in case you're wondering looks like this so the other obs looks like this actually in 4k what you're seeing is not in 4k i have sampled it back down and so as soon as i hit start recording i am now recording all of these separate feeds to disk at the same time as live streaming this this is actually by the way what i have done previously just uh not at the same time so i have with members of the coding train when i record a new video i live stream the actual 4k layout while i'm recording but now i have the possibility in theory if this works of both live streaming uh and recording all of these feeds to disk so that whatever i do during the live stream could be reedited and things could be like mixed and matched in different ways if necessary into a video so let's try a coding challenge let's try a slide puzzle now if i'm being perfectly honest um i have a feeling that this is not going to go well i'm probably not going to make it work or finish this or end up editing this into a separate video so this is just a trial run no pressure i would really like to do this as a coding challenge video so consider this a rehearsal i mean the point of the coding challenge videos is to not rehearse but it might that just might have to happen now i also would like to give myself a timer and i'm i'm just going to send a text message to explain that i'm going to be a little bit late i don't know where my phone is here it is because i need to give myself an extra 30 minutes here um oh awesome need uh 30 more minutes so 1pm i'm going to turn into a pumpkin at 1 pm i'm turning into a pumpkin i really should check that this is recording to disk all right i'm just going to hit stop i'm just going to hit stop recording to disk i'm just going to look at the file very briefly i mean if it's not working i'm not doing the setup anymore i'm just going to go into the coding challenge but i would like to know if it's working videos today is october 15th here is the file um i think it looks good it looks like there might be some choppiness to the frame rate i think i know why that is and i'm not going to worry about it right now and i will deal with fixing that later i have an idea for a way of doing this better but i'm just going to record again so now once again i'm recording the disk i have live streaming i'm going to close all of these things out we're going to say slide puzzle this is actually really good because i do have a coding challenge video that has been recorded that hasn't come out yet about the copy function and i think i need to use the copy function for this tim rhodenbrecker let me just introduce you to the most patient person in the world tim i'm going to accept i accept all of your cookies please send me cookies i love cookies actually if you uh vegan cookies please if possible it's just kind of like the nondairy thing i mean eggs i do eat eggs anyway we don't need to get into that but um no one's sending me cookies who am i kidding you should check out um tim rodenbrooker's and i'm apologies if i'm mispronouncing the name um website live streams videos creative coding stuff um tim gave a donation to the processing foundation last year's holiday fundraiser i am still a half to the end i have until the day of the next holiday fundraiser to finish releasing the videos based on those donations this one is recorded tim i like probably owe you an email from like six months ago if you're listening uh please everybody check out tim's wonderful work and stay tuned this video is coming out of the coding train about the copy function um okay um so now now that i did that little ad for tim uh i need uh a um i need an image to do as the slide puzzle all right i guess we're gonna use the coding train train and um coding train train i must have that somewhere let me just i'm going to go into my google drive for a second oh let's we could use choo choo bot i love choo choo bot choo choo bot is like one of my favorite coding trained character so oh you gotta be kidding me you don't need to make me put in my password right now i've got a time time limit here folks it's 12 30 already all right it's got to be on choo choo bot png perfect well okay i'm showing you so i'm gonna go back to um this is the choo choo bot and so the good news about like doing this kind of thing where i'm recording everything to disc if i forget to switch to the right feed like i have all that material so even if it's sort of messed up in the live stream you can repackage it later to be better so choo choo bot i kind of want to do this in processing but i'll do this in p5 so i just need to upload choo choo bot upload file where is this file can i like see it show in finder i'm just gonna do save save as okay choo choo bot on the desktop uh let's just keep it a png well those are some loud birds uh whoops okay uh okay what is this what's the size of this file by the way 400 by 400 perfect couldn't be more perfect okay so i just want to before i begin the coding challenge i'm going to make a variable called source and source is going to load image ch choo choo bot.png and i don't need this open anymore which will give me more room for the code um we're going to just draw we don't need draw right now well i mean we do need draw right now i'm just going to draw the image source zero zero what did i do wrong here oh yeah choo choo but choo choo up can i just rename it here choo choo bot okay okay everybody so one thing though that i think that i might try to be mindful of if the idea is to actually repurpose this is to not do a lot of my own zooming because now that can happen better in postproduction uh okay um okay everybody yes there we go ready everyone do their spread okay by the way i have the discord member live chat going on here so i can see that here and i have the youtube chat over here this is actually a really good way of doing it and incidentally i suppose i mean i don't want to this is a way that i could actually show what's happening in discord on the live stream by switching over to it but i don't want to do that right now because i guess i could go to like uh yeah anyway um okay so slide puzzle where's my timer i'll do a timer on my phone okay clock timer 30 minutes this is 30 minutes okay i'm going to try to make a slide puzzle in 30 minutes you won't be able to see the timer i'm sure we could create some type of better system for doing this that would be ah the camera no no not the camera not the camera jeez louise people what if i take the battery out would that help it's plugged in are you overheating why why do you go off you look you've got you're plugged in you've got a charge i see no reason for you to turn yourself off camera all right i don't wanna i guess i'm just gonna have to like reset you and i have to like walk half a mile around to get back to my desk area here okay everybody okay stop i haven't started the timer yet ready everybody welcome folks to a coding challenge i haven't done one of these in a while i'm gonna set myself a timer here 30 seconds 30 seconds oh my god 30 minutes and i'm going to attempt to make a slide puzzle so this is the source image that i'm going to use i need to chop it up into a bunch of pieces allow you to like click to move the pieces around and see if you could solve it to put it back together and have something detect when it's put back together that it works there's almost no chance that i'm going to get this done in 30 minutes but you know c'est la vie here i go all right so one of the things that we need to use that i need to use for this is the copy function because what i want to do first is just take this image and chop it up into a bunch of smaller images so let me call those uh the pieces and i'll make an array and then in setup uh and i should figure out how many columns and rows that i want so let's just make it it's right now it's a 400 by 400 so let's just make it four by four um and so the um and i also i'm going to probably want to keep track of like the width and height of each piece i probably should do this in like an objectoriented way where there's like class piece and but that's not happening right now um so we i'm going to say uh 4 let i equal 0 i is less than the number of columns and then j is less than 0 j less than the number of rows and then w o w is the width of the canvas divided by the number of columns h is the height of the canvas divided by the number of rows okay and then for each one of these i need to make a new image or the new the image is a piece of the larger image i'm going to turn off auto refresh for a second so i need to take the source image and copy from it oh i think i could just use get i'm really obsessed with the idea of using copy because hopefully by the time this video comes out there will be an entire video all about the copy function and processing in p5 let's look at the reference um oh i know i remember i think i remember how copy works but maybe i could just use get because get i believe it returns an array of rgba values which is not what i want i want an actual like image i want a sub image p5 image oh so array of sub image from a p5 image yeah that's what this is well i i maybe copy is what i want i know copy will work um in the sense that i can copy from this image onto this image let's use copy so this is fine i'm going to use copy because i know it's going to work and the first thing i'll do is create a blank image that is the size of one of the pieces i really want to use the whiteboard just because i have a whiteboard this is going to take up too much time i've got 26 minutes left but if you don't mind humoring me for a second i'm gonna go over here to oh and i'm gonna have to erase the whiteboard that's gonna take quite a bit of time and i i don't have an eraser i'm in a new space this is the first this is momentous this is the first coding challenge in my new space this whiteboard it rolls around it's very shaky i put it together myself it did a terrible job putting it together i hope this is all recording i need to find a marker okay this is great oh i feel i feel alive oh this okay so the idea here is i have a source image and what i first want to do is on my canvas i want to take i'm going to chop this up one two three one two three into four by four and i want to take this section of the image and place it on the canvas but keep this as a separate variable like a piece so that these pieces can be locked to a part of the original oh i really need it i just need a knot i'm going to i got to do this object oriented right because the piece should know where its home base is as well as where it currently is so if they're being shuffled when all the pieces are in the right place we've won so what do i need to make a class a piece class that has the um it's like cur it's like a current index like if i number all these zero one two three four five six seven blah blah blah blah i wanna keep track of where it currently is as well as um as well as where it's original spot it's it's home bases so we know when the puzzle solved all right let's let's do that it's worth it it'll be worth it how's this going uh all right um i'm looking at the chat okay let's see um now so let me i gotta open this up here i'm gonna make a new javascript file and i'm going to call it piece.js tile it's probably tile is what they are right let's call it tile.js so i have a tile class and what does it have in it it has the index so i'm going to pass that in as an argument and it has its image okay so i mean there's probably more to do with this but i'm basically just want to wrap the idea of the image's piece and where it's supposed to be in to this constructor okay good here we go uh so now what i'm actually doing is i'm still creating the image then i'm saying copy uh what am i copying i'm copying from the source zero zero oh no no no no the in the source the x location is i times the width the y location is j times h and i'm copying from the source i j with height 2 0 0 with height so if this is confusing to you thank goodness i have a white board even though my lighting needs to be fixed and there's so many issues but let me explain what's going on here right each one of these pieces is an image i didn't switch the button but that's okay because i'm recording it all but i'm running over here there now at least you can see it if you're watching this live each one of these pieces is a standalone image where this is zero zero and its height is with an h but if i'm copying this one and it's column two row one boy this is like so messy this whiteboard but that's fine um then basically i need to know what is this location this location is column times width height row times height and then so take this section and copy it to this part of the piece all right so now um and i think this is right right it's um it should be the source image source x source y source to the destination so um it doesn't show you calling this on an image but that's fine that's what i'm doing i want to copy the source image at this location to this destination which is image at this location great then i need to make a a tile is a new tile with an index oh the camera went off the camera went off it's just it's like just like the old days nothing has changed on the cutting trade doesn't matter how many years i do this i have to reset the camera it's part of the time why why it's plugged in you're plugged in there's no reason for your power to go dark okay i have to run this is good i'm gonna get so many steps for my steps challenge okay um index and then the image now what is the index the index is the uh i'm not going to use any twodimensional arrays here i'm just going to keep track of um the the the individual index counting zero one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen zero three fifteen sixteen total tiles uh press this button so the index is i plus j times the number of columns um and the so that's a new tile and then i should be able to let's just put let's call this tiles let's just put all the tiles into an array just out of curiosity now let me loop through that array and uh say and actually you know what might be good this is just gonna make my life so much easier i'm gonna keep track of the index the column and the row because i actually just want to give it its uh well no because it's going to move around i don't know what i'm doing right now let's do ah okay i have an idea let's make let's make a variable called board so this is the board the board is an array of all of the elements in the order that they're in so um and i'm gonna eventually need to put a negative one for the empty one but um so board push index so basically i'm gonna have an array that keeps track of the positions of all of the tiles and then this is a little bit silly but i'm going to do it this way i'm gonna i'm gonna just always use a nested loop just to get that index and then i'm going to say board index uh um i guess show so let me just do uh yeah which why would make sense to keep track of uh you know what uh this is a little bit weird what i'm doing okay i have to think i have to think i have to think i have to think just you know rain going churning i have 18 minutes left this is wonderful oh so much time so much time ah my by the way this this came alive the uh stream deck buttons uh now now there's the coding coding train discord and there's 205 of you supposedly watching this right now all right um okay let me think about this for a second let me be a little bit more thoughtful here i was trying to avoid using a twodimensional array but maybe that's silly so ah yes so i want to have this array which i'm going to call board and it's going to have like it'll be all of the numbers shuffled in random order so as i go through i yes i draw the image at that spot like the zero spot what the zero spot would be x and y but i go look up image three or index three from my uh array of all the tiles i don't know if that made sense to you but i had to walk over to the whiteboard to sort of think through that in other words x is this is exactly what i'm doing x is i times w y is j times h and then the image i want to draw is board index well it's not yeah board uh is it's actually like tiles board index i mean this is like a crazy way to write it but i basically want the number the index that's in the array called board to tell me which tile to look up so so this is tile i'll call it like tile index or i think this might be a nice way of writing it right now they'll be in order because i haven't shuffled it right i'm putting them all in order and then i should be able to say image image x comma y so i'm hoping that when i run this sketch i'm going to identically see the image because the only things that i've done is chop it up into a bunch of tiles put those tiles in order no i should just i don't like does anybody know this is a sony alpha seven it doesn't just go off after a certain amount of time because it's obviously been on it was on for the whole first hour of the stream without going off and now it just keeps going off um right and lucas is saying in the chat that i could do index modulus columns y index divided by columns i don't know why i'm like for some reason i that math like hurts my brain i was like i'm doing i'm doing all this like gymnastics to avoid doing that but that would certainly make a lot of sense all right what i want to say is when i run this i chopped up the image put them into an array in order and then i'm going and getting them one at a time and showing them all right what happened there's an errors copy could not be called as a function create image was expecting a string oh oh am i supposed to do create imedge yeah so i think i did the dom image element by accident tile is not defined oh so no problem no problem yep tile.js that's a file i'm working with thank you very much uh failed to execute draw load pixels hmm all right hold on let's just do create okay p5 reference uh yeah create image load picks maybe i just need to call load pixels i thought to do copy i don't need to but i must oh and all sorts of weirdness happened here and then let's do like image update pixels let's try that signature not supported what is going on what just happened what signature not supported what is going on well let me take this out okay the sketch is running uh let's do this one okay uh okay we're good create image load pixels oh wait it's source that i need to load pixels i need to load the pixels from source but what is this signature not supported did i forget to say like rgb here i don't think that usually matters copy oh like i guess like the way that i am okay i'm just gonna google copy i'm sure that is a path towards me solving this problem no not right now i've totally done this is is this why i switched to processing in my other video checkline 25 parameters are wrong i know uh oh look at this i deleted some stuff ah i when i was like mucking around some stuff got deleted i need all those numbers all those numbers and i want to sort copy it from x comma y yikes okay i don't need this rgb thing okay now we're getting somewhere uh i don't know if i need all these load pixels and update pixels still good okay everybody oh hold on oh image equals tile dot image so i need to pull the image property out of the tiles no okay update pixels copy all right hold on tiles oh hold on let's take a look at what's going on here how do i find the uh must be this usually this lets me find and like log the right now this is like ah there we go all right so tiles there is okay so let's console.log tile index um the camera went off again yeah it's got to be overheating which is weird this one doesn't seem to be overheating i should switch cameras it's on the same amount of time it did go off at one point i told you this would be a total fail this year i camera keeps going off then i got stuck on a weird bug okay um let's look at the uh let me put no loop in here oh i have eight minutes left nine minutes left okay so all those numbers came out okay so am i getting an image so there's an image where's the x and y those are the right locations let's take out all these like load pixels and update pixels ah so somehow load was it load pixels and update pixels very much unnecessary do i need this one yeah okay i didn't need any of the low pixels and update pixels there's a little bit of a mystery here i definitely want to use the pixels but i have a feeling that and sometimes when you need access to the pixel array directly you've got to like in advance load the pixels and when you change the pixel array you have to update the pixels i have a feeling here copy is doing the work for us so we're good now you might not believe me now this is actually showing it as separate tiles now let me let me prove this by um trying to think of like by just drawing some lines over it um this is going to be a slightly awkward way of doing it but let me just do stroke weight two no fill oh but this is silly i'm just drawing the lines for they're actually like if i change this to like width minus with minus 10 height minus like if i make the images smaller right okay i just wanted to show you that i am actually they are separate pieces okay so uh i i visually it might help i think to actually just draw little thin lines over it with the rectangles and this is very silly this extraneous kind of code that i'm doing but um i think this will help yeah so i just wanted to draw some lines over it now now we are really getting somewhere because in theory if all i do is shuffle this array right have all of the elements of the array in random order then i should see the image chopped up and moved around so let's do that six minutes left so i'm going to write a function called shuffle which receives an array and then i'm going to just say like um a hundred times pick element one well let's do r1 is array dot rand a random number floor a random number between zero and the length of the array r2 is floor a random number between zero and the length of the right now in theory i don't want these two elements to be the same but i'm doing it a bunch of times i want to swap i'm just the way i'm going to shuffle the array is by picking any two elements and swapping their place so now temp is that arrays r1 value then and you know i'm going to need i'm going to write a swap function because i'm going to need that i think also when i move the pieces so function swap is swap index i and j of an array so temp is index i and then that arrays i element is the j element and the j element is that temporary value now you might be wondering like what what and there's a way i know there's some like spread operator or oh maybe there's like deconstructing an array like can i do something like this array like there's some kind of like i there's some kind of um object deconstruction way i can do a swap and i'll put it up on the screen if i ever make this into an edited video but basically the oldfashioned oh the old old way that we used to swap our elements in an array is we take element one store it somewhere temporary because we need to put a new thing in that spot and then we saved it temporarily we could put that thing we saved in the spot that just the other thing came out of so if i just did this if i just did this it looks right like i should be j and j should be i but if i is j then j will be j because i is now j and oh it's just not good so temporary stuff okay so now i want to swap r1 r2 in that array so let's shuffle the array um let's i don't need to shuffle the tiles the tiles is just an array of elements i'm shuffling the array that's keeping track of the index indices of all of them maybe i didn't need these two arrays but it's the way that i'm thinking of it right now shuffle the board oh hmm board is what did i miss i missed something obvious probably uh oh i'm already using shuffle as a variable ah maybe is that oh is that up oh you know what i think there might be a p5 function already for this there's a p5 shuffle and it uses probably a fancier algorithm whatever this fischer yates shuffle algorithm is which has all these beautiful visualizations and of course my camera is off what a what a mess how long ago did it go off come back well good thing i wrote that p5 shuffle function i'm sorry well good well good thing i wrote my own shuffle function p5 the reason i'm getting that error is there already is a global function in p5 called shuffle and it uses this uh fischer yates shuffle algorithm which i can only assume is better than whatever i did although is it the same i don't know we could read this page and discover we should it could be another coding challenge the fischer yates shuffle algorithm okay but thankfully for us what was what's this argument modified a past array optional what does that do is it oh modifying the array or keeping the additional one well you know what i'm gonna do uh i'm just gonna call this a simple shuffle that way and i could use the p5 one you should try it yourself there we go look i have mixed up the elements all right so one thing that for it to be a slide puzzle that i need to do is i need to be able to i'm thinking i'm thinking i'm thinking remove one of them so i should also pick a random one simple shuffle and then i should pick i mean i and then i should pick a random one to remove or do i always want to remove like the top left one how do slide puzzles work is it always the bottom right one that's missing does anybody know that's the timer going off [Laughter] oh and then by shuffling the tiles randomly you could end up with an unsolvable sliding puzzle oh bottom right so actually i don't want to shuffle this way because i want to remove the bottom right one so uh columns and then let's just delete the last one pop is it pop and that'll be empty okay great so as long as uh as long as if tile index is greater than zero draw the image so now whoops oh greater than greater than negative one okay so now i have made the board um and i i could shuffle it i could still shuffle it now now but this isn't going to be this is not what i want to do but this shuffling is no good because in theory now is it possible that it's unsolvable or is is it always possible to move them around because what i could do is i could instead of i need a move basically i need a function that like moves one element so i need to know where the negative one is oh oh this is a hard problem and it is 108 p.m i can do this i'm so close i'm so close um let me just get a move function going okay i'm gonna take out this no loop okay so function move so the function is going to receive a given index so the first thing i need to know is is that so the idea is i'm clicking on an index like i'm going to click on one of them and it's only a valid move if it's above below to the right or to the left so i do need this function like uh the column is index well you know what i couldn't i could pick a random column or row so that function so then uh i need to know where the negative one is so let's let's just have a variable blank spot is uh and then the blank spot is i guess i could always oh this is so bad you know what i'm going to do i'm going to write a function find blank uh um obviously there's better ways to track all this so this is a way to quickly check all of it to find which one is blank and then so i have that index so the blank the blank column is the blank the blank spot modulus the number of columns and the blank row is floor the blank index divided by the number of rows that's the inverse of putting it back i should just use the twodimensional array okay so that's the blank column in row so now if so i and j if i and j is a neighbor if is neighbor i j blank um there's got to be an easier way to check if it's a neighbor right so if it's a neighbor then swap blank with i plus j j times columns of that array so the move basically the idea of doing a move is uh there's a spot that i want to move and i need to find if it's if it's a proper neighbor to the blank spot then it can be swapped with it oh no that's not yeah yeah yeah when you move a thing and tile into it it becomes the blank spot okay so i just need now an is neighbor function you the viewer will write this in a so much better way i'm on a time crunch here i'm way over my 30 minute limit uh function is neighbor of uh i'm just doing x1 y1 x2 y2 so um let me do i j i j x y so it's a valid neighbor if so first if i is not equal to x and j is not equal to y return return false so it's either got to be in the same column or the same row so if they're both not the same then it's not a neighbor then if the absolute value of i minus x equals 1 it's one spot away or the absolute value of j minus y if it's one spot away return true and i know i could return like the result or whatever and yeah so otherwise otherwise it's the same spot so i'm just gonna say return false if it gets to the end i think this will work just did that kinda like awkwardly right it's gotta both be in either the same column or row and one spot away so now shuffling so what shuffling is should be picking a move random uh columns and random rows obviously i could pick from the valid neighbors but that's too much work that's just fine i'm just going to pick randomly enough times that they'll be valid moves camera cool down it's very cool here in the garage it's a nice cool day i really need to get going i'm 45 minutes over but i'm so close i'm so close all right so now i i know i'm gonna just repeat what i was saying i know i could uh just i know i could just pick from valid neighbors to do a move but if i do it enough times i'll pick valid neighbors enough times that this should work so now i should just say move r1 and r2 and move if it's a finds the blank spot and if the blank spot is a neighbor it swaps it with i don't know if this is going to work let's just try it uh array ah move i guess move should the function should get the array i mean i'm only using one array so it's a little bit silly um but uh yeah there we go okay so that that's a valid shuffling now i'm just curious let me make this a random move function again i will refactor this later i mean i don't know if i will uh let's do random move so like if i do a thousand moves oh uh array it's a little bit silly how i have to like i'm not using global variables well okay so that should be a random shuffling that's possible but just out of curiosity in draw if i just said random move of the tiles this is very silly how i have arguments that somewhere and not other places yeah i got to fix this up later but i don't want to shuffle it i just want to see it do a one move per okay cannot read properties undefined image why random move of tiles hold on why can't i just do a random move all right what's going on here it works to do a bunch of them do i need to do it i mean this doesn't make any sense i mean if i do it at the beginning or not oh board it's the board there we go oh i'm not drawing the background so the old piece is there okay so this is it shuffling the puzzle randomly oh i love this so fun okay so now all i need to do now is have a mouse pressed function and i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna go back to shuffling it to start uh where where where where where where where so take out this and mouse press function is so the column that i'm clicking on is floor mouse x divided by the number of columns right and the row and i'm going to call this i and the row that i'm clicking on is floor mouse y divided by the number of rows and then move i j tiles now i'm not giving myself any feedback or i'm not seeing an animation all of those are things that i hope that you will add but in theory if i click on this one and i know the camera just went off but i know if i but but in theory if i click on one of them it should move if it's a valid neighbor what what did i i j array find blank so console log i j 60 whoops no no no divided by w and h not divided by the number of columns divided by the width of the column is it zero one or two okay it's like what am i losing my mind here okay no oh not the tiles not the tiles the board the board yeah look at that now i'm pressing the buttons and so now it is solved um if is solved if the board uh if so console log solved we will not have any fanfare just a console log solved so i'm going to write a function is solved where i'm going to go 4 let i equal 0 i is less than board dot length minus one i don't need to check the last one i plus plus and then if board index i is not equal to tiles index i dot index right isn't that didn't i save where it's supposed to be yes in the tile class then that's a piece that's in the wrong place so return false and if you get through everything all of them are in the right place return true so if i don't shuffle the board at all in setup it's solved it's showing me it's solved now if i shuffle it in setup it's not solved and i can solve it okay let's make it easier for me to solve oh my god i think i got this i think i did it you did it i think i made a slide puzzle um uh so let's just shuffle it simple shuffle like five times okay no it didn't pick oh there we go okay great so in theory all i need to do and i think it's this is left over from from the previous timer is just click on this element it will move up and go into place solved yay okay awesome so um just for fun because what are we doing but having fun i am going to uh have it be eight by eight and i am going to let it shuffle a hundred times well i guess i guess with more pieces it's not going to pick the thing randomly but hold on this is a little bit harder solved i did it no let's keep it but this is kind of fun because you realize you could do like you know a 20 by 20 slide puzzle here right and how many times do i need like you know obviously again i need a better shuffling algorithm but if i do it 10 000 times you know that's a lot of interesting moves there but let's go back let's go back to making it four by four and make this puzzle solvable for myself i'm gonna shuffle it just i'm gonna do a hundred random moves okay camera's off this is the last thing i'm doing let me and let me try this is the last thing i'm going to do i'm going to make it four by four i'm going to shuffle it just 100 times and let's see if i can solve this oh shoot oh wait a sec i think i did it yes i solved it all right so what can you do well you can be more thoughtful about what image you pick you could add animations there's a million opportunities to refactor this code to make it more s make more sense i mean this object could do so much i started like i need to make this object oriented but i did not follow through with that but also one prompt that i would have for you is there's no reason you couldn't do this with a video or some abstract generative art drawing i mean so many possibilities there because as long as you have an image even if it's an image that's changing over time you can shuffle it and you can solve it and a move counter for scoring so many things thank you for watching this coding challenge and i will see you next time on the coding train all right everybody uh that's all i got time for today uh i don't know if this i i think it's probably pretty unlikely that this is actually gonna get edited into something although i do think it's a nice um so if it doesn't work to edit what i did today i probably will off live streaming sometime on my own just kind of recreate this process so when you know i look forward to when all of you be like see the edited video that's released being like what you're wearing different clothes you did it so much more easily you really made it nicely object oriented so it might be a second pass of doing this but i'm gonna see if this can be edited uh and see what happens all right um i gotta go so i'm just gonna put on music and get out of here sorry they don't have time to answer any questions or say goodbye i might be back next friday or two weeks from today it could also be live streaming instead on a monday it all rains to be seen thank you again let me just give a big shout out to curiositystream sign up at curiositystream.comcodingtrain you get uh 26 off it's 15 for the entire year for all of the documentary documentaries plus access to watch nebula and all nebula and all the originals and things that
