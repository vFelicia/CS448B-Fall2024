00:00 - - It's time for a Coding
Train bonus episode. (laughs)
00:05 - (train whistling)
00:06 - I made this ridiculously terrible video
00:08 - about how to make a GIF loop.
00:09 - And you should really just
go look at Golan Levin's
00:11 - amazing resources.
00:12 - And different artists that I've mentioned,
00:13 - Saskia Freeke and Bees and Bombs,
00:15 - who are doing wonderful things.
00:17 - Then I made this video,
which I actually kind of love
00:19 - that makes a heart in processing.
00:21 - Just using like a nice
little math formula.
00:22 - Look at that.
00:23 - It's time to make a GIF loop of the heart
00:27 - for Valentine's Day.
00:28 - There I said it.
00:29 - It's Valentine's Day,
this is what we're doing.
00:30 - Alright, so first that I need is for this
00:32 - to always end where it started.
00:34 - So I have an idea for doing that.
00:36 - Which is that, if what I'm
doing is I'm adding these,
00:42 - I'm adding the vertices of
the heart over and over again.
00:45 - When I get to the end, all I want to do
00:47 - is start deleting the
ones from the beginning.
00:49 - So I should go back to
that idea of percent.
00:53 - So let me actually open up my other thing.
00:57 - So I'm going to open up the GIF loop code.
01:01 - This is my design.
01:03 - So what I need is this at the top.
01:06 - Then I need all my drawing stuff.
01:10 - And I'm going to put it
in the render function.
01:14 - And now the percent, the percent is going
01:18 - to tell me what to do with a.
01:20 - So, that angle.
01:26 - I'm going to have to change something.
01:27 - So let's just first do it this way.
01:28 - A equals map, percent, which
goes between zero and one
01:33 - to between zero and two pi.
01:36 - So right now, if I run this with record,
01:40 - and let me close this.
01:41 - This should just be, I've got my GIF loop.
01:46 - Let me just move
everything out of the way.
01:49 - I've got my GIF loop here
and I want record default.
01:52 - So I don't want to record yet.
01:54 - So now if I run this,
01:56 - we can see it's making the heart.
02:00 - Oh,
02:01 - oh, right.
02:02 - And then, okay, so that's the right idea
02:04 - but it's not looping because ultimately,
02:07 - I mean there's a bunch
of things I could do.
02:08 - Because I could say,
02:11 - if I record it, I mean in
a way I'm getting a loop,
02:13 - but I want it to like
shrink back down to zero.
02:16 - So I need the size.
02:19 - So basically I want percent,
I want this to be like,
02:23 - actually when percent
is between zero and .5,
02:28 - halfway through. I want to draw the heart.
02:32 - So I'm going to say, this is weird.
02:34 - But if percent is greater
than .5, is less than .5,
02:39 - less than or equal to .5. (laughs)
02:42 - There's probably a better
way way to do this.
02:44 - But I'm going to do it this way right now.
02:45 - I'm going to add points.
02:49 - Otherwise, I want to
remove the number of points
02:55 - that I've added.
02:56 - And I think it actually
is just going to work
02:58 - if I just say heart dot, how
do I delete something out of,
03:04 - I think if I just delete zero,
03:06 - that'll be like the oldest one.
03:10 - As I get, so let's try that.
03:14 - (laughs)
03:16 - That removed them all.
03:18 - What's going on here?
03:20 - Oh, but I still need to draw.
03:21 - I always need to draw it.
03:23 - Ahh.
03:24 - So I'm always drawing it no matter what.
03:27 - But I'm adding points for the first half
03:30 - and removing points for the second half.
03:33 - There we go!
03:35 - There's my loop.
03:36 - Yay!
03:37 - Okay, so now, guess what?
03:40 - I should make, add some colors and things.
03:43 - Oh, it should beat.
03:44 - People are saying it should beat.
03:46 - Of course it should beat.
03:47 - Okay, okay, we're going
to add beating to it.
03:49 - Okay, so there's no reason why the size,
03:52 - the size is being controlled
by this thing, r, here.
03:56 - So actually, let's take this out.
03:59 - Let's take this.
04:00 - So this will make it small, right?
04:03 - Right, so makes it small.
04:04 - So I can control the size here
just while I'm drawing it.
04:07 - Because I could say r times, r times.
04:12 - Great, so now what I want is the r to be,
04:17 - so I want an angle to be mapped,
04:21 - the percent between zero and one
04:23 - and maybe between zero and
two pi, but like times four.
04:27 - I probably want it to beat like four times
04:31 - within just the one.
04:32 - So I'm going to just map that
and then r equals map of sin
04:37 - of that angle, which goes
between negative one and one
04:40 - to between like
04:43 - height divided by 80 to
height divided by 40.
04:47 - So I think this would map
the size to a sin wave
04:52 - and the angle is getting
mapped from the percent.
04:54 - And so this would be
04:57 - and it should be a perfect
loop of it beating.
05:00 - Okay.
05:01 - I feel like I need to add
more color and stuff to this
05:03 - and it's kind of off-center.
05:05 - Hmm, alright.
05:06 - So let's see if this is a perfect loop.
05:08 - I have no idea if it's a perfect loop.
05:10 - It's weird, something was weird about it.
05:12 - It's not deleting all the points.
05:14 - Ha, this is crazy.
05:16 - This is actually kind of a nice effect.
05:19 - But I'm not deleting all of the points.
05:22 - I did, and am I just
getting some left over?
05:25 - Hold on.
05:26 - (bell rings)
05:27 - Guess what?
05:28 - The problem is I'm adding an extra,
05:32 - I'm adding that last vertex twice.
05:35 - Because I have less than equals there.
05:37 - So this is actually as simple
05:39 - as just getting rid of that equals there.
05:40 - I just want to use
percent is less than .5.
05:43 - I'm sure somebody in the
chat already said this.
05:44 - But now you see this loops perfectly.
05:48 - Let me add the heart beating back in.
05:50 - So I had that from before where I had r
05:54 - mapped to the result of a sine function.
05:56 - And so if I do that,
05:59 - I'm pretty sure this is
a perfect loop still.
06:03 - Is that beating too fast?
06:05 - Slower beating, people are saying.
06:07 - So to slow down the beating,
I'm going to just do
06:09 - two pi times two.
06:13 - Is that better?
06:14 - Anyway, you can work on,
you can make (laughs)
06:16 - your own version of this.
06:17 - (laughs) This is fine for me right now.
06:19 - I got to end this video.
06:20 - I am now going to change record to true.
06:23 - I'm going to hit run.
06:26 - It's going to finish that.
06:28 - I'm going to look in the folder
06:30 - and I can see I have all the images there.
06:32 - I'm just going to check the
last one, which looks like that.
06:35 - And the first one,
06:38 - yeah, I think this will
match up perfectly.
06:40 - Which basically the first one is empty.
06:42 - So I think coming all the way down to zero
06:44 - and back up will work.
06:45 - So the website that I used before,
06:47 - although there's a
variety of different ways
06:48 - you can make a GIF stitched
out of a bunch of images,
06:50 - is this GIF maker, ezGIF.com/maker.
06:55 - So I can click Choose Files
and I go to my output directory
07:00 - where I have all those.
07:00 - I can hit command A, select all the files,
07:04 - and then click Upload and make a GIF.
07:06 - So it's now uploading all those images.
07:09 - And we can see them all here now.
07:10 - I could do all sorts of
things to fuss with them.
07:13 - And I'm curious to add
this crossfade frames.
07:15 - Let's try adding that.
07:16 - Oh, that's a bad idea.
07:18 - I don't know.
07:19 - Let's make the delay time three
one-hundredths of a second,
07:21 - that's more like 30 frames per second.
07:23 - And then it's not exact,
07:25 - and then I'm going to click Make a GIF.
07:26 - And then the cat is going
to, going to wait for my GIF.
07:29 - Hi, cat. Meow meow.
07:31 - Make me my GIF.
07:32 - Oh, and
07:34 - my GIF is ready.
07:35 - Yay.
07:36 - Now I just do Save Image
As heart GIF, there it is.
07:43 - Thank you everybody. (lips smacking)
07:44 - I love you, I hope you enjoyed
07:46 - this special about using, special?
07:49 - (laughs) This video about using
math to draw a heart curve
07:52 - and then animating it as
an infinitely looping GIF.
07:56 - And I just can't wait to
see all of the different,
07:58 - I just want to be flooded with heart GIFs.
08:01 - Just flood me with heart GIFs.
08:03 - (train whistling)
08:04 - Make them 3D, make them rainbow
colors, put stars in them,
08:07 - and cupcakes and whatever
you can think of.
08:09 - I'll see you in a future coding challenge.
08:10 - Goodbye. Mwah.
08:12 - (upbeat music)

It's time for a Coding Train bonus episode. (laughs) (train whistling) I made this ridiculously terrible video about how to make a GIF loop.
