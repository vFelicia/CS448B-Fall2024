00:00 - hello and welcome to another coding
00:01 - challenge in this coding challenge I am
00:03 - going to continue a series that I've
00:05 - been doing about algorithmic botany one
00:07 - of my favorite topics I'm here to tell
00:09 - you that if you like sunflowers and
00:10 - likes of flowers then this is the video
00:13 - for you to watch because what I want to
00:15 - talk about is a topic called Philo Texas
00:18 - and I want to examine what phyllotaxis
00:20 - is I want to look at the math behind
00:21 - phyllotaxis hopefully pronouncing that
00:23 - right and I want to create a nice shiny
00:26 - rainbow colored phyllotaxis example so
00:29 - this is the Wikipedia page phyllotaxis
00:31 - it comes from the ancient Greek Phylon
00:34 - meaning leaf and taxes meaning
00:36 - arrangement so it's a kind of spiral
00:37 - pattern that you see often in nature
00:39 - it's connected to both the Fibonacci
00:41 - sequence interesting thing to look up if
00:43 - you're not familiar with and also the
00:45 - golden ratio so the reference that I'm
00:48 - going to use is from this algorithmic
00:50 - botany algorithm botany org from the
00:52 - University of Calgary website there's a
00:54 - free pdf book the the math for
00:58 - everything I'm going to do is right here
01:00 - in this paper chain in chapter 4 of this
01:02 - book and you look at this and you think
01:03 - Greek letters and square roots and all
01:06 - that sort of stuff but I'm here to tell
01:08 - you this is actually going to be
01:09 - something quite simple so all I want to
01:11 - do is I want to rewrite those formulas
01:13 - kuna by sound board went off by accident
01:16 - I want to rewrite those formulas over
01:19 - here I'm going to say a fee or fahai I
01:23 - could never remember equals n times one
01:26 - thirty seven point five degrees this is
01:29 - a very very special angle hearts and
01:35 - stars for this angle one hundred thirty
01:37 - seven point five degrees one of my
01:39 - favorite angles everybody should have a
01:40 - favorite angle in their life I think and
01:42 - then also I want to say R equals C times
01:45 - the square root of n so you can see this
01:49 - is all we need so why in the first place
01:52 - do we need an R and an angle well this
01:54 - is why this is a coordinate space a
01:58 - Cartesian coordinate space with an
02:00 - x-axis and a y-axis and we're going to
02:02 - plot every point in this spiral pattern
02:05 - based on an x value and a y value so
02:08 - this is a point it's some X and
02:10 - why points however what the phyllotaxis
02:13 - math is going to give us is not an x and
02:16 - a y but a radius and an angle the radius
02:19 - being the distance from 0 0 that's R and
02:23 - the angle being the direction so you're
02:26 - going to see like this spiral pattern
02:28 - come out and we're going to draw all
02:29 - these circles each with a different
02:30 - radius that's either growing that's
02:32 - growing in an angle that's incrementing
02:34 - so we need to whip but but in np5 or
02:38 - processing or whatever programming
02:39 - environment is you might use I'm going
02:41 - to say like ellipse I want to draw a
02:42 - circle at a given x and y so what I need
02:45 - to be able to do is convert the radius
02:47 - and the angle 2 and x and a y and how do
02:51 - I do that I used something called polar
02:53 - to Cartesian coordinate transformation
02:56 - that sounds kind of fancy but basically
02:58 - I need a formula to go from my R and
03:01 - theta R and Phi or theta or fee or
03:03 - whatever angle R an angle to X&Y and the
03:07 - formula for that actually just uses
03:09 - cosign by the way if you say cosine of
03:11 - this angle it equals a cosine of this
03:16 - angle equals adjacent over hypotenuse x
03:20 - divided by r rx equals R times cosine of
03:24 - that angle and y equals R times sine of
03:27 - that angle we do the same thing with
03:29 - sine so these are these formulas you're
03:31 - going to see in our code and these
03:32 - formulas are going to see in the code
03:34 - now this looks a little weird the only
03:36 - thing here is is really are the only
03:38 - thing but we're calculating R and and
03:40 - the angle in order to get the X and the
03:42 - y in order to do that we need to have an
03:45 - N and to see what is n n is we're going
03:48 - to make a whole lot of dots for this
03:51 - phyllotaxis pattern and n is the number
03:53 - of the dot is it dot number zero dot
03:55 - number one number two number three
03:57 - number four and C is a number for a
04:00 - scaling pattern so you'll see that in a
04:02 - bit let's start to write some actual
04:03 - code so I'm going to come back over here
04:04 - and uh here we go I'm going to come back
04:11 - to the code - I usually to come to the
04:13 - code yet so let's just look this is some
04:15 - p5.js code I'm going to it's running
04:18 - here in the browser it does nothing but
04:20 - draw a blank canvas but I'm going to
04:22 - create a variable n
04:24 - which equals zero and I'm going to say n
04:27 - plus plus right this is the first thing
04:29 - that I'm doing because each frame and
04:31 - actually I want to draw my background
04:33 - and set up each frame I'm going to draw
04:35 - a new dot and I'm going to how am I
04:38 - going to draw that dot I'm going to say
04:40 - angle equals what was the formula again
04:43 - n times one thirty seven point five so n
04:50 - times one thirty seven point five and
04:53 - the radius equals what C times the
04:58 - square root of n so we need to come up
05:00 - with what C is let's make up a number
05:02 - for right now let's make up a number
05:05 - what - I know you're going to play with
05:09 - that number and we're going to see a
05:09 - bunch of different variety of results
05:11 - okay so now that we have a and are being
05:14 - calculated we can also remember now all
05:17 - we need are these two formulas to
05:18 - calculate x and y so now I'm going to
05:22 - say VAR x equals R times cosine of that
05:26 - angle VAR y equals R times sine of that
05:28 - angle and then also the thing is I want
05:31 - everything to be drawn relative to the
05:33 - center of the window so I'm also going
05:35 - to add a width divided by 2 and add
05:39 - height divided by 2 that's just to take
05:42 - because if you look at my diagram over
05:44 - here I'm thinking about everything is
05:46 - calculated relative to an origin point
05:48 - but in the computer graphics window the
05:50 - origin point is the top left and so I
05:52 - want to shift everything over okay so
05:54 - now I'm just gonna say ellipse X comma Y
05:57 - and I don't know I'll make the ellipse
05:58 - you know eight pixels or whatever and
06:00 - I'm going to just say fill 255 and then
06:05 - we're gonna run this program I don't
06:07 - know why I'm condensing all the code so
06:08 - no white space here we go let's run it
06:10 - see what happens hey look that looks
06:11 - pretty good
06:12 - something's happenin here oh wait I
06:14 - think we finished I think we did this
06:16 - already look that kind of looks like a
06:17 - cool little spiral pattern well let's um
06:19 - let me let me show you something special
06:21 - I'm gonna just expand C for a second
06:23 - whoa that's way too much uh there we go
06:27 - so well okay no this is not where oak is
06:29 - nevermind let's try to live code that's
06:32 - not going to work let's make C a little
06:34 - bit bigger actually I'm gonna make it a
06:36 - lot bigger just for a second sure
06:38 - make it 20 you can see what C is doing
06:40 - is it's actually sort of a scaling
06:42 - factor so how much is that radius
06:44 - changing right you can see here the
06:47 - radius is equal to the square root of
06:48 - the number times C so if I'm drawing my
06:51 - circles at 8 pixel with a diameter of 8
06:54 - pixels let's try making that C actually
06:57 - just something like 4 and you can see we
07:00 - can start to sort of see that pattern
07:01 - let me make the circles a little bit
07:03 - smaller let me just say no stroke also
07:07 - maybe and then we can run this again and
07:09 - we can start to see there's that
07:11 - phyllotaxis spiral pattern there it is
07:14 - beautiful
07:15 - there we go in a way I'm kind of done
07:18 - right now I could sort of play with I
07:20 - could play with the scaling factor I
07:22 - could still actually play with the angle
07:23 - as well and if you go if we go back and
07:25 - looked at this paper you'll see down
07:27 - here like oh look at this
07:28 - here are some different kinds of
07:30 - patterns we could get if we kind of futz
07:32 - with the angle this one here as an angle
07:34 - of 1 37.3 not my favorite angle but a
07:38 - perfectly reasonable angle so let's run
07:41 - this and see what we get and you can see
07:44 - how this fire what kind of spiral
07:45 - pattern we get now which is kind of
07:47 - interesting in and of itself the other
07:49 - thing we can start to think about what
07:51 - we might do is how we might color the
07:54 - dots in a more interesting way so one
07:56 - thing that I could do here is just use a
07:59 - HSB color so I'm going to do you know
08:01 - what I don't think this is right I think
08:04 - this whole time I'm getting something
08:07 - sort of vaguely interesting and correct
08:09 - but I think that my angle mode I don't
08:12 - think this is the exact phyllotaxis
08:14 - spiral pattern because I believe the
08:16 - default angle mode of p5 is radians and
08:22 - really what this number is is in degree
08:25 - so I need to change the angle mode to
08:26 - degrees I don't know can you tell it
08:29 - yeah this is a little bit different and
08:30 - actually 4 correct so I think earlier in
08:33 - this video my phyllotaxis pattern was a
08:35 - little bit off but now you can see I'm
08:37 - kind of getting that beautiful more
08:38 - perfect kind the reason why I noticed it
08:40 - is because I think when I went to one
08:43 - 37.3 it didn't match up exactly with
08:45 - what was in that paper but now this is
08:47 - match I can see that this pattern is
08:49 - what's there so let me go back to now
08:51 - what I was thinking the reason why I
08:52 - thought of this is because I want to
08:54 - change the color mode to HSB meaning
08:57 - when I create a color I want to make it
08:59 - by 2 Q its saturation and its brightness
09:01 - so if I were to say something like fill
09:03 - 100 255 255 then I'm getting a sort of
09:07 - green color for all of my dots in the
09:10 - pattern and if I were to say 200 I'm
09:13 - getting a nice blue because that number
09:16 - is a hue between 0 and 255 so I could
09:19 - say something like I don't know just
09:21 - make it the angle modulus 255 and
09:23 - actually that should be modulus 256
09:25 - modulus being a way to to cycle back to
09:28 - 0 so 256 modulus 256 is 0 and 250 seven
09:32 - modules 256 is 1 so if I do this you can
09:35 - see like ah look at that I get kind of a
09:37 - difference respiro Li hue for every
09:40 - single based on what the angle is um I
09:42 - could actually use n might also make
09:45 - sense just to do the actual number so
09:48 - you can see now the number on the dot is
09:50 - controlling the color I could actually
09:53 - do something kind of interesting which i
09:54 - think is angle minus radius we might try
09:59 - I think would be kind of interesting the
10:01 - difference between the angle and the
10:02 - radius I don't know if this is going to
10:04 - whoops oh it's just called a and I guess
10:08 - I'll say modulus 255 there as well
10:10 - whoops a my oops and I'm missing a
10:12 - parenthesis here we go
10:16 - this is kind of you can see how the you
10:19 - can see kind of wet where the hue is
10:21 - kind of traveling around in this spiral
10:22 - pattern so there's all sorts of possible
10:25 - ways you can think about how you might
10:27 - create the color another thing you could
10:28 - do is guy could change the size of these
10:30 - circles based on where they are in the
10:31 - pattern they could be smaller in the
10:33 - middle larger to the outside all sorts
10:37 - of things so here we are I've got a nice
10:39 - thumbnail here for this video I've made
10:41 - a phyllotaxis pattern I would love for
10:44 - you guys to go take this code that I'll
10:46 - release with this video scroll down read
10:48 - more of this paper can you make a nice
10:50 - sunflower pattern can you expand on this
10:52 - what types of things might you do make
10:55 - some experiments make some beautiful
10:56 - phyllotaxis
10:57 - and I will see you in another
10:59 - challenge in the future thanks very much
11:00 - for watching

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome to another coding challenge in this coding challenge I am going to continue a series that I've been doing about algorithmic botany one of my favorite topics I'm here to tell you that if you like sunflowers and likes of flowers then this is the video for you to watch because what I want to talk about is a topic called Philo Texas and I want to examine what phyllotaxis is I want to look at the math behind phyllotaxis hopefully pronouncing that right and I want to create a nice shiny rainbow colored phyllotaxis example so this is the Wikipedia page phyllotaxis it comes from the ancient Greek Phylon meaning leaf and taxes meaning arrangement so it's a kind of spiral pattern that you see often in nature it's connected to both the Fibonacci sequence interesting thing to look up if you're not familiar with and also the golden ratio so the reference that I'm going to use is from this algorithmic botany algorithm botany org from the University of Calgary website there's a free pdf book the the math for everything I'm going to do is right here in this paper chain in chapter 4 of this book and you look at this and you think Greek letters and square roots and all that sort of stuff but I'm here to tell you this is actually going to be something quite simple so all I want to do is I want to rewrite those formulas kuna by sound board went off by accident I want to rewrite those formulas over here I'm going to say a fee or fahai I could never remember equals n times one thirty seven point five degrees this is a very very special angle hearts and stars for this angle one hundred thirty seven point five degrees one of my favorite angles everybody should have a favorite angle in their life I think and then also I want to say R equals C times the square root of n so you can see this is all we need so why in the first place do we need an R and an angle well this is why this is a coordinate space a Cartesian coordinate space with an xaxis and a yaxis and we're going to plot every point in this spiral pattern based on an x value and a y value so this is a point it's some X and why points however what the phyllotaxis math is going to give us is not an x and a y but a

each with a different radius that's either growing that's growing in an angle that's incrementing so we need to whip but but in np5 or processing or whatever programming environment is you might use I'm going to say like ellipse I want to draw a circle at a given x and y so what I need to be able to do is convert the radius and the angle 2 and x and a y and how do I do that I used something called polar to Cartesian coordinate transformation that sounds kind of fancy but basically I need a formula to go from my R and theta R and Phi or theta or fee or whatever angle R an angle to X&Y and the formula for that actually just uses cosign by the way if you say cosine of this angle it equals a cosine of this angle equals adjacent over hypotenuse x divided by r rx equals R times cosine of that angle and y equals R times sine of that angle we do the same thing with sine so these are these formulas you're going to see in our code and these formulas are going to see in the code now this looks a little weird the only thing here is is really are the only thing but we're calculating R and and the angle in order to get the X and the y in order to do that we need to have an N and to see what is n n is we're going to make a whole lot of dots for this phyllotaxis pattern and n is the number of the dot is it dot number zero dot number one number two number three number four and C is a number for a scaling pattern so you'll see that in a bit let's start to write some actual code so I'm going to come back over here and uh here we go I'm going to come back to the code I usually to come to the code yet so let's just look this is some p5.js code I'm going to it's running here in the browser it does nothing but draw a blank canvas but I'm going to create a variable n which equals zero and I'm going to say n plus plus right this is the first thing that I'm doing because each frame and actually I want to draw my background and set up each frame I'm going to draw a new dot and I'm going to how am I going to draw that dot I'm going to say angle equals what was the formula again n times one thirty seven point five so n times one thirty seven point five and the radius equals what C times the square root of n so we need to come up with what C is let's make up a number for right now let's make up a number what I know you're going to play with that number and we're going to see a bunch of different variety of results okay so now that we have a and are being calculated we can also remember now all we need are these two formulas to calculate x and y so now I'm going to say VAR x equals R times cosine of that angle VAR y equals R times sine of that angle and then also the thing is I want everything to be drawn relative to the center of the window so I'm also going to add

pixels or whatever and I'm going to just say fill 255 and then we're gonna run this program I don't know why I'm condensing all the code so no white space here we go let's run it see what happens hey look that looks pretty good something's happenin here oh wait I think we finished I think we did this already look that kind of looks like a cool little spiral pattern well let's um let me let me show you something special I'm gonna just expand C for a second whoa that's way too much uh there we go so well okay no this is not where oak is nevermind let's try to live code that's not going to work let's make C a little bit bigger actually I'm gonna make it a lot bigger just for a second sure make it 20 you can see what C is doing is it's actually sort of a scaling factor so how much is that radius changing right you can see here the radius is equal to the square root of the number times C so if I'm drawing my circles at 8 pixel with a diameter of 8 pixels let's try making that C actually just something like 4 and you can see we can start to sort of see that pattern let me make the circles a little bit smaller let me just say no stroke also maybe and then we can run this again and we can start to see there's that phyllotaxis spiral pattern there it is beautiful there we go in a way I'm kind of done right now I could sort of play with I could play with the scaling factor I could still actually play with the angle as well and if you go if we go back and looked at this paper you'll see down here like oh look at this here are some different kinds of patterns we could get if we kind of futz with the angle this one here as an angle of 1 37.3 not my favorite angle but a perfectly reasonable angle so let's run this and see what we get and you can see how this fire what kind of spiral pattern we get now which is kind of interesting in and of itself the other thing we can start to think about what we might do is how we might color the dots in a more interesting way so one thing that I could do here is just use a HSB color so I'm going to do you know what I don't think this is right I think this whole time I'm getting something sort of vaguely interesting and correct but I think that my angle mode I don't think this is the exact phyllotaxis spiral pattern because I believe the default angle mode of p5 is radians and really what this number is is in degree so I need to change the angle mode to degrees I don't know can you tell it yeah this is a little bit different and actually 4 correct so I think earlier in this video my phyllotaxis pattern was a little bit off but now you can see I'm kind of getting that beautiful more perfect kind the reason why I noticed it is because I think when I went to one 37.3 it didn't match up exactly with what was in that paper but now this is match I can see that this pattern is what's there so let me go back to now what I was thinking the reason why I thought of this is because I want to change the color mode to HSB meaning when I create a color I want to make it by 2 Q its saturation and its brightness so if I were to say something like fill 100 255 255 then I'm getting a sort of green color for all of my dots in the pattern and if I were to say 200 I'm getting a nice blue because that number is a hue between 0 and 255 so I could say something like I don't know just make it the angle modulus 255 and

you make a nice sunflower pattern can you expand on this what types of things might you do make some experiments make some beautiful phyllotaxis and I will see you in another challenge in the future thanks very much for watching
