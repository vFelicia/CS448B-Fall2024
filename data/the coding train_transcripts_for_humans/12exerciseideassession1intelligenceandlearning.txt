00:00 - hello welcome to a video that comes at
00:02 - the end of session one of intelligence
00:05 - and learning this is a video that goes
00:06 - along with the course that I'm teaching
00:07 - at New York University ITP to School of
00:10 - the Arts okay so I'm making this video
00:11 - just if you happen to have watched this
00:13 - entire playlist you're following this
00:16 - course on my youtube channel a mouse
00:18 - time where you could try to make a
00:19 - creative exercise based on the variety
00:22 - of different search algorithms with
00:24 - grass systems that I've showed you so
00:26 - this page here I will link to it has
00:30 - some of these exercise ideas I'm going
00:32 - to talk you through some of them so one
00:33 - of the things you could really do is you
00:34 - could take any of the examples that I
00:36 - made maize generation with depth-first
00:38 - search
00:39 - binary tree and just visualize them in a
00:41 - different way in an artistic way it's 3d
00:43 - you're really interesting to see could
00:45 - you do a star path finding in 3d you
00:48 - could actually even have a terrain
00:50 - that's 3d and you're trying to like you
00:52 - don't want to go up and you want to go
00:53 - down this is a viewer actually submitted
00:58 - a project like that which I will try to
01:00 - link to in the description of this video
01:02 - and so so I'll talk you through some of
01:05 - these possibilities so you could make
01:07 - your own visual design you know just as
01:09 - a technical exercise one thing you might
01:10 - try to do is have music in the hallway
01:15 - again take that binary tree example
01:19 - which just puts ten random things in the
01:21 - binary tree but allow the user to enter
01:23 - numbers and have those appear in the
01:25 - tree so it builds up slowly maybe it
01:27 - animates in some interesting way add
01:29 - some physics to it
01:31 - you know the six degrees of Kevin Bacon
01:33 - example I use the sort of dummy small
01:35 - dataset you could try to use build that
01:37 - exact same example but with a much
01:39 - larger data set maybe it's not movies
01:40 - and actors the animal guessing game is
01:44 - so is oh that's when I didn't make a
01:46 - video for I should make a video about
01:48 - that so if you look at this animal
01:49 - guessing game example it's just a little
01:52 - node program that tries to get an animal
01:54 - that you're thinking of and it uses a
01:57 - tree like structure to do that and so
02:00 - making an interactive version of that
02:01 - you know something that I think if you
02:03 - look at the a star example and you know
02:06 - all it does is show you that path that
02:08 - it solves for but if you actually use
02:10 - some of my
02:11 - animus agent examples that have steering
02:13 - agents moving through a space actually
02:15 - look like they're little mice trying to
02:16 - find the finding it oh this was this
02:20 - idea of you know how do you think about
02:22 - the space that you're pathfinding in you
02:24 - know it's really just my examples are
02:25 - just a pure maze I should pull one of
02:28 - them up so I pulled up the a star
02:29 - example and also this maze example now
02:32 - first of all it could be interesting to
02:33 - think about combining these two that's
02:35 - an exercise I actually have a solution
02:36 - to that if you look at the links I
02:39 - created a solution to that but here you
02:41 - know you could really think about the
02:43 - maze in two different ways that wall is
02:45 - it a river so I think just re imagining
02:48 - other ways to visualize these spaces and
02:50 - thinking about this as a terrain there's
02:53 - a lot of possibilities I think that you
02:55 - could that you could explore just using
02:57 - the algorithm verbatim but thinking
03:00 - about the actual space that the
03:02 - algorithm is playing out in a completely
03:04 - different way and putting your own
03:05 - design spin on it
03:07 - what else we have here so you know
03:10 - another thing you could do is I never
03:11 - made a video about like say for example
03:13 - Dijkstra's algorithm and you could
03:15 - investigate that and create something so
03:17 - if you do any of this if you do any of
03:18 - these assignments and you're watching
03:19 - this video share links to what you make
03:21 - in this videos in the comments or tweet
03:24 - them at me at Schiffman and oh it's a
03:29 - variation on one of my examples that's
03:31 - on the github repository you can add it
03:32 - a link to it in the readme file in that
03:34 - directory
03:35 - I gotta have a better system for this so
03:36 - I'm working that out thanks for
03:39 - participating in this session one of
03:41 - intelligence of learning and maybe
03:43 - you'll move on and watch Session two
03:44 - with genetic algorithms
03:50 - [Music]

hello welcome to a video that comes at the end of session one of intelligence and learning this is a video that goes along with the course that I'm teaching at New York University ITP to School of the Arts okay so I'm making this video just if you happen to have watched this entire playlist you're following this course on my youtube channel a mouse time where you could try to make a creative exercise based on the variety of different search algorithms with grass systems that I've showed you so this page here I will link to it has some of these exercise ideas I'm going to talk you through some of them so one of the things you could really do is you could take any of the examples that I made maize generation with depthfirst search binary tree and just visualize them in a different way in an artistic way it's 3d you're really interesting to see could you do a star path finding in 3d you could actually even have a terrain that's 3d and you're trying to like you don't want to go up and you want to go down this is a viewer actually submitted a project like that which I will try to link to in the description of this video and so so I'll talk you through some of these possibilities so you could make your own visual design you know just as a technical exercise one thing you might try to do is have music in the hallway again take that binary tree example which just puts ten random things in the binary tree but allow the user to enter numbers and have those appear in the tree so it builds up slowly maybe it animates in some interesting way add some physics to it you know the six degrees of Kevin Bacon example I use the sort of dummy small dataset you could try to use build that exact same example but with a much larger data set maybe it's not movies and actors the animal guessing game is so is oh that's when I didn't make a video for I should make a video about that so if you look at this animal guessing game example it's just a little node program that tries to get an animal that you're thinking of and it uses a tree like structure to do that and so making an interactive version of that you know something that I think if you look at the a star example and you know all it does is show you that path that it solves for but if you actually use some of my animus agent examples that have steering agents moving through a space actually look like they're little mice trying to find the finding it oh this was this idea of you know how do you think about the space that you're pathfinding in you know it's really just my examples are just a pure maze I should pull one of them up so I pulled up the a star example and also this maze example now first of all it could be interesting to think about combining these two that's an exercise I actually have a solution to that if you look at the links I created a solution to that but here you know you could really think about the maze in two different ways that wall is it a river so I think just re imagining other ways to visualize these spaces and thinking about this as a terrain there's a lot of possibilities I think that you could that you could explore just using the algorithm verbatim but thinking about the actual space that the algorithm is playing out in a completely different way and putting your own design spin on it what else we have here so you know another thing you could do is I never made a video about like say for example Dijkstra's algorithm and you could investigate that and create something so if you do any of this if you do any of these assignments and you're watching this video share links to what you make in this videos in the comments or tweet them at me at Schiffman and oh it's a variation on one of my examples that's on the github repository you can add it a link to it in the readme file in that directory I gotta have a better system for this so I'm working that out thanks for participating in this session one of intelligence of learning and maybe you'll move on and watch Session two with genetic algorithms
