With timestamps:

00:00 - hello I am making a video about speech
00:07 - recognition in the browser using the p5
00:09 - speech library so first another thank
00:12 - you to the NYU ability project at the
00:15 - integrated digital media program at
00:17 - Tandon school for engineering in Luke Du
00:19 - Bois who created this library I've been
00:22 - using it I've made a lot of mistakes
00:23 - with it but I'm excited about it
00:27 - and what I'm going to show you in this
00:28 - video is how to do speech recognition
00:33 - now one thing I should say is there's
00:35 - some privacy concerns here anytime
00:37 - you're going to use the microphone in
00:39 - the browser so if you write the code
00:41 - that I'm going to write the browser will
00:43 - ask for permission to use the microphone
00:46 - you should also note that the audio that
00:49 - the browser is recording gets uploaded
00:50 - to the cloud that's where the actual
00:52 - speech recognition happens not locally
00:54 - on your machine itself it's the Google
00:56 - speech recognition stuff in the cloud so
00:58 - if you're connected to the Internet if
01:00 - you're not connected the internet none
01:01 - of this will work okay so let's get
01:03 - started and see how we can write some
01:05 - code that does this I've got a sketch
01:08 - with nothing in it
01:09 - so I'm gonna add setup I am going to add
01:13 - a no canvas and let me mention again
01:16 - that I already have included in my HTML
01:19 - file the p5 speech Jas library which you
01:23 - need to go download yourself from the
01:25 - github repository that's linked to in
01:27 - this video's description once you've
01:29 - done that you can then write some code
01:32 - that says let a speech recognizer let's
01:37 - just say speech rec equal new p5 speech
01:40 - rec ok now I can give I can do a couple
01:44 - things here I can give it a language
01:45 - because and I believe this is the
01:48 - default for us English so I could if I
01:52 - don't give it any arguments it'll set
01:54 - some default settings and I can also
01:55 - give it a callback like got speech so
01:58 - when I create the recorder I'm saying is
01:59 - I want you to listen for this language
02:00 - and I'll post a link to where you can
02:03 - see all the documented language
02:04 - possibilities there and actually Alka
02:09 - I'm gonna one thing I could do which is
02:12 - exciting is I could say navigator dot
02:16 - language
02:17 - so let's actually write this as a
02:19 - separate line of Coit code navigator dot
02:23 - language or en-us so in other words if
02:27 - the browser this this would just pick up
02:30 - whatever this is a way of asking p5
02:34 - speech recognition to just use whatever
02:36 - this word language is set of the browser
02:37 - already AHA okay then once I have this I
02:41 - can write this Scott speech callback and
02:46 - what I'm gonna do now in the got speech
02:48 - callback is I'm just gonna say console
02:50 - dot log speech rec so what I want to do
02:54 - is run this code it's going to listen to
02:59 - the microphone and then anytime it hears
03:02 - something oh you know I forgot something
03:04 - really important I have to say speech
03:07 - Rex tart there's a few more things I'm
03:09 - gonna do with this but this is start
03:12 - listening which is important you have to
03:14 - explicitly say start listening okay so
03:16 - let's see what happens
03:18 - refresh Oh navigation is not defined
03:21 - because it's navigate tour first you can
03:28 - see this red blinking microphone now
03:30 - because I've been doing this for a while
03:31 - on this computer before I started
03:32 - recording this video it didn't ask me
03:34 - for permission it already had permission
03:36 - and it might also because I'm doing it
03:38 - locally but it you will probably see
03:41 - that it'll ask you permission
03:42 - okay wait something console.log got some
03:44 - speech look at this confidence level so
03:47 - this is important it gives you a
03:48 - confidence level of how confident it is
03:50 - that it got what you said correctly 92%
03:53 - and then you can see here result string
03:55 - first you can see this red blinking
03:57 - microphone not because I've been doing
03:58 - this for a while you can see this is all
03:59 - the stuff that I said and there's
04:01 - actually a lot more information as well
04:03 - and the object in the result JSON so
04:05 - there's lots of stuff like a timestamp
04:07 - and more information that you could sort
04:10 - of dig into you know this is really this
04:12 - p5 speech library is a thin layer on the
04:14 - web speech kit library probably saying
04:17 - that wrong but on the web speech API so
04:20 - really it's just a window into that and
04:21 - once you're using this you might
04:22 - discover you want to dig deeper into
04:23 - that but what I could do right now is I
04:25 - could see what I really want is just
04:27 - what I said which is results string I
04:29 - can also look at I think there's a
04:31 - result value true this is kind of like
04:33 - was it successful or not so what I'm
04:36 - going to do is add to the code if speech
04:39 - rec result value was it successful or
04:43 - not then create P speech rec dot result
04:49 - string ok so there we go
04:55 - and here here come's here we go and
05:04 - refresh hello speech recognizer were
05:10 - there
05:12 - I should really show such coding train
05:14 - or something let's try this again
05:16 - choo choo wait all right I'm gonna hit
05:21 - refresh let's see what happens choo choo
05:25 - oh wait it said let's see what happens
05:28 - choo choo oh that's the greatest thing
05:33 - that's ever happened to my life with
05:34 - speech recognition awesome now you'll
05:36 - notice something it's not listening to
05:38 - me anymore so by default when you say
05:41 - start it's only going to listen to one
05:43 - thing that you say and this is good to
05:45 - have that by default because you don't
05:47 - want suddenly like all of the audio
05:49 - that's ever coming into this computer to
05:50 - be uploaded to the cloud but you can
05:53 - turn on something called continuous mode
05:55 - so I could say continuous equals true
05:58 - and there's actually something else
05:59 - called interim results which I'm gonna
06:00 - set at false and I'll show you what that
06:02 - is in a second so I could say continuous
06:04 - which I always felt wrong and I can say
06:06 - comma interim which I I always spell
06:11 - wrong not say I think I say continuous
06:12 - so I'm gonna turn on continuous mode
06:14 - let's see what happens whoops
06:16 - interim is not defined Oh interest held
06:21 - Ajay did spell interim run all the board
06:29 - choo choo chugga chugga chugga chugga
06:34 - chugga chugga chugga chugga choo choo
06:38 - alright anyway you can see that this
06:40 - works sort of so one thing you might
06:47 - notice is that it waits for me to pause
06:54 - speaking before it gives me more data
06:58 - into the browser this is what interim
07:01 - results now the interim results is a
07:02 - little tricky to get to work and really
07:05 - you've got to investigate how the web
07:07 - speech API works but let me set this to
07:08 - true and I'll show you what I mean hello
07:13 - 1 2 3 how is it going four five six so
07:17 - you can see here that it's continuously
07:19 - listening and just it's continuously
07:22 - listening and giving me stuff and so
07:23 - what's great lookk in the examples in
07:26 - the actual p5 github repository has an
07:28 - example where you can drive a little
07:30 - drawing thing around the screen and so
07:32 - watch what how this works up up down
07:35 - down right right down up down up down so
07:38 - if you're listening continuously and
07:40 - you're listening for certain key words
07:41 - you could control like a pen as it's
07:43 - drawing onto a canvas I encourage you to
07:44 - try that as an exercise yourself or go
07:47 - or go and check out the example that
07:51 - does this there's a lot of other great
07:52 - examples on the p5 speech github
07:55 - repository itself so thank you Luke
07:57 - Dubois and the ability project and
07:59 - everybody else at NYU who's worked on
08:01 - this library it's really wonderful it's
08:02 - fun to play with I'm gonna do a coding
08:04 - challenge which I'll link to from this
08:06 - video where I create one of my a chat
08:09 - BOTS but instead of typing with the chat
08:11 - bot and having it display text to me I
08:13 - speak to the chat bot and it speaks back
08:15 - to me so I'm gonna use both speech
08:16 - recognition and text-to-speech let's say
08:19 - text-to-speech and speech-to-text no
08:22 - speech the text is a thing no no
08:24 - text-to-speech is a thing speech the
08:26 - text is speech really called speech
08:28 - recognition but whatever you get the
08:29 - point enjoy have a good day
08:35 - [Music]

hello I am making a video about speech recognition in the browser using the p5 speech library so first another thank you to the NYU ability project at the integrated digital media program at Tandon
