05:48 - there we are hello good evening
05:52 - welcome to a special well at least
05:54 - eastern time
05:55 - nighttime edition of the coding train
06:01 - i am here to do something very special
06:04 - today um so you might be wondering
06:07 - what uh as as was just asked in the chat
06:10 - by pin
06:11 - ball oh you got me
06:15 - pinball oh my goodness i can't believe
06:17 - what's happening right now
06:19 - um you might be wondering what is the
06:21 - itp
06:22 - ima show hi alca i haven't seen you in a
06:25 - while alka
06:26 - welcome back to the coding train maybe
06:28 - you've been here all along and just
06:29 - haven't seen your name pop up
06:30 - um so um this is my uh there's a bunch
06:33 - of things that i tend to do at the end
06:35 - of the year and this is sort of like
06:38 - item number one so my uh
06:41 - regular day job uh besides um being this
06:45 - uh uh internet uh weirdo is
06:48 - um being a teacher at new york
06:51 - university
06:52 - a school at new york university called
06:54 - tisch school of the arts and a program
06:56 - called itp
06:57 - as well as one called ima so itp is a
07:00 - two-year graduate
07:02 - program an ima is a well four year
07:04 - undergraduate
07:05 - major and at the end of every semester
07:08 - the students usually gather
07:10 - physically in person and you know
07:13 - transform the entire
07:15 - floor where all the classrooms are and
07:17 - the labs into a giant
07:19 - exhibition gallery space that is not
07:22 - happening uh this year it didn't happen
07:24 - last spring either instead
07:26 - the show has moved virtual i mean it's
07:28 - not really virtual what's
07:30 - virtual about it it's happening it's
07:32 - real
07:33 - we're just look we're just experiencing
07:35 - it through the through mediated through
07:37 - video and audio and all sorts of stuff
07:39 - so um
07:40 - what i have typically done in the past
07:42 - is spent my time wandering around with
07:44 - my phone
07:45 - trying to live stream and a microphone
07:46 - and looking at projects and interviewing
07:48 - students
07:49 - today really i'm just here to invite you
07:52 - you can see the urls up there i'm gonna
07:54 - i'm gonna take a little time to
07:56 - show you all the bits and pieces of how
07:57 - the show works it actually doesn't start
07:59 - technically for 20 minutes so um so i'm
08:02 - going to show you
08:03 - how uh where you can find projects where
08:05 - you can uh
08:06 - interact with other people i'm going to
08:08 - show you the website i'm going to show
08:09 - you this thing called yorb which is
08:11 - really incredible um and then hopefully
08:14 - i'm gonna just
08:15 - back away slowly turn off the streaming
08:18 - button
08:19 - and let you experience the show for
08:20 - yourself and i'll be around there you
08:22 - can chat with me and say hello
08:23 - um in the virtual spaces as well so
08:26 - that's what i've got
08:27 - on the agenda for tonight are you ready
08:30 - are you excited
08:31 - i hope so but as always on the coding
08:34 - train
08:34 - we must begin with the ceremonial
08:38 - reading of the random numbers now
08:41 - how do i do this i have to find i'm
08:44 - going to open up
08:46 - discord here so if you aren't
08:51 - a member of the coding drain discord a
08:54 - link should be popping up in the chat
08:55 - right about now it probably actually
08:57 - happened about
08:57 - 30 seconds ago because you're behind me
09:00 - in time but the chat is in real time
09:02 - um and i'm looking for where did i last
09:05 - end up i think i forgot to post no i
09:08 - didn't
09:09 - row 17 column zero
09:12 - i am embarking on uh a project
09:15 - it is my goal it's my lifelong dream to
09:18 - read this entire book
09:20 - out loud the book of a million random
09:23 - digits
09:24 - i'm really not doing a very good job
09:26 - with that i'm gonna have to live a very
09:28 - very long time
09:29 - unless i somehow speed this process up
09:32 - but
09:32 - every time i live stream i try to read a
09:34 - little bit of it
09:35 - so here we are
09:38 - it is evening time night time time for
09:41 - children to go to sleep gotta sleep
09:45 - children
09:45 - i guess it's actually only 7 40. finish
09:47 - your homework whatever
09:49 - whatever i'm supposed to yell as a
09:51 - parent who is up in the attic
09:52 - live streaming and reading from a book
09:54 - of random numbers aha okay
09:56 - so let's move on to line 18 and
09:59 - tonight's
10:00 - random numbers will be
10:03 - starting at row 18 column zero
10:10 - sixty nine thousand nine hundred and
10:12 - sixteen
10:13 - twenty six thousand eight hundred and
10:15 - three sixty six thousand
10:18 - two hundred and fifty two twenty nine
10:21 - thousand one hundred and forty eight
10:23 - thirty six thousand nine hundred and
10:25 - thirty six
10:27 - eighty seven thousand two hundred and
10:28 - three
10:30 - seventy six thousand six hundred and
10:32 - twenty one
10:33 - thirteen thousand nine hundred and
10:36 - ninety
10:37 - by the way i think i was supposed to
10:38 - read row 17.
10:40 - i'm on the wrong row mr over
10:44 - you'd wear that that that's next week's
10:47 - random numbers
10:48 - seventy four thousand three hundred and
10:50 - fifty ninety nine thousand eight hundred
10:52 - and seventeen
10:54 - seventy seven thousand four hundred and
10:56 - two
10:58 - seventy seven thousand two hundred and
11:00 - fourteen
11:01 - forty three thousand two hundred and
11:03 - sixty three
11:05 - two hundred and ten
11:09 - wow that's quite a number i feel like
11:12 - the first time i've ever read a number
11:13 - that
11:14 - below one thousand in this book forty
11:16 - five thousand five hundred and twenty
11:18 - one
11:19 - sixty four thousand two hundred and
11:20 - thirty seven
11:22 - ninety six thousand two hundred eighty
11:23 - six two thousand
11:25 - six hundred and fifty five all right so
11:28 - one of the reasons why i like to read
11:30 - these random numbers is because i don't
11:32 - want there to be any confusion
11:34 - whatsoever about what's going on here
11:37 - this is nonsense
11:38 - and you should probably tune out and
11:40 - again might i remind you
11:42 - ah shoot i moved my camera around and
11:44 - i'm just like i don't have enough
11:45 - vertical space to reach up so i have to
11:47 - like practice not going too high
11:49 - um you should not be watching me instead
11:52 - you should be visiting show itp.nyu.edu
11:57 - yorb.itp.io but
11:59 - for the time being there's about 15
12:01 - minutes till it officially starts
12:03 - you can stay here and i'll kind of talk
12:05 - you through and
12:06 - show you um what's going on
12:10 - all right i'm looking at the chat i see
12:13 - people are saying they're sleepy
12:15 - um they're gonna use the julia says i'm
12:18 - going to use these as
12:19 - lottery numbers i'm rooting for you
12:23 - i'm really rooting for you um all right
12:25 - so
12:26 - what do i need to do first let me move
12:28 - over here
12:29 - to my laptop whoops no over here there
12:32 - we go
12:33 - and i think i can well i guess i can
12:36 - leave these messages up here
12:38 - maybe i'll just unpin them now for a
12:40 - second but i'll bring them back
12:45 - so what is it that i want to do first so
12:47 - let me open up
12:48 - open broadcast studio so first of all
12:51 - one thing that i have
12:52 - a really difficult time with oh and this
12:54 - is photoshop
12:56 - maybe some of somebody watching can
12:57 - actually help me make a nicer version of
12:59 - this
13:00 - but one of the things i'm struggling
13:01 - with is i'm about to go into
13:03 - uh you know semi-public online space
13:07 - and essentially be recording people i'm
13:09 - actually more than just recording it i'm
13:11 - live streaming
13:12 - so this is akin to you know perhaps
13:15 - playing roblox
13:17 - um a game like that and live streaming
13:19 - your experience and there's other
13:20 - players in the on the server and
13:22 - maybe there's an understanding that
13:23 - people have when they're in one of these
13:24 - spaces
13:25 - that there are other people who might be
13:27 - streaming it or recording it
13:29 - um but this place where i'm going is not
13:31 - a particularly anonymous space in fact
13:33 - people can have their cameras on and be
13:35 - visible and so
13:36 - i don't really know uh in in the
13:38 - physical show
13:40 - i could walk around with a physical
13:41 - camera people sort of see that as like a
13:43 - social cue oh there's somebody with a
13:45 - camera and a microphone
13:46 - if i don't want to be on camera i could
13:48 - sort of move out of the way
13:50 - also being in the sort of public space
13:52 - of the show there are signs up
13:54 - that kind of um explain that your you
13:56 - know the sort of permissions around
13:58 - um your photo maybe being taken and
14:01 - recorded in the space so i know i'm
14:02 - going on for a long long time about this
14:04 - but i've been thinking about this a lot
14:06 - and i don't love the idea of kind of
14:07 - going into this 3d world that i'm about
14:09 - to go into
14:10 - and live stream it but i think the
14:12 - benefits here outweigh
14:13 - the downside in that i'm going to bring
14:15 - some attention and and have a little bit
14:17 - fun and see the show and
14:18 - students will be able to interact and
14:20 - you'll be able to see some of their
14:21 - projects so this is my solution
14:23 - i'm using open broadcast studio to get
14:25 - my camera and then put a like
14:28 - message over the top that says live
14:29 - broadcast i wonder if it might make
14:32 - sense for me and i was just quickly
14:33 - mocking this up in photoshop
14:34 - so first of all these should definitely
14:36 - be the coding train
14:39 - uh whoops um instead of these like red
14:42 - dots they should be these coding trained
14:44 - characters
14:45 - which you would think i would have at
14:47 - the ready
14:48 - so i'm going to quickly i'm just like i
14:52 - put my screen away because i'm going to
14:53 - head over to
14:55 - google drive here where i have all of my
14:58 - stuff
15:00 - my stuff okay where are you
15:04 - um characters paid members merchandise
15:07 - no share design design i'm looking at a
15:09 - folder called design
15:10 - design assets um
15:13 - [Music]
15:15 - and characters here we go i think i can
15:18 - bring you back now
15:20 - um so i'm in this folder called
15:22 - characters let's go
15:23 - to symbol characters maybe
15:27 - or i really love um
15:30 - i do love my friend the robot this is my
15:32 - new favorite character
15:33 - choo choo bot so let's try uh
15:37 - let's try getting a chuchu bot
15:40 - download i just want this might indicate
15:43 - to people that it's the coding train
15:45 - what
15:46 - uh what else
15:50 - uh is really sort of obviously the
15:52 - coding train is there
15:54 - symbol symbol character is the unicorn
15:57 - here
15:57 - let's go to jpegs let's try
16:01 - the rainbow one this would probably also
16:04 - indicate so i'll download this one this
16:06 - is a png oh it's a jpeg i don't like
16:08 - that why don't i have a png of this here
16:12 - oh there are pngs here uh rainbow okay
16:15 - there we go
16:16 - let's download this i know this is like
16:18 - riveting live streaming watching me
16:21 - attempt to use
16:22 - photoshop which i'm like absolutely
16:25 - terrible at
16:26 - um okay so i think i can get rid of this
16:29 - now
16:30 - and i can i don't know drag and drop is
16:32 - photoshop gonna let me do that
16:34 - uh downloads downloads
16:38 - symbol look at that
16:41 - all right i know what i'm doing here you
16:43 - can't stop me
16:45 - live broadcast and then let's grab
16:48 - a robot
16:52 - oh do i need to like place it okay great
16:54 - let's grab the robot
16:58 - and shrink it a little bit put it over
17:01 - here
17:01 - it's in the corner you're in the corner
17:05 - all right i think people will sort of
17:07 - get the idea
17:10 - uh and if anybody wants to design a
17:12 - slightly better version of this
17:15 - you're welcome to it uh what happened to
17:17 - my
17:18 - oh it's fine uh let's actually like keep
17:20 - these dots really do say live broadcast
17:22 - though
17:23 - um so maybe i should leave these
17:26 - uh trans uh free transform will that do
17:28 - it here we go making them like
17:30 - right in the corner down here uh we can
17:33 - just get rid of
17:36 - this one and where am i here no here
17:40 - now here where i don't even understand
17:42 - what's going on
17:43 - oh that look that's a layer okay there
17:44 - we go so now i can copy paste there we
17:47 - go
17:48 - put that one down here so just make it
17:50 - all along the bottom i think i'm going
17:51 - to stop
17:53 - okay save export
17:57 - quick export is png let's try that
18:01 - to the desktop sure replace that
18:05 - and then is obs gonna perfect so now
18:08 - when i go
18:09 - in so what i'm doing is i have a virtual
18:11 - camera running
18:12 - so i've got the virtual camera running
18:14 - which means
18:16 - if i go to any website that makes use of
18:19 - my webcam
18:20 - instead of just the webcam it's going to
18:21 - show this so hopefully that's going to
18:23 - indicate to people oh i should probably
18:26 - put
18:26 - let's also do this um
18:29 - so let me add one more little bit of
18:31 - text and say
18:33 - youtube.com the coding train
18:37 - and make that much smaller
18:40 - and just put that down here on the
18:43 - bottom
18:47 - uh let's try another quick export
18:51 - export quick export i know you guys
18:55 - are just so this is so exciting
18:59 - there we go oh i spelt it wrong
19:03 - uh come on i can't see it so it's very
19:07 - hard when i can't see it
19:09 - just i need a c in there there we go
19:12 - um do i have to recenter it
19:15 - just tell me where it goes come on
19:17 - photoshop like do it for me
19:18 - automatically
19:19 - close enough close enough i don't know
19:21 - where that is i don't know what's going
19:22 - on i'm trying to line it up with
19:25 - something okay
19:27 - uh quick export i really i should have
19:30 - done this before i started live
19:31 - streaming but
19:32 - you could say i started i just didn't
19:34 - have a lot of time
19:35 - um all right this is gonna be great all
19:38 - right
19:39 - so this is what people will see um
19:43 - and alco oh wait we've got some breaking
19:45 - news here
19:50 - breaking news
19:54 - um
19:58 - obs version 26.1 has added official
20:01 - support
20:02 - for virtual camera for the mac all right
20:04 - that's great to know
20:05 - all right so now this can go away and um
20:08 - let's just run let's go i'm gonna go to
20:11 - a quick
20:12 - test zoom meeting and by the way i'm
20:14 - just going to because i don't know
20:16 - what's about to pop
20:17 - up i'm just gonna put my camera my and
20:20 - let's just see if this at least works
20:21 - with
20:22 - zoom so i'll know
20:25 - let me go to slash test
20:30 - join so there might be an option of
20:34 - visiting some of the projects in
20:35 - zoom meetings and so
20:38 - i'm going to join with video and so with
20:41 - the virtual camera
20:42 - okay yes yes i hear the ringtone yes my
20:44 - microphone's working
20:46 - um so basically uh
20:49 - this is now oops uh me in uh
20:52 - zoom meeting and if i go here under
20:55 - video and change this to virtual camera
20:57 - now this is me in the zoom meeting so
21:00 - you can see
21:01 - that i am live broadcasting now of
21:02 - course i could do that as the background
21:05 - which would make sense and i have a
21:06 - green screen and all that but i actually
21:08 - think it's better for it to be just
21:09 - right up here at front so front and
21:12 - center so people know
21:13 - all right we are ready to head on
21:17 - to over to the itb show i'm so excited
21:25 - so ordinarily um i feel like i know what
21:28 - all the projects are i've seen
21:30 - them all i've seen the students building
21:31 - them i've helped students with them
21:33 - i'm i feel very out of the loop this
21:35 - semester with everything being remote
21:37 - and all my classes being remote i know
21:38 - about some of the projects i participate
21:40 - still
21:41 - but there isn't that like i show up to
21:43 - work every day and wander around the
21:44 - floor
21:45 - and see all the students building their
21:46 - projects so mostly i have no idea what
21:48 - i'm about to find
21:49 - um so this should be exciting i should
21:51 - pin back
21:53 - uh this back up on the screen by the way
21:56 - uh
21:56 - if you are a coding trained member that
21:59 - unlocks a channel in the discord where
22:02 - you can post messages that i can uh
22:04 - bring up here on the screen
22:05 - pretty exciting stuff here i've got
22:06 - going um all right so
22:08 - now let's go on over to itp.nyu
22:12 - show so this is the winter show website
22:16 - um we can start to look down here and i
22:19 - will do a dramatic reading of what this
22:21 - is that we're about to experience
22:23 - uh join us on december 16th if you
22:26 - brought your time machine with you you
22:27 - can go to the show on december 16th
22:29 - or december 17th for our virtual winter
22:32 - show it's a two-day event
22:33 - features projects representing creative
22:35 - applications of the recently possible
22:37 - from three programs of new york
22:39 - university's tissue of the arts
22:40 - itp ima and a brand new program by the
22:43 - way ima
22:44 - low res this is a new program that is a
22:47 - one year masters
22:49 - everything you know is turned upside
22:51 - down this year in
22:53 - education and in many other industries
22:55 - and
22:56 - activities but the low res was actually
22:58 - designed to be
22:59 - mostly online and remote with some
23:02 - intensive in-person
23:04 - um periods in january and over the
23:06 - summer i mean you should check out the
23:08 - website to
23:09 - get the full details but it's pretty
23:10 - interesting model for
23:12 - um uh learning the material
23:16 - and participating in the community that
23:17 - is itp ima
23:19 - so um so this is how um basically th one
23:22 - of the reasons why the time

23:25 - this semester and many of them there's a
23:27 - large
23:28 - uh number of students who are in china
23:29 - so if we find any of them it'll be
23:32 - 8 a.m for them whereas it's 8 p.m for me

28:48 - sure that the
28:49 - audio from the browser
28:53 - is heading to the stream
28:56 - so if i the thing that i use for that is
28:58 - something called loopback
29:00 - uh google chrome is on and it is heading
29:03 - out being routed out to usb capture
29:05 - so as soon as there's any audio you

32:01 - is there a sign in front of me
32:03 - [Music]
32:05 - sorry oh well well i won't worry about
32:07 - that anymore so this is my first attempt
32:09 - at live streaming the virtual yorb
32:12 - itp show ethan you are my first uh
32:16 - victim so to speak um and so i don't
32:20 - really have a plan here other than to
32:22 - turn it over to you to tell us about
32:25 - your project called
32:26 - if i'm right historia yes indeed um
32:29 - so i created an automatic reality
32:32 - ios app that's basically built around a
32:36 - walking tour of downtown brooklyn which
32:38 - is the neighborhood where i depend on
32:39 - the itp
32:41 - so you it uses an apple's
32:45 - geo-tracking api to basically scan your
32:48 - environment to get a hyper
32:49 - precise location of where you are on the
32:51 - street which is necessary for popping up
32:54 - these
32:54 - physical markers around your environment
32:57 - um that
32:58 - show what the neighborhood and
33:00 - streetscape look like 100 or 120 years
33:02 - ago
33:04 - so these photo markers pop up there's
33:07 - also like ambient sound markers and then
33:09 - if you click on them
33:10 - they provide a bit more background
33:12 - information where they came from when
33:14 - they're taken and you can zoom in on the
33:15 - photo
33:16 - um so there are those photo markers then
33:21 - they're like audio ambient markers and
33:23 - there are infoboards on with the more
33:26 - historic
33:26 - uh important sites that were destroyed
33:29 - in the neighborhood
33:32 - so yeah it's apple ios app i'm hoping to
33:35 - have it ready to be released in a month
33:37 - or two
33:38 - with some more user testing and
33:42 - just fun to work on
33:48 - yeah it's undergraduate a new realities
33:52 - class
33:53 - um with the n sebastian
34:18 - oh
34:31 - yeah it was a bit of a mixed bag um
34:34 - because to test it every time you have
34:36 - to go outside you have to put on
34:38 - the mask and it's a look very anxiety do
34:40 - this thing i find especially if you're
34:42 - like going in high rises with elevators
34:44 - um but the opportunity to go outside was
34:48 - certainly excellent once i
34:49 - got outside and it was a fun project to
34:52 - work around with
34:53 - um just exploring the neighborhood
34:55 - making sure that all markers were
34:56 - positioned correctly
34:58 - great so i i have to tell the live
35:00 - stream i have to apologize to the live
35:01 - stream
35:02 - i muted my audio while you were
35:04 - presenting
35:05 - because i needed a minute to like check
35:06 - a few things and fix a couple things
35:08 - and then when i came back to ask you
35:10 - that question i didn't unmute my audio
35:12 - so nobody heard my question which i
35:14 - really by the way
35:15 - there was a very eloquent um deep and
35:18 - meaningful the way i asked it was just
35:20 - ah so so well done if i don't say so
35:22 - myself
35:23 - no i um i very awkwardly asked just
35:25 - about how
35:26 - the pandemic sort of affected the
35:28 - development of this project related to
35:30 - especially as it related to being
35:31 - outside oh my goodness did your
35:33 - just crash or is somebody oh no just
35:36 - somebody with a um
35:38 - a black screen like walked right in
35:40 - front of me and it made everything look
35:41 - empty
35:42 - uh wonderful thank you so much for
35:43 - sharing your project um so people
35:46 - everybody if you want to come and chat

41:49 - or 10a which project 10
41:52 - 10a
41:57 - [Laughter]
41:59 - did i i wonder if i have single-handedly
42:02 - brought down yorb through the power of
42:05 - the coding train
42:06 - all 194 people who are watching
42:10 - possibly you know ten percent are
42:13 - actually paying attention
42:14 - and one percent of those people actually
42:16 - went into europe so probably not
42:19 - uh i think the itp show the itv ima show
42:21 - has quite its own
42:22 - uh following i don't know what's going
42:25 - on to be perfectly frank
42:27 - um you know my name is not frank
42:30 - it's dan but and we're like we're in
42:33 - some kind of strange
42:35 - yorb uh uh empty ghost yorb
42:40 - wait is that a person or is that just a
42:42 - sign
42:45 - this is a sign about this project
42:49 - um nancy writes in the chat
42:53 - it makes me so happy to see you having
42:55 - problems with yorb it makes me feel less
42:57 - alone
42:59 - that is like the thesis statement of the
43:02 - coding train
43:03 - it makes me so happy to see you having
43:05 - problems with
43:06 - blank it makes me feel less alone fill
43:09 - in the blank
43:10 - javascript math
43:13 - programming css video yorb
43:17 - i have problems with it all don't be
43:19 - alone
43:20 - be with me i can't do it either let's
43:22 - not do it either together
43:26 - all right um drum roll yes oh no look at
43:29 - all this
43:30 - noah is here and luisa's here there's
43:32 - all these people that i actually know in
43:33 - real life in the chat that doesn't
43:35 - usually happen when i
43:36 - broadcast all right let's try i think we
43:38 - might need to go visit a zoom project
43:41 - i'm a little bit wary of doing that
43:42 - because i'm just kind of
43:44 - landing in somebody's zoom room without
43:46 - them being aware
43:47 - sort of but um i pretty sure um
43:51 - i'm pretty sure that the
43:54 - um the web oh the weather ban says
43:58 - closer to 9 p.m
43:59 - it is getting close to 9 p.m it's
44:01 - already 8 15.
44:03 - uh ready to go 10a let's try a different

44:13 - one or another
44:15 - let's try all right
44:18 - drum roll please
44:28 - okay is there anyone here

44:39 - b c okay c is over here hello
44:44 - hello i
44:47 - i'm waiting to play my ah wait yes
44:52 - i see a project oh and i know this
44:55 - project
44:57 - i know this project hello are you there
45:03 - i don't hear anything wait i heard
45:06 - somebody
45:09 - speak up
45:15 - hello hello who's there
45:20 - this is maria maria
45:25 - oh hello people does anyone see my live
45:30 - broadcast sign
45:31 - that's about my whole life it depends on
45:33 - it
45:35 - no no but i'm watching the broadcast now
45:38 - so
45:38 - okay oh wow your voice is really coming
45:40 - through wait i'm looking
45:42 - hi am i i'm here to oh zao there you
45:45 - are i am here i'm here to uh hear about
45:49 - this project that you've made
45:51 - oh great uh is that okay is it okay that
45:54 - cause i i i i my intention was to have a
45:57 - big sign on me that says that i'm live
45:59 - broadcasting so that i'm not
46:01 - i know that you're alive everybody seems
46:03 - to know it anyway so i i give up
46:05 - okay my face so anyways uh hello tell me
46:08 - your
46:09 - name and this by the way is very
46:10 - artificial because zayal actually made
46:12 - this project in my class so i'm going to
46:14 - pretend as if i know nothing about it
46:16 - tell me your name and uh um
46:19 - about this project and um tell the
46:22 - viewers all about it we'd love to hear
46:23 - about it yeah
46:24 - um hey everyone here's the round
46:26 - shipment uh anzael
46:28 - this is the project i made with my
46:29 - cosmic tinshu it's called 100
46:31 - 2100 non-existent voice i've dated
46:34 - before
46:35 - it's a project using machine learning in
46:37 - runway that trend data from okcupid
46:40 - which i found the stairs that has like
46:42 - 60 thousand dating profiles
46:45 - uh it's just online and i trained them
46:47 - so it's all artificial
46:49 - uh fake dating profile that i put into
46:52 - like this tinder clone that i made
46:54 - uh once the swap person is matched
46:57 - you can find a dating story between me
47:00 - and this non-existent human being and
47:03 - this dating story is using context-free
47:05 - grammar
47:06 - uh to write the story always end it with
47:09 - with we never met again so we want to
47:11 - talk about how
47:13 - the data privacy really is out there
47:18 - and also oh i feel like i heard some
47:20 - alcohol but
47:22 - yeah i hear the echo too i think it must
47:24 - be somebody who's nearby who's not
47:25 - doesn't have headphones
47:29 - but anyways uh we want to talk about
47:32 - like data privacy and how you treat your
47:34 - data on dating profiles uh more
47:35 - seriously and also
47:37 - just it's a fun project to just work on
47:39 - to like get all this like
47:40 - weird bizarre it's like somehow even
47:42 - feels like cursed because like
47:44 - you know all the data that you watch
47:46 - right now are like very weird but then
47:48 - they're actually from the real data
47:50 - like got trained out of it so it's very
47:53 - cursed
47:53 - it's very uh entertaining in a way that
47:56 - i like to to read it
47:57 - and to to find all the stories between
47:59 - me and
48:01 - there's a hundred boys that i've dated
48:04 - so just just so everyone's clear who's
48:07 - looking at this right what we're seeing
48:08 - right now
48:08 - on screen that you're sharing yes is a
48:11 - picture of some a person
48:13 - with a name alonso at age 27 and then a
48:16 - description written below
48:17 - can you tell me where you're headed on
48:19 - the road do you have any life goals or
48:20 - dreams that could be started in any
48:21 - format
48:22 - can you go through each one of these
48:24 - like where did the photo come from where
48:26 - did the name come from how did you pick
48:28 - the age
48:28 - and how did you get text okay okay so
48:32 - i'm gonna go scroll a little bit the
48:34 - profile picture is actually
48:35 - from scale down two and also there's
48:37 - like a ff hq data set
48:39 - so like you just mentioned learning to
48:41 - train the photo and they generated like
48:43 - like a nonsense a human that actually
48:45 - looks like
48:46 - real enough uh we pull it actually from
48:49 - the side the code
48:51 - not just a human uh because the easier
48:53 - they're using the same model to train it
48:55 - and it's easier to pull data from them
48:56 - every time you refresh the page you'll
48:58 - generate the new data
49:00 - and the names who are like getting it
49:02 - from the social security administration
49:03 - just find like common
49:05 - voice name and dating bio is trained
49:07 - from the okcupid profiles
49:09 - and we pick so if you have you state um
49:12 - if you have you say okay cuba you'll
49:14 - probably know there are like multiple
49:15 - questions out there
49:17 - and we picked the first question which
49:19 - is a dating bio
49:20 - and trade the dating bio which is can
49:21 - you tell me where you had it on the road
49:24 - and also what is this weapon so we match
49:27 - but what happened after we bought
49:28 - prepared food at zarbar 10 minutes into
49:30 - the date he said your kind of guy
49:32 - wants to marry but i want to have fun
49:33 - with pretty ones first we never talk
49:35 - again
49:36 - so what he said here is also trained
49:38 - from okcupid
49:39 - uh it's trained from fun fact and also
49:42 - what you're looking for
49:44 - and we put that into the context
49:45 - programmer
49:47 - and then we generate it with the end of
49:49 - we never talked again
49:51 - so and then you click and you can swipe
49:54 - as many as you want
49:55 - uh this one said if you lose 10 pounds
49:57 - you'll be a 10.
49:58 - very bizarre but this actually got trade
50:00 - from the real data
50:02 - but yeah this is our our project that
50:05 - is a fun entertaining to work on but
50:08 - also it's fun to rate it
50:09 - and it's very interesting to think about
50:11 - how data got used
50:13 - uh online and on dating profile because
50:17 - the data privacy
50:20 - yeah fantastic yeah
50:23 - play with this project play with like
50:27 - is this um is this i'm currently online
50:29 - at the url can people go try it out yeah
50:31 - exactly uh go click that billboard thing
50:34 - uh
50:35 - in front of you well i'm just gonna oh
50:37 - so over here yeah
50:38 - yes there's a billboard thing here
50:42 - and then you click this billboard and
50:43 - then there will be a website
50:45 - okay learn more about the project yeah
50:48 - so hopefully this is going to keep not
50:50 - kick me out of yorub and go into a new
50:52 - tablet see what happens
50:54 - oh i see and i actually see the project
50:56 - website i will check this out
50:57 - so i just wanted to say like one of the
50:59 - things that i love about this project
51:00 - many things but is it's really a great
51:03 - example of how
51:04 - when you're using you know techniques
51:06 - for machine learning or
51:08 - uh generative algorithms to create what
51:10 - is this entire like fictional story
51:12 - basically
51:13 - but there's so many elements of that
51:14 - story and you've used a different
51:16 - technique and a different data set
51:17 - for each element and it's um uh i i i
51:21 - love to hear about the process of why
51:23 - you chose different ones and what data
51:24 - set and i know
51:25 - how hard you all worked on sort of
51:27 - developing this project um so
51:28 - great job um wonderful to see thank you
51:32 - okay so everybody i'm in just so you
51:34 - know i'm in your blit3
51:36 - if you're watching this live i'm putting
51:37 - the url up the screen your blitz3.itp.io
51:40 - you can go um there yourself and then
51:43 - you can also find the url
51:45 - if i click on here and click on project
51:47 - website um there we go now i found and i
51:50 - found alonso
51:51 - uh right here that we saw so i could see
51:53 - i can see the actual project wonderful
51:54 - great job
51:56 - yeah thank you okay i'm going to wander
51:59 - around to figure out i'm going to check
52:00 - my list as to where i'm go
52:02 - my uh team my team of producers is
52:05 - telling me to go next
52:08 - see you all everybody i'm wandering over
52:10 - here here we go
52:11 - all right uh so that was awesome
52:14 - uh i'm looking at the chat now just for
52:17 - a second they are
52:18 - hiding in the corner i don't know what
52:19 - that means sean
52:21 - um all right so let's see ready to go
52:24 - is position eight where am i i'm in
52:27 - three
52:28 - is there any other three listed here
52:31 - ready to go position eight c so let's
52:34 - try
52:35 - going to your blit eight this is my
52:37 - really
52:38 - highly sophisticated technique where i
52:40 - change the number in the address bar
52:43 - and i hit
52:48 - yes i want the full experience i want
52:51 - the full experience
52:55 - uh yeah use my microphone but please
52:57 - could you could you please
53:00 - use my virtual camera i worked so hard
53:02 - on this
53:03 - i worked so hard on my virtual camera
53:05 - it's not showing up
53:06 - it shows up here it shows up here
53:10 - enter can i press my happy sound
53:15 - i see people oh i see people i hear
53:17 - people
53:18 - yes uh i'm going to position 8c
53:23 - let's see uh oh i see a blank screen in
53:27 - 8c
53:28 - this is not a good sign but we're going
53:30 - to head over there oh i'm like
53:32 - i've never been so hunched over in my
53:33 - life while live streaming i'm just like
53:37 - here we go this project is the chocolate
53:40 - factory oh
53:41 - my connection failed now why do i get
53:43 - that message and then oh
53:45 - i've lost control i'm spiraling out of
53:47 - control i crashed oh my god where am i
53:49 - going stop
53:50 - no come back go back oh my god europe
53:53 - has gone out of control
53:56 - oh my god where how help i'm gonna hit
53:58 - refresh
53:59 - refresh refresh here we go
54:01 - [Music]
54:03 - and
54:09 - look they're all the people there's i
54:10 - think there's a there's a very small
54:11 - group of people it's like my
54:13 - entourage that's like falling around so
54:15 - i feel like there's a whole bunch of
54:16 - people at hc right now
54:19 - come to your blit 11 says yonatan okay
54:22 - okay i i will go to your blit 11 but
54:25 - first i must go to hc
54:30 - okay yonatan says come to your little
54:33 - eleven i by the way
54:34 - if you're saying in the chat come to a
54:36 - your blit i'm coming to that your blit
54:39 - uh chocolate factory i will have to come
54:40 - back to
54:42 - uh we're going to your blit 11
54:45 - and duh
54:46 - [Music]
54:50 - i have a lot more sound effects i'm just
54:51 - using this one
54:59 - i think maybe i need to read some more
55:00 - random hours up up up i want the full
55:02 - experience
55:03 - so i need to know where in your blit 11
55:05 - to go i mean i'll go anywhere
55:07 - uh
55:11 - all i see is your blitz 11 okay moving
55:13 - around
55:16 - is there a tour guide here by the way i
55:18 - believe the ushers
55:19 - in yorba are called ushers or is it
55:22 - ushers are you shells i don't know
55:27 - um okay i'll look for a project that
55:29 - seems on
55:31 - um here's something
55:34 - hello um i'm supposed i'm good i'm
55:38 - supposed to have a big sign on me that
55:39 - says i'm live streaming but
55:41 - it's not working so i'm telling you that
55:42 - i'm live-streaming this
55:46 - is that so if you if you want to send me
55:49 - away i will go away
55:50 - if you don't is is this your project
55:52 - here yes
55:54 - oh wonderful um would you mind telling
55:58 - uh the viewers of the coding trade a
56:00 - little bit about yourself in this
56:01 - project
56:03 - yeah sure so so briefly
56:06 - we created of your gallery oh and so i'm
56:09 - sorry to interrupt you i have a bad
56:10 - habit of doing this this is a
56:11 - collaboration between the two of you
56:13 - yeah can you can you tell uh can you
56:15 - tell us your names and any other
56:16 - collaborators
56:17 - oh okay so you're team leo
56:21 - and my name is kevin and my name is
56:24 - hanzo
56:26 - so uh yeah we we
56:29 - made a building leo which is a
56:32 - social vr platform like a
56:36 - vr gallery so
56:39 - um we both have designers background
56:43 - and i thought we thought 2d a flat 2d
56:47 - screens in
56:48 - real world has a limitation of digesting
56:51 - future of computational crap
56:54 - so we use vr technology and
56:57 - game engines to create a environment
57:00 - where artists can
57:01 - express the future of expression i would
57:04 - say
57:06 - so we created a whole clear gallery
57:10 - environment
57:11 - with six different rooms with six
57:13 - different themes
57:16 - so um idea is coming from
57:19 - collecting our secure moment
57:22 - and memory so we recreated this
57:26 - uh designs and like from our
57:29 - memory with the light insulation
57:33 - and sound experience and spatial
57:36 - environment
57:37 - [Music]
57:46 - so also multiplayer
57:50 - can play in the same venue
57:59 - together as well
58:06 - oops fantastic um is this
58:10 - i you know i obviously in the context
58:12 - here we're just seeing this sort of
58:14 - documentation
58:15 - is there a url is this a thing that
58:17 - people can try
58:18 - um right now if you click this signboard
58:21 - here
58:22 - there is a website and i also unloaded
58:25 - applications so
58:26 - if you guys have oculus quest you guys
58:29 - can try
58:30 - uh this whole experience with octopus
58:33 - quest
58:48 - wonderful thank you so much for sharing
58:51 - thank you all
58:53 - does anybody know what station yonatan
58:55 - is at
59:01 - nobody knows okay we're gonna find
59:02 - jonathan
59:07 - maybe 11c
59:13 - meditative experiences oh yeah
59:22 - can you see me yeah i can can you hear
59:24 - me
59:25 - yeah i'm teaching it can you kiss me now
59:28 - yeah we're good it's our it's how
59:31 - you're lit
59:32 -  we're up up
59:35 - beep beep beep that's me censoring out
59:39 - the language
59:40 - see this is the problem i want to be
59:41 - live streaming sign
59:43 - all right is this uh oh this is where i
59:46 - just was
59:47 - okay i don't know where yonitan is
59:51 - i don't know where yonitan is and i've
59:53 - i've ceased be able to navigate i can't
59:56 - turn to the right anymore
59:58 - what is going on ah here we go let's try
60:00 - going this way
60:01 - we're gonna return to the lobby ready
60:03 - everybody
60:04 - we're returning to the lobby
60:09 - 11h okay i see it in the chat 11 e
60:12 - a b c d e f
60:16 - e f wait
60:19 - g yes g h there we go okay
60:23 - i'm coming over to 11 h hello

60:42 - uh sending bringing me here
60:46 - f wait g yes g
60:49 - oh wait there we go somebody's got my
60:51 - stream open
60:53 - it's 30 seconds in the past the audio is
60:56 - coming out
60:57 - let's see okay i think we're back
61:00 - i think we're good so i'm wandering
61:02 - around asking people to just introduce
61:04 - themselves and tell us a little bit
61:05 - about your project so
61:06 - take it away cool uh so here's my
61:09 - project
61:10 - uh it is let me get my camera
61:13 - [Music]
61:16 - little little remote control car wow
61:19 - yeah um so basically what this thing has
61:22 - is it's got if you can
61:24 - see right here this is an infrared
61:26 - distance sensor
61:27 - and probably me what you can do
61:31 - is you can take uh any kind of object
61:34 - uh like a box here and what you've got
61:37 - is um
61:38 - you can drive it forward
61:43 - and what it will do is it will graph out
61:47 - the side of the box just like that
61:51 - and then what you can do is you can
61:52 - click on hold on
61:54 - i'm sorry to interrupt you i'm going to
61:55 - go wander over to the screen share
61:57 - because i think i'll be i'll have a
61:58 - better view there
61:59 - sure okay i could still hear you i think
62:02 - you can see
62:02 - on the stage the graph and everything
62:05 - awesome right behind you
62:07 - okay i'm good
62:11 - yeah let me let me uh demonstrate again
62:15 - um so i've got the car and you've got
62:19 - any kind of object right here and uh
62:22 - using
62:23 - arrow keys you can drive the car forward
62:25 - and as it passes the box you can see
62:27 - that it
62:28 - graphs the side of it
62:31 - and then what you can do is you can
62:32 - click at the start and the end
62:36 - and it will tell you the length with
62:39 - semi accuracy 17.8 centimeters
62:44 - and i've got a ruler
62:47 - and this box is
62:50 - uh 18 and a half so it's
62:54 - almost perfectly accurate still needs a
62:57 - little bit of calibration
63:02 - wow fantastic and i can see here this
63:05 - looks like this is a
63:06 - p5.js sketch is that right yeah
63:09 - absolutely
63:10 - oh i think i missed the last thing you
63:14 - said
63:15 - yeah it is a p5 sketch amazing
63:18 - and had you used and this is is this a
63:20 - is this a project you did
63:22 - for the physical computing course yeah
63:24 - physical computing
63:25 - and uh computational media ah so you did
63:28 - it crossbars
63:28 - um and so and so you're using the p5
63:33 - serial library
63:34 - to communicate between the car and p5
63:37 - itself fantastic yeah
63:38 - exactly i love the way you're presenting
63:42 - this like it's such a challenge
63:44 - to present these kind of projects
63:48 - in this context yeah it works so yeah i
63:51 - had to
63:52 - uh yeah i had to get the camera feed to
63:54 - be part of the uh
63:56 - of the sketch in order to make this
63:58 - whole thing happen
63:59 - yeah yeah
64:04 - wonderful and had you ever um you know i
64:06 - know obviously you were familiar with
64:08 - itp before you came had you ever
64:09 - worked with p5 before this semester or
64:12 - was it your first time
64:13 - no no uh p5 no programming no nothing i
64:16 - used to be a musician actually
64:19 - yeah amazing did you work on any like
64:23 - music related projects this semester or
64:25 - do you think that's something
64:26 - you'll can like think about my uh my
64:28 - past
64:29 - uh physical computing program was a
64:32 - little guitar
64:33 - um using stretch sensors and p5 to kind
64:37 - of
64:38 - make little notes i wasn't a guitarist
64:41 - but
64:42 - yeah guitar seems like the most uh yeah
64:45 - appropriate choice
64:46 - yeah i for me teaching programming i i
64:48 - find so many students have music
64:50 - backgrounds are interested in music and
64:51 - sound and that's definitely one of my
64:53 - sort of missing pieces of my knowledge
64:55 - base and i always feel a little bit
64:56 - lost um and always excited to see what
64:59 - students are doing with
65:01 - computation and music so great job thank
65:03 - you so much for sharing this
65:04 - thank you thank you so much thanks for
65:05 - bringing your entourage here
65:07 - of course and so people can find out
65:09 - more first of all
65:10 - you can come here right everybody
65:12 - watching and come to your blit 11
65:14 - station 11 h and you can also see
65:18 - here um you can click on the sign post
65:20 - which says space mapper car
65:22 - and if i click here on the project
65:23 - website we'll see
65:25 - probably some documentation oh look at
65:27 - this we've got like a circuit diagram
65:29 - and all sorts of other information
65:30 - about how this was made fantastic
65:32 - wonderful
65:34 - okay off we go uh to where will
65:38 - where will we'll be led we don't
65:41 - no i just like awkwardly
65:44 - slide away that's how i do it bye thank
65:47 - you so much
65:50 - uh all right i could return to the lobby
65:52 - coming over here to the middle i'm gonna
65:53 - look at my
65:55 - uh oh the weather band is ready to go
65:58 - and that is a zoom
65:59 - project i believe i think so let's
66:02 - go to uh
66:06 - the weather band project how do i find
66:08 - that
66:09 - i'm gonna leave yorb for a second i need
66:11 - a break i'm out of here
66:14 - oh my god that's very stressful this is
66:16 - very complicated
66:17 - i also need to eventually move on with
66:19 - my evening the point of me doing this
66:21 - as fun as this is and hopefully you're
66:23 - you're enjoying this or
66:24 - finding projects and people are telling
66:26 - me to come to 3a
66:28 - was that my goal here was is not really
66:30 - to visit all the projects myself
66:32 - but to show people how to navigate the
66:34 - itp show itima show
66:36 - and encourage you all the viewers to go
66:39 - yourself and i can bring back my urls
66:42 - here
66:44 - your.itp.io or itp.nyu.edu
66:47 - so we're going to go to the weather map
66:49 - let's search for
66:52 - weather band introduction oh wait
66:55 - whether journals no that's a different
66:56 - project weather band
66:58 - close and this is a zoom room okay
67:01 - everybody
67:02 - this is very exciting we're about to go
67:04 - into zoom
67:06 - let's see what happens
67:09 - oh i should have made my name i should
67:11 - rename myself
67:13 - to live broadcast but whatever i think
67:16 - it might say codingtrain my name
67:18 - so hopefully that will help people know
67:20 - that what they're about what they're
67:22 - getting themselves into before i enter
67:25 - now i actually don't know if the zoom
67:27 - audio is going to make it through
67:30 - to um
67:35 - to the actual youtube stream itself okay
67:39 - let's put on some
67:40 - waiting music here
67:43 - while i check loopback
67:46 - zoom and audio source it is if i turn it
67:48 - on
67:51 - oh i'm connecting okay
67:54 - naturally come to that i probably will
67:56 - not have anything to do with my thesis
67:58 - but i did take um sound studio with luke
68:01 - this past semester um and if i'm
68:05 - if i'm lucky i can get to apply some of
68:07 - that to what we're doing next semester
68:09 - yeah awesome
68:10 - hello coding train hello so this is my
68:12 - like warning sign to tell people
68:14 - that this is a live broadcast as i enter
68:18 - these semi public spaces so people can
68:20 - quickly
68:21 - leave or turn their camera off or
68:23 - something i haven't figured out how to
68:24 - do this effectively
68:25 - but i thought this is better than
68:27 - nothing i really you know anyway so but
68:29 - i'm sorry to interrupt in the middle but
68:31 - i've got a small
68:33 - group of people watching who i would
68:35 - sure would love to
68:37 - hear about the itp weather band project
68:40 - [Music]
68:43 - name do you want to say so we are we are
68:47 - my tv weather band and we
68:50 - make music with data collected from the
68:53 - diy weather station
68:59 - do you have anything to add like name
69:03 - yeah so this year we are focusing on
69:06 - building the system
69:08 - um behind the weather ban like the
69:11 - database and the server and also we have
69:13 - some
69:14 - new instrument coming as well so yeah
69:16 - let's watch the video
69:18 - together
69:22 - here's what you want to share i cannot
69:24 - share okay
69:25 - i have a better internet here
69:32 - yeah itp
69:35 - weather band is an experimental band
69:37 - creating music with
69:39 - weather data collected from a diy
69:41 - weather station
69:42 - and we have been working together for
69:45 - the past year
69:46 - to build a networked weather station
69:49 - system
69:49 - and create experimental instruments that
69:52 - turn
69:53 - the environmental data into music and
69:55 - visuals
69:57 - this is the weather station installed
70:00 - like love by animals then
70:02 - this is a circuit that is boosting the
70:04 - data
70:05 - onto the web so here is our
70:08 - system diagram so what are we doing is
70:12 - the weather station is getting the
70:15 - winter data
70:16 - and we are using i don't know mkrt
70:18 - intend to
70:19 - getting the data and then um through the
70:22 - wi-fi
70:23 - we posted the data to our database
70:27 - on the daily ocean server and
70:31 - after we having the data in the database
70:34 - people can get the data
70:36 - using a http request our client can be
70:40 - p5 client arduino client or website or
70:44 - any client that can do http requests
70:47 - and here is our api
70:51 - so as for our database which is set up
70:53 - with microsoft we have
70:54 - um our old documentation and database
70:58 - here and
70:58 - our the point is that we started as a
71:01 - performance band and we did a few
71:03 - performances
71:04 - but now uh we are developing the
71:06 - performance and also
71:07 - uh we are trying to grow as an open
71:09 - source project that like people
71:11 - in the anywhere in the world can
71:14 - set up their diy weather station um
71:18 - and then also and contributing to our
71:21 - day on weather data network and also
71:24 - we have some p5 and arduino examples
71:27 - that people can just use
71:28 - to get our weather data um that's posted
71:31 - like every one minute
71:32 - like a lot of um data like wind and rain
71:36 - um and illuminance and uv and everything
71:39 - to
71:40 - combine into their creative projects
71:44 - and just to show some of the projects
71:47 - like using the data um
71:49 - this
71:52 - by skylar and um ichan at new
71:56 - new school they're collaborating on this
71:59 - website
72:00 - that is uh veteran website but is a
72:03 - very nice graphical sculpture
72:07 - that is reacting to the
72:10 - weather data in real time
72:16 - and also we had this performance last
72:20 - time
72:23 - [Music]
72:49 - music performance and network music
72:51 - festival and we
72:52 - are all in different locations like a
72:54 - people who are different locations using
72:57 - the
72:57 - weather like different weather data from
72:59 - the same period of time it's the first
73:02 - day of the summer
73:03 - and these are all the instruments made
73:06 - on that music developed by
73:10 - the band members
73:21 - [Music]
73:30 - so
73:32 - [Music]
73:34 - [Applause]
73:34 - [Music]
74:01 - may 6th cloudy
74:15 - and we have some new instruments that we
74:18 - are meeting like dp
74:19 - like every two weeks um to continue this
74:22 - project and then these are from
74:24 - um new members which are first years
74:27 - this
74:28 - is one of these by sihen
74:30 - [Music]
74:31 - and this one is by cu the visual
74:35 - instrument using the illuminance data
74:39 - for this um light sculpture
74:59 - yay thank you
75:04 - um that was fantastic you know i've
75:06 - heard so much about
75:07 - this project and i've seen bits and
75:09 - pieces but it was really nice to finally
75:11 - be able to sort of like
75:12 - settle in and get a full sort of like
75:14 - survey and presentation uh
75:15 - i'll tell you i have actually like a
75:16 - sort of vested interest in the project i
75:18 - know you sent an email about this and i
75:20 - hadn't gotten a chance to reply yet but
75:22 - a huge challenge for me in teaching
75:25 - is to find sort of stable and easily
75:28 - accessible
75:29 - free uh data sources for people to begin
75:32 - with like just to learn the
75:34 - low json function for example in p5
75:37 - and actually i have several people who
75:40 - watch the coding train know that i have
75:41 - like a whole series about working with
75:43 - weather data and in the video i make a
75:45 - joke like
75:46 - by the time you watch it this api
75:47 - probably won't be available anymore
75:50 - and or like you'll have to pay for it
75:51 - and that's actually the case i was using
75:53 - dark sky
75:54 - which then um i believe apple bought
75:56 - them and shut them down or whatever you
75:58 - can't use it so like
75:59 - so anyway i think it's really exciting
76:01 - to see
76:02 - like these kinds of like open source
76:04 - style
76:05 - um initiatives the to that
76:09 - not only like teach people that are
76:11 - opportunities we're able to learn about
76:12 - working with data
76:13 - but you know you've got this whole like
76:14 - hardware system that you've built
76:16 - to like make the api itself so it's
76:18 - really thrilling and i wonder
76:20 - you know what and just the way you're
76:22 - showing like all these different
76:23 - projects that came out of it so i hope
76:25 - that this can grow and that people can
76:27 - make their own weather stations they're
76:28 - going to be
76:28 - a lot of them and it's super exciting so
76:31 - thank you for doing this work
76:32 - i i definitely think i need to like add
76:34 - to my list make a basic like here's a p5
76:37 - example that gets the weather
76:39 - you know from this api so remind me
76:41 - about that maybe maybe in january
76:43 - um with xer calm down i can like
76:47 - take a minute to to make a video about
76:48 - that be great yeah we really yeah i
76:50 - think that would be super exciting
76:52 - and then we will um yeah make sure the
76:55 - weather station is working hard
76:56 - [Laughter]
76:59 - and then we don't plan to install in
77:00 - multiple occasions the name is thinking
77:02 - over in thailand then like in china and
77:05 - maybe i can
77:05 - ensure in korea so right is there is
77:08 - there just
77:09 - one right now or yeah so one thing you
77:12 - might consider actually by the way
77:14 - also is and maybe this isn't relevant
77:17 - maybe i
77:17 - is like creating a sort of like
77:21 - sample also api that's not real data but
77:24 - like allow people to sort of like
77:25 - test the idea out of like getting
77:27 - multiple sources
77:29 - so i haven't thought this through and
77:31 - here i am just like live talking off the
77:32 - top of my head live streaming here but
77:34 - that could be something to think about
77:36 - also if there are sort of
77:38 - things that you're thinking about
77:39 - scaling and features you're thinking
77:41 - about offering
77:42 - you know you can sort of test those out
77:44 - and have people use them
77:45 - um without the hardware in place um and
77:48 - that also like if it ever goes down then
77:50 - there's still like
77:51 - you know a backup feed that works even
77:53 - if it's historical data i think there's
77:54 - interesting possibilities there
77:56 - yeah yeah we do have historical data but
77:59 - that's a great idea of the example api
78:01 - yeah yeah we are here we are yeah we are
78:04 - like still developing different features
78:06 - so thanks so much for the suggestion
78:08 - yeah mostly i'm just really stuck on
78:10 - this thing where it's like no matter
78:11 - what
78:12 - i use like it's not there a year later
78:15 - or
78:15 - it's changed because i'm often relying
78:16 - on these sort of commercial services
78:18 - that you know change very rapidly so
78:21 - anyway uh thank you so much for sharing
78:23 - this project
78:24 - i hope people watching um can we're
78:26 - joining the itp weather band i see we
78:28 - have a viewer
78:29 - who says i live in thailand that's super
78:31 - exciting um i'm
78:33 - i'm going to wrap up soon so i'm going
78:35 - to wander off and try to catch
78:36 - one or two more projects but anybody
78:38 - wants to see
78:40 - come and visit your zoom room they can
78:42 - do that by going to
78:43 - the show website which i have in the
78:45 - video's description searching for itp
78:47 - weather band and then
78:49 - join live okay so maybe hopefully after
78:51 - i leave
78:52 - some people will come and ask you some
78:53 - more questions
78:55 - thank you okay bye everybody
79:01 - okay that was so successful it like
79:05 - worked and there was a presentation and
79:07 - you could see it i got to turn my camera
79:09 - off for a minute and i could just take a
79:10 - i could like meditate and i was reading
79:12 - my random number book actually i was
79:13 - quite glued to their presentation it's a
79:15 - very exciting project
79:17 - and it's just like uh i'm just so
79:20 - surprised so not really surprised
79:21 - because
79:22 - i see the creativity from students at
79:26 - itp and ima
79:27 - and people from all over the world all
79:28 - the time but it's amazing to see how
79:30 - just this one little piece of data
79:33 - can launch so many different kinds of
79:34 - threads and ideas for projects
79:36 - that riff off of that data all right
79:40 - where do i go next
79:44 - [Music]
79:47 - it's getting close to 9 pm my children
79:49 - need to be put to bed actually they kind
79:51 - of go to sleep on their own they're a
79:52 - little bit older now but
79:53 - i should say good night to them i would
79:56 - really like to encourage people to go
79:57 - visit the show
79:59 - lil z crazy g is asking what is itp so i
80:02 - did
80:02 - talk about this briefly at the beginning
80:05 - of the stream
80:07 - you know if you go to the show website
80:09 - you can read a little bit more
80:10 - about the different programs but itp is
80:13 - a graduate program located in brooklyn
80:15 - new york
80:16 - where i teach and many other people
80:17 - teach and many people are students and
80:18 - many people work there so many wonderful
80:20 - people
80:20 - um and you can visit the virtual floor
80:22 - which is like a 3d model of the actual
80:24 - space
80:25 - and wander around at yorb so um
80:28 - uh crabby is possibly a bit late but
80:32 - crabby i am so glad that you are here it
80:34 - is always wonderful to see your
80:36 - green name crabby second account someday
80:39 - you will grace us
80:40 - with the presence of your first account
80:42 - i know it will happen someday
80:44 - but we'll we'll take your second account
80:46 - right now all right i'm i'm going to
80:48 - head over to your blit 12
80:52 - your blit12 let's go to just the main
80:54 - yorb
80:55 - and wander over to your blit12 okay i
80:58 - really really wish
81:00 - that my live streaming sign would show
81:01 - up
81:04 - but i don't think it's going to so we're
81:06 - going to go this way
81:08 - oh there's a help desk
81:11 - hey it's the help desk
81:14 - okay i'm gonna move on i don't like
81:17 - wandering around here people don't know
81:19 - that i'm like live streaming them your
81:21 - blitz eight
81:21 - your blit9 okay you're a blip
81:25 - where am i going and then you're
81:31 - okay here we go you're blit 12. here we
81:35 - [Music]
81:40 - go
81:42 - i'm gonna fall okay click enter okay
81:44 - here we go
81:45 - whoa oh sorry for landing
81:50 - here we are your blitz 12 going to 12 b
81:55 - uh b is an easy one for me to find
81:57 - because it is the letter
81:58 - after the letter a in the alphabet and i
82:01 - do know that much without having to sing
82:03 - the song
82:04 - but it is nice to sing the song
82:08 - uh oh 12 b hmm i don't see anything
82:11 - going on here
82:12 - 12b where did you go in my secret
82:15 - message
82:16 - system which tells me which projects are
82:18 - ready for me it says
82:19 - ready to go i need also to like cross
82:23 - them off
82:24 - once i've already been there i uh
82:27 - we'll wait for a minute while i
82:31 - look around to see what where else i
82:32 - might go
82:36 - um um
82:40 - four f doesn't say ready to go oh wait a
82:43 - second ate
82:44 - pandy i think i know this project
82:49 - oh yes we're gonna go see if we can
82:51 - visit handy
82:52 - uh your blit8 so we'll come back
82:55 - please hold everybody wait
82:58 - anybody here sound drop
83:02 - wait 12c is active
83:09 - hello um i'm supposed to have a big sign
83:12 - that says i'm live broadcasting
83:14 - so that i don't surprise people so
83:18 - you could run away if you want or tell
83:20 - me to run away and i will gladly do so
83:22 - but if you will accept me here i would
83:25 - love to stay and hear about your project
83:27 - if this is your project okay
83:31 - you're kind of like a celebrity here yes
83:34 - thank you very much that's
83:34 - why that is the most absurd thing i've
83:37 - ever heard but i will take it
83:39 - okay okay so
83:43 - so tell me tell us your name um and
83:45 - about the project that you're presenting
83:46 - here
83:48 - okay for the other people as well i'm
83:50 - charlie i'm the first year student in
83:52 - itp
83:53 - and this is my um my first year project
83:56 - it's called
83:56 - wait it's not actually playing sorry um
83:59 - it's
84:00 - called a scene so basically it's an
84:02 - interactive interaction
84:04 - and also animation and coding p5 sketch
84:07 - it's a combination of all these forms um
84:10 - so
84:11 - um it's basically the idea of like
84:13 - seeking for
84:14 - a weakness of my life of my
84:17 - uh moments of up ups and downs so
84:19 - somebody who can be my supporter
84:21 - so i choose to be uh
84:25 - in the um so basically it's like three
84:27 - different forms
84:29 - just just a very quick uh walk through
84:31 - so first you're gonna see this little um
84:34 - uh just let me know if you can see it or
84:36 - you can hear my sound um
84:38 - i can definitely see it and i hear your
84:39 - voice but i don't think i hear that
84:41 - great
84:41 - great sound from the sketch yeah
84:43 - excellent so first we're going to see
84:45 - this p5 sketch
84:46 - so basically um it's it's actually have
84:49 - the
84:50 - monologue playing as a background sound
84:54 - oh now i hear it yeah you can hear
84:57 - uh let me know if you think it's true
85:06 - uh-oh now i don't hear or see anything
85:12 - what happened do people hear me jump if
85:15 - you hear me
85:18 - oh okay people are jumping i don't hear
85:21 - anybody
85:21 - did we lose um
85:25 - our project creator oh no now i can hear
85:27 - you
85:28 - oh yeah sorry so i shouldn't play the
85:30 - sound because every time i played sound
85:32 - my voices got cut off ah got it anyway
85:34 - yeah there's a sketch just like uh
85:36 - you is this just like um how to say like
85:38 - a narrative this
85:40 - stages first you're gonna like um
85:43 - basically just um
85:44 - when you uh the the mouse access is
85:47 - worth controlling this whole schedule
85:49 - here so when you just um move the mouse
85:52 - from the
85:53 - uh left to right it will lead you to the
85:55 - next stage and at this stage you're
85:57 - going to like
85:57 - collecting this like little eyes when
86:00 - you hit the 20 you can see it moves
86:02 - moves you to the next stage and you're
86:05 - going to see this little animation
86:07 - as a video embedded in the sketch and
86:10 - you're gonna listen to monologue and the
86:12 - sound
86:13 - and just gonna be you know just like a
86:15 - quick like what
86:16 - no just move the mouse from the left to
86:18 - right you're gonna move to the next
86:19 - stage
86:20 - so there's gonna be four stages i
86:23 - i if i remember correctly it can be four
86:26 - stages you can be
86:27 - you know just
86:35 - oh i think we may have lost audio again
86:38 - oh
86:38 - no i hear the audio from the video from
86:40 - the sound from the screen
86:47 - how about now can you hear no now i can
86:49 - hear you again yes
86:51 - okay did you visualize where
86:54 - where where did you lies um
86:58 - it's hard to say okay
87:01 - there was a there was a giant eye with
87:03 - like heart emojis in it that was the
87:05 - last thing that i saw
87:08 - oh yeah this one so basically just like
87:11 - a presentation of the all the videos in
87:13 - the p5 sketch
87:15 - um you just like move the little mousex
87:17 - things and just walk through
87:19 - the whole sketch and that's it
87:22 - and for the next one uh it's in unity
87:26 - um it's like uh it's not it's not vr
87:29 - because i didn't
87:30 - make this one for the vr setting
87:37 - what is it um sorry i just i just hear
87:40 - dance like the voice take it
87:42 - back yeah i think what happens i think
87:44 - is that people have the live stream open
87:47 - on their computer
87:48 - and then it's they don't have headphones
87:50 - it like comes out through their speakers
87:51 - into the mic
87:52 - and then ends up in your but trust me if
87:54 - you're finding it hard to figure out
87:56 - what's going on
87:57 - with hearing my own voices also but this
88:00 - is really beautiful work
88:01 - i love i mean first of all i always love
88:03 - seeing um
88:05 - such you know sort of creative new uh
88:07 - visual ideas
88:08 - that get programmed in a p5 sketch you
88:10 - know i always think well
88:12 - what is else is there but the sort of
88:13 - like shapes and things you can do but
88:15 - i'm always
88:16 - just every year surprised by sort of new
88:18 - um new designs and visual ideas i also
88:20 - just like that how you have all these
88:22 - different
88:22 - um it really feels like to me like
88:24 - there's a i'd love to like
88:26 - experience it myself but there's like a
88:28 - story you're telling and there's
88:29 - different aspects of the story but
88:30 - there's this one
88:32 - sort of a visual this icon really the
88:34 - eye
88:35 - that kind of is the through line that
88:36 - sort of connects everything and that
88:38 - i think that works super well yeah thank
88:41 - you
88:41 - first for the coding part you just
88:43 - mentioned thank you for the coding
88:44 - change
88:45 - that's where i picked up all the things
88:47 - that i learned
88:52 - wonderful um is the sketch online
88:55 - somewhere
88:56 - like if i go maybe to the sign will
88:57 - there be a url
89:01 - okay i think we might have lost uh okay
89:05 - scene and if i go here project website
89:10 - um i could see it here oh wonderful okay
89:15 - oh look at this amazing amazing look at
89:18 - all these
89:19 - beautiful oh and we see the sketches

89:42 - evening i hope people should come
89:44 - to your blit12 yourblit12.itp.io
89:48 - come and check out scene as well as
89:51 - other projects that are here
89:52 - in your blit12 i'm going to wander over
89:54 - to the middle um and figure out where
89:56 - i'm going next okay bye everybody
89:58 - thank you bye
90:02 - all right i'm gonna just this is here we

90:22 - project
90:23 - oh handy is where i wanted to go where
90:25 - was that uh
90:26 - your blit8 all right i'm heading over to

90:33 - say good night don't worry there's more
90:36 - coming
90:36 - in quoting trade coming in 2020 and then
90:39 - a lot of coding train coming in 2021 but
90:41 - um here we go we're going over your
90:43 - blit8 everybody
90:46 - this is the theme song for your blitz 8.
90:56 - come on you're blind you can do it
91:01 - just want everyone to know that i worked
91:02 - really hard on this sign

91:17 - b is fun uh
91:21 - a b oh no project so sad
91:25 - this is a project i know well because a
91:27 - version of it was made in a machine
91:29 - learning class i taught a year ago
91:32 - and so i definitely would encourage you
91:33 - to check it out
91:35 - handy is a wearable interface
91:36 - interpreting tangible interaction to
91:38 - intentional experiences
91:39 - using emg signal and machine learning so
91:42 - it's not here right now but you can
91:44 - obviously come and click on the
91:46 - the sign here and check out the website
91:48 - all right we're gonna try to find one
91:50 - more project
91:52 - one more project tonight people all
91:54 - right we're gonna travel back
91:56 - in time to yours
91:59 - and find ourselves a project to take us
92:03 - out
92:03 - tonight on the coding train i mean i'm
92:05 - gonna stop i'm gonna still be here
92:07 - in europe in the show i just gotta stop
92:10 - live streaming at some point
92:12 - uh all right
92:14 - [Music]
92:17 - let's see i'm looking at my 3b did i go
92:21 - there already
92:23 - i don't know what project that is that's
92:24 - the problem so i can't remember if i
92:26 - went there
92:28 - it's my project actually 3b
92:32 - i'm right here oh should we go over oh
92:34 - amazing see the problem is my stage
92:37 - broke
92:37 - so the link isn't working i appear to be
92:40 - having very unique technical
92:41 - difficulties
92:42 - i can share my screen and if you want to
92:45 - go back there i can share my screen
92:46 - yeah let's do it h now because 3b is
92:49 - broken three so i should head to yorb33h
92:52 - that's where we're going to ph this is
92:54 - like this is like in
92:55 - olden times where we had to plan where
92:57 - we would go and give each other
92:58 - congratulations
92:59 - and then there was no way to communicate
93:01 - unless we just happened to be there
93:03 - yeah i don't know if anybody ever lived
93:04 - through the time where i would actually
93:05 - give my friend a
93:07 - pay phone number and make sure they had
93:08 - quarters this is the thing we used to do
93:09 - in new york city
93:10 - okay yes everybody i am old okay we're
93:13 - going to now i already forgot where i'm
93:14 - going 3h right
93:16 - 3h 3h okay here i go see you there
93:23 - all right here we go
93:28 - oh come on enter
93:33 - boom ah that was quite quite a rough
93:36 - landing there
93:37 - um i think this is working okay
93:41 - three e a b c d e f
93:44 - g h i like to say h ash
93:49 - okay anyway here we go i uh here we go
93:52 - ah here i am
93:55 - um okay i'm here to involve technology
93:59 - in our society
94:00 - and our day-to-day lives hi everyone
94:06 - there's somebody standing on top of you
94:08 - so i sort of see
94:10 - you only partially
94:13 - i think oh no my connection failed well
94:15 - let's see if i can get back
94:18 - all right am i here
94:22 - does anyone hear me
94:25 - jump if you can hear me
94:29 - the only way to signal people in your is
94:31 - with the body language of jumping
94:33 - all right i seem to have you know what
94:36 - would be a nice feature is to be able to
94:37 - type a little message to like
94:39 - pop up on the top of my head um
94:42 - i seem to have lost my connection i'm
94:44 - going to refresh and come
94:46 - back i don't know if anyone can hear me
94:48 - other than those of you who are watching
94:49 - i'm gonna hit refresh in the browser and
94:51 - i'll be right back
94:56 - just make sure i have sound i do all
94:58 - right here we go refresh
95:01 - i want the full experience okay
95:06 - okay that's like my favorite thing in
95:10 - yorb right now it's
95:11 - like flying in okay okay i'm coming back
95:14 - so the audio should be sharing as well
95:16 - i'm back sorry i lost my connection
95:19 - but i'm back now oh okay okay hey
95:22 - hey okay so um basically my project i'm
95:25 - looking to liminal spaces
95:27 - which is this idea of like transitional
95:29 - spaces whether in a medical or medical
95:31 - physical sense
95:32 - um and it's also kind of this internet
95:34 - trend like i was looking at pictures on
95:35 - reddit
95:36 - where people post these pictures of
95:37 - spaces with no context no people
95:39 - and so basically i did like an ai
95:41 - interpretation of that
95:43 - um so basically this is a web vr project
95:45 - uh let me know if you can see it cause
95:46 - i've been having some difficulty
95:47 - so i can't actually unfortunately wait
95:51 - you can't see it
95:52 - i see you and i hear you but i just see
95:54 - a black screen oh no
95:58 - oh no i really don't know what's
95:59 - happening do you see it
96:02 - yeah i see it do other do other people
96:04 - see it
96:05 - do other people say that no we can't see
96:07 - anything on the screen
96:09 - okay wait let me try something else
96:12 - um okay
96:15 - i can let me see if this works
96:18 - can you see something now no
96:22 - no oh my god this is so sad okay
96:25 - well um i don't know you know how to
96:29 - give my link
96:30 - uh this is very sad thank you for coming
96:33 - no i i so i think we could we can make
96:36 - something of this
96:37 - we can figure this out in a way that
96:39 - gives us
96:40 - like a moment of of of uh
96:43 - like a triumph so i i think if we can't
96:46 - see it that's
96:47 - maybe you could you could you i was
96:48 - enjoying listening to your description
96:50 - of the project
96:51 - so i'd love to hear sort of the end of
96:52 - that and then i can pretty easily
96:55 - even if you just speak it out loud kind
96:56 - of like put a url up on screen so i
96:58 - could say oh yeah let me just
97:00 - check it or i can actually just even i
97:02 - can open it up myself
97:13 - i'm getting the link now sorry okay okay
97:16 - okay i'm putting the link in the youtube
97:18 - oh people are oh that's not going to
97:20 - happen oh craig's here oh my god okay
97:23 - oh are you an ima low-res student yes i
97:26 - am
97:26 - oh oh this is like the most exciting
97:28 - thing ever to happen i didn't even
97:30 - realize that
97:31 - okay now i have so many questions yeah
97:35 - but i but you know maybe i won't ask you
97:37 - to answer all of them right now
97:39 - while live broadcasting but i'm just the
97:41 - ima lo-res is totally new
97:43 - and so it feels i kind of remember this
97:45 - when i would be like an ima
97:47 - student the undergrad program when that
97:49 - was new or just like blow my mind
97:51 - so i want to hear i'm a undergrad and
97:53 - i'm i'm a
97:54 - uh low res so yeah i got really into ima
97:58 - i don't know can't let it go but you so
98:00 - you graduated from ima undergrad
98:02 - yes i went to nyu shanghai and i said
98:05 - nyu
98:06 - because i was going to say we haven't
98:07 - had four years of the program in new
98:09 - york although there have been some
98:10 - transfer students
98:11 - who are yeah maybe graduated but yeah
98:13 - yeah okay
98:14 - was incredible i highly their program
98:16 - there is like so good
98:17 - and where and are your are um i'm only
98:20 - like now i'm like i got to stop
98:22 - asking people to reveal personal
98:23 - information while i'm live streaming
98:25 - but anyway just give me your tell me the
98:27 - url so i can uh pull it up on on screen
98:30 - people will actually see it or at least
98:31 - you're watching
98:32 - the youtube chat okay yeah
98:35 - under my name it's juju codes dot
98:38 - somehow like well that's weird i don't
98:42 - see it i'm like losing i see
98:44 - craig says low res right above craig
98:47 - julia ann myers
98:49 - my full name wait this is so weird i
98:53 - don't
98:53 - see it i saw your name earlier okay let
98:56 - me that's
98:56 - so strange because the the chat and this
98:59 - is live i think
99:02 - oh you mean it could be like from way
99:03 - before uh
99:05 - um i don't know i this is live though so
99:07 - i put it in the chat live
99:09 - the latest mess this is crazy this we
99:11 - got to figure this out the latest
99:12 - message i see
99:14 - is from presto that says why i love that
99:17 - do you not see the message right above
99:18 - that it says i need friends on here do
99:20 - you all want to be friends
99:22 - wait what my messages aren't showing up
99:24 - okay
99:25 - it's juju codes
99:29 - did somebody who's a moderator by
99:30 - accident uh okay
99:32 - juju codes dot github
99:35 - dot github dot io dot io
99:39 - slash liminal mind slash uh oh i'm
99:42 - am i going to spell this right liminal
99:43 - mind slash
99:46 - yes i think i spelled it right that's so
99:49 - lucky okay
99:50 - so i'm here it says enter my liminal
99:53 - mind
99:54 - headphones recommended click on center
99:56 - text to advance
99:58 - please do so i'm going to go forward so
100:00 - i'm going to narrate this and then you
100:01 - can sort of explain what's happening
100:03 - that no one can see you right now but
100:04 - they can hear you still
100:06 - yeah i'm just waiting for the stream to
100:08 - catch up so i can see oh yeah it's way
100:10 - it's way in the past uh click on center
100:13 - text to advance
100:15 - oh no yeah let me know if you hear
100:18 - anything there's supposed to be like a
100:20 - like yeah a monologue and soundscape
100:24 - so the monologue and soundscape are also
100:26 - ai generated so basically i like really
100:28 - gone to this idea of liminal spaces like
100:30 - researching like jg ballard and like the
100:32 - situationists and all that and so
100:34 - um basically i want to explore this and
100:36 - how ai
100:37 - kind of like reacts to our conversations
100:40 - and images of liminal spaces
100:42 - um so basically i trained ai on like my
100:46 - notes about little spaces and used an ai
100:48 - voice to do the voice over and then i
100:50 - create these images
100:51 - these are gann images that i bred from
100:54 - uh
100:54 - liminal space images i collected from
100:56 - reddit and other parts of the internet
100:58 - and so and then i stitched them together
100:59 - in photoshop to create accurate
101:00 - rectangular photos to create this web vr
101:03 - um so i learned a lot i use a-frame
101:05 - and i wish you had a video on that i
101:08 - hope that's coming
101:09 - you know well i'd have to learn it first
101:10 - maybe you can uh help me
101:12 - figure out how to use it um yeah so i'm
101:14 - in there and i'm seeing this room and i
101:16 - see
101:16 - the text that says look around you and i
101:18 - can look around one thing i'm curious
101:20 - you know i have a lot of people who are
101:21 - watching or from all over the world are
101:22 - not necessarily native english speak
101:24 - speakers and i'm wondering if you could
101:25 - sort of define that might be helpful to
101:27 - hear
101:27 - in your own words like what what what
101:29 - you mean by liminal space like what how
101:31 - do you define
101:32 - that in terms of this product in the
101:33 - context of this project
101:42 - maybe you can't hear me
101:48 - i do hear the monologue do people hear
101:49 - the monologue
101:51 - very quietly well i'm going to go back
101:53 - into europe to see what's going on
101:55 - can you hear me still i can hear you now
101:59 - sorry
102:00 - oh i know oh i've been talking and
102:02 - talking but it must be that the uh my
102:04 - mic
102:05 - gets muted if i go to a different tab
102:09 - so i was curious one thing i was curious
102:10 - if you could just you know for viewers
102:12 - who might not be sort of familiar with
102:13 - the term or maybe you have a particular
102:14 - point of view of the project can you
102:16 - give us a definition of liminal space
102:18 - and
102:18 - how um how do you think of that for this
102:20 - project yeah sure so little space just
102:22 - basically means trans
102:23 - transitional transitional transitional
102:26 - space so basically it's a space like
102:27 - maybe
102:28 - in between uses so i feel like
102:30 - capitalism produces a lot of these
102:31 - spaces that are like for example
102:33 - empty malls empty parking lots like
102:35 - these kind of empty spaces that are in
102:37 - between
102:38 - um particular uses but also it's kind of
102:41 - been an internet trend in recent years
102:42 - you go to the subreddit liminal space a
102:44 - lot of people kind of post these photos
102:46 - and they like
102:46 - evoke nostalgic feelings also like
102:49 - people are creeped out by them i think
102:50 - it's like the lack of context
102:52 - combined with unidentifiable elements
102:54 - like visual indeterminacy
102:56 - so that was actually my link because
102:57 - like i realized visual indeterminacy is
102:59 - the quality of luminal face photos
103:00 - as well as gan photos i'm like really
103:02 - into like an art breeder and all that
103:05 - and so that's what kind of like the
103:06 - connections like i want to like create
103:08 - my own little space photos um
103:10 - kind of trained off of these ones i was
103:12 - collecting so the combination of like an
103:13 - interesting internet movement
103:15 - as well as like yeah liminal is like a
103:17 - very
103:18 - you know over all encompassing term but
103:20 - yeah
103:21 - wonderful that's super helpful to hear
103:23 - and i i i um
103:24 - i think you've really you know you've
103:27 - you've
103:28 - you've found something here about this
103:29 - sort of connection with this concept and
103:31 - idea
103:32 - and the kind of strange and
103:35 - you know images that are produced now by
103:38 - your synthetic uh images that can be
103:39 - produced by the different ai models
103:41 - um and by the way i think we discovered
103:44 - the mystery of the missing message
103:47 - uh this is this came from arnov who is a
103:50 - dedicated coding trained viewer i'm
103:51 - going to put his
103:53 - message up on the screen for people who
103:54 - are watching he says
103:56 - maybe the message got filtered out by

110:22 - attic in brooklyn with a lot of computer
110:24 - equipment and apparently a very
110:27 - robust internet connection the fact that
110:29 - all i'm live streaming all this stuff
110:31 - all right so we're gonna head over to
110:32 - nine f if um um ellen if um
110:36 - if um if maria comes back you can send

110:54 - round of applause
110:56 - yay it's just gone off um
110:59 - so uh maria please tell us
111:02 - about the cyborgian rock all right
111:07 - so the cyborgian rock
111:10 - is a chat box actually um
111:13 - i build it after watching uh
111:16 - a couple of the videos that you made to
111:19 - them
111:20 - um about rescript oh rhyme script yes
111:25 - oh that's so exciting to hear amazing ah
111:29 - i i didn't know i it's as if i planned
111:31 - it this way that's so exciting to hear
111:33 - cool so yes and um
111:36 - and i was exploring this this concept of
111:39 - social presence
111:41 - the the idea that um even
111:44 - dots in a chat message produce a feeling
111:48 - of of another person or some being there
111:52 - and i was also very interested in
111:54 - animism
111:55 - so um the rock is is not
111:58 - a consumerist type of a
112:02 - product it is encouraging you to think
112:06 - um about nature to observe
112:09 - it stimulates uh optimistic imagination
112:15 - um
112:18 - i think um the
112:22 - as people interact with it i'm able to
112:24 - improve it and
112:25 - [Music]
112:27 - work with the uh dialogue to make it
112:30 - better
112:33 - um amazing so wait um can i can oops oh
112:36 - i pressed the wrong button
112:37 - ah here i am i'm back um can i
112:40 - or not me but can is it i what i'm
112:43 - seeing right now is this sort of like a
112:44 - live
112:45 - interaction with it um yes that's uh
112:48 - this is me
112:48 - interacting so i'm gonna go up closer
112:50 - can you type a message to it
112:53 - absolutely okay tell me what to type
112:55 - then um all right i'm gonna uh
112:57 - the chat is way behind but if anybody
112:59 - has a question
113:00 - wants to suggest a question from the
113:04 - uh to ask of the cyborgian rock we have
113:06 - a unique opportunity here
113:08 - this is a you know once in a lifetime
113:11 - opportunity
113:12 - to speak directly to a rock
113:17 - so far nobody has come up with a
113:20 - suggestion
113:21 - all right i will uh come up um
113:24 - let's see maybe something train themed
113:27 - um um
113:30 - can i ask the rock if
113:34 - um if it uh i'm really like expecting
113:38 - somebody like
113:39 - something profound to suddenly just
113:41 - appear into the chat but it doesn't seem
113:43 - to be happening
113:43 - i'm gonna have to come up with it myself
113:45 - okay um
113:47 - um how um
113:51 - how is how
113:55 - is the weather
113:58 - the weather where you are
114:03 - that's my like super creative question
114:10 - the being of hills and wind carry me
114:13 - across oh the beings of hillson went
114:18 - carried me across
114:19 - that is very profound
114:25 - what um are is the sound effects that
114:27 - i'm hearing part of the experience i'm
114:29 - hearing
114:30 - crickets yes these are the sounds around
114:32 - the
114:33 - rock so when i begin
114:36 - to type their assignments and
114:40 - we are not hearing anything because
114:42 - we're in our own presence
114:44 - but as soon as i exit the
114:48 - input box
114:52 - but i think this this this deserves a
114:54 - follow-up
114:56 - uh comment yeah i'm i have so many
114:59 - questions about
115:01 - the hills where are these hills if the
115:04 - wind can carry the rock let me ask the
115:06 - rock
115:07 - um are you alive
115:14 - this this might need a drumroll
115:17 - would it matter to you oh oh oh it would
115:20 - matter to me
115:22 - the chat is suggesting i ask if uh lava
115:25 - is good or evil
115:27 - it's a lava groot
115:31 - or evil
115:34 - i'm seeing some messages from some folks
115:36 - telling me to check out the zoom rooms i
115:38 - have been to
115:39 - one zoom room uh for sure

116:09 - people
116:10 - and if anybody wants to come and ask

116:14 - so you can ask your questions to the
116:16 - cyborgian rock directly

123:23 - coming into the chat i'm so excited that
123:25 - we can make this
123:26 - happen by the way i'm like europe is so
123:28 - amazing but it's i find it to be very
123:30 - stressful and now being in a zoom room
123:32 - i'm like oh
123:33 - this is so familiar it's so relaxed
123:36 - i do have and i have my sign working
123:38 - because just in case i arrive somewhere
123:40 - people aren't aware they know that this
123:42 - is a live broadcast
123:43 - all right so um i'm checking i'm on the
123:46 - tail end here
123:47 - we've looked at many projects i'm super
123:49 - excited to be here and hear about
123:51 - the blur clock so tell um
123:54 - each of you if you could introduce
123:55 - yourself and and tell us a little bit
123:56 - about your project
123:58 - surely um so my name is aiden lincoln
124:02 - fowler and
124:03 - um i'm the second year at itp and my
124:06 - name is young min choi
124:08 - also second year at itp uh this is our
124:11 - project called blur clock
124:12 - um so we built a clock that uses machine
124:15 - learning to detect if you're looking at
124:16 - it
124:17 - and it only shows you the time if you
124:19 - are look if your eyes are open in front
124:21 - of it
124:22 - so we have a webcam um and when it sees
124:25 - your eyes it pushes
124:26 - an led screen that has a clock on it
124:29 - towards the front
124:30 - and it becomes legible um and when you
124:32 - close your eyes it retracts the screen
124:34 - back into the box and becomes blurry the
124:36 - whole thing is based on a book called
124:38 - the order of time by carlo revelli
124:41 - and it's basically about how time only
124:44 - exists from a
124:45 - human's blurred perspective of reality
124:48 - and we
124:48 - actually make time by measuring it
124:53 - um we also have a clock called sunclock
124:56 - um young you want to talk about that
124:58 - yes a sunclog is an abstract version of
125:01 - learnclock we built a server that
125:05 - asks um for sunrise and sunset time when
125:08 - you enter
125:08 - zip code and based on your location it
125:11 - will place the
125:12 - sun at where he's at and right now we're
125:15 - showing just the whole animation
125:17 - throughout the day
125:18 - but it'll actually move really really
125:20 - slowly
125:21 - um and i can show you a quick demo of
125:26 - how it looks like so is that the sorry
125:28 - is that the clock right behind you
125:30 - yes so
125:34 - so right now it's drawing the animation
125:38 - no
125:41 - but it looks like i'm seeing it kind of
125:43 - like a mirror
125:44 - but then i saw an animation going across
125:46 - it but i'm just seeing it's just that's
125:48 - an artifice of it being a
125:49 - screen that is it has a piece of
125:51 - dichroic film on it so it acts as a
125:53 - two-way mirror
125:54 - so it changes color and it's a gradient
125:56 - as you walk by it but when the lights
125:57 - behind it you can see through
125:59 - oh now and now i'm seeing this is like a
126:01 - uh um
126:03 - a recorded anim uh video of the claw of
126:06 - the song like wow no it's not a video
126:08 - it's running
126:09 - um like on a fast a
126:12 - fast pace but if we set up
126:15 - so that you just place the time the time
126:18 - it would move very slowly over the
126:19 - course
126:20 - of it yeah where it is at it'll move
126:22 - really slowly
126:23 - um and where is so i see that clock
126:27 - where is the um the other clock the one
126:30 - that looks free
126:31 - clocks yes i'm running a local server
126:34 - um and
126:38 - we i can turn on and off sun clock or
126:40 - the blur clocks
126:41 - oh it's the same physical device that
126:44 - you're able to oh
126:46 - okay wow you're picking that up like
126:48 - move it back and forth you can see the
126:49 - color change
126:50 - if you if you tilt it yeah there you go
126:52 - so hold on i i had you aiden
126:54 - large there for a second so let me get
126:56 - um young but great yeah
126:58 - okay oh amazing yeah
127:01 - so um i hope um
127:05 - i because of the letter i don't think
127:07 - it'll work
127:08 - um why but um
127:11 - we tested before it sort of works
127:13 - through zoom
127:14 - and we can i can pin someone's video
127:17 - and it reads the face um
127:21 - and uh it moves back and forth
127:24 - so interesting
127:27 - you know it's funny i was sort of when
127:28 - you were talking about it for a moment i
127:30 - was like thinking it through
127:31 - and i was imagining that it worked only
127:34 - when you're not looking at it
127:38 - right which is sort of interesting to
127:39 - think like uh you know can you
127:41 - like this idea that time isn't real you
127:43 - can't actually
127:44 - get there right like if you look away it
127:46 - sort of is there and you look back
127:48 - but anyway that's neither here nor there
127:50 - but it's interesting to sort of think
127:51 - about the sort of range of
127:52 - possibilities um have you um so
127:56 - young obviously it's like it's there
127:57 - physically with you have you been sort
127:59 - of like
128:00 - you know i don't know if this is the
128:01 - right term to apply but user testing it
128:02 - so to speak like
128:04 - do you have you do you sort of like live
128:05 - with the clock and interact with it or
128:07 - the sun version
128:08 - or the blur clock or is it mostly just
128:10 - kind of like it came together very
128:11 - recently
128:12 - so um i personally like to use uh blur
128:15 - clock is really
128:16 - um fun because it's it really has like a
128:20 - subtle and smooth way of interacting
128:22 - with the clock
128:23 - but when you turn the clock sun clock on
128:26 - throughout the day it's really nice to
128:28 - see
128:28 - like because it's it's all different
128:31 - throughout the seasons
128:33 - so for example winter we have shorts a
128:36 - certain amount of sunlight time so it's
128:38 - interesting to see
128:40 - um how much sunlight we have
128:43 - but yeah it's it's it's been really
128:46 - great to
128:47 - use our tests yeah i also really like
128:49 - the idea that if you know you have to
128:51 - give it your like focused attention
128:53 - you know where so like the clock isn't
128:55 - just going to display the information
128:57 - it needs you to like be sort of like
128:59 - present with it
129:00 - and so there's something kind of um
129:04 - touching about that or unique it gives
129:06 - it a sort of quality of character
129:08 - in a way um i'm just curious so is it
129:10 - all
129:11 - um just i'm curious about some of the
129:13 - technical information is it all
129:14 - self-contained
129:16 - like is there a camera in the device
129:18 - it's not um and there what's
129:20 - and you mentioned it's using machine
129:21 - learning so there's some like
129:22 - pre-trained model that you're running
129:24 - that's taking a look at the camera image
129:25 - and just doing face detection or eye
129:27 - detection or what's um
129:28 - can you tell us a bit about the
129:30 - logistics of that
129:32 - sure it's all embedded and the server is
129:34 - running on a local host
129:35 - when you um turn the clock on so you it
129:38 - could just work with the phone and it's
129:39 - using opencv
129:41 - um eye tracking so it it first finds
129:44 - your face
129:45 - then it finds your eyes and then it
129:46 - checks if your eyes are open or not
129:48 - so it's using three different models or
129:50 - kind of two models
129:53 - and did you do both these projects for
129:55 - the same class are they different
129:56 - classes or
129:59 - uh we built it for time class but i i
130:02 - combined it with
130:03 - uh understanding networks so that's
130:05 - where we built like the
130:07 - app controller amazing wonderful yeah i
130:10 - can see now i can see it blurred right
130:12 - now it's funny like
130:13 - i'm staring that's really quite uh
130:15 - beautiful wonderful
130:17 - amazing so thank you so much for sharing
130:20 - this project
130:21 - um so for people who want to learn more
130:25 - um they can go to the show website
130:26 - that's where i found i'm just gonna pull
130:27 - that i'm pulling that up right here
130:29 - um under projects under blur clock so
130:32 - first of all go here you can you could
130:33 - be
130:33 - in this zoom room with us right now i'm
130:36 - gonna jump out real fast so before
130:38 - everybody comes
130:39 - racing in here but you could come i'm
130:40 - just trying to
130:42 - you can come and ask your questions
130:43 - about uh the blur clock but also
130:46 - i'm assuming if i click on the name blur
130:48 - clock i also get to
130:50 - a page with a description and learn more
130:52 - some more documentation so definitely
130:54 - come check out this uh wonderful work
130:58 - thank you so much thank you for sharing
131:00 - this okay
131:01 - i'll see you all soon oh great okay

131:15 - it's 9 45 this show only goes till 10.
131:19 - but you know there was another part of
131:21 - the day today where i thought
131:22 - maybe i'll do a little like advent of
131:24 - code challenge also but all right we're
131:26 - going to go to
131:27 - the your blit9 um we are going to go to
131:30 - your blit9 and try to get to 9f
131:32 - if anyone's in there you can let them
131:34 - know that i'm on the way
131:36 - um yorb 2020. we're going into yorb

132:30 - the fight's final destination
132:33 - and we're going to head over to 9f and
132:36 - see what we can find
132:37 - out this project and like have
132:41 - two people who trust each other two
132:43 - performers perform it rather than and
132:44 - see how people respond to that because
132:46 - that's
132:46 - i
132:57 - i'm supposed to have a big sign on me

133:59 - chance
134:00 - i'll run away very quietly but if you
134:03 - would be so kind i would love to hear
134:06 - about this project and
134:07 - i think it works pretty well especially
134:08 - if we wander a little bit closer to the
134:10 - stage
134:11 - because then i can get a little bit
134:12 - closer for people to see with you also
134:14 - in the frame
134:16 - yeah sure so if you want to come like
134:17 - stand like off to the side

134:27 - enrique
134:32 - okay yeah take it away okay
134:35 - so this is i am an amelo rest project
134:39 - for a class called connections lab and
134:42 - this is
134:43 - our secret forest that you and i created
134:47 - for you all so it is an interactive
134:50 - experience that we it's a collective
134:52 - interactive experience
134:54 - so maybe if you want daniel you can
134:57 - join us there if you go to the poster
135:02 - and at the bottom part there is a link
135:05 - that will take you to our secret forest
135:08 - when we can play together
135:10 - okay shall i head there now or is there
135:12 - anything else you want to tell us before
135:14 - i
135:14 - do maybe we can express it like first
135:17 - and then
135:18 - okay then i'll come back okay i'm gonna
135:19 - do that i'm heading to the poster
135:22 - well there's so many people here uh oh
135:25 - there's the poster
135:27 - here we go secret forest i'm clicking on
135:28 - the poster at no people on my way okay i
135:30 - got it
135:31 - and now i'm gonna go to project website
135:33 - i'm gonna open that a new tab so
135:34 - hopefully i'll still be here in yorb
135:36 - but um i'm heading over to that other
135:38 - tab
135:39 - allow move my nose
135:43 - into the hexagon okay ready to play
135:47 - oh i'm in the forest and my my sign is
135:50 - here
135:51 - [Music]
135:56 - whoa
135:56 - [Laughter]
135:59 - oh boy are people hearing this this is
136:02 - amazing i guess i should put my camera
136:04 - back on
136:08 - fly into the forest listen to the music
136:18 - [Music]
136:23 - [Applause]
136:23 - [Music]
136:33 - [Music]
136:44 - [Applause]
136:47 - okay this is amazing i think i'm gonna
136:49 - go back into europe now let me close
136:52 - this tab
136:54 - come back here okay i've come back
136:58 - hey yeah so that was our secret forest
137:04 - amazing you know it's interesting i
137:06 - couldn't i found myself just swaying and
137:09 - then i couldn't stop swaying
137:11 - you know just i settled into like a
137:12 - groove with it
137:15 - and then i almost wanted it it's very
137:16 - beautiful to look at but i also felt
137:18 - this moment that i just wanted to
137:20 - kind of close my eyes it's actually a
137:22 - really nice project for me to sort of
137:23 - like finish
137:24 - off my wandering through the show
137:27 - because it's uh
137:28 - it's very relaxing and soothing is that
137:29 - the sort of intention
137:31 - behind it to bring people together in a
137:33 - networked way
137:34 - but with a different feeling than we
137:35 - might have ordinarily and
137:38 - and i i don't mean to describe your
137:40 - project to you i'm giving you my sort of
137:42 - impression of it but i'd like to hear
137:43 - about some of the reasons why you made
137:45 - it and what you imagined the experience
137:46 - to be
137:46 - [Music]
137:48 - yeah uh maybe do you want to talk about
137:52 - that part yeah the project idea is
137:55 - actually
137:56 - uh starting from very simple idea how we
137:59 - can bring the music experience online
138:03 - and through our user test
138:06 - we we find overlapped two people
138:09 - together
138:10 - is the most people love experience
138:13 - so we go for this direction and and then
138:16 - we
138:17 - how to say develop our project and we
138:19 - want to focus that part how to
138:21 - build an intimate relationship when
138:24 - both of us uh remotely but we actually
138:27 - are in the same place
138:29 - to to to to build a deep connection with
138:31 - each other yeah maybe enrique can add
138:34 - more about that project
138:35 - yes ah this comes in many different ways
138:38 - like uh
138:39 - we wanted to do a musical instrument
138:42 - for the web but also like uh like very
138:46 - based on
138:47 - uh many collaborative projects like i
138:50 - don't know like
138:50 - even physical ones like react table and
138:53 - uh
138:54 - just like this sense of can like playing
138:57 - together
138:59 - and then that uh lead us to this
139:03 - intimate uh kind of setting when you
139:06 - overlap people
139:08 - and you can have like this shared space
139:10 - and i think that's like a
139:12 - part of the uh benefits of
139:16 - of doing this in web because you can
139:18 - connect
139:19 - people and to allow them to to play
139:23 - in this this kind of scenario
139:29 - wonderful is it um is it only a
139:32 - two-person experience or is
139:34 - it as many people who join no
139:38 - i think for the prototype it's only
139:40 - allowed two maybe
139:41 - three or four because we want to develop
139:44 - this project
139:45 - in a long way so we also imagine how
139:48 - this project can be
139:49 - in the public space to to install some
139:52 - screen in the public space so people can
139:55 - interact with
139:56 - people how to say in the other place so
139:59 - so to build
140:00 - that physical space remote relationship
140:03 - but it's intimate
140:05 - connection yeah actually like like in
140:07 - the technical part you can
140:09 - yeah like many people can join but i
140:11 - think it's designed
140:13 - only for for two people
140:17 - and do you imagine that people would use
140:20 - it in the sort of way we did here where
140:22 - we sort of came together and said oh
140:24 - let's go
140:24 - there and try it or would it be
140:26 - something that you
140:28 - you know you end up in it with a random
140:31 - person that you don't know is that part
140:33 - of your thinking behind it in terms of
140:35 - how two people would find each other to
140:37 - experience it
140:39 - yeah that's a good question actually uh
140:42 - i think uh there's
140:44 - like we see two ways for this project
140:47 - like to evolve
140:48 - into maybe we can do both but uh
140:52 - like first one it's like a musical
140:54 - interactive experience
140:56 - uh that maybe can be on a public space
141:00 - or
141:00 - something like that and the other one
141:02 - it's a performance tool for actual
141:05 - institutions to create with people
141:08 - around
141:08 - the globe so it depends on which
141:12 - direction we want to take which
141:17 - um two other things that i just like to
141:19 - say that i really love about it one is i
141:20 - loved your use of hexagons
141:22 - like i'm so used to interacting with
141:25 - sort of grid-based pixel-based systems
141:28 - and something about the hexagonal
141:29 - pattern is just has a different quality
141:32 - to it
141:32 - that is um just gives it a
141:36 - unique feeling and it's very like sort
141:37 - of playful um
141:40 - uh abstract quality that's just like
141:42 - taking that makes it feel less like
141:44 - computery in a nice way but still very
141:46 - sort of geometric and understandable
141:48 - and then also i think you've found like
141:50 - it's always really tricky with these
141:51 - projects to strike the right balance
141:52 - between um
141:54 - my i want to be able to see what i'm
141:56 - doing and understand what i'm doing
141:57 - as but i don't really want to be fully
142:00 - there like i need it to be abs
142:02 - it makes me uncomfortable to be like
142:03 - sort of like looking in a mirror with my
142:05 - camera
142:05 - fully on display of course that's what
142:07 - we're all doing right now i do all the
142:09 - time
142:09 - but there's something nice i think you
142:11 - know i was able to really see myself
142:13 - see you and kind of move together but it
142:15 - was
142:16 - it was clear but it also had a kind of
142:18 - ghost-like abstract quality that i think
142:20 - worked really well
142:21 - so wonderful job really beautiful work
142:24 - thank you thank you okay um
142:27 - everybody should come and first of all
142:29 - so people can just go to the webs the
142:31 - website the same way i did right now
142:33 - yeah so people should go and check out
142:35 - the oh there's a very weird noise
142:38 - happening right now i don't know what
142:39 - that is
142:40 - static horrible static okay i gotta go
142:44 - move away from that static
142:46 - anyway uh everyone should go to i'm to
142:49 - go back to find that link
142:52 - right here secret forest i'm so bad at
142:55 - navigating
142:56 - your this is why i lose every single
142:59 - among us game i ever play um
143:01 - project website uh here um if i click on
143:04 - project website
143:05 - um i will be right here in the secret
143:07 - forest which you can see the url right
143:09 - here a
143:10 - dash secret dash forest dot glitch dot
143:12 - me
143:13 - um but more more more than that i would
143:16 - encourage you to come
143:17 - right here to yourblit9.itp.io
143:21 - and visit with the creators of the
143:23 - secret forest
143:24 - themselves you've got about four minutes
143:26 - i can't believe i ended up live
143:28 - streaming the entire show
143:29 - the whole point of me doing this was to
143:32 - just do it for a little bit at the
143:33 - beginning
143:34 - and then get out of the way so that
143:36 - everybody else would
143:37 - um would enjoy it so but i'm gonna i'm
143:39 - gonna quickly close out your i don't
143:41 - know if anybody's still hearing me in
143:42 - europe i'm closing the link
143:44 - i'm closing this link i'm turning this
143:46 - off

144:03 - winter show
144:04 - my name is dan schiffman i am your host
144:07 - of the coding train
144:09 - the year 2020 is almost over i have some
144:13 - things still on the horizon you might
144:16 - know me from my
144:17 - how to program your own discord bot i

144:31 - discord so if that interests you
144:33 - head on over to youtube youtube.com i
144:36 - think that's the url
144:38 - slash coding and i'm not trying to i

145:19 - their whole life is like if only
145:21 - only somebody would make a video that
145:22 - explained what required
145:24 - node.js meant um so that you can go
145:27 - check out um young man is telling me to
145:29 - go check infinite reflection
145:31 - i don't know where that is i think i've

Cleaned transcript:

hi there hi i'm fake oh okay hi oh yeah it's um i'm checking your uh live now oh uh where oh yeah yeah i can look at it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's working really well okay do check one check one does everyone hear me is my audio okay oh you could hear me that whole time that's very strange were you hearing me having a conversation there i'm not sure what's going on i got to get started in just about one minute or a few minutes do so do test hello oh my goodness i'm i'm technically challenged right now there we are hello good evening welcome to a special well at least eastern time nighttime edition of the coding train i am here to do something very special today um so you might be wondering what uh as as was just asked in the chat by pin ball oh you got me pinball oh my goodness i can't believe what's happening right now um you might be wondering what is the itp ima show hi alca i haven't seen you in a while alka welcome back to the coding train maybe you've been here all along and just haven't seen your name pop up um so um this is my uh there's a bunch of things that i tend to do at the end of the year and this is sort of like item number one so my uh regular day job uh besides um being this uh uh internet uh weirdo is um being a teacher at new york university a school at new york university called tisch school of the arts and a program called itp as well as one called ima so itp is a twoyear graduate program an ima is a well four year undergraduate major and at the end of every semester the students usually gather physically in person and you know transform the entire floor where all the classrooms are and the labs into a giant exhibition gallery space that is not happening uh this year it didn't happen last spring either instead the show has moved virtual i mean it's not really virtual what's virtual about it it's happening it's real we're just look we're just experiencing it through the through mediated through video and audio and all sorts of stuff so um what i have typically done in the past is spent my time wandering around with my phone trying to live stream and a microphone and looking at projects and interviewing students today really i'm just here to invite you you can see the urls up there i'm gonna i'm gonna take a little time to show you all the bits and pieces of how the show works it actually doesn't start technically for 20 minutes so um so i'm going to show you how uh where you can find projects where you can uh interact with other people i'm going to show you the website i'm going to show you this thing called yorb which is really incredible um and then hopefully i'm gonna just back away slowly turn off the streaming button and let you experience the show for yourself and i'll be around there you can chat with me and say hello um in the virtual spaces as well so that's what i've got on the agenda for tonight are you ready are you excited i hope so but as always on the coding train we must begin with the ceremonial reading of the random numbers now how do i do this i have to find i'm going to open up discord here so if you aren't a member of the coding drain discord a link should be popping up in the chat right about now it probably actually happened about 30 seconds ago because you're behind me in time but the chat is in real time um and i'm looking for where did i last end up i think i forgot to post no i didn't row 17 column zero i am embarking on uh a project it is my goal it's my lifelong dream to read this entire book out loud the book of a million random digits i'm really not doing a very good job with that i'm gonna have to live a very very long time unless i somehow speed this process up but every time i live stream i try to read a little bit of it so here we are it is evening time night time time for children to go to sleep gotta sleep children i guess it's actually only 7 40. finish your homework whatever whatever i'm supposed to yell as a parent who is up in the attic live streaming and reading from a book of random numbers aha okay so let's move on to line 18 and tonight's random numbers will be starting at row 18 column zero sixty nine thousand nine hundred and sixteen twenty six thousand eight hundred and three sixty six thousand two hundred and fifty two twenty nine thousand one hundred and forty eight thirty six thousand nine hundred and thirty six eighty seven thousand two hundred and three seventy six thousand six hundred and twenty one thirteen thousand nine hundred and ninety by the way i think i was supposed to read row 17. i'm on the wrong row mr over you'd wear that that that's next week's random numbers seventy four thousand three hundred and fifty ninety nine thousand eight hundred and seventeen seventy seven thousand four hundred and two seventy seven thousand two hundred and fourteen forty three thousand two hundred and sixty three two hundred and ten wow that's quite a number i feel like the first time i've ever read a number that below one thousand in this book forty five thousand five hundred and twenty one sixty four thousand two hundred and thirty seven ninety six thousand two hundred eighty six two thousand six hundred and fifty five all right so one of the reasons why i like to read these random numbers is because i don't want there to be any confusion whatsoever about what's going on here this is nonsense and you should probably tune out and again might i remind you ah shoot i moved my camera around and i'm just like i don't have enough vertical space to reach up so i have to like practice not going too high um you should not be watching me instead you should be visiting show itp.nyu.edu yorb.itp.io but for the time being there's about 15 minutes till it officially starts you can stay here and i'll kind of talk you through and show you um what's going on all right i'm looking at the chat i see people are saying they're sleepy um they're gonna use the julia says i'm going to use these as lottery numbers i'm rooting for you i'm really rooting for you um all right so what do i need to do first let me move over here to my laptop whoops no over here there we go and i think i can well i guess i can leave these messages up here maybe i'll just unpin them now for a second but i'll bring them back so what is it that i want to do first so let me open up open broadcast studio so first of all one thing that i have a really difficult time with oh and this is photoshop maybe some of somebody watching can actually help me make a nicer version of this but one of the things i'm struggling with is i'm about to go into uh you know semipublic online space and essentially be recording people i'm actually more than just recording it i'm live streaming so this is akin to you know perhaps playing roblox um a game like that and live streaming your experience and there's other players in the on the server and maybe there's an understanding that people have when they're in one of these spaces that there are other people who might be streaming it or recording it um but this place where i'm going is not a particularly anonymous space in fact people can have their cameras on and be visible and so i don't really know uh in in the physical show i could walk around with a physical camera people sort of see that as like a social cue oh there's somebody with a camera and a microphone if i don't want to be on camera i could sort of move out of the way also being in the sort of public space of the show there are signs up that kind of um explain that your you know the sort of permissions around um your photo maybe being taken and recorded in the space so i know i'm going on for a long long time about this but i've been thinking about this a lot and i don't love the idea of kind of going into this 3d world that i'm about to go into and live stream it but i think the benefits here outweigh the downside in that i'm going to bring some attention and and have a little bit fun and see the show and students will be able to interact and you'll be able to see some of their projects so this is my solution i'm using open broadcast studio to get my camera and then put a like message over the top that says live broadcast i wonder if it might make sense for me and i was just quickly mocking this up in photoshop so first of all these should definitely be the coding train uh whoops um instead of these like red dots they should be these coding trained characters which you would think i would have at the ready so i'm going to quickly i'm just like i put my screen away because i'm going to head over to google drive here where i have all of my stuff my stuff okay where are you um characters paid members merchandise no share design design i'm looking at a folder called design design assets um and characters here we go i think i can bring you back now um so i'm in this folder called characters let's go to symbol characters maybe or i really love um i do love my friend the robot this is my new favorite character choo choo bot so let's try uh let's try getting a chuchu bot download i just want this might indicate to people that it's the coding train what uh what else uh is really sort of obviously the coding train is there symbol symbol character is the unicorn here let's go to jpegs let's try the rainbow one this would probably also indicate so i'll download this one this is a png oh it's a jpeg i don't like that why don't i have a png of this here oh there are pngs here uh rainbow okay there we go let's download this i know this is like riveting live streaming watching me attempt to use photoshop which i'm like absolutely terrible at um okay so i think i can get rid of this now and i can i don't know drag and drop is photoshop gonna let me do that uh downloads downloads symbol look at that all right i know what i'm doing here you can't stop me live broadcast and then let's grab a robot oh do i need to like place it okay great let's grab the robot and shrink it a little bit put it over here it's in the corner you're in the corner all right i think people will sort of get the idea uh and if anybody wants to design a slightly better version of this you're welcome to it uh what happened to my oh it's fine uh let's actually like keep these dots really do say live broadcast though um so maybe i should leave these uh trans uh free transform will that do it here we go making them like right in the corner down here uh we can just get rid of this one and where am i here no here now here where i don't even understand what's going on oh that look that's a layer okay there we go so now i can copy paste there we go put that one down here so just make it all along the bottom i think i'm going to stop okay save export quick export is png let's try that to the desktop sure replace that and then is obs gonna perfect so now when i go in so what i'm doing is i have a virtual camera running so i've got the virtual camera running which means if i go to any website that makes use of my webcam instead of just the webcam it's going to show this so hopefully that's going to indicate to people oh i should probably put let's also do this um so let me add one more little bit of text and say youtube.com the coding train and make that much smaller and just put that down here on the bottom uh let's try another quick export export quick export i know you guys are just so this is so exciting there we go oh i spelt it wrong uh come on i can't see it so it's very hard when i can't see it just i need a c in there there we go um do i have to recenter it just tell me where it goes come on photoshop like do it for me automatically close enough close enough i don't know where that is i don't know what's going on i'm trying to line it up with something okay uh quick export i really i should have done this before i started live streaming but you could say i started i just didn't have a lot of time um all right this is gonna be great all right so this is what people will see um and alco oh wait we've got some breaking news here breaking news um obs version 26.1 has added official support for virtual camera for the mac all right that's great to know all right so now this can go away and um let's just run let's go i'm gonna go to a quick test zoom meeting and by the way i'm just going to because i don't know what's about to pop up i'm just gonna put my camera my and let's just see if this at least works with zoom so i'll know let me go to slash test join so there might be an option of visiting some of the projects in zoom meetings and so i'm going to join with video and so with the virtual camera okay yes yes i hear the ringtone yes my microphone's working um so basically uh this is now oops uh me in uh zoom meeting and if i go here under video and change this to virtual camera now this is me in the zoom meeting so you can see that i am live broadcasting now of course i could do that as the background which would make sense and i have a green screen and all that but i actually think it's better for it to be just right up here at front so front and center so people know all right we are ready to head on to over to the itb show i'm so excited so ordinarily um i feel like i know what all the projects are i've seen them all i've seen the students building them i've helped students with them i'm i feel very out of the loop this semester with everything being remote and all my classes being remote i know about some of the projects i participate still but there isn't that like i show up to work every day and wander around the floor and see all the students building their projects so mostly i have no idea what i'm about to find um so this should be exciting i should pin back uh this back up on the screen by the way uh if you are a coding trained member that unlocks a channel in the discord where you can post messages that i can uh bring up here on the screen pretty exciting stuff here i've got going um all right so now let's go on over to itp.nyu show so this is the winter show website um we can start to look down here and i will do a dramatic reading of what this is that we're about to experience uh join us on december 16th if you brought your time machine with you you can go to the show on december 16th or december 17th for our virtual winter show it's a twoday event features projects representing creative applications of the recently possible from three programs of new york university's tissue of the arts itp ima and a brand new program by the way ima low res this is a new program that is a one year masters everything you know is turned upside down this year in education and in many other industries and activities but the low res was actually designed to be mostly online and remote with some intensive inperson um periods in january and over the summer i mean you should check out the website to get the full details but it's pretty interesting model for um uh learning the material and participating in the community that is itp ima so um so this is how um basically th one of the reasons why the time is the students are all over the world this semester and many of them there's a large uh number of students who are in china so if we find any of them it'll be 8 a.m for them whereas it's 8 p.m for me so yorb is really where i want to spend the time so in a minute i'm going to click on yorb but i also want to show you oh my test zoom meeting ended um how i can browse projects on this site which is the website itself so you can read more about itp and by the way let me just highlight all of these wonderful people who have made the show happen sorry stop stop talking to me watch um so it more than just these people because there's a lot of students and a lot of behind the scenes administrative work but just to highlight a few people um esther zhang who did the banner art that you're seeing uh lennon compressed who did the website design and front end development yet yen and chan yen chen who did the back end development the show producers are sean van every rob ryan and ellen nichols thank you so much to ellen who's been sort of feeding me my like sort of secret live stream producer for today it's like feeding me discord direct messages telling me what what where i might go to see a project um aiden nelson who i don't know if it's accurate to say is the inventor of your but the orb is based on a project by dan o'sullivan from many many years ago and there have been a ton of people uh contributing to your the orb team there's a europe club but aiden is your producer and then the resident show assistant producers lydia jessup august blurs billy bennett and yg zhang so thank you big round of applause to all of those wonderful people i wish i could just press a button and have them like appear i could interview them but maybe we'll find them in yorb and we'll be able to interview them in in the space that is yours okay i keep saying yorb you're your bjor bjor bjorb i don't have a yorb song you know my ukulele nothing got a train whistle a little bit out of breath let's get going all right so first thing i want to stop by is check out this browse project on this site so here is where i could actually see a list of all the projects so i can go into this 3d world and wander around and talk to people and find the projects there but if i just want to look at the list of projects you know we could spin a wheel i could have you vote with my live poll about which one we should go to and you can see here if it says join live presentation with a number the number indicates the your blitz which is like a mini orb inside of your oh my god i'm i'm in the upside down aren't i what's going on um yorbjorblit what's happening 11d it's like you know it's like a room number classroom number but you will also find i saw one up here some of them are uh i'm looking i'm looking zoom so this one for example the censor battle star wars edition is a live presentation in zoom and you can kind of see i don't know if i can get down here but you can see at the bottom like this is just a link to a zoom meeting whereas this is a link to a url um your blit2.itb.io all right so this is what i'm really hoping those of you watching will take it upon yourself to um experience so yes you can watch me i'm gonna just ramble on and all i'm very tired and confused and not sure if i'm putting words together that make senses uh but i do have a computer and a microphone and i'm gonna poke around here so this is um this i definitely encourage you to check out all of these projects and join especially the ones that are in zoom um i heard anecdotally yesterday that people weren't finding them as much as they were finding the your projects so it looks like most of them are in europe right now here's a here's a zoom one so yeah so i'm gonna check let me put on a little uh music for you here i'm gonna check my secret direct messages here which have some information about where i might go adding times above okay let's see um move this out of the way i don't know what that means oh closer to 9pm ready to go position 2b okay we are going to ready to go position 2b the title is historia historia let's see there's a search on here right search uh can i do this historia and we're going to go oops oh ethan prince oh i know ethan uh so how do i find ah here we go join live presentation here we go we're heading over to the live presentation of historia in europe and we really gotta just cross our fingers and hope this works cuz i don't know if it's gonna work all right uh yes allow okay so it looks like by the way this is my preview so it looks like i can see in my preview that my weird live broadcast sign is showing up i'm going to hit uh enter and i'm heading into the your blit i'm going to just remove this message here and where would i need to go was it 2 2b all right here we go i can't hear anything wait a second hold on i've got to make sure that the audio from the browser is heading to the stream so if i the thing that i use for that is something called loopback uh google chrome is on and it is heading out being routed out to usb capture so as soon as there's any audio you should hear it we'll find out in a moment 2b 2b there we go hello is anybody here ethan is that you hello hello are you there i like to jump i'm like obsessed with jumping in yorb hello oh ethan is that you yes and you can and you can hear me yes i can awesome now i don't see you which is fine maybe you have your camera off a bug you don't have to be on camera i'm just curious whether it's a bug or not and by the way this is basically i should be on camera okay so do you see me with a giant live broadcast sign on me no no no just you in front of her green screen really yeah ah hold on you think this is using a different camera that's so weird hold on my camera is off now yes uh yeah it's that stopped updating now it's on and it's not a giant uh it's not a giant live live stream sign it's actually just me in front of a green screen all right hold on i'm gonna see if i can make an attempt here very briefly just because i want to get this working um i'll see if i can get my camera okay um ah your blade is allowed i'm gonna go here no camera how do i go to switch the uh camera obs virtual camera yeah and obs virtual camera all right i'm gonna not worry about this too much it was a lovely idea i had i'm going to hit refresh so i'm going to disappear and come right back all right people in the chat hearing the double audio oh that's just because david you're over there okay uh here we go i'm going to refresh and see if it comes back with i'm saying live stream okay here we go enter enter yorb here we go yes webcam i'm following where we see you jonah should we go to two like this yeah 2b is where i'm going by the way this is a live broadcast do you see live broadcast written on me probably not oh wait i think i see ethan now there you are let's reload but it worked now okay and i'm just curious is it still just me or is there a sign in front of me sorry oh well well i won't worry about that anymore so this is my first attempt at live streaming the virtual yorb itp show ethan you are my first uh victim so to speak um and so i don't really have a plan here other than to turn it over to you to tell us about your project called if i'm right historia yes indeed um so i created an automatic reality ios app that's basically built around a walking tour of downtown brooklyn which is the neighborhood where i depend on the itp so you it uses an apple's geotracking api to basically scan your environment to get a hyper precise location of where you are on the street which is necessary for popping up these physical markers around your environment um that show what the neighborhood and streetscape look like 100 or 120 years ago so these photo markers pop up there's also like ambient sound markers and then if you click on them they provide a bit more background information where they came from when they're taken and you can zoom in on the photo um so there are those photo markers then they're like audio ambient markers and there are infoboards on with the more historic uh important sites that were destroyed in the neighborhood so yeah it's apple ios app i'm hoping to have it ready to be released in a month or two with some more user testing and just fun to work on yeah it's undergraduate a new realities class um with the n sebastian oh yeah it was a bit of a mixed bag um because to test it every time you have to go outside you have to put on the mask and it's a look very anxiety do this thing i find especially if you're like going in high rises with elevators um but the opportunity to go outside was certainly excellent once i got outside and it was a fun project to work around with um just exploring the neighborhood making sure that all markers were positioned correctly great so i i have to tell the live stream i have to apologize to the live stream i muted my audio while you were presenting because i needed a minute to like check a few things and fix a couple things and then when i came back to ask you that question i didn't unmute my audio so nobody heard my question which i really by the way there was a very eloquent um deep and meaningful the way i asked it was just ah so so well done if i don't say so myself no i um i very awkwardly asked just about how the pandemic sort of affected the development of this project related to especially as it related to being outside oh my goodness did your just crash or is somebody oh no just somebody with a um a black screen like walked right in front of me and it made everything look empty uh wonderful thank you so much for sharing your project um so people everybody if you want to come and chat with ethan and find out more about historia you can go to your blit2 dot itp dot io i'm gonna zoom way on in up here on the url yourblit2.itp.io and you can um find ethan's project that way and many more projects thank you so much all right so here i go wandering around um i'm going to head this way um let's try going to a let's go return whoops very challenged with using this oh okay let's try returning to the lobby let's see what happens there return to the lobby okay here we go enter drum roll please and and oh here we go all right i got to ask some people if they see my live streaming sign i really want that to work uh david you are here do you see my live streaming sign you know what's going on do you see my giant sign that says i'm live streaming no no no amazing what's up man i've got a killer this whole elab oh i went into a your blit why is that not working why is it not picking up my virtual camera it's making me crazy um all right well i'm in your blood four let me see here that happened by accident where i'm supposed to go next uh position 2d oh i should have gone to position 2d um i really should have gone there because i was already in york too i was at 2b and 2d was right next door your live stream sign was not working and your picture wasn't moving either hmm it's so sad because right here you can clearly see that the preview of myself has the weird live broadcast thing in front of it um and it is so it is picking up my virtual camera why does this not showing up in your oh well i did see it for a second a few minutes ago says nancy hi nancy welcome to the the very last live stream i ever do in my entire life okay uh this is going well i'm gonna look here um so there is a project for f called meet the future let's try to wander over there i don't know if they'll be there i'm a little confused i have a schedule oh ready to go 8c ready to go 8c i see oh ready to go 10a where do i go where do i go now adding times above 10 also 10b and 10c use ml5 okay we're going to your your blood 10. can i just like put in the number 10 here and it'll just send me there secret hack i've hacked yorb here we go what happened to my sound i don't hear it anymore did loot back die did my headphones die i don't know what's going on but i'm not going to worry um do you hear a drum roll i don't hear it anymore okay your blit10 we're going to 10a okay shoot i don't hear any sound anymore that's a problem i do need to hear the people whoa is this this looks like 10a this is so cool do you hear it all right we got to figure out what's going on um loopback my audio routing software chrome is up um let me let me try playing this oh connection failed please restart the page oh no oh no let's try refreshing but also why is this not it's okay all right let's try this again just going to check something here yeah this is up did i disconnect no turn this on all right well i can hear coming out of the speakers why can't i not hear it in my headphones this is going so well let's try this headphone put another one in when in doubt add another headphone let me play actually some music that'll play more continuously okay oh my connection failed well i think we might have to visit a zoom project okay connect all right i'm connected i heard a ah okay i've got sound back again all right okay i've got sound back we're gonna head back over to 10 uh 10b or 10a which project 10 10a [Laughter] did i i wonder if i have singlehandedly brought down yorb through the power of the coding train all 194 people who are watching possibly you know ten percent are actually paying attention and one percent of those people actually went into europe so probably not uh i think the itp show the itv ima show has quite its own uh following i don't know what's going on to be perfectly frank um you know my name is not frank it's dan but and we're like we're in some kind of strange yorb uh uh empty ghost yorb wait is that a person or is that just a sign this is a sign about this project um nancy writes in the chat it makes me so happy to see you having problems with yorb it makes me feel less alone that is like the thesis statement of the coding train it makes me so happy to see you having problems with blank it makes me feel less alone fill in the blank javascript math programming css video yorb i have problems with it all don't be alone be with me i can't do it either let's not do it either together all right um drum roll yes oh no look at all this noah is here and luisa's here there's all these people that i actually know in real life in the chat that doesn't usually happen when i broadcast all right let's try i think we might need to go visit a zoom project i'm a little bit wary of doing that because i'm just kind of landing in somebody's zoom room without them being aware sort of but um i pretty sure um i'm pretty sure that the um the web oh the weather ban says closer to 9 p.m it is getting close to 9 p.m it's already 8 15. uh ready to go 10a let's try a different ur blit ready to go position three let's try your blit3 do you think that different your blitz um my connection will work better with one or another let's try all right drum roll please okay is there anyone here to say hello to me is there where am i going 3c a b c okay c is over here hello hello i i'm waiting to play my ah wait yes i see a project oh and i know this project i know this project hello are you there i don't hear anything wait i heard somebody speak up hello hello who's there this is maria maria oh hello people does anyone see my live broadcast sign that's about my whole life it depends on it no no but i'm watching the broadcast now so okay oh wow your voice is really coming through wait i'm looking hi am i i'm here to oh zao there you are i am here i'm here to uh hear about this project that you've made oh great uh is that okay is it okay that cause i i i i my intention was to have a big sign on me that says that i'm live broadcasting so that i'm not i know that you're alive everybody seems to know it anyway so i i give up okay my face so anyways uh hello tell me your name and this by the way is very artificial because zayal actually made this project in my class so i'm going to pretend as if i know nothing about it tell me your name and uh um about this project and um tell the viewers all about it we'd love to hear about it yeah um hey everyone here's the round shipment uh anzael this is the project i made with my cosmic tinshu it's called 100 2100 nonexistent voice i've dated before it's a project using machine learning in runway that trend data from okcupid which i found the stairs that has like 60 thousand dating profiles uh it's just online and i trained them so it's all artificial uh fake dating profile that i put into like this tinder clone that i made uh once the swap person is matched you can find a dating story between me and this nonexistent human being and this dating story is using contextfree grammar uh to write the story always end it with with we never met again so we want to talk about how the data privacy really is out there and also oh i feel like i heard some alcohol but yeah i hear the echo too i think it must be somebody who's nearby who's not doesn't have headphones but anyways uh we want to talk about like data privacy and how you treat your data on dating profiles uh more seriously and also just it's a fun project to just work on to like get all this like weird bizarre it's like somehow even feels like cursed because like you know all the data that you watch right now are like very weird but then they're actually from the real data like got trained out of it so it's very cursed it's very uh entertaining in a way that i like to to read it and to to find all the stories between me and there's a hundred boys that i've dated so just just so everyone's clear who's looking at this right what we're seeing right now on screen that you're sharing yes is a picture of some a person with a name alonso at age 27 and then a description written below can you tell me where you're headed on the road do you have any life goals or dreams that could be started in any format can you go through each one of these like where did the photo come from where did the name come from how did you pick the age and how did you get text okay okay so i'm gonna go scroll a little bit the profile picture is actually from scale down two and also there's like a ff hq data set so like you just mentioned learning to train the photo and they generated like like a nonsense a human that actually looks like real enough uh we pull it actually from the side the code not just a human uh because the easier they're using the same model to train it and it's easier to pull data from them every time you refresh the page you'll generate the new data and the names who are like getting it from the social security administration just find like common voice name and dating bio is trained from the okcupid profiles and we pick so if you have you state um if you have you say okay cuba you'll probably know there are like multiple questions out there and we picked the first question which is a dating bio and trade the dating bio which is can you tell me where you had it on the road and also what is this weapon so we match but what happened after we bought prepared food at zarbar 10 minutes into the date he said your kind of guy wants to marry but i want to have fun with pretty ones first we never talk again so what he said here is also trained from okcupid uh it's trained from fun fact and also what you're looking for and we put that into the context programmer and then we generate it with the end of we never talked again so and then you click and you can swipe as many as you want uh this one said if you lose 10 pounds you'll be a 10. very bizarre but this actually got trade from the real data but yeah this is our our project that is a fun entertaining to work on but also it's fun to rate it and it's very interesting to think about how data got used uh online and on dating profile because the data privacy yeah fantastic yeah play with this project play with like is this um is this i'm currently online at the url can people go try it out yeah exactly uh go click that billboard thing uh in front of you well i'm just gonna oh so over here yeah yes there's a billboard thing here and then you click this billboard and then there will be a website okay learn more about the project yeah so hopefully this is going to keep not kick me out of yorub and go into a new tablet see what happens oh i see and i actually see the project website i will check this out so i just wanted to say like one of the things that i love about this project many things but is it's really a great example of how when you're using you know techniques for machine learning or uh generative algorithms to create what is this entire like fictional story basically but there's so many elements of that story and you've used a different technique and a different data set for each element and it's um uh i i i love to hear about the process of why you chose different ones and what data set and i know how hard you all worked on sort of developing this project um so great job um wonderful to see thank you okay so everybody i'm in just so you know i'm in your blit3 if you're watching this live i'm putting the url up the screen your blitz3.itp.io you can go um there yourself and then you can also find the url if i click on here and click on project website um there we go now i found and i found alonso uh right here that we saw so i could see i can see the actual project wonderful great job yeah thank you okay i'm going to wander around to figure out i'm going to check my list as to where i'm go my uh team my team of producers is telling me to go next see you all everybody i'm wandering over here here we go all right uh so that was awesome uh i'm looking at the chat now just for a second they are hiding in the corner i don't know what that means sean um all right so let's see ready to go is position eight where am i i'm in three is there any other three listed here ready to go position eight c so let's try going to your blit eight this is my really highly sophisticated technique where i change the number in the address bar and i hit yes i want the full experience i want the full experience uh yeah use my microphone but please could you could you please use my virtual camera i worked so hard on this i worked so hard on my virtual camera it's not showing up it shows up here it shows up here enter can i press my happy sound i see people oh i see people i hear people yes uh i'm going to position 8c let's see uh oh i see a blank screen in 8c this is not a good sign but we're going to head over there oh i'm like i've never been so hunched over in my life while live streaming i'm just like here we go this project is the chocolate factory oh my connection failed now why do i get that message and then oh i've lost control i'm spiraling out of control i crashed oh my god where am i going stop no come back go back oh my god europe has gone out of control oh my god where how help i'm gonna hit refresh refresh refresh here we go and look they're all the people there's i think there's a there's a very small group of people it's like my entourage that's like falling around so i feel like there's a whole bunch of people at hc right now come to your blit 11 says yonatan okay okay i i will go to your blit 11 but first i must go to hc okay yonatan says come to your little eleven i by the way if you're saying in the chat come to a your blit i'm coming to that your blit uh chocolate factory i will have to come back to uh we're going to your blit 11 and duh i have a lot more sound effects i'm just using this one i think maybe i need to read some more random hours up up up i want the full experience so i need to know where in your blit 11 to go i mean i'll go anywhere uh all i see is your blitz 11 okay moving around is there a tour guide here by the way i believe the ushers in yorba are called ushers or is it ushers are you shells i don't know um okay i'll look for a project that seems on um here's something hello um i'm supposed i'm good i'm supposed to have a big sign on me that says i'm live streaming but it's not working so i'm telling you that i'm livestreaming this is that so if you if you want to send me away i will go away if you don't is is this your project here yes oh wonderful um would you mind telling uh the viewers of the coding trade a little bit about yourself in this project yeah sure so so briefly we created of your gallery oh and so i'm sorry to interrupt you i have a bad habit of doing this this is a collaboration between the two of you yeah can you can you tell uh can you tell us your names and any other collaborators oh okay so you're team leo and my name is kevin and my name is hanzo so uh yeah we we made a building leo which is a social vr platform like a vr gallery so um we both have designers background and i thought we thought 2d a flat 2d screens in real world has a limitation of digesting future of computational crap so we use vr technology and game engines to create a environment where artists can express the future of expression i would say so we created a whole clear gallery environment with six different rooms with six different themes so um idea is coming from collecting our secure moment and memory so we recreated this uh designs and like from our memory with the light insulation and sound experience and spatial environment so also multiplayer can play in the same venue together as well oops fantastic um is this i you know i obviously in the context here we're just seeing this sort of documentation is there a url is this a thing that people can try um right now if you click this signboard here there is a website and i also unloaded applications so if you guys have oculus quest you guys can try uh this whole experience with octopus quest wonderful thank you so much for sharing thank you all does anybody know what station yonatan is at nobody knows okay we're gonna find jonathan maybe 11c meditative experiences oh yeah can you see me yeah i can can you hear me yeah i'm teaching it can you kiss me now yeah we're good it's our it's how you're lit we're up up beep beep beep that's me censoring out the language see this is the problem i want to be live streaming sign all right is this uh oh this is where i just was okay i don't know where yonitan is i don't know where yonitan is and i've i've ceased be able to navigate i can't turn to the right anymore what is going on ah here we go let's try going this way we're gonna return to the lobby ready everybody we're returning to the lobby 11h okay i see it in the chat 11 e a b c d e f e f wait g yes g h there we go okay i'm coming over to 11 h hello 11 h space mapper car uh yonatan are you there i don't hear you hey welcome oh i do hear you okay wonderful um thank you for thank you for uh sending bringing me here f wait g yes g oh wait there we go somebody's got my stream open it's 30 seconds in the past the audio is coming out let's see okay i think we're back i think we're good so i'm wandering around asking people to just introduce themselves and tell us a little bit about your project so take it away cool uh so here's my project uh it is let me get my camera little little remote control car wow yeah um so basically what this thing has is it's got if you can see right here this is an infrared distance sensor and probably me what you can do is you can take uh any kind of object uh like a box here and what you've got is um you can drive it forward and what it will do is it will graph out the side of the box just like that and then what you can do is you can click on hold on i'm sorry to interrupt you i'm going to go wander over to the screen share because i think i'll be i'll have a better view there sure okay i could still hear you i think you can see on the stage the graph and everything awesome right behind you okay i'm good yeah let me let me uh demonstrate again um so i've got the car and you've got any kind of object right here and uh using arrow keys you can drive the car forward and as it passes the box you can see that it graphs the side of it and then what you can do is you can click at the start and the end and it will tell you the length with semi accuracy 17.8 centimeters and i've got a ruler and this box is uh 18 and a half so it's almost perfectly accurate still needs a little bit of calibration wow fantastic and i can see here this looks like this is a p5.js sketch is that right yeah absolutely oh i think i missed the last thing you said yeah it is a p5 sketch amazing and had you used and this is is this a is this a project you did for the physical computing course yeah physical computing and uh computational media ah so you did it crossbars um and so and so you're using the p5 serial library to communicate between the car and p5 itself fantastic yeah exactly i love the way you're presenting this like it's such a challenge to present these kind of projects in this context yeah it works so yeah i had to uh yeah i had to get the camera feed to be part of the uh of the sketch in order to make this whole thing happen yeah yeah wonderful and had you ever um you know i know obviously you were familiar with itp before you came had you ever worked with p5 before this semester or was it your first time no no uh p5 no programming no nothing i used to be a musician actually yeah amazing did you work on any like music related projects this semester or do you think that's something you'll can like think about my uh my past uh physical computing program was a little guitar um using stretch sensors and p5 to kind of make little notes i wasn't a guitarist but yeah guitar seems like the most uh yeah appropriate choice yeah i for me teaching programming i i find so many students have music backgrounds are interested in music and sound and that's definitely one of my sort of missing pieces of my knowledge base and i always feel a little bit lost um and always excited to see what students are doing with computation and music so great job thank you so much for sharing this thank you thank you so much thanks for bringing your entourage here of course and so people can find out more first of all you can come here right everybody watching and come to your blit 11 station 11 h and you can also see here um you can click on the sign post which says space mapper car and if i click here on the project website we'll see probably some documentation oh look at this we've got like a circuit diagram and all sorts of other information about how this was made fantastic wonderful okay off we go uh to where will where will we'll be led we don't no i just like awkwardly slide away that's how i do it bye thank you so much uh all right i could return to the lobby coming over here to the middle i'm gonna look at my uh oh the weather band is ready to go and that is a zoom project i believe i think so let's go to uh the weather band project how do i find that i'm gonna leave yorb for a second i need a break i'm out of here oh my god that's very stressful this is very complicated i also need to eventually move on with my evening the point of me doing this as fun as this is and hopefully you're you're enjoying this or finding projects and people are telling me to come to 3a was that my goal here was is not really to visit all the projects myself but to show people how to navigate the itp show itima show and encourage you all the viewers to go yourself and i can bring back my urls here your.itp.io or itp.nyu.edu so we're going to go to the weather map let's search for weather band introduction oh wait whether journals no that's a different project weather band close and this is a zoom room okay everybody this is very exciting we're about to go into zoom let's see what happens oh i should have made my name i should rename myself to live broadcast but whatever i think it might say codingtrain my name so hopefully that will help people know that what they're about what they're getting themselves into before i enter now i actually don't know if the zoom audio is going to make it through to um to the actual youtube stream itself okay let's put on some waiting music here while i check loopback zoom and audio source it is if i turn it on oh i'm connecting okay naturally come to that i probably will not have anything to do with my thesis but i did take um sound studio with luke this past semester um and if i'm if i'm lucky i can get to apply some of that to what we're doing next semester yeah awesome hello coding train hello so this is my like warning sign to tell people that this is a live broadcast as i enter these semi public spaces so people can quickly leave or turn their camera off or something i haven't figured out how to do this effectively but i thought this is better than nothing i really you know anyway so but i'm sorry to interrupt in the middle but i've got a small group of people watching who i would sure would love to hear about the itp weather band project name do you want to say so we are we are my tv weather band and we make music with data collected from the diy weather station do you have anything to add like name yeah so this year we are focusing on building the system um behind the weather ban like the database and the server and also we have some new instrument coming as well so yeah let's watch the video together here's what you want to share i cannot share okay i have a better internet here yeah itp weather band is an experimental band creating music with weather data collected from a diy weather station and we have been working together for the past year to build a networked weather station system and create experimental instruments that turn the environmental data into music and visuals this is the weather station installed like love by animals then this is a circuit that is boosting the data onto the web so here is our system diagram so what are we doing is the weather station is getting the winter data and we are using i don't know mkrt intend to getting the data and then um through the wifi we posted the data to our database on the daily ocean server and after we having the data in the database people can get the data using a http request our client can be p5 client arduino client or website or any client that can do http requests and here is our api so as for our database which is set up with microsoft we have um our old documentation and database here and our the point is that we started as a performance band and we did a few performances but now uh we are developing the performance and also uh we are trying to grow as an open source project that like people in the anywhere in the world can set up their diy weather station um and then also and contributing to our day on weather data network and also we have some p5 and arduino examples that people can just use to get our weather data um that's posted like every one minute like a lot of um data like wind and rain um and illuminance and uv and everything to combine into their creative projects and just to show some of the projects like using the data um this by skylar and um ichan at new new school they're collaborating on this website that is uh veteran website but is a very nice graphical sculpture that is reacting to the weather data in real time and also we had this performance last time music performance and network music festival and we are all in different locations like a people who are different locations using the weather like different weather data from the same period of time it's the first day of the summer and these are all the instruments made on that music developed by the band members so may 6th cloudy and we have some new instruments that we are meeting like dp like every two weeks um to continue this project and then these are from um new members which are first years this is one of these by sihen and this one is by cu the visual instrument using the illuminance data for this um light sculpture yay thank you um that was fantastic you know i've heard so much about this project and i've seen bits and pieces but it was really nice to finally be able to sort of like settle in and get a full sort of like survey and presentation uh i'll tell you i have actually like a sort of vested interest in the project i know you sent an email about this and i hadn't gotten a chance to reply yet but a huge challenge for me in teaching is to find sort of stable and easily accessible free uh data sources for people to begin with like just to learn the low json function for example in p5 and actually i have several people who watch the coding train know that i have like a whole series about working with weather data and in the video i make a joke like by the time you watch it this api probably won't be available anymore and or like you'll have to pay for it and that's actually the case i was using dark sky which then um i believe apple bought them and shut them down or whatever you can't use it so like so anyway i think it's really exciting to see like these kinds of like open source style um initiatives the to that not only like teach people that are opportunities we're able to learn about working with data but you know you've got this whole like hardware system that you've built to like make the api itself so it's really thrilling and i wonder you know what and just the way you're showing like all these different projects that came out of it so i hope that this can grow and that people can make their own weather stations they're going to be a lot of them and it's super exciting so thank you for doing this work i i definitely think i need to like add to my list make a basic like here's a p5 example that gets the weather you know from this api so remind me about that maybe maybe in january um with xer calm down i can like take a minute to to make a video about that be great yeah we really yeah i think that would be super exciting and then we will um yeah make sure the weather station is working hard [Laughter] and then we don't plan to install in multiple occasions the name is thinking over in thailand then like in china and maybe i can ensure in korea so right is there is there just one right now or yeah so one thing you might consider actually by the way also is and maybe this isn't relevant maybe i is like creating a sort of like sample also api that's not real data but like allow people to sort of like test the idea out of like getting multiple sources so i haven't thought this through and here i am just like live talking off the top of my head live streaming here but that could be something to think about also if there are sort of things that you're thinking about scaling and features you're thinking about offering you know you can sort of test those out and have people use them um without the hardware in place um and that also like if it ever goes down then there's still like you know a backup feed that works even if it's historical data i think there's interesting possibilities there yeah yeah we do have historical data but that's a great idea of the example api yeah yeah we are here we are yeah we are like still developing different features so thanks so much for the suggestion yeah mostly i'm just really stuck on this thing where it's like no matter what i use like it's not there a year later or it's changed because i'm often relying on these sort of commercial services that you know change very rapidly so anyway uh thank you so much for sharing this project i hope people watching um can we're joining the itp weather band i see we have a viewer who says i live in thailand that's super exciting um i'm i'm going to wrap up soon so i'm going to wander off and try to catch one or two more projects but anybody wants to see come and visit your zoom room they can do that by going to the show website which i have in the video's description searching for itp weather band and then join live okay so maybe hopefully after i leave some people will come and ask you some more questions thank you okay bye everybody okay that was so successful it like worked and there was a presentation and you could see it i got to turn my camera off for a minute and i could just take a i could like meditate and i was reading my random number book actually i was quite glued to their presentation it's a very exciting project and it's just like uh i'm just so surprised so not really surprised because i see the creativity from students at itp and ima and people from all over the world all the time but it's amazing to see how just this one little piece of data can launch so many different kinds of threads and ideas for projects that riff off of that data all right where do i go next it's getting close to 9 pm my children need to be put to bed actually they kind of go to sleep on their own they're a little bit older now but i should say good night to them i would really like to encourage people to go visit the show lil z crazy g is asking what is itp so i did talk about this briefly at the beginning of the stream you know if you go to the show website you can read a little bit more about the different programs but itp is a graduate program located in brooklyn new york where i teach and many other people teach and many people are students and many people work there so many wonderful people um and you can visit the virtual floor which is like a 3d model of the actual space and wander around at yorb so um uh crabby is possibly a bit late but crabby i am so glad that you are here it is always wonderful to see your green name crabby second account someday you will grace us with the presence of your first account i know it will happen someday but we'll we'll take your second account right now all right i'm i'm going to head over to your blit 12 your blit12 let's go to just the main yorb and wander over to your blit12 okay i really really wish that my live streaming sign would show up but i don't think it's going to so we're going to go this way oh there's a help desk hey it's the help desk okay i'm gonna move on i don't like wandering around here people don't know that i'm like live streaming them your blitz eight your blit9 okay you're a blip where am i going and then you're okay here we go you're blit 12. here we go i'm gonna fall okay click enter okay here we go whoa oh sorry for landing here we are your blitz 12 going to 12 b uh b is an easy one for me to find because it is the letter after the letter a in the alphabet and i do know that much without having to sing the song but it is nice to sing the song uh oh 12 b hmm i don't see anything going on here 12b where did you go in my secret message system which tells me which projects are ready for me it says ready to go i need also to like cross them off once i've already been there i uh we'll wait for a minute while i look around to see what where else i might go um um four f doesn't say ready to go oh wait a second ate pandy i think i know this project oh yes we're gonna go see if we can visit handy uh your blit8 so we'll come back please hold everybody wait anybody here sound drop wait 12c is active hello um i'm supposed to have a big sign that says i'm live broadcasting so that i don't surprise people so you could run away if you want or tell me to run away and i will gladly do so but if you will accept me here i would love to stay and hear about your project if this is your project okay you're kind of like a celebrity here yes thank you very much that's why that is the most absurd thing i've ever heard but i will take it okay okay so so tell me tell us your name um and about the project that you're presenting here okay for the other people as well i'm charlie i'm the first year student in itp and this is my um my first year project it's called wait it's not actually playing sorry um it's called a scene so basically it's an interactive interaction and also animation and coding p5 sketch it's a combination of all these forms um so um it's basically the idea of like seeking for a weakness of my life of my uh moments of up ups and downs so somebody who can be my supporter so i choose to be uh in the um so basically it's like three different forms just just a very quick uh walk through so first you're gonna see this little um uh just let me know if you can see it or you can hear my sound um i can definitely see it and i hear your voice but i don't think i hear that great great sound from the sketch yeah excellent so first we're going to see this p5 sketch so basically um it's it's actually have the monologue playing as a background sound oh now i hear it yeah you can hear uh let me know if you think it's true uhoh now i don't hear or see anything what happened do people hear me jump if you hear me oh okay people are jumping i don't hear anybody did we lose um our project creator oh no now i can hear you oh yeah sorry so i shouldn't play the sound because every time i played sound my voices got cut off ah got it anyway yeah there's a sketch just like uh you is this just like um how to say like a narrative this stages first you're gonna like um basically just um when you uh the the mouse access is worth controlling this whole schedule here so when you just um move the mouse from the uh left to right it will lead you to the next stage and at this stage you're going to like collecting this like little eyes when you hit the 20 you can see it moves moves you to the next stage and you're going to see this little animation as a video embedded in the sketch and you're gonna listen to monologue and the sound and just gonna be you know just like a quick like what no just move the mouse from the left to right you're gonna move to the next stage so there's gonna be four stages i i if i remember correctly it can be four stages you can be you know just oh i think we may have lost audio again oh no i hear the audio from the video from the sound from the screen how about now can you hear no now i can hear you again yes okay did you visualize where where where did you lies um it's hard to say okay there was a there was a giant eye with like heart emojis in it that was the last thing that i saw oh yeah this one so basically just like a presentation of the all the videos in the p5 sketch um you just like move the little mousex things and just walk through the whole sketch and that's it and for the next one uh it's in unity um it's like uh it's not it's not vr because i didn't make this one for the vr setting what is it um sorry i just i just hear dance like the voice take it back yeah i think what happens i think is that people have the live stream open on their computer and then it's they don't have headphones it like comes out through their speakers into the mic and then ends up in your but trust me if you're finding it hard to figure out what's going on with hearing my own voices also but this is really beautiful work i love i mean first of all i always love seeing um such you know sort of creative new uh visual ideas that get programmed in a p5 sketch you know i always think well what is else is there but the sort of like shapes and things you can do but i'm always just every year surprised by sort of new um new designs and visual ideas i also just like that how you have all these different um it really feels like to me like there's a i'd love to like experience it myself but there's like a story you're telling and there's different aspects of the story but there's this one sort of a visual this icon really the eye that kind of is the through line that sort of connects everything and that i think that works super well yeah thank you first for the coding part you just mentioned thank you for the coding change that's where i picked up all the things that i learned wonderful um is the sketch online somewhere like if i go maybe to the sign will there be a url okay i think we might have lost uh okay scene and if i go here project website um i could see it here oh wonderful okay oh look at this amazing amazing look at all these beautiful oh and we see the sketches here this one with the eye made out of emojis is really amazing so now i'm talking to myself here am i still in europe i'm also still in europe all right wonderful uh thank you so much for sharing this project um and i look forward to checking out and learning more about it ah you're back i was just clicking over to your website and looking at the project more thank you so much yeah thank you for coming have a great evening i hope people should come to your blit12 yourblit12.itp.io come and check out scene as well as other projects that are here in your blit12 i'm going to wander over to the middle um and figure out where i'm going next okay bye everybody thank you bye all right i'm gonna just this is here we go i'm just head on over here to return to lobby i'm going to take a look uh and taylor i think i'm going to try maybe one more project i'm looking at the chat i'm looking at my direct messages um let's see if we can try one more project oh handy is where i wanted to go where was that uh your blit8 all right i'm heading over to your blitz eight this is my last stop um and then i'm going to say good night don't worry there's more coming in quoting trade coming in 2020 and then a lot of coding train coming in 2021 but um here we go we're going over your blit8 everybody this is the theme song for your blitz 8. come on you're blind you can do it just want everyone to know that i worked really hard on this sign this sign that would show that i'm live streaming all right your blit8 here we are um eight b eight b i like going to b b is fun uh a b oh no project so sad this is a project i know well because a version of it was made in a machine learning class i taught a year ago and so i definitely would encourage you to check it out handy is a wearable interface interpreting tangible interaction to intentional experiences using emg signal and machine learning so it's not here right now but you can obviously come and click on the the sign here and check out the website all right we're gonna try to find one more project one more project tonight people all right we're gonna travel back in time to yours and find ourselves a project to take us out tonight on the coding train i mean i'm gonna stop i'm gonna still be here in europe in the show i just gotta stop live streaming at some point uh all right let's see i'm looking at my 3b did i go there already i don't know what project that is that's the problem so i can't remember if i went there it's my project actually 3b i'm right here oh should we go over oh amazing see the problem is my stage broke so the link isn't working i appear to be having very unique technical difficulties i can share my screen and if you want to go back there i can share my screen yeah let's do it h now because 3b is broken three so i should head to yorb33h that's where we're going to ph this is like this is like in olden times where we had to plan where we would go and give each other congratulations and then there was no way to communicate unless we just happened to be there yeah i don't know if anybody ever lived through the time where i would actually give my friend a pay phone number and make sure they had quarters this is the thing we used to do in new york city okay yes everybody i am old okay we're going to now i already forgot where i'm going 3h right 3h 3h okay here i go see you there all right here we go oh come on enter boom ah that was quite quite a rough landing there um i think this is working okay three e a b c d e f g h i like to say h ash okay anyway here we go i uh here we go ah here i am um okay i'm here to involve technology in our society and our daytoday lives hi everyone there's somebody standing on top of you so i sort of see you only partially i think oh no my connection failed well let's see if i can get back all right am i here does anyone hear me jump if you can hear me the only way to signal people in your is with the body language of jumping all right i seem to have you know what would be a nice feature is to be able to type a little message to like pop up on the top of my head um i seem to have lost my connection i'm going to refresh and come back i don't know if anyone can hear me other than those of you who are watching i'm gonna hit refresh in the browser and i'll be right back just make sure i have sound i do all right here we go refresh i want the full experience okay okay that's like my favorite thing in yorb right now it's like flying in okay okay i'm coming back so the audio should be sharing as well i'm back sorry i lost my connection but i'm back now oh okay okay hey hey okay so um basically my project i'm looking to liminal spaces which is this idea of like transitional spaces whether in a medical or medical physical sense um and it's also kind of this internet trend like i was looking at pictures on reddit where people post these pictures of spaces with no context no people and so basically i did like an ai interpretation of that um so basically this is a web vr project uh let me know if you can see it cause i've been having some difficulty so i can't actually unfortunately wait you can't see it i see you and i hear you but i just see a black screen oh no oh no i really don't know what's happening do you see it yeah i see it do other do other people see it do other people say that no we can't see anything on the screen okay wait let me try something else um okay i can let me see if this works can you see something now no no oh my god this is so sad okay well um i don't know you know how to give my link uh this is very sad thank you for coming no i i so i think we could we can make something of this we can figure this out in a way that gives us like a moment of of of uh like a triumph so i i think if we can't see it that's maybe you could you could you i was enjoying listening to your description of the project so i'd love to hear sort of the end of that and then i can pretty easily even if you just speak it out loud kind of like put a url up on screen so i could say oh yeah let me just check it or i can actually just even i can open it up myself i'm getting the link now sorry okay okay okay i'm putting the link in the youtube oh people are oh that's not going to happen oh craig's here oh my god okay oh are you an ima lowres student yes i am oh oh this is like the most exciting thing ever to happen i didn't even realize that okay now i have so many questions yeah but i but you know maybe i won't ask you to answer all of them right now while live broadcasting but i'm just the ima lores is totally new and so it feels i kind of remember this when i would be like an ima student the undergrad program when that was new or just like blow my mind so i want to hear i'm a undergrad and i'm i'm a uh low res so yeah i got really into ima i don't know can't let it go but you so you graduated from ima undergrad yes i went to nyu shanghai and i said nyu because i was going to say we haven't had four years of the program in new york although there have been some transfer students who are yeah maybe graduated but yeah yeah okay was incredible i highly their program there is like so good and where and are your are um i'm only like now i'm like i got to stop asking people to reveal personal information while i'm live streaming but anyway just give me your tell me the url so i can uh pull it up on on screen people will actually see it or at least you're watching the youtube chat okay yeah under my name it's juju codes dot somehow like well that's weird i don't see it i'm like losing i see craig says low res right above craig julia ann myers my full name wait this is so weird i don't see it i saw your name earlier okay let me that's so strange because the the chat and this is live i think oh you mean it could be like from way before uh um i don't know i this is live though so i put it in the chat live the latest mess this is crazy this we got to figure this out the latest message i see is from presto that says why i love that do you not see the message right above that it says i need friends on here do you all want to be friends wait what my messages aren't showing up okay it's juju codes did somebody who's a moderator by accident uh okay juju codes dot github dot github dot io dot io slash liminal mind slash uh oh i'm am i going to spell this right liminal mind slash yes i think i spelled it right that's so lucky okay so i'm here it says enter my liminal mind headphones recommended click on center text to advance please do so i'm going to go forward so i'm going to narrate this and then you can sort of explain what's happening that no one can see you right now but they can hear you still yeah i'm just waiting for the stream to catch up so i can see oh yeah it's way it's way in the past uh click on center text to advance oh no yeah let me know if you hear anything there's supposed to be like a like yeah a monologue and soundscape so the monologue and soundscape are also ai generated so basically i like really gone to this idea of liminal spaces like researching like jg ballard and like the situationists and all that and so um basically i want to explore this and how ai kind of like reacts to our conversations and images of liminal spaces um so basically i trained ai on like my notes about little spaces and used an ai voice to do the voice over and then i create these images these are gann images that i bred from uh liminal space images i collected from reddit and other parts of the internet and so and then i stitched them together in photoshop to create accurate rectangular photos to create this web vr um so i learned a lot i use aframe and i wish you had a video on that i hope that's coming you know well i'd have to learn it first maybe you can uh help me figure out how to use it um yeah so i'm in there and i'm seeing this room and i see the text that says look around you and i can look around one thing i'm curious you know i have a lot of people who are watching or from all over the world are not necessarily native english speak speakers and i'm wondering if you could sort of define that might be helpful to hear in your own words like what what what you mean by liminal space like what how do you define that in terms of this product in the context of this project maybe you can't hear me i do hear the monologue do people hear the monologue very quietly well i'm going to go back into europe to see what's going on can you hear me still i can hear you now sorry oh i know oh i've been talking and talking but it must be that the uh my mic gets muted if i go to a different tab so i was curious one thing i was curious if you could just you know for viewers who might not be sort of familiar with the term or maybe you have a particular point of view of the project can you give us a definition of liminal space and how um how do you think of that for this project yeah sure so little space just basically means trans transitional transitional transitional space so basically it's a space like maybe in between uses so i feel like capitalism produces a lot of these spaces that are like for example empty malls empty parking lots like these kind of empty spaces that are in between um particular uses but also it's kind of been an internet trend in recent years you go to the subreddit liminal space a lot of people kind of post these photos and they like evoke nostalgic feelings also like people are creeped out by them i think it's like the lack of context combined with unidentifiable elements like visual indeterminacy so that was actually my link because like i realized visual indeterminacy is the quality of luminal face photos as well as gan photos i'm like really into like an art breeder and all that and so that's what kind of like the connections like i want to like create my own little space photos um kind of trained off of these ones i was collecting so the combination of like an interesting internet movement as well as like yeah liminal is like a very you know over all encompassing term but yeah wonderful that's super helpful to hear and i i i um i think you've really you know you've you've you've found something here about this sort of connection with this concept and idea and the kind of strange and you know images that are produced now by your synthetic uh images that can be produced by the different ai models um and by the way i think we discovered the mystery of the missing message uh this is this came from arnov who is a dedicated coding trained viewer i'm going to put his message up on the screen for people who are watching he says maybe the message got filtered out by youtube as it contained a link so it is true that unless you're um um yeah so the messages that don't so i suspect if you type a hello message into the chat we would see it but messages are being blocked and filtered and i actually don't i'm looking at the chat in a different place where i wouldn't actually even see the moderation panel so anyway mystery solved i know now you can now everybody can sleep sleep tonight knowing that you are you're not mysteriously blocked from the coding train yeah wonderful thank you so much for sharing that project so again just to tell anybody who's sort of tuning in here um go to uh well i'm on juju codes.github.io slash liminal spelled liminal i've got that up on the screen and then you can also visit um here some very loud banging by the way going on who that is uh yorb station 3h if you want to come and ask more questions about the project thank you so much yeah thank you and it's also on like the whole database too oh wonderful yeah awesome thank you thank you for trying i'm so glad that we found an ima uh i'm a lowres student to represent um in this like really small selection of the show so um yeah another 3b 3b okay i was gonna wrap up and leave but you you you had me at three you had me at gorblet three i could just it's so close i got no excuse i could just wander over all right i'm gonna i'm gonna give it a try okay all right awesome thank you for the recommendation i'm gonna head over there now yeah thank you bye okay we're gonna wander over everybody to 3b we'll play a little wandering over walking music here it comes hey we're wandering around ah over here to 3v but uh i i have a couple friends that have beautiful projects in in the your blood nine that are sound related i think you would enjoy okay um i'm sorry to interrupt but i wanted to let people know in this area that i am currently doing a live broadcast of the show uh visiting projects so if you want to send me away i will leave but if you would like me to stay i would love to hear about this project called cyborgian rock all right i'm going to read to you um this description of cyborgian rock a fictional entity experienced via a chatbot stimulates animistic imagination in the user explores untapped potentialities of social presence theory and technology fascinating yeah so maybe my warning was actually like i'm supposed to have a big sign oh i hear my voice again being fed back to me okay well i want to encourage everybody to come and visit the cyborgian rock um i'm actually going to click over on the website maybe i can find out some more information so like to feature this project somebody has the live stream going on on their computer and it's like coming through in your mind i'm sorry that's me okay okay uh maria's frozen for me i think oh shoot she did she just froze oh okay she hopefully she refreshes okay so we can confirm she's not running away because she's not okay because you know i don't want to i don't want anyone to feel uh that i'm invading their space [Laughter] all right we're gonna we're gonna hang out here for a few minutes um i will while we're waiting to see if maria returns i am going to head on over again to the itp show website because i am going to be leaving soon but the show will go on the show must go on and you can experience it yourself you don't need me you'll have a much better time being there on your own visiting the show so you can um if you go to the website which is uh in the video's description and up here on the screen um you can click right here to enter into your which is this 3d world that you know i'm winding around have a little uh be flexible have a little patience it's a new uh very experimental project that a ton of people are have worked incredibly hard on um and you can see the fruits of their labor here okay wait uh maria might be back no no no no craig um by the way craig who is uh uh somehow a moderator i don't know he's a little bit suspicious i actually i think i remember giving craig moderator privileges it's time to head to 9f um so um oh and sarah sarah gives her endorsement of the cyborgian rock quote let me quote i am a huge fan of the cyborgian rock that's actually there should be a big poster you know one of these like posters that has like quotes from your views from sarah i am a huge fan of the cyborgian rock this is me by the way just kind of vamping here to see maria comes back she keeps getting kicked out unfortunately okay so here's what i'm gonna do i i can't stop as much as i say i'm gonna stop i just can't i'm gonna head over to um 9f secret forest is to try to get one more project in all right now i'm getting so many recommendations i can't do it all people there's you got to go around yourself in the show i can't do it all just i'm just one person sitting in an attic in brooklyn with a lot of computer equipment and apparently a very robust internet connection the fact that all i'm live streaming all this stuff all right so we're gonna head over to nine f if um um ellen if um if um if maria comes back you can send me a discord message i i do have that up um so i will see it oh i see her okay oh you're here oh oh my goodness wait i have to play a very exciting sound effect for you okay you can't hear it but a big giant round of applause yay it's just gone off um so uh maria please tell us about the cyborgian rock all right so the cyborgian rock is a chat box actually um i build it after watching uh a couple of the videos that you made to them um about rescript oh rhyme script yes oh that's so exciting to hear amazing ah i i didn't know i it's as if i planned it this way that's so exciting to hear cool so yes and um and i was exploring this this concept of social presence the the idea that um even dots in a chat message produce a feeling of of another person or some being there and i was also very interested in animism so um the rock is is not a consumerist type of a product it is encouraging you to think um about nature to observe it stimulates uh optimistic imagination um i think um the as people interact with it i'm able to improve it and work with the uh dialogue to make it better um amazing so wait um can i can oops oh i pressed the wrong button ah here i am i'm back um can i or not me but can is it i what i'm seeing right now is this sort of like a live interaction with it um yes that's uh this is me interacting so i'm gonna go up closer can you type a message to it absolutely okay tell me what to type then um all right i'm gonna uh the chat is way behind but if anybody has a question wants to suggest a question from the uh to ask of the cyborgian rock we have a unique opportunity here this is a you know once in a lifetime opportunity to speak directly to a rock so far nobody has come up with a suggestion all right i will uh come up um let's see maybe something train themed um um can i ask the rock if um if it uh i'm really like expecting somebody like something profound to suddenly just appear into the chat but it doesn't seem to be happening i'm gonna have to come up with it myself okay um um how um how is how is the weather the weather where you are that's my like super creative question the being of hills and wind carry me across oh the beings of hillson went carried me across that is very profound what um are is the sound effects that i'm hearing part of the experience i'm hearing crickets yes these are the sounds around the rock so when i begin to type their assignments and we are not hearing anything because we're in our own presence but as soon as i exit the input box but i think this this this deserves a followup uh comment yeah i'm i have so many questions about the hills where are these hills if the wind can carry the rock let me ask the rock um are you alive this this might need a drumroll would it matter to you oh oh oh it would matter to me the chat is suggesting i ask if uh lava is good or evil it's a lava groot or evil i'm seeing some messages from some folks telling me to check out the zoom rooms i have been to one zoom room uh for sure there are some amazing projects in those almost wonderful oh i do not harm or nor serve okay wow this is is this live online somewhere like can people chat with the rock themselves absolutely yes the project description has a link okay terrific all right i'm gonna i'm gonna wander over there and show it to people and if anybody wants to come and ask more questions so you can ask your questions to the cyborgian rock directly by going to the cyborgian rock website but if you feel so inclined and want to ask your questions to the creator of the cyborgian rock then um you can come right here thank you so much for sharing this project with us take care all right so here i am and i'm on the website now i'm gonna actually just close out of yorb real quick okay sometimes like whenever i close out of europe i just feel this like enormous sigh of like i find it very stressful to be in there live streaming and people don't know that i'm live streaming and what am i going to encounter like it's it's it's very stressful i just like this is what i'm much more used to i just have a website open i'm just here talking to you the viewer i've been doing this what now for two hours getting a bit exhausted i do like i really want to see all of the projects and i i'm sad it makes me i i often i just like it pains me to see people in the chat or like come check out this project check out this project is it's just not possible for me in this context of how i'm doing it to visit all the projects so i think that i need to kind of wrap up for a minute uh i could put this into intermission stage and come back in like five or ten minutes i gotta just check on some stuff that's going on here at home nine f9 f9 f9f wow i really got a message telling me to go to 9f all right we're going to have um just a brief five minute intermission and i will be back and i'm going to head to 9f so let me just uh send this message here hold on type something i'm gonna put on my intermission sign you can still hear me actually before i do that um let me come back here so what i would like for you to do um if you are watching right now is go to the itp show website go over to projects and browse through them and let me give you a tip uh if you see one of these say zoom room please visit it um i think that the zoom rooms are waiting for you to check out their projects don't be shy um go i would like to ask everybody watching this right now while i take a fiveminute break or else you can't see me anymore to visit one zoom room okay everybody let's do it together let's all of you go pick one zoom room to visit and then i'll wander into yorb and i'll be back to go to 9f in about five minutes so do so do do do do do okay here i am i have returned if anybody's still there here i am uh all right so um i see in the i'm going to 9 f but i do see in the chat here i i it's hard for me to not take a request i see a project called blur clock which is in zoom okay ah good aiden oh and i saw young min okay here we go we're going to blur clock uh oh you don't see it um but actually so i'll bring it in uh as soon as um as soon as i'm live in here okay oh oh people can hear me yes hello hold on let me bring in your screen into this row okay here we are um say something let me make sure the audio is going through how's it going ah it definitely is okay wonderful all right first of all so thank you for coming into the chat i'm so excited that we can make this happen by the way i'm like europe is so amazing but it's i find it to be very stressful and now being in a zoom room i'm like oh this is so familiar it's so relaxed i do have and i have my sign working because just in case i arrive somewhere people aren't aware they know that this is a live broadcast all right so um i'm checking i'm on the tail end here we've looked at many projects i'm super excited to be here and hear about the blur clock so tell um each of you if you could introduce yourself and and tell us a little bit about your project surely um so my name is aiden lincoln fowler and um i'm the second year at itp and my name is young min choi also second year at itp uh this is our project called blur clock um so we built a clock that uses machine learning to detect if you're looking at it and it only shows you the time if you are look if your eyes are open in front of it so we have a webcam um and when it sees your eyes it pushes an led screen that has a clock on it towards the front and it becomes legible um and when you close your eyes it retracts the screen back into the box and becomes blurry the whole thing is based on a book called the order of time by carlo revelli and it's basically about how time only exists from a human's blurred perspective of reality and we actually make time by measuring it um we also have a clock called sunclock um young you want to talk about that yes a sunclog is an abstract version of learnclock we built a server that asks um for sunrise and sunset time when you enter zip code and based on your location it will place the sun at where he's at and right now we're showing just the whole animation throughout the day but it'll actually move really really slowly um and i can show you a quick demo of how it looks like so is that the sorry is that the clock right behind you yes so so right now it's drawing the animation no but it looks like i'm seeing it kind of like a mirror but then i saw an animation going across it but i'm just seeing it's just that's an artifice of it being a screen that is it has a piece of dichroic film on it so it acts as a twoway mirror so it changes color and it's a gradient as you walk by it but when the lights behind it you can see through oh now and now i'm seeing this is like a uh um a recorded anim uh video of the claw of the song like wow no it's not a video it's running um like on a fast a fast pace but if we set up so that you just place the time the time it would move very slowly over the course of it yeah where it is at it'll move really slowly um and where is so i see that clock where is the um the other clock the one that looks free clocks yes i'm running a local server um and we i can turn on and off sun clock or the blur clocks oh it's the same physical device that you're able to oh okay wow you're picking that up like move it back and forth you can see the color change if you if you tilt it yeah there you go so hold on i i had you aiden large there for a second so let me get um young but great yeah okay oh amazing yeah so um i hope um i because of the letter i don't think it'll work um why but um we tested before it sort of works through zoom and we can i can pin someone's video and it reads the face um and uh it moves back and forth so interesting you know it's funny i was sort of when you were talking about it for a moment i was like thinking it through and i was imagining that it worked only when you're not looking at it right which is sort of interesting to think like uh you know can you like this idea that time isn't real you can't actually get there right like if you look away it sort of is there and you look back but anyway that's neither here nor there but it's interesting to sort of think about the sort of range of possibilities um have you um so young obviously it's like it's there physically with you have you been sort of like you know i don't know if this is the right term to apply but user testing it so to speak like do you have you do you sort of like live with the clock and interact with it or the sun version or the blur clock or is it mostly just kind of like it came together very recently so um i personally like to use uh blur clock is really um fun because it's it really has like a subtle and smooth way of interacting with the clock but when you turn the clock sun clock on throughout the day it's really nice to see like because it's it's all different throughout the seasons so for example winter we have shorts a certain amount of sunlight time so it's interesting to see um how much sunlight we have but yeah it's it's it's been really great to use our tests yeah i also really like the idea that if you know you have to give it your like focused attention you know where so like the clock isn't just going to display the information it needs you to like be sort of like present with it and so there's something kind of um touching about that or unique it gives it a sort of quality of character in a way um i'm just curious so is it all um just i'm curious about some of the technical information is it all selfcontained like is there a camera in the device it's not um and there what's and you mentioned it's using machine learning so there's some like pretrained model that you're running that's taking a look at the camera image and just doing face detection or eye detection or what's um can you tell us a bit about the logistics of that sure it's all embedded and the server is running on a local host when you um turn the clock on so you it could just work with the phone and it's using opencv um eye tracking so it it first finds your face then it finds your eyes and then it checks if your eyes are open or not so it's using three different models or kind of two models and did you do both these projects for the same class are they different classes or uh we built it for time class but i i combined it with uh understanding networks so that's where we built like the app controller amazing wonderful yeah i can see now i can see it blurred right now it's funny like i'm staring that's really quite uh beautiful wonderful amazing so thank you so much for sharing this project um so for people who want to learn more um they can go to the show website that's where i found i'm just gonna pull that i'm pulling that up right here um under projects under blur clock so first of all go here you can you could be in this zoom room with us right now i'm gonna jump out real fast so before everybody comes racing in here but you could come i'm just trying to you can come and ask your questions about uh the blur clock but also i'm assuming if i click on the name blur clock i also get to a page with a description and learn more some more documentation so definitely come check out this uh wonderful work thank you so much thank you for sharing this okay i'll see you all soon oh great okay byebye byebye sean i've got to go jump to the okay all right nine f i'm i was really about to be like i think i'm done now it's 9 45 this show only goes till 10. but you know there was another part of the day today where i thought maybe i'll do a little like advent of code challenge also but all right we're going to go to the your blit9 um we are going to go to your blit9 and try to get to 9f if anyone's in there you can let them know that i'm on the way um yorb 2020. we're going into yorb sorry your music this is my walking around your music your seven eight nine here we go europe nine everybody oh what perfect timing here we go going for a landing wow i really want to know why my sign doesn't show up okay nine f here we go heading over to nine f this is going to be my last stop the train has reached the fight's final destination and we're going to head over to 9f and see what we can find out this project and like have two people who trust each other two performers perform it rather than and see how people respond to that because that's i i'm supposed to have a big sign on me that says i'm streaming but you don't see it do you uh i don't see it but i heard you say that on the stream several times i'm aware you believe me i'm gonna show it once again this is what people are supposed to see they're supposed to see this and you can even see it here in the preview it makes me crazy okay i'm i'm talking way too loud and interrupting no no hello this is like the cool low res crew over here is this another ima low res project yeah amazing and are you the creator who is standing in front of me here yeah i'm enrique and also jiro which is at my left she's also creator of this message okay wait wait wait we found enrique and then say your name hero okay so i'm gonna um uh if you don't mind uh this is being this is a live broadcast right now and so if you want to opt out that was your chance i'll run away very quietly but if you would be so kind i would love to hear about this project and i think it works pretty well especially if we wander a little bit closer to the stage because then i can get a little bit closer for people to see with you also in the frame yeah sure so if you want to come like stand like off to the side there that's perfect where you are and hero if you want to come there too i've got now i've got a nice view of both of of just enrique okay yeah take it away okay so this is i am an amelo rest project for a class called connections lab and this is our secret forest that you and i created for you all so it is an interactive experience that we it's a collective interactive experience so maybe if you want daniel you can join us there if you go to the poster and at the bottom part there is a link that will take you to our secret forest when we can play together okay shall i head there now or is there anything else you want to tell us before i do maybe we can express it like first and then okay then i'll come back okay i'm gonna do that i'm heading to the poster well there's so many people here uh oh there's the poster here we go secret forest i'm clicking on the poster at no people on my way okay i got it and now i'm gonna go to project website i'm gonna open that a new tab so hopefully i'll still be here in yorb but um i'm heading over to that other tab allow move my nose into the hexagon okay ready to play oh i'm in the forest and my my sign is here whoa [Laughter] oh boy are people hearing this this is amazing i guess i should put my camera back on fly into the forest listen to the music okay this is amazing i think i'm gonna go back into europe now let me close this tab come back here okay i've come back hey yeah so that was our secret forest amazing you know it's interesting i couldn't i found myself just swaying and then i couldn't stop swaying you know just i settled into like a groove with it and then i almost wanted it it's very beautiful to look at but i also felt this moment that i just wanted to kind of close my eyes it's actually a really nice project for me to sort of like finish off my wandering through the show because it's uh it's very relaxing and soothing is that the sort of intention behind it to bring people together in a networked way but with a different feeling than we might have ordinarily and and i i don't mean to describe your project to you i'm giving you my sort of impression of it but i'd like to hear about some of the reasons why you made it and what you imagined the experience to be yeah uh maybe do you want to talk about that part yeah the project idea is actually uh starting from very simple idea how we can bring the music experience online and through our user test we we find overlapped two people together is the most people love experience so we go for this direction and and then we how to say develop our project and we want to focus that part how to build an intimate relationship when both of us uh remotely but we actually are in the same place to to to to build a deep connection with each other yeah maybe enrique can add more about that project yes ah this comes in many different ways like uh we wanted to do a musical instrument for the web but also like uh like very based on uh many collaborative projects like i don't know like even physical ones like react table and uh just like this sense of can like playing together and then that uh lead us to this intimate uh kind of setting when you overlap people and you can have like this shared space and i think that's like a part of the uh benefits of of doing this in web because you can connect people and to allow them to to play in this this kind of scenario wonderful is it um is it only a twoperson experience or is it as many people who join no i think for the prototype it's only allowed two maybe three or four because we want to develop this project in a long way so we also imagine how this project can be in the public space to to install some screen in the public space so people can interact with people how to say in the other place so so to build that physical space remote relationship but it's intimate connection yeah actually like like in the technical part you can yeah like many people can join but i think it's designed only for for two people and do you imagine that people would use it in the sort of way we did here where we sort of came together and said oh let's go there and try it or would it be something that you you know you end up in it with a random person that you don't know is that part of your thinking behind it in terms of how two people would find each other to experience it yeah that's a good question actually uh i think uh there's like we see two ways for this project like to evolve into maybe we can do both but uh like first one it's like a musical interactive experience uh that maybe can be on a public space or something like that and the other one it's a performance tool for actual institutions to create with people around the globe so it depends on which direction we want to take which um two other things that i just like to say that i really love about it one is i loved your use of hexagons like i'm so used to interacting with sort of gridbased pixelbased systems and something about the hexagonal pattern is just has a different quality to it that is um just gives it a unique feeling and it's very like sort of playful um uh abstract quality that's just like taking that makes it feel less like computery in a nice way but still very sort of geometric and understandable and then also i think you've found like it's always really tricky with these projects to strike the right balance between um my i want to be able to see what i'm doing and understand what i'm doing as but i don't really want to be fully there like i need it to be abs it makes me uncomfortable to be like sort of like looking in a mirror with my camera fully on display of course that's what we're all doing right now i do all the time but there's something nice i think you know i was able to really see myself see you and kind of move together but it was it was clear but it also had a kind of ghostlike abstract quality that i think worked really well so wonderful job really beautiful work thank you thank you okay um everybody should come and first of all so people can just go to the webs the website the same way i did right now yeah so people should go and check out the oh there's a very weird noise happening right now i don't know what that is static horrible static okay i gotta go move away from that static anyway uh everyone should go to i'm to go back to find that link right here secret forest i'm so bad at navigating your this is why i lose every single among us game i ever play um project website uh here um if i click on project website um i will be right here in the secret forest which you can see the url right here a dash secret dash forest dot glitch dot me um but more more more than that i would encourage you to come right here to yourblit9.itp.io and visit with the creators of the secret forest themselves you've got about four minutes i can't believe i ended up live streaming the entire show the whole point of me doing this was to just do it for a little bit at the beginning and then get out of the way so that everybody else would um would enjoy it so but i'm gonna i'm gonna quickly close out your i don't know if anybody's still hearing me in europe i'm closing the link i'm closing this link i'm turning this off and i'm gonna wrap things up ah so uh thank you all for joining me on this journey this strange journey through the itp ima i am a lowres winter show my name is dan schiffman i am your host of the coding train the year 2020 is almost over i have some things still on the horizon you might know me from my how to program your own discord bot i don't think i need this music in the background uh video series um and most recently um a most recent video tutorial that came out today was how to post gifs from a bot to discord so if that interests you head on over to youtube youtube.com i think that's the url slash coding and i'm not trying to i don't know why i'm trying to like i'm just trying to give you updates i really you should be going to bed uh everybody who's on the east coast of new york go to sleep get some sleep get some rest read a book i don't know light some candles relax don't be like me um on the computer all the time but um uh so that's i do have one more video that was recorded that i haven't finished uh publishing yet which will be at least the final discord bot tutorial for a while on how to program a command handler so if you've ever wanted to know more about require and node.js because that's what everybody's looking for right now everybody's just wandering the world their whole life is like if only only somebody would make a video that explained what required node.js meant um so that you can go check out um young man is telling me to go check infinite reflection i don't know where that is i think i've got to be done with looking at projects right now but i really encourage everybody to check it out maybe i'll i might go i'm gonna look at a few more projects after i sign off um but what i wanted to announce okay skelly says it's only 7 on the on the on the west coast so you're ok um skelly you can stay awake for a little bit longer but you know maybe just you know to lower the screen time get some rest i don't know what i'm saying uh julia there you go i see julia your messages are coming through in the chat i am so glad to see that it was just the url i you know i could i'm gonna give you like an amazing power right now julia um julia now you should be able to post a url everything has worked out we've come full circle we're closing the loop we're tying a bow around it twisting it putting it there julia can now post links um and what was i saying i don't even remember oh yes what else is coming in 2020 so i will be um soon uh i have two more live streams planned for 2020. one i don't really want to tell you so much about because it's kind of a surprise it's a really out there crazy thing that might not go well at all but it's going to be really fun if it happens um it's a guest it's a guest conductor video i've got a guest who i've been messaging with talking to with an amazing youtube channel if you want to check it out it's called twirlingtech goddess just check out twirling tech goddess on youtube but we're going to do a collaboration i probably shouldn't be announcing this now it's going to be really really wacky and fun so that's coming it's got to happen before the end of the year because twirling tech goddess is only available until december 31st so uh you know we all turn into pumpkins after that so that's coming but then what's the what i what i would like to really announce and tell you about is that my next um mike says i live on a spherical planet so east and west coast doesn't make much sense you know it's all relative um um what was i saying ah yes let me just pull up this url here um if you are not familiar with the processing foundation uh the processing found oh you don't see that the processing foundation is the nonprofit organization that i am a part of uh that maintains processing and p5.js and works on a lot of different um advocacy and education initiatives please visit processingfoundation.org to learn all about processing and we are in our the season of our annual fundraiser um you know processing and p5.js and all of the related activities are only made possible by you the generous people um who contribute in all sorts of ways not just financially so many of you may be watching this and not able to donate please don't donate but if you are able to please do there are a lot of worthy organizations that could use your support right now i hope that processing can make it onto your list and there are some of these wonderful rewards and gifts that you can get this thing is like incredible i just want to make these infinite objects little like video sculpture things so anyway i'm going to be doing a live telethon to raise money for the prostate foundation i think next tuesday or wednesday that's kind of my plan it'll be in the middle of the day um and i will be singing some holiday songs about code because i feel like the more i embarrass myself the more people donate that's how it's gone in the past so stay tuned for that i'll be scheduling that on the channel so if you really want to know this thing i'm supposed to say it's like written it's like uh you know when you when you start a youtube channel you sign this like contract where at the end of every video i have to say so please like and subscribe click the bell all that stuff if you want to get notified about that um thank you everyone for tuning in please go and check out the itp show projects if they're still there i'm going to head out of here now i'm going to play the rest of this song and say goodbye angus is watching from germany at 4 4am thank you for tuning in uh sassanc is asking me to do android app development tutorials not too likely if i'm being honest sorry about that um goodbye everybody see you next time on the coding train and have a wonderful evening as always i always forget that this stop this stop this stop this stop i'm gonna do this stop this stop i'm gonna do this this stop this stop uh just because it was asked will there be a live stream this saturday no there will not be a live stream this saturday um but there are two more live streams coming this month this dot this dot song never forget the this dot somebody composed that song for me
