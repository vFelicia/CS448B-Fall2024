03:14 - you know I didn't realize my mic wasn't
03:16 - muted because the uh these there we go I
03:19 - I computer crashed and the audio's not
03:21 - playing
03:22 - this is a professional operation here
03:24 - people
03:28 - [Laughter]
03:32 - well how's my audio folks I'm gonna mute
03:35 - my mic for a second and see if I can get
03:36 - the music going

05:35 - thank you
05:37 - foreign
05:40 - [Music]
06:15 - hi
06:18 - that's right
06:21 - welcome to
06:24 - a sort of pop-up surprise spur of the
06:28 - moment uh Saturday
06:30 - 409 p.m eastern time live stream of the
06:34 - coding train that's right it's me Dan
06:36 - your friendly neighborhood awkward
06:38 - internet personality live streaming on a
06:42 - Saturday afternoon uh with a lot of
06:44 - incredible
06:46 - unanticipated technical difficulties in
06:48 - getting this thing going
06:51 - um and uh so feeling more unprepared
06:55 - than I did 20 to 30 minutes ago when I
06:58 - decided I've got a moment to just run
07:01 - into the studio and turn the lights on
07:03 - and get this thing going because
07:05 - I started a project yesterday and to be
07:08 - honest uh what I mean by started a
07:10 - project yesterday is I talked about the
07:13 - idea of a project yesterday
07:15 - four two and a half hours and then or I
07:19 - or I talked about other things for about
07:21 - an hour and a half
07:23 - I talked about the idea for an hour and
07:26 - so I wanted to keep the momentum here I
07:29 - don't know that the idea he that I that
07:32 - it's my intention to build this entire
07:34 - project entirely while live streaming
07:37 - but I do feel it's important to kick it
07:39 - off and get it going if I
07:42 - um
07:43 - want to make it possible for the
07:46 - community the viewers like you at home
07:48 - to be able to contribute and participate
07:52 - uh it is 9 p.m 10 p.m 11 p.m everyone 2
07:56 - A.M no one is there anyone in the chat
08:01 - who was on eastern time I would like to
08:03 - know maybe uh maybe it is earlier in the
08:06 - day is it morning for and like uh is it
08:09 - is it early afternoon for anybody early
08:11 - morning maybe somebody from Hawaii uh
08:17 - um
08:19 - and okay
08:21 - uh zdax wanted to help out true bolt
08:25 - asks hey Dan I have a question when will
08:27 - you make a video where you try to make
08:29 - Geometry Dash on an Apple II Plus
08:32 - I'm sorry to disappoint you but Eastern
08:36 - Daily Time represents says bill yeah
08:39 - um
08:40 - that doesn't sound super likely
08:45 - but not out of the realm of total
08:48 - possibility I think it's more likely if
08:50 - I were to attempt some kind of version
08:52 - of Geometry Dash as a coding challenge
08:54 - that would be
08:56 - happening right here on my trusty uh
08:59 - Apple Macintosh
09:01 - laptop computer
09:04 - um for any of you who are uh supporters
09:08 - on patreon or YouTube membership I've
09:10 - got the Discord chat I'm going to try to
09:13 - keep my eye on it today I'm not gonna
09:16 - run two simultaneous YouTube chat and
09:19 - YouTube q a so if you've got questions
09:21 - throw them in the live chat just know
09:23 - that I basically the way that I interact
09:26 - with the live chat is I kind of peer at
09:28 - it every once in a while and there are
09:31 - some people who have that wrench icon
09:33 - who are moderators who can hopefully
09:35 - help answer some questions and please
09:37 - try to stay on topic and be friendly and
09:40 - kind to each other uh uh um in the chat
09:45 - um it's a freckle pasta hair maybe
09:47 - Tetris Tetris
09:50 - Tetris is really really missing from the
09:54 - library of coding challenges on the
09:56 - coding train so let's um
09:57 - let me talk about two things one uh a
09:59 - correction time I don't know if these
10:01 - really count as Corrections wait a
10:03 - second
10:06 - what
10:08 - hold on hold on
10:10 - I had some really weird stuff going on
10:12 - here
10:13 - that I do not want to uh I messed up my
10:18 - okay
10:19 - I put the wrong I I charge the sound
10:22 - board iPad up
10:24 - and
10:26 - um but I had placed the wrong one in the
10:29 - place with the sound board we'll see if
10:32 - we have some sound later not that we
10:33 - really need it because today is a work
10:34 - day
10:35 - I don't have time to just mess around on
10:37 - a Saturday afternoon if if I'm not
10:40 - taking a nap
10:41 - or playing Monopoly with my children or
10:44 - cooking dinner I better be doing
10:45 - something productive right here I just I
10:47 - started with the nap and then realized
10:49 - oh that's not a good look
10:52 - naps are underrated for me just nothing
10:55 - like a good nap I um I'm getting some
10:57 - Sounds here getting some messages all
10:59 - right
11:00 - um just just bear with me I'm trying to
11:02 - get the sound board going
11:05 - uh
11:10 - oh no
11:17 - go go yes sound cue okay hold on it's
11:21 - happening people
11:23 - the iPad I couldn't charge yesterday
11:28 - is charged
11:31 - Trust
11:33 - oh oh no no no I don't need to do this
11:36 - right now
11:38 - just unplug from there
11:40 - not now not now not now
11:42 - not now not now this is not what I mean
11:45 - to be doing
11:51 - welcome to the coding train where I hook
11:55 - up
11:56 - all the technology of the coding train
11:59 - at the beginning of the live stream you
12:01 - know what they say you got to capture
12:03 - the audience's attention right there at
12:05 - the beginning which is why I usually
12:06 - read random numbers because that really
12:08 - captures the audience's attention
12:12 - well we're doing that today people
12:14 - that's happening if we can get this
12:17 - going just give me a second
12:20 - we're back baby
12:24 - um
12:26 - okay let's do it here

13:34 - foreign
13:36 - all right and with that I think we
13:40 - really can begin today's episode of the
13:44 - coding train C all of that manic energy
13:46 - that frantic neuroticism it's all melted
13:50 - away I am here with you I am the
13:52 - soothing internet coding
13:56 - person
13:58 - who calms your nerves and helps you work
14:01 - through those for loops
14:04 - uh was that music too loud okay sorry
14:09 - uh you remember you know how I did we
14:12 - get a new um did it so did a new member
14:15 - just join did I miss that tie lie
14:19 - [Music]
14:24 - welcome to
14:27 - the coding train
14:32 - come on on board where you will receive
14:37 - your very own random number
14:41 - [Music]
14:44 - six seven two four one by the way you
14:48 - should everyone should know that I've
14:50 - spent
14:51 - um
14:52 - many a year
14:54 - talking about these custom uh laser
14:57 - etched train whistles that I am making
14:59 - uh as a a token and a pre of
15:02 - appreciation a fun
15:06 - treat to be sent in the mail to
15:08 - supporters and members of the coding
15:10 - train and it's really happening folks
15:14 - um but the the new the truth is uh doing
15:17 - them custom with a custom number and a
15:20 - custom unique random uh random walk has
15:23 - proved to have
15:25 - defeated me uh and so I am um I don't
15:30 - want to say Mass producing them because
15:32 - that's not exactly accurate but I'm just
15:34 - having a batch of about 50 of these made
15:36 - they're all identical they will be
15:37 - numbered but they all have the same
15:39 - algorithmic patterns on them from a few
15:42 - different coding challenges the coding
15:43 - train train and uh this is for I can't
15:47 - remember which level but the conductors
15:49 - or the engineers not um so stay tuned uh
15:52 - if you're not in the Discord uh everyone
15:54 - is welcome and should be in the Discord
15:55 - that's one of the things that I forgot
15:57 - to show yesterday that I wanted to I
15:58 - have three things three Corrections from
16:00 - yesterday
16:02 - um but uh for any of you who are members
16:04 - and are wondering what's happening with
16:05 - your train whistle or or your stickers
16:09 - so some of you are expecting stickers
16:10 - please
16:12 - um con into the uh Discord and make sure
16:15 - you tag me or station manager or any of
16:18 - the um the the folks who help out there
16:20 - in the Discord okay
16:22 - um
16:24 - uh Frank asks are you a professor uh
16:28 - well technically speaking I mean there
16:31 - is a place where you can find the word
16:33 - professor and my name in the same web
16:36 - page
16:37 - and on the deployment logs of a
16:40 - university but I don't know so at some
16:43 - point someone's gonna uh that's I don't
16:45 - know how much longer they're having to
16:46 - be able to keep that up but yes and in
16:48 - fact I am returning to teaching live and
16:51 - in person at NYU uh this spring so I've
16:54 - I've been on leave for a bit which has
16:56 - been wonderful uh I I prothomash great
16:59 - to see you there in the Discord chat
17:02 - um and I'm going back to teaching all
17:03 - right let's go through the corrections
17:05 - and I'm not a CS so for warrior
17:09 - great name
17:11 - um uh pravesh I'm sorry that you have
17:13 - covet I hope that this stream can bring
17:15 - you some little happiness and and help
17:16 - you feel better uh I hope you feel
17:18 - better soon
17:19 - um
17:21 - I'm not uh just to make a correction I
17:23 - am not a computer science Professor uh I
17:26 - do not
17:28 - um uh I am part I I uh I teach at the uh
17:31 - Tish School of the Arts in the
17:33 - interactive media department so
17:36 - um yeah
17:37 - um okay
17:39 - um let's go to Corrections
17:42 - Corrections so a couple things one is
17:44 - let's see I'm very excited that we'll be
17:48 - returning back to the
17:51 - um Apple II today uh and and trying to
17:55 - Port a project here one of the things
17:57 - that happened yesterday do you see my
17:59 - face how I'm talking to you I had
18:01 - cropped it in obs
18:03 - cropped the video in OBS right about
18:05 - here
18:06 - and I didn't realize that so I was in
18:09 - this position most of the stream talking
18:12 - to the camera while typing I didn't look
18:15 - and check the whole time yesterday's
18:17 - live stream you don't see my face so uh
18:20 - I think I fixed it just now let me know
18:22 - if that's the case we'll come back here
18:23 - in a bit
18:24 - that's correction number one
18:30 - uh
18:32 - crook
18:35 - um correction number two
18:38 - uh let's see look at this I fixed my
18:42 - curiosity stream Banner so I I literally
18:45 - have a mulligan here uh today
18:47 - yesterday's stream and today's stream is
18:49 - sponsored by curiositystream and the
18:52 - reason why I was so excited uh for this
18:54 - sponsorship and this collaboration is I
18:57 - recorded a new course
18:59 - um if we go to here and here uh I you
19:02 - know I apologies for those of you tuned
19:04 - in yesterday that this is a total repeat
19:05 - but I imagine there's quite a few uh uh
19:08 - new viewers today
19:10 - um if I go to
19:12 - nebula.tv uh Slash what is code uh
19:16 - nebula is a wonderful streaming service
19:17 - uh built by creators including myself
19:20 - and owned by creators
19:23 - um and if you kind of want if you like a
19:26 - certain set of interesting educational
19:28 - YouTubers I have a feeling you're gonna
19:31 - find most of them on nebula and you can
19:33 - watch all of their videos uh ad free
19:36 - um there's nebula first so a lot of
19:38 - videos get posted to nebula before they
19:40 - go on to YouTube there's lots of
19:42 - wonderful aspects of
19:45 - um
19:46 - of the uh the the site
19:50 - um
19:51 - if I'd like to go to feature and sort of
19:53 - see what's going on here
19:55 - um but um what I wanted to uh mention
19:58 - was classes there's all these wonderful
20:00 - classes one of which I don't let's see
20:03 - if mine is still up here in this like
20:04 - top uh row it doesn't look like it is
20:07 - but all these awesome ones are somewhere
20:10 - here we would find mine if we kept
20:11 - looking but uh what is code and so it
20:14 - used to be that this was a separate
20:16 - purchase that I mentioned on many uh
20:18 - previous
20:19 - um videos but now it just comes with
20:21 - nebula but the um the best way for you
20:24 - to get it is through the Curiosity
20:26 - stream bundle this is the cheapest way
20:28 - at least it's like a price hack so if
20:29 - you go to curiositystream.com choo choo
20:32 - Link in the description sign up for
20:34 - curiosity by the way you're getting
20:35 - thousands of curiosity Street
20:37 - documentaries I'm talking about nebula
20:39 - because that's where my clap my Apple II
20:41 - classes that you might be interested in
20:42 - because you're watching this
20:44 - um but you're you know curiosity stream
20:46 - is an incredible range of content as
20:47 - well so if you go to that link you'll
20:50 - get curiosity stream plus nebula for a
20:53 - full year for 14.79 for the entire year
20:56 - it's a bundle
20:58 - um
20:58 - it's like a little over a dollar a month
21:00 - and then if you uh come on classes uh
21:03 - just for a one-time fee of ten dollars
21:06 - you can upgrade to have classes or a one
21:08 - dollar a month so technically you could
21:10 - watch my class for one dollar extra if
21:12 - you watch it all for the same month I
21:13 - suppose I hope I think you would just
21:16 - once you're there you're going to
21:17 - realize there's so much other stuff you
21:18 - want but anyway so I just wanted to get
21:19 - that out of the way at the beginning of
21:21 - the live stream and correct that um I
21:23 - will I might mention that link again
21:25 - later if you've got any questions about
21:26 - that
21:27 - come to the Discord ask me
21:30 - um all right so that was those are two
21:33 - Corrections ah yes speaking of the
21:36 - Discord this is what I wanted to mention
21:39 - um the Discord so a lot of these things
21:42 - um
21:43 - are in uh my announcements on Discord
21:46 - which I'm showing you right now I talked
21:47 - about sure and I'm not going to go
21:48 - through all this other stuff but here's
21:50 - the links also to the Curiosity stream
21:52 - bundle and the nebula class but what I
21:54 - wanted to show you that I'm really
21:55 - excited about is that
21:59 - um
21:59 - our Discord the coding train Discord now
22:02 - has help forums so there's lots of fun
22:07 - Lively chatter of just people hanging
22:10 - out and talking about I don't know who
22:12 - coding train and there's a pets Channel
22:14 - which is my favorite Channel there's the
22:16 - introductions Channel which is actually
22:18 - truly my favorite Channel because I love
22:20 - hearing about where people are from and
22:22 - how they found the coding train and what
22:23 - they're interested in and their Hobbies
22:24 - I really want it to be a place for
22:26 - people just to enjoy meeting each other
22:28 - and hanging out in online space but one
22:31 - of the things that I feel like we were
22:33 - never able to successfully really do
22:35 - until I would say now it's really
22:37 - happening is be able to provide uh help
22:40 - uh oh Stefan from Germany hello
22:44 - um and I will catch you up name
22:47 - name I love that name name
22:51 - um we've never I've never really found
22:52 - the right tool for people to be able to
22:54 - ask for help and get help with their
22:57 - code as it relates to the coding trade
22:59 - so certainly this is not perfect but
23:00 - let's go take a look at it the help
23:02 - forums I
23:04 - um so you can see here now if you want
23:07 - help with your code you can create a
23:10 - forum post and most of these I'm
23:12 - noticing are like very active
23:15 - um maybe I'm just going to look through
23:16 - here to see there is one here that only
23:19 - has one comment so maybe that's one
23:21 - we'll take a look at here's another one
23:22 - with one comment so there's a few here's
23:24 - one with zero uh maybe we'll look at
23:26 - this one since it has zero but most of
23:28 - these are pretty active you can see that
23:30 - they're new
23:32 - um and so there's a lovely community of
23:34 - folks in here who are helping each other
23:36 - out with their code discussing coding
23:38 - problems I have to admit as you can see
23:40 - it says 24 new posts so I'm not able to
23:44 - be in there on a regular daily basis is
23:47 - answering a lot of questions
23:48 - not to mention the fact that I you know
23:51 - I'm an old man and I don't know very
23:56 - much anymore I mean I I want to thank
23:58 - just speaking of which I want to give a
24:01 - shout out to
24:04 - um
24:07 - F terminal ft Irmo who watched the live
24:11 - stream yesterday and just opened this
24:13 - total pull request to help optimize the
24:17 - build of the coding trade website Gatsby
24:19 - and I'm looking at this and be like I
24:20 - don't know how any of this works I don't
24:22 - understand it somebody asked a question
24:23 - in the Forum about this I'd be like I
24:25 - don't know I gotta ask a question too
24:27 - because I don't know how to do any of
24:29 - this so I'm just thrilled for the
24:31 - community who's been so generous and
24:32 - helpful with the website who's being so
24:34 - generous and helpful with these um
24:36 - uh uh Forum posts and I just want to say
24:40 - thank you and let everyone know about
24:42 - this
24:44 - um
24:45 - so
24:47 - um did I name the stream the coding
24:49 - Trail on purpose
24:51 - yes
24:54 - no
24:57 - nobody it's I meant for it to be but I
24:59 - don't remember doing that yes
25:04 - okay so I kind of wanted to look let's
25:07 - let's
25:08 - I don't have a ton of time and I I it's
25:10 - already been a half an hour and I want
25:12 - to really begin this project in earnest
25:16 - um and welcome to Simon uh one of coding
25:19 - Train's most loyal viewers and I I
25:21 - always think of Simon when I say that
25:23 - because I think once I said Royal by
25:25 - accident like a little Freudian slip if
25:27 - you will and I think Simon truly is a
25:30 - royal viewer of the Kodak train okay
25:34 - um
25:34 - let's look at this one it has one
25:36 - comment
25:38 - and I'm gonna open this wider so I can
25:41 - see it better
25:43 - look at all this look at look at look at
25:45 - me uh messing with these windows okay
25:47 - oops ah no okay
25:49 - no ah it's okay uh I haven't I have
25:53 - haven't completed typing everything but
25:55 - until here it is working the way it
25:56 - should
25:58 - uh oh okay so so one thing I would say
26:02 - is to mushy
26:05 - um is that I'm not sure exactly
26:10 - what you're asking about so one thing
26:12 - that I would say like if you're posting
26:14 - your code questions that could be
26:15 - helpful and I know for many of you uh
26:18 - English is not your first language and
26:20 - so that is a big challenge to overcome
26:22 - if you're in a you know english-centric
26:25 - uh Discord server
26:28 - um so I would love to think about ways
26:31 - to make it friendlier more accessible
26:32 - for a global audience but um but I'm not
26:36 - so thinking about what the question is
26:37 - also um sometimes including a screenshot
26:40 - so if this code is not working the way
26:43 - you think it should and you have an
26:46 - image of what it the output is currently
26:48 - doing as well as an image of what you
26:51 - think it should look like that can be
26:52 - helpful
26:54 - um posting the code is always excellent
26:56 - a couple notes about this in Discord is
27:00 - uh
27:00 - if I do this
27:05 - that's a way of noting that this is
27:08 - going to be uh
27:10 - um pre what's that not forgetting what
27:13 - pre-formatted text what does the pre
27:14 - stand for I forget
27:16 - um pre
27:18 - um but uh which will look like this but
27:21 - um if you want to syntax highlight it
27:23 - you can add a JavaScript or a different
27:26 - language and you can see now it's syntax
27:28 - highlighted so that's always something I
27:29 - recommend when you're posting your code
27:30 - but often even better with the P5 web
27:32 - editor uh just posting a link to the
27:35 - code in the web editor is a really good
27:37 - good way of when you're asking for help
27:39 - because
27:41 - um then you know otherwise I'm sitting
27:42 - here and I'm kind of copying and pasting
27:44 - it
27:45 - um and I would say like uh Snippets are
27:48 - better in here but a huge block of code
27:51 - is very hard to parse and read inside of
27:53 - Discord so let's take a look and see if
27:55 - we can help it all
27:59 - um
28:01 - so I can see I see that this
28:04 - looks like something and then uh
28:10 - the poster mushy maybe is expecting it
28:13 - to look like this ah you know what I
28:17 - know what it is okay
28:19 - so let's take a look let's see if we can
28:21 - fix this
28:22 - um
28:24 - so fascinating
28:27 - so first of all I'm seeing dots here I
28:29 - was expecting to see text
28:32 - oh they're points okay well that's
28:34 - interesting so this is also doing
28:36 - something totally different
28:38 - than what I see here
28:41 - so this I think is going to Merit some
28:43 - more time this is pretty cool though
28:46 - well this would be a great coding
28:47 - challenge
28:48 - uh it looks like they tried to take this
28:51 - code and then
28:56 - um
28:58 - ah and then I'm kind of
29:02 - Fork it not for fork it just sort of
29:04 - adapt it and you can see some JavaScript
29:06 - code so I I I think this is perhaps not
29:09 - um unfortunately this is not a great
29:12 - question for me to pursue right here uh
29:16 - I'll try to return to this if somebody
29:18 - can remind me or tag Me Maybe
29:21 - um in this thread later not right now
29:22 - because I won't that the notification
29:24 - will come in I'll see you later but if
29:26 - anybody wants to kind of help maybe we
29:28 - can take it upon ourselves as a
29:29 - community to see
29:31 - um if we can get this working I love the
29:33 - idea of doing this as a uh coding
29:39 - challenge
29:40 - um itself to create an ASCII rendered
29:42 - donut that's pretty cool okay
29:45 - so I always wanted to ask this is a
29:47 - great question from Stefan uh are we
29:50 - just talking about processing Java
29:52 - JavaScript or can we ask about anything
29:54 - coding related Swift swift UI Swift
29:56 - playground
29:57 - okay
29:59 - so great question
30:01 - the the short answer is
30:04 - the the Discord and the community is not
30:07 - limited to processing Java JavaScript
30:09 - and p5.js definitely not
30:12 - any question uh related to the coding
30:16 - train World which encompasses all uh
30:20 - code work and Beyond really is welcome
30:24 - here um in the Discord
30:27 - um so certainly if you have questions
30:29 - about Swift swift playgrounds all these
30:31 - things opening a question here there is
30:33 - a a tagging system
30:36 - so you probably would want to tag other
30:38 - uh tag it as other if you're if you
30:42 - think it makes sense to include
30:43 - something like Swift in this list then
30:47 - uh I would suggest pinging a station at
30:50 - station manager the moderation team who
30:52 - sort of handles and curates this stuff
30:54 - but I think other is pretty good
30:56 - catch-all for other things I just think
30:57 - be aware that I uh prob you know I don't
31:02 - have an accounting of this I haven't
31:03 - done some deep dive into uh the sort of
31:07 - skills and the depths and skills in the
31:09 - community but probably there are fewer
31:11 - people who are around in the Discord who
31:14 - know about these things but they may be
31:16 - interested and would love to take a look
31:18 - and participate so yes please all topics
31:22 - related to code and the universe of
31:24 - creativity and design and interactive
31:26 - media and working with computers are all
31:29 - welcome here
31:31 - um ah so Starkey asks a great question I
31:35 - just joined the Discord how come I don't
31:37 - have the help and questions tab on it so
31:39 - most likely if you just joined the
31:41 - Discord all you see is read me
31:45 - um and so um I know that there are newer
31:48 - systems for how Discord can onboard
31:51 - people and Kobe I believe is working on
31:53 - that but you you're you probably have a
31:56 - role called waiting to board let me see
31:58 - if I can find you
32:01 - um so a whole lot of people just joined
32:03 - uh Starkey 3000 let's see uh Starkey
32:07 - 3000 so yeah if I look at you Starkey I
32:10 - see that you have this waiting to board
32:12 - roll
32:12 - and so I could actually manually remove
32:15 - that and every it would unlock
32:16 - everything but what you need to do is
32:19 - read through this uh readme which gives
32:22 - you all of the pertinent information
32:23 - about you know what the different
32:25 - channels are for uh what the different
32:27 - roles are and they need to actually
32:30 - update some of these I realized because
32:32 - Psy has moved on to uh bigger and better
32:35 - things
32:36 - um and so
32:38 - um
32:39 - um but
32:41 - um uh and thank you to CJ who helped you
32:43 - would a lot of this is pulled from the
32:45 - coding Gardens Discord but once you uh
32:47 - react to the with an emoji to the code
32:49 - of conduct sort of accepting the code of
32:51 - conduct of the community
32:53 - um
32:54 - then it should unlock all the channels
32:56 - for you you won't see
32:58 - um some of uh these channels that are
33:00 - for uh supporters only I know you can't
33:02 - even see this right now because it's I'd
33:04 - have to move it over and then just as a
33:07 - key thing as I often post links to
33:09 - things
33:10 - um here and check and just check the
33:15 - announcements recently because I've
33:16 - posted a lot of stuff there okay
33:18 - uh
33:20 - uh saw and everyone uh wish Simon well
33:23 - who has uh broken his arm hopefully it's
33:26 - healing smoothly uh
33:31 - um all right so yes uh prothomash is
33:33 - saying uh Daniel starts coding within 40
33:36 - minutes of starting the stream challenge
33:37 - impossible mode like can we make that
33:38 - happen yes we got four minutes all right
33:42 - so
33:43 - um
33:45 - let's get going
33:49 - what is the work of today
33:52 - and I don't expect to get super far with
33:55 - this which is why I probably need to
33:57 - ultimately work on this not while
33:59 - streaming or do a more sort of ambient
34:02 - stream but let's go to repositories and
34:06 - let's go to
34:08 - um
34:11 - oh whoops
34:14 - oh
34:15 - did I wait a second
34:19 - help
34:23 - oh you know what I did I didn't realize
34:26 - that yesterday I put the repository
34:27 - under shiftman not coding train so
34:29 - that's let's fix that
34:31 - speaking of Corrections settings
34:33 - uh no um
34:36 - uh settings
34:39 - um
34:41 - uh
34:43 - it's usually here somewhere transfer
34:46 - transfer the ownership
34:50 - um sorry I can barely see my screen uh
34:53 - coding train
34:55 - this is the worst this is what I always
34:57 - do it says type this to uh confirm
35:00 - because it really wants to make sure you
35:01 - really want to do it and I always just
35:02 - copy paste it uh okay so uh now I've
35:06 - gotta find
35:09 - my two-factor code
35:19 - um so please bear with me look I can
35:20 - play music now though
35:25 - no
35:28 - no not now
35:30 - [Music]
35:54 - foreign
35:56 - [Music]
36:06 - so let's go ahead
36:09 - and clone this repo
36:16 - sure we'll also install the item update
36:18 - why not
36:20 - ah we got some folks from Sweden in the
36:23 - house
36:24 - um guess what I'm sorry I missed you but
36:25 - I was in Sweden over the summer I was
36:27 - had the opportunity to visit your lovely
36:29 - city of Stockholm
36:32 - um I had an incredible time I know this
36:33 - is probably very like touristy like the
36:35 - sort of like obvious tourist thing but
36:36 - the Vasa Museum was incredible I also
36:39 - really enjoyed the Abba you see him
36:41 - uh I had some lovely uh food some lovely
36:44 - beer some good coffee even
36:47 - had a really wonderful time there and um
36:50 - that was it was pretty brief but I was
36:52 - only in Stockholm so that was my only
36:54 - regret I was I'd love to list visit more
36:56 - of Sweden I would
36:58 - um one of my dreams is to go on a trip
37:01 - up as North as you can go up in northern
37:05 - Europe and see the Northern Lights maybe
37:07 - stay in one of those ice hotels I don't
37:08 - know maybe this is like me being like a
37:10 - sort of like really embarrassing
37:12 - American but um
37:14 - uh that's uh that's that sounds really
37:17 - cool to me okay
37:19 - um let's just put it on the desktop
37:22 - grab this repo
37:25 - uh open it up in vs code
37:30 - okay let's
37:32 - actually only open that repo up
37:37 - so we're gonna get the beginning of this
37:39 - going today
37:43 - um and let's also
37:45 - um let me merge this thank you to uh
37:48 - python coder unicorn who helped create
37:51 - this text file which is going to prove
37:53 - enormously
37:55 - um useful
37:57 - um for today's work
37:59 - incred enormously useful incredibly
38:03 - um useful
38:09 - um all right so let's bring this in
38:11 - and uh well it's okay sure
38:17 - we'll take a look at this great all
38:19 - right now what I would like to do wow so
38:21 - many people from Sweden that's really
38:24 - cool
38:26 - um the Discord invite on the website is
38:28 - outdated we're really working on this
38:30 - people
38:31 - so why does this keep happening
38:34 - we went through a whole round of this
38:37 - um so apologies for that please file a
38:39 - GitHub issue for the website uh noting
38:42 - that so we can fix it but yesterday I
38:45 - checked and if you go to
38:46 - thecodingtrain.com Discord
38:51 - uh thecodingtrain.com Discord that
38:54 - should take you to a valid invite I hope
38:57 - okay so let's move on over to the Apple
39:00 - II uh briefly
39:03 - um
39:05 - uh oh where's my button for that okay
39:08 - um okay we're gonna move over to the
39:10 - Apple II
39:16 - and I'm going to apologize in advance
39:19 - because
39:21 - those of you who are you the the Young
39:25 - and have all your faculties and wits
39:27 - about you
39:29 - which is not me
39:31 - my brain moves so slowly these days but
39:34 - my ears do not hear
39:38 - sounds above a certain frequency and
39:41 - this um
39:43 - this monitor emits a very high pitched
39:46 - wine it's an old-fashioned CRT Monitor
39:48 - and uh I should have set it up to put a
39:51 - low fat pass filter but I'm not so you
39:53 - might be hearing that apologies for that
39:54 - once I get back over the computer it
39:56 - does not transfer that far so this is
39:59 - actually all I wanted to do which is I
40:01 - wanted to have this Opening screen
40:03 - because this in many ways is the first
40:06 - thing that I would like to implement
40:08 - today during the live stream so I have
40:10 - this as a reference we can play it as
40:13 - necessary
40:15 - um
40:16 - and
40:18 - then I'm going to come so somebody asked
40:22 - somebody asked
40:24 - um and I and I could put the
40:26 - maybe what I'll do is just put in the
40:29 - top I don't know where but let's uh
40:32 - um video capture device
40:35 - um let's let's bring in a picture and
40:37 - picture of
40:40 - it oh that's the wrong one sorry
40:42 - everybody
40:44 - um
40:49 - uh
40:50 - sorry I should have had this prepared
40:52 - maybe this is unnecessary but I would
40:55 - like to
40:57 - I don't know why that I'm sorry about
40:59 - the um I'm sorry blue boo is anybody is
41:03 - uh
41:04 - if somebody who has access to
41:09 - um Discord invite URLs and could help
41:12 - with that I will I will deal with that
41:14 - in a moment um sorry uh Apple II this is
41:17 - what I'm looking for okay so let's move
41:20 - this up here in a place where I'm just
41:23 - gonna like leave it up here as a very
41:25 - small reference
41:28 - um so apologies about the Discord uh I
41:31 - don't know if Kobe is watching in
41:33 - particular who can help
41:35 - uh with that
41:37 - but um
41:39 - I will get that sorted
41:42 - um blue
41:43 - uh and so somebody remind me when the
41:46 - stream is wrapping up perhaps okay
41:49 - so and I guess probably makes more sense
41:52 - for me to just go over here but here's
41:54 - the real here's the real question
41:57 - this is the sixty four thousand dollar
41:59 - question
42:01 - do I want to do this
42:04 - entirely as canvas
42:08 - or
42:11 - do I want to create this as Dom elements
42:15 - and let me talk you through what I see
42:16 - as the pros and cons of each
42:20 - and
42:21 - um
42:22 - and actually
42:25 - what I'll do here
42:28 - is
42:30 - I'm really getting kind of ridiculous
42:33 - about this
42:36 - oh sorry everybody it's me with a giant
42:39 - green screen okay uh let's just put me
42:42 - here
42:43 - uh and uh chroma key that
42:46 - uh great okay so look at that tiny look
42:50 - at this giant Oregon Trail
42:52 - I want to be able to talk to you with
42:53 - this here I guess I could make myself a
42:55 - little bigger
42:57 - a little bit absurd okay so
43:00 - um
43:02 - pros and cons
43:05 - so
43:06 - for me I like the idea of doing this in
43:10 - canvas because it is more act it
43:14 - reflects the reality of this very low
43:18 - resolution pixel space right
43:21 - um Dom elements you know divs and all of
43:25 - that jazz paragraphs are all kind of the
43:27 - have all of these features for
43:30 - responsive design and
43:32 - uh the sort of modern capabilities of
43:35 - the web and if I want to create
43:37 - something kind of true to the look and
43:41 - feel of this game having a fixed canvas
43:44 - which doesn't mean I couldn't resize it
43:46 - and and alter the sort of Dimensions I
43:48 - think would be more true to the look and
43:51 - feel of it
43:54 - um the uh the disadvantage to doing
43:57 - canvas the downside is uh
44:02 - the text would be
44:04 - not selectable sort of viewable as part
44:08 - of like the source of the page
44:11 - um it would make
44:13 - inevitably I think we'd have some issues
44:15 - around accessibility although come to
44:17 - think of it this could be a really nice
44:19 - opportunity to investigate
44:22 - creating a canvas game that is
44:25 - accessible and what I mean by accessible
44:27 - is works with a screen reader
44:29 - um so Dom elements you know have
44:32 - built-in features to be able to be read
44:35 - to screen reader users
44:38 - um
44:39 - whereas canvas that you know there are
44:42 - capabilities that do that but it's a
44:43 - bigger challenge especially when
44:45 - something is highly visual or animated
44:47 - at a very fast you know frame rate but
44:49 - with this I wouldn't have that issue I
44:51 - just would have to build in some hooks
44:53 - to read the text on screen describe the
44:56 - images I kind of like this idea now
44:58 - canvas presents the most interesting
45:00 - challenge says bite spider which I like
45:02 - that the other thing
45:07 - I like I mean so I'm not
45:10 - I'm not doing this because this doesn't
45:12 - exist like let's look
45:14 - I I haven't uh Oregon Trail uh emulator
45:17 - like let's just see classicroad.com
45:22 - start this is like made with some like
45:26 - plug-in I guess
45:29 - um blue okay I can't look at this it's
45:31 - all ads or whatever
45:33 - retro games
45:36 - so here's one
45:39 - I guess it's running in an actual
45:41 - emulator perhaps
45:44 - well this is a 1990 oh you can't see
45:47 - this this is a 1990 version of it wow
45:51 - that's cool
45:53 - so yeah so this is emulating the sort of
45:55 - like 1990 dos uh dos version of it
45:59 - let's see Oregon Trail
46:03 - JavaScript let's try that I'm just I
46:05 - should have researched this in advance
46:07 - a re-imagining so somebody's uh six
46:10 - years ago did this oh dear
46:13 - so this looks very much like what I want
46:15 - to do already done
46:18 - this these are Dom elements
46:21 - because they're selectable
46:25 - oh interesting
46:27 - so I do quite like this
46:30 - and it has an interface
46:33 - and it has new images so this is kind of
46:35 - exactly what I want to build
46:40 - uh
46:42 - but I I still think you know
46:46 - I mean the point of this is not is the
46:48 - learning and the challenge of doing it
46:52 - um
46:53 - let's just like take a quick peek at the
46:56 - code just to sort of understand it yeah
46:58 - oh interesting
47:00 - yeah this is kind of what I imagine
47:01 - doing and is a lot of Dom element stuff
47:04 - so this this is a very clever design
47:07 - that I it sort of feels like it could
47:09 - easily be canvas and what is this font
47:11 - because I'm going to want to use a font
47:12 - like this
47:15 - um
47:15 - it is
47:17 - can I find it here
47:21 - I would think that it would show inherit
47:25 - I don't I don't see it in uh the font
47:28 - family vt323
47:31 - yeah
47:32 - vt323 font
47:39 - ah yes so this could be a great font to
47:41 - use
47:43 - um
47:44 - so Kathy says I think you should update
47:46 - to modern times so I don't know if you
47:48 - mean the visual style of it or the
47:51 - content
47:53 - um so
47:54 - my goal for the so my goal for the
47:58 - project is to stay true to the visual
48:00 - style of it so that doesn't mean the
48:02 - interaction couldn't be a bit more
48:04 - clever and more fluid and there couldn't
48:05 - be some additional like fun animations
48:08 - but I I want it's important to me for
48:11 - the way I'm thinking about this project
48:13 - to and also just my own sort of like
48:15 - capabilities and keeping things
48:17 - constrained to keep the original visual
48:19 - design
48:20 - content wise the reason to do this
48:24 - ultimately is not to play the Oregon
48:26 - Trail but to have the coding Trail well
48:28 - I want to make it somewhat uh
48:30 - templatable so I'm imagining kind of
48:31 - like a big Json file that has all of the
48:34 - narration and the data and all the stuff
48:36 - in it so you could like basically write
48:38 - your own organ Trail Story retitle the
48:39 - game so that's content oh yeah so the
48:42 - content absolutely but right now I don't
48:45 - want to have to
48:46 - uh develop the content
48:48 - so it's easier for me to just use the
48:51 - precise content of the Oregon Trail and
48:53 - uh then once it's sort of up and running
48:55 - we can start to rewrite and redo the
48:58 - content that's kind of my thinking okay
49:01 - um Terminus font
49:03 - I'm afraid to like just
49:06 - look at this
49:08 - but I'm going to trust
49:11 - uh
49:13 - screenshots
49:17 - all right uh this is not showing me
49:20 - anything but oh cool ah yeah that's
49:23 - great yeah I think I used this font in
49:26 - uh I don't know if it was this font that
49:27 - much you used in the recent Apple II
49:29 - video okay
49:31 - so so that's the question that's a
49:34 - starting point
49:36 - um and I don't think
49:39 - I
49:39 - don't think that
49:43 - um
49:44 - and let me go back to here
49:47 - I don't think that any decision that I
49:49 - make right now that I'm going to be so
49:51 - far along in the project that we
49:52 - couldn't switch gears and change it to
49:54 - Dom
49:56 - um but that's kind of what I'm thinking
49:57 - let me put up a poll yeah famously I
50:00 - almost I never do what the audience says
50:02 - in the poll so in fact I have some like
50:05 - Affliction which is to do the opposite
50:09 - um Oregon Trail uh canvas
50:14 - um
50:17 - so no matter what this is going to be
50:19 - canvas or it's going to be P5 and I
50:23 - should really do I should the reason why
50:25 - I have this other laptop here so I can
50:26 - create the poll like this and still talk
50:28 - to I look so weird when I'm over here
50:30 - like off in Never Never Land but I have
50:32 - a computer over here that's what you
50:33 - can't see
50:34 - Canvas OR Dom
50:38 - curious to see
50:40 - the thing that I worry about doing Dom
50:42 - that um
50:44 - uh is that everyone's going to complain
50:46 - that I'm using the P5 Dom Library which
50:48 - is a little bit wonky but
50:50 - um
50:51 - so I'm kind of interested in canvas to
50:53 - be honest that's what I'm leaning
50:54 - towards starting today and while that
50:56 - poll is going let's at least start to
50:59 - create a bit of a framework here what
51:03 - image do we get
51:04 - oh thank you for this
51:12 - yeah I
51:16 - choose Dom so you do it in campus right
51:18 - no no don't try to game the system
51:25 - to Dom but probably still didn't canvas
51:27 - and he wrote canvas I'll just be more
51:29 - clear about where I'm starting I I fully
51:32 - uh expect
51:34 - that I I think there's a a a a a
51:37 - significant chance definitely a non-zero
51:40 - chance that I start with canvas and
51:41 - change to Dom later or kind of use
51:43 - canvas but put Dom uh I could also uh
51:46 - you know what makes sense is actually to
51:48 - have
51:49 - um fixed position Dom elements over the
51:52 - canvas but I'm getting ahead of myself
51:53 - here I haven't even like
51:55 - started this I got we got to get going
51:57 - so I'm going to make a uh file called
52:01 - um
52:02 - index.html
52:05 - I'm going to make a file called
52:08 - sketch.js
52:11 - and I don't know what's going on here
52:14 - should not be in the image directory
52:17 - this should index.html so let's move
52:20 - that
52:21 - let's go to the web editor and let's
52:27 - just grab this
52:33 - and let's go to the web I don't need to
52:36 - grab anything for oh yeah
52:39 - so and let's take a look here
52:41 - oh you're not seeing me again I'm sorry
52:43 - ah see this is why I shouldn't go to
52:46 - that screen because I'm going to forget
52:47 - so sorry about that it it is I did
52:49 - correct it just now
52:52 - um
52:54 - it would be interesting to try to do
52:55 - this in basic and actually what I should
52:57 - do is I should grab the code for it
53:02 - do I have a all right well one step at a
53:06 - time
53:07 - uh canvas is winning uh
53:11 - yes to be clear again I'm not going to
53:14 - use the original Graphics the content is
53:16 - entirely going to change the look and
53:19 - feel of it should be the same the
53:21 - whatever new graphics will be pixelated
53:23 - in the same style as the old Graphics
53:25 - that's the idea
53:28 - um okay
53:31 - um
53:32 - so let's
53:36 - but create a style
53:39 - dot CSS in case we're going to need that
53:42 - [Music]
53:43 - um
53:49 - let's add the ubiquitous setup and draw
53:57 - whoops
53:59 - and let's just try
54:04 - um
54:09 - let's try this font just because it's a
54:11 - Google font so I should be able to
54:15 - load it easily how do I okay wait wait
54:18 - wait wait
54:19 - I know how to do this
54:21 - I don't want to download it isn't there
54:23 - a way here to get the
54:29 - um
54:31 - like that like it should give me like
54:34 - the CSS for select
54:36 - yeah so I think I can do this
54:43 - right if I put this I'm just curious
54:46 - right I think if I for any font and I'm
54:48 - sorry this is uh small I think if I copy
54:52 - this
54:54 - put this in
54:56 - the HTML
54:59 - and then now why did this not format
55:02 - I don't know but I'm going to manually
55:04 - do it
55:06 - and then
55:08 - uh and then I think if I were to go into
55:12 - style and do body and again we're gonna
55:14 - I have to be more specific about this at
55:16 - some point
55:18 - and grab this
55:21 - press start to P looks like a 8-bit font
55:25 - ah
55:28 - oh and I'm seeing some
55:30 - oh no stop
55:33 - um
55:37 - input handling is much easier doing HTML
55:39 - instead yeah I know that input handling
55:41 - is much easier doing HTML but so there's
55:44 - a comment here which is saying input
55:45 - handling is much easier to do an HTML
55:47 - instead of in canvas but you have to
55:48 - remember
55:50 - whoa this was not written
55:53 - with can't with uh HTML dominant complex
55:57 - input in mind like there's very little
55:59 - input that I need which number on the
56:01 - keyboard did the person press did they
56:02 - say yes or no what number did they enter
56:04 - so uh writing a little engine to get
56:07 - that basic amount of input from the user
56:09 - the player is not going to be is it's
56:11 - going to be work but that's kind of an
56:13 - interesting Challenge and I think a
56:14 - throwback to how these systems were
56:16 - originally done but anyway so yeah I
56:18 - just want to get a sort of hello world
56:20 - thing going here
56:22 - um so I'm going to say text align
56:24 - Center Center
56:27 - let's do a
56:29 - create canvas
56:34 - 640 so the Apple II is 280 by
56:41 - 192 I believe
56:44 - is that right
56:46 - yeah 280 so let's multiply that by two
56:49 - just to sort of like double the
56:51 - resolution
56:53 - and uh let's say
56:55 - um text the Oregon Trail
57:01 - width divided by two height divided by
57:03 - two put that in the center text size
57:07 - let's try like 64 and fill of 250 ah I
57:12 - gotta turn off that autocomplete and no
57:14 - stroke so you've never seen P5 before
57:16 - friendly
57:18 - um
57:20 - uh creative coding environment for
57:22 - drawing into canvas with a lot of other
57:23 - hooks with a very nice API okay so let's
57:28 - go
57:29 - to oh and let me
57:32 - um
57:34 - run a little server here
57:36 - in fact let me actually uh use live
57:38 - server and I I could run a server
57:41 - through vs code okay there we go
57:45 - thank you everybody uh
57:47 - [Music]
57:52 - thank you thank you we are done we're
57:54 - done we're done we're done
57:56 - yeah okay uh
58:02 - all right uh the the
58:04 - um what was Simon's great idea in the
58:06 - chat I missed it
58:11 - Trail okay so why didn't my font work
58:16 - um
58:19 - so that would be oh did I take no
58:22 - I mean this shouldn't matter the order
58:24 - right
58:26 - oh you know why
58:29 - canvas is not going to pick up the fonts
58:35 - interesting
58:36 - uh
58:38 - so how do I
58:41 - this is an interesting question P5 load
58:43 - font
58:48 - take a look so it could be a an asset
58:54 - that's if I want to load it as a
58:59 - file but that's not what I want to do
59:01 - unless I can put the URL
59:04 - um text font
59:11 - but what would happen
59:14 - if I
59:18 - whoops
59:20 - text font
59:27 - let's see
59:29 - and again I'm going to use a diff I'm
59:31 - not saying this is the font I'm going to
59:32 - use I just wanted to sort of see oh
59:34 - there we go okay that worked okay
59:36 - awesome
59:39 - um great so we've got this
59:42 - um clearly not exactly the same
59:45 - uh font but
59:48 - something close to this font here pretty
59:50 - interesting all right so we've begun
59:55 - so let's think now
59:59 - um a bit more holistically about this
60:01 - project and I'm going to check the time
60:03 - I'm
60:04 - um I think I'm probably going to wrap up
60:06 - around 5 30 which is a half an hour from
60:08 - now so again my this this really would
60:11 - if I'm really going to build this we'd
60:12 - need like an all-day stream
60:15 - uh yeah so making a CLI and node would
60:19 - be super fun like that's a really fun
60:21 - idea a fun project but
60:24 - um not going to make it as easily sort
60:25 - of playable or usable for a wider
60:28 - audience as it would be if it's just on
60:29 - the web
60:30 - um okay
60:33 - um
60:34 - so let's take a look at what
60:38 - uh python unicorn coder had uh offered
60:43 - so
60:45 - python unicorn encoder I don't know
60:47 - whether they were able to find this or
60:50 - just took notes but this is awesome
60:52 - because it's given us a really nice long
60:56 - script for the whole uh game
61:00 - but I think what would be useful to do
61:06 - as an exercise and I'm kind of doing
61:08 - this without a lot of
61:11 - um
61:14 - planning or note taking but I I would
61:16 - like I'm just going to call it data dot
61:18 - let's call it
61:20 - game.json I guess maybe
61:23 - what I would like is to create a data
61:27 - file I'm calling it game.json which
61:29 - stores all of the metadata for the game
61:34 - so and there are references up here I
61:37 - can't see this at all so like for
61:39 - example let's just put it to there
61:42 - so for example
61:46 - I and I I think we're good it's going to
61:48 - need a lot of work but just to start
61:53 - like imagine if I had a
61:58 - um
61:59 - let's just think about this for a second
62:00 - like a
62:02 - array called choices
62:06 - and in those choices would be the
62:08 - options like travel the trail
62:12 - uh learn about the trail
62:23 - uh see the Oregon see the organ top ten
62:32 - um
62:35 - and
62:37 - turn sound off
62:40 - turn sound off
62:44 - so
62:53 - the idea here zdax that is you great
62:56 - so the idea here is that for any given
63:02 - sort of like page of the game
63:06 - part of the game the story The Choices
63:09 - the story and the data are all inside of
63:14 - this
63:15 - um
63:16 - Json file so what I want to do is like
63:18 - play through the game a little bit so
63:20 - let's imagine I I think what I'm going
63:23 - to need is
63:25 - um like we'll call this
63:27 - we're gonna have to do this a little bit
63:28 - on the fly like uh intro
63:33 - which is an object
63:36 - which has the choices
63:38 - the prompt
63:40 - which might be the same for everything
63:43 - what is your choice
63:46 - and then like you know maybe it would
63:48 - have a you know image
63:55 - you could imagine there being like
63:59 - like what was this there's this like
64:01 - imagine if what I did was crop this
64:04 - image and only kept the top let's try
64:06 - that just
64:07 - just as a sort of exercise
64:16 - uh okay
64:21 - so again this is not
64:24 - I'm gonna really have to rethink the way
64:28 - um the source code to the original game
64:30 - was late says Joshua Walker
64:34 - thank you for that let's go look
64:36 - uh I missed a membership upgrade okay
64:39 - okay okay it's hard to keep track of
64:41 - everything no the Super Chat I see
64:44 - someone joined at the conductor level
64:45 - okay fine
64:48 - interrupt me
64:50 - someone who joined to the conductor
64:53 - level it's got to be a way for me to
64:54 - find out who you are
64:58 - welcome thank you for joining
65:02 - the coding trade
65:04 - at the conductor level
65:08 - ah it's Joe who gifted a membership
65:10 - thank you Joe I forgot that we have
65:12 - membership gifting that's a very very
65:15 - very much appreciated
65:17 - um Joe has been a wonderful new member
65:19 - of the coding train posting a lot in the
65:21 - Discord I owe you a reply to an
65:24 - excellent set of questions that you sent
65:26 - me that I've really been thinking about
65:27 - just I haven't had a chance to uh dig
65:30 - into it yet okay so let's do
65:33 - um let's call this title.png so
65:36 - imagining then there's going to be like
65:38 - title dot PNG so this is like kind of
65:41 - the idea that I'm thinking about
65:44 - um the intro is going to have a set of
65:46 - choices a prompt and a title card so we
65:49 - can so we can now go I just want to like
65:51 - go through and start playing the game
65:54 - so I'm going to go over and I gotta end
65:58 - this poll because it's blocking my view
66:00 - of the chat so oh no end poll
66:07 - um okay
66:10 - okay well sorry I I will I'm sorry for
66:13 - whatever I missed it's not showing on my
66:16 - screens I can only do what I can do okay
66:19 - um going to the Oregon Trail come join
66:22 - the Discord so I can say thank you okay
66:24 - yeah BB asked if Emma is Dan I I don't
66:27 - know I want to keep doing twit twitch
66:30 - and I would have normally done this in
66:32 - twitch but I was streaming yesterday on
66:33 - YouTube and I got the setup and then I
66:36 - thought I should continue if I go back
66:37 - and forth so I'm really lost so your
66:40 - help and thoughts and advice and I'm
66:42 - going over to there so
66:46 - um I'll be right there in a second I
66:49 - just apologies
66:52 - um
67:06 - okay
67:08 - um I'm going over now
67:10 - to here
67:15 - and
67:16 - so
67:18 - I think for right now what I'm going to
67:20 - do is I'm not going to bother to work
67:24 - through learn about the trail or see the
67:26 - Oregon top 10. I really have trouble
67:29 - pronouncing Oregon because I think
67:30 - there's a proper way to pronounce it I
67:32 - know it's incorrect to say Oregon that's
67:35 - definitely wrong but Oregon is that
67:37 - right I think I'm not looking at the
67:39 - chat right now so sorry I didn't bring
67:40 - my laptop over here but I'll be back
67:42 - over there in a second
67:43 - um travel the trail so if we go to
67:45 - travel the trail
67:48 - so now we need to do this screen
67:51 - so
67:53 - um so I don't know to what extent it's
67:55 - useful to do all this data entry but I'm
67:57 - going to go back I'm going to do this
68:00 - at least do this okay
68:04 - actually I'm going to skip this because
68:06 - now we kind of understand what I need to
68:07 - do for this just data entry
68:10 - um
68:17 - so let's just I'm gonna go ahead and do
68:19 - the banker again that's what I did
68:20 - yesterday just to kind of do that
68:23 - and see okay what is the first name of
68:26 - the wagon leader okay so we need a this
68:30 - is important
68:33 - we're going to need a
68:36 - um
68:39 - we're going to need
68:45 - I don't I'm going to call it game for
68:46 - right now and the
68:51 - I don't know what to call the people who
68:53 - ride the wagon
68:56 - oh DJ manga says or
68:59 - gen organ or again or again or again
69:03 - okay the Oregon Trail thank you DJ
69:06 - Mangus
69:07 - um
69:08 - so what are the people who ride the
69:11 - wagon
69:17 - so there will be an array with the
69:20 - people who are riding I mean I guess
69:22 - there's the do we need to keep the
69:23 - leader separate
69:28 - I don't call them passengers
69:33 - which would be an array
69:37 - so like for example
69:38 - if I entered my name
69:41 - you know yesterday we had choo choo
69:45 - this Dot and obviously this wouldn't be
69:48 - in the Json
69:52 - in advance because it would be empty
69:54 - it's just sort of like loaded and then
69:55 - these things would get filled in I'm not
69:57 - again I I haven't thought this through
69:59 - maybe we need a separate
70:01 - data structure like
70:04 - but I'm going to keep going with this
70:06 - because I'm figuring this out this time
70:07 - okay so that's the idea but let's leave
70:09 - it empty
70:13 - knowing that the idea is it for it to be
70:15 - filled in
70:17 - and
70:18 - uh let me go over to here
70:24 - so this would also need
70:27 - um this would be part of the story
70:31 - um so
70:32 - um I'm just gonna say uh
70:35 - a simple Dan
70:37 - uh
70:47 - this is what I did yesterday
70:50 - so again so one of the things that
70:52 - people could do today after the stream
70:55 - if this seems like a good direction is
70:57 - help
70:59 - um do the data entry for all of these
71:01 - different uh screens pages
71:05 - are these names correct
71:07 - yes
71:09 - um
71:11 - and then all right so then we need
71:14 - something for this screen with the text
71:17 - okay
71:18 - uh Okay so
71:21 - now we have uh the month that you're
71:24 - leaving so again this is just something
71:27 - to enter just like before so I'm not
71:30 - gonna go back and type this in I'm just
71:32 - going to put in April
71:37 - and this would be another page so money
71:41 - how much cash you have is very important
71:45 - so cash and then the through your
71:49 - inventory
71:51 - so
71:53 - um okay
71:55 - so let's go back and think
72:04 - so again I'm not so sure everything
72:06 - needs to be in this Json file or it's a
72:11 - matter of me just creating variables
72:13 - right because like the amount of money
72:15 - could be
72:21 - just its own variable but I think what
72:24 - I'd like to do right now is I'm kind of
72:25 - working this out is have everything be
72:28 - in here and so this would be
72:30 - um
72:31 - the amount of money you have so you can
72:33 - imagine like it's going to start with
72:35 - some amount then we would have an
72:36 - inventory
72:41 - which would be another object
72:43 - with properties like oxen
72:47 - and then the number so all these would
72:49 - start at zero
72:53 - like this would get filled in Oxen what
72:56 - were the other things a team of oxen
72:58 - clothing
73:03 - I know there's food
73:07 - and there was uh what else was there
73:11 - um
73:14 - recommend having a Json data structure
73:16 - to hold all the game State exactly
73:18 - that's what I'm hoping to do here
73:21 - um
73:22 - State machine we're definitely going to
73:24 - need a conductor right I mean certainly
73:27 - this should be the conductor but again I
73:30 - just I'm not I'm just going to use the
73:32 - language and the story of the
73:33 - Oregon the Oregon Trail right now food
73:37 - okay
73:38 - that computer is very far away let me
73:40 - make more sense when you do this with an
73:42 - emulator
73:44 - so before I leave I'm going to see if I
73:46 - can get the code
73:48 - um
73:50 - okay clothing and I don't think I
73:52 - switched the screen sorry about that
73:54 - um clothing food ammunition spare parts
73:58 - for the wagon food ammunition spare
74:00 - parts
74:02 - oh this would have made things easier if
74:04 - I just saw this okay
74:08 - so we've got oxen food clothing
74:11 - ammunition spare parts
74:14 - oxen clothing food ammunition
74:25 - uh
74:28 - spare parts
74:32 - now the prices
74:37 - I should also
74:41 - yeah what if I made a slide class
74:45 - [Music]
74:46 - um
74:47 - and uh
74:50 - would render and wait for input yeah so
74:53 - these are all great ideas I don't know
74:54 - how to organize doing this in a sort of
74:56 - collective way I think what I would love
75:00 - is for those of you who have the idea if
75:01 - you want to contribute and work on some
75:03 - of these features after today because I
75:05 - am going to wrap up pretty soon I'm not
75:07 - going to get much further is
75:10 - um
75:11 - is like file an issue uh with a sort of
75:15 - short description of what you want to
75:16 - try to implement
75:18 - um and then I can kind of like give you
75:19 - the thumbs up I will try to stay really
75:21 - like a close eye on this repo over the
75:24 - next week and then uh and then so people
75:28 - can also track and and don't have uh
75:30 - both people aren't kind of doing the
75:31 - same thing but I know it's this is
75:33 - tricky because the sort of foundation
75:34 - isn't really there yet game State and
75:37 - gang config text should be separate
75:39 - files though since one will be read only
75:41 - and one will be read write
75:44 - um yeah that makes a lot of sense
75:47 - that makes a lot of sense
75:51 - um
75:52 - so these should be also the price like
75:59 - the game state in a way I don't even
76:01 - need it to be a Json file like I'm not
76:06 - going to be I'm not really intending to
76:08 - implement this we might I would use
76:10 - local storage so I guess if I'm using
76:12 - local storage to save the game state so
76:14 - somebody could leave and come back to
76:15 - their browser that would make sense
76:17 - so all right I think what I need to do
76:19 - because I uh is start to wrap this up
76:22 - and file a bunch of issues with sort of
76:25 - some plans and people could I I might
76:27 - work on it knowing these plans
76:29 - um Okay so
76:33 - that's what I'm gonna do so I'm gonna
76:35 - put put a hold on this right now
76:38 - um yeah the money is 1600 right so this
76:41 - is the this is the disconnect right now
76:43 - the money is sixteen hundred dollars but
76:46 - that value doesn't go in here
76:49 - that value is
76:51 - listed with
76:53 - um okay so these are like what are um
76:55 - the Prof I would call them professions
77:01 - so I the professions
77:04 - are Banker
77:14 - um
77:16 - which gets sixteen hundred dollars there
77:18 - might be more to it so
77:20 - um
77:26 - so we like the name of the profession as
77:28 - the banker
77:31 - the money is 1600 right so when so this
77:37 - is why I'm mixing up the important
77:39 - details which was what I can't remember
77:41 - which um viewer just said
77:45 - um
77:47 - um and I have somebody by the way who a
77:50 - a foreign asked about the art
77:53 - um so I have somebody who is interested
77:55 - in helping do who specializes in pixel
77:58 - art and it was interested in helping
77:59 - create all the art so certainly if
78:01 - somebody's interested in that let me
78:03 - know
78:04 - um and I probably just use as
78:06 - placeholder I'm going to kind of like
78:07 - screenshot the actual art from the game
78:10 - and just put it in there but eventually
78:12 - the idea is to have updated new art
78:15 - um the profession also has an effect on
78:17 - score so right all of the details for
78:20 - each profession
78:22 - would go here
78:28 - I don't know if anybody knows off the
78:30 - top of the head what um
78:32 - what amount of money uh the farmer has
78:35 - I'm just gonna put zero in right now so
78:38 - this is really the game State and I
78:40 - think I should take this out here now
78:44 - because uh so let's do a game
78:50 - uh
78:52 - I'm gonna call this game
78:54 - data
78:56 - and I am going to do game state
79:03 - uh which would be this part of me
79:07 - actually wants to make this
79:10 - I'm going to do it this way I'm gonna do
79:12 - actually call it state.js
79:16 - so I'm gonna have a Javascript file
79:22 - which stores
79:24 - the state of the game in a variable
79:27 - so um the idea here is that the game
79:31 - state is not the data we're loading
79:35 - right it's
79:36 - ultimately there is a little bit of an
79:39 - issue here because the language here
79:40 - probably has to match in some way and
79:42 - maybe what the state the initial State
79:44 - like maybe it makes sense for the
79:46 - initial state to be part of the Json
79:48 - file I don't know see there's so many
79:50 - different ways I could take this and I
79:51 - that's why I'm interested in getting
79:52 - people's opinion of people just jumping
79:54 - in but the idea is that this is the
79:56 - current state of the game and it's empty
79:58 - when the game begins
80:00 - then when you select being a banker the
80:05 - amount of money that's tied to the
80:08 - banker would go into
80:10 - the your current money in the state of
80:13 - the game so
80:15 - um
80:16 - but I am just going to uh say let's just
80:21 - see if
80:23 - still loads uh let's do git add
80:27 - git commit
80:29 - uh starting the foundation for the game
80:33 - and I'm sorry you can't really see what
80:34 - I'm doing down here
80:37 - um
80:37 - uh get push well I didn't create another
80:39 - Branch but that's okay by the way if you
80:41 - forget to create another branch and you
80:43 - want to do a pull request I can push
80:45 - the main branch to a different branch on
80:49 - GitHub Itself by doing this uh live
80:53 - I'll just call it live stream two
80:57 - and then I'm going to open up a pull
80:58 - request here
81:02 - and
81:03 - um this is from
81:06 - today's live stream
81:12 - and if I go to YouTube and coding train
81:15 - I should presumably
81:17 - be able to
81:19 - find this
81:22 - uh
81:24 - right it might make sense to make it a
81:26 - class maybe the game State should be a
81:28 - class I like that idea
81:34 - so I'm just going to go ahead and merge
81:36 - it
81:38 - I mean I could leave it unmerged so
81:40 - people could comment on it but I think
81:41 - that's going to be more confusing so
81:43 - let's start by
81:47 - merge attempt failed
81:49 - oh I probably did it twice it has a
81:52 - conflict what is going on
81:55 - what just happened
81:59 - what
82:05 - how is this even possible
82:07 - what did I do okay fine
82:10 - let's do this
82:11 - uh
82:18 - uh let's do this get fetch
82:22 - uh get check out live stream
82:26 - two
82:28 - oh no
82:39 - I don't know what's going on here did I
82:41 - think I hit the merge button twice
82:50 - yeah oh so yeah I think I don't know
82:53 - what just happened did I push it to the
82:55 - wrong thing
82:58 - I have no idea what's going on this is
83:01 - very weird
83:07 - nobody knows I don't know what I just
83:09 - did
83:10 - so strange
83:14 - I'm just gonna close this pull request
83:17 - and
83:20 - just walk away slowly from this
83:24 - um one thing I want to do is
83:27 - add a git ignore file
83:34 - and put DS store in it
83:38 - and remove
83:44 - um I should really step I want to set
83:46 - this up with netlify as well remove
83:49 - git remove
83:56 - no get
83:58 - RN
84:01 - there we go
84:02 - uh
84:05 - uh great
84:10 - let's do this
84:22 - good
84:42 - okay
84:43 - uh
84:45 - do this okay so
84:48 - um
84:53 - great so oh all right
84:59 - States got to keep track of Health yeah
85:01 - everything everything so
85:06 - let me think here let let me start
85:08 - creating some issues
85:11 - um
85:15 - um
85:22 - um do I still have that yeah okay
85:25 - I'm gonna close this issue
85:27 - so
85:34 - I am now looking for in the chat or in I
85:37 - lost the Discord uh supporter chat
85:43 - uh Richard v d Veen thank you is the uh
85:47 - welcome to conductor so Richard if
85:49 - you're still watching I appreciate thank
85:51 - you for your support make sure you link
85:53 - your Discord account come and say hi and
85:54 - Discord
85:56 - um font for the title page okay great so
85:59 - uh
86:01 - um okay so fonts so no brainer uh Chris
86:05 - Sears who just suggested a font that'll
86:07 - work well anybody wants to pull request
86:09 - the font go for it so what are some
86:11 - things that are that people who are
86:14 - watching could do
86:16 - so one is create uh
86:21 - create class
86:24 - to store game state
86:28 - okay so that I welcome is does that make
86:31 - sense
86:33 - um
86:37 - uh
86:39 - yeah I don't rebase
86:42 - it's not for me that's that's very uh
86:45 - you know exciting and I'm sure it's very
86:47 - you know it's kind of like a big party
86:50 - when everyone's get rebasing but but for
86:52 - me I just merge
86:55 - um so what are some things just based on
86:59 - what we've seen today that you could
87:01 - imagine uh doing
87:04 - um that I should create issues for is
87:05 - what I'm looking for in the chat
87:13 - or maybe I should just go work on this
87:15 - more on my own and then come back to
87:18 - another live stream and and let you all
87:20 - know where I am
87:24 - um all right let's do create a class
87:27 - okay
87:29 - um
87:31 - let's see data
87:35 - create a class
87:38 - to store game State all right I'm just
87:42 - going to file that issue
87:44 - uh okay yes so the idea is using the
87:47 - text file so the text file just needs is
87:49 - exactly what we need just needed to be
87:51 - adapted into the Json format
87:54 - um
87:56 - okay adapt
87:59 - text file script into Json format that's
88:03 - something that somebody could work on
88:05 - potentially
88:07 - um
88:09 - another thing could be that I'm thinking
88:12 - of is render a slide maybe there's a
88:16 - better term
88:21 - but taking the data from
88:26 - um
88:28 - game
88:29 - data.json and rendering the text and
88:35 - and choices
88:39 - uh
88:43 - uh so like a framework a simple engine
88:47 - for
88:48 - uh user input
88:54 - so we need to we can use the P5 key
88:56 - press function to just kind of like keep
88:58 - track of user input
89:01 - um then I also want to
89:05 - um accessibility
89:11 - uh
89:13 - screen reader support
89:16 - for each
89:18 - game slide what's the you know game page
89:21 - page
89:23 - um
89:24 - so uh describe
89:27 - p5.js
89:30 - yeah
89:32 - we should be able to use this
89:34 - um
89:35 - uh
89:38 - um read prompts and describe imagery
89:43 - for screen readers
89:45 - p5s
89:47 - describe
89:50 - function might be enough
89:58 - um okay
90:04 - I meant to grab this URL here
90:08 - okay
90:12 - um all right
90:15 - right the shop right so you could use
90:18 - older each screen or slide can also
90:20 - accept input theme it you can use labels
90:22 - to Mark the tasks right all these are
90:24 - great suggestions
90:27 - um the shop interface is uh is its
90:30 - unique one is is kind of unique so like
90:32 - maybe there is a
90:35 - um
90:36 - you know what are
90:38 - list of possible classes
90:43 - so there are there's the
90:46 - um shop
90:48 - there's there's sort of like an
90:50 - interface
90:52 - slide class
90:58 - shop extends
91:01 - interface
91:03 - slide
91:04 - keyboard input class
91:11 - so again I'm kind of just making up
91:13 - stuff as I'm talking here you know if I
91:15 - were building this just all on my own I
91:17 - probably wouldn't be trying to architect
91:20 - it so much I just start like making the
91:23 - first page and then as I go on then I'd
91:26 - refactor a bit but um so uh so
91:32 - um
91:34 - so yeah so so and I'm not really worried
91:37 - about the visual design right now
91:39 - because that can be cleaned up what I
91:41 - would like is kind of like a core
91:43 - framework for the game just to like be
91:46 - able to
91:48 - start it with reduced amount of options
91:50 - play through a few pages
91:52 - um and that's kind of what I'm looking
91:54 - to do
91:56 - um okay
91:59 - so what else can I possibly do before I
92:03 - go here so people jump right in uh to
92:06 - comment file your own issues to propose
92:08 - things the ways uh you know make your uh
92:12 - look freaking there you are
92:14 - um and um
92:17 - uh we'll see I mean I guess I'm gonna
92:19 - work on this a bit this weekend
92:21 - um and over the course of next well week
92:25 - um what I wanted to do
92:27 - see if I have the tools for this okay so
92:30 - let me go over this one of the things
92:32 - I'm curious
92:34 - to see is if
92:39 - I don't know
92:41 - if this game itself
92:45 - the one that you're seeing here is
92:47 - actually
92:48 - um written
92:51 - uh in basic but I want to look at
92:54 - the disk image of the Oregon Trail game
92:57 - which I have on this
93:00 - um micro SD card and I can put it into
93:03 - here
93:05 - the only thing is I need a a card reader
93:08 - which I I have somewhere in this room ah
93:12 - found it
93:15 - so I'm coming back over here
93:18 - I also need a Windows computer which
93:22 - is not this one
93:24 - so I might uh love to get some help from
93:28 - from all from any of you who are
93:29 - watching here
93:32 - um okay so I'm going to
93:39 - put this in here
93:45 - put this here
93:46 - hopefully this is going to appear
93:49 - uh
93:51 - great perfect
93:54 - um
93:55 - Apple II stuff five and a quarter discs
93:59 - uh games
94:02 - so Oregon Trail one and two dot d o
94:05 - that's not a format that I'm used to
94:07 - seeing let's put these on the desktop
94:13 - um
94:15 - so one thing I'm curious about is
94:18 - first of all
94:20 - before I go is can I
94:26 - can I open
94:29 - will it support these
94:31 - do files
94:39 - let's see ah yes awesome so
94:43 - I'm you watching at home the version
94:46 - we're doing this version the 1985 Apple
94:49 - II version
94:52 - um you can play this
94:53 - so would it be weird for me to put in
94:57 - the repo
94:59 - these two files they're tiny files so I
95:02 - think it's fine I don't think they're I
95:05 - think they're they're my public domain
95:08 - so let me add uh
95:11 - let's go here
95:12 - so this is going to help everybody
95:15 - um so let's
95:18 - upload add a file
95:21 - upload files
95:23 - uh all right no
95:27 - all right let me just put them in let's
95:29 - create a branch
95:32 - um
95:41 - it's a couple things uh
95:43 - I'm gonna move some stuff around
95:49 - and put this in there
96:03 - it's a little silly but just in case
96:05 - just let's do some
96:06 - like file management here
96:21 - and
96:23 - let's create a folder called
96:26 - uh original
96:31 - and let's put these disk images there
96:38 - so if anybody
96:40 - you know if if we want to check
96:45 - uh
96:47 - look at the chat create an asset folder
96:50 - however there's a reason you don't
96:52 - usually find that version of alignment
96:53 - instead of the 1978 basic version I kind
96:56 - of I don't am I wrong to want to do this
96:57 - version I kind of like this version
97:01 - um
97:02 - so
97:04 - um so let's do this so get checkout uh
97:08 - get branch
97:10 - file management
97:17 - let's add the
97:22 - wait what happened here
97:26 - let's add the original
97:31 - disk uh 1985
97:36 - Apple to disk images
97:45 - organize files
97:53 - okay
97:55 - um
97:58 - organizing files
98:02 - and adding original disk
98:06 - images for play at
98:10 - here
98:14 - okay
98:19 - now what I would like to do
98:23 - is
98:26 - this is the best version just not ever
98:28 - released to public domain interesting
98:31 - um thank you DJ Mangus okay so what I
98:34 - would like to do
98:36 - is I think what's the thing I think it's
98:38 - called Cider
98:42 - Apple II disk image
98:45 - cider press yeah so anybody who's
98:49 - watching on a Windows machine right now
98:51 - I'm pretty sure that this tool I know
98:55 - because I've used this and somebody
98:56 - helped me um with Soren who helped me
98:58 - with this
99:00 - um
99:03 - this tool should allow you me you to
99:07 - extract a disk image
99:11 - and convert it to raw files that are
99:15 - that you could open on your Windows
99:16 - computer or on a Mac so if anybody is
99:20 - watching right now who might be able to
99:22 - very quickly
99:24 - uh grab
99:28 - these two disk image files and open them
99:32 - with cider press
99:36 - and let me know if you've got
99:39 - the um
99:42 - uh
99:45 - uh let me know if you've got the
99:48 - um
99:50 - if you're able to access the data that's
99:52 - on these disks because I'm curious
99:54 - what's there is it some kind of you know
99:58 - binary assembly version of the game is
100:01 - there basic code that's running the game
100:03 - uh I wonder so I would love to I would
100:07 - be curious to know
100:09 - [Music]
100:09 - um
100:10 - but Gerald this so so now let me talk
100:14 - about one of the reasons why I'm doing
100:16 - this so I
100:19 - so I want to make a faithful version of
100:22 - the original to sort of like learn about
100:24 - it and kind of build this but um
100:27 - there is a podcast that I listen to
100:30 - uh Oregon
100:33 - Trail Rob and Akiva let's see if we can
100:36 - find this
100:38 - Rob and Akiva go on the Oregon Trail
100:42 - um this looks like the version that
100:45 - this is interesting is this the version
100:48 - that um cord on the computer oh they're
100:51 - playing this one
100:53 - so funny okay I'm gonna mute this
100:57 - so this
100:59 - podcast oh so I wonder if I this is the
101:02 - version that they played through
101:04 - and uh I have volunteered which looks
101:07 - very similar to the version
101:10 - that I played through on the Apple II
101:11 - this is a slightly later one so I don't
101:14 - know if
101:16 - um so this is a good question uh
101:20 - um
101:22 - which one to model ours after
101:26 - we should go with the Apple too because
101:27 - that's what I have and it's largely the
101:29 - same so that's the Dos version so unless
101:32 - somebody uh knows like you know like
101:36 - is I guess I'll ask this question is
101:39 - there anything from the Dos version We
101:43 - would like to incorporate again the
101:46 - story is really we could ignore
101:48 - um
101:49 - see uh dos Oregon Trail
101:55 - and I think this is it here
101:59 - right I think this is it yeah
102:02 - um
102:03 - no
102:04 - uh
102:06 - what happened to that
102:10 - lost that page
102:17 - where are we
102:23 - have lost
102:25 - here we go
102:27 - um
102:28 - so I I encourage you to check out the
102:31 - podcast watch that episode but I have
102:33 - volunteered to create a custom version
102:36 - of the game that uh
102:40 - um for their sequel to that episode
102:43 - where they played the Oregon Trail and
102:46 - the idea is that much like if you could
102:48 - imagine if we can make a version of the
102:51 - game that is like the story of the
102:52 - coding train with the coding Train
102:54 - characters and you're trying to journey
102:55 - to find your way to like the promised
102:58 - land of you know your code or whatever
103:01 - um then think of that what I would like
103:03 - to do is make the same idea for that
103:05 - this particular podcast resolve it's
103:07 - weird and fun inside jokes and
103:09 - characters and there's a lot of things
103:11 - going on there so
103:13 - um
103:15 - it's a port from the Apple II version
103:17 - basically the same game yeah that's what
103:19 - I think too so
103:21 - um so
103:22 - um so this is the trajectory here
103:25 - so if anybody would really is interested
103:28 - in being involved with this project
103:31 - I fully understand if you're not
103:35 - um
103:36 - uh then you know go carry on if you're
103:39 - interested you know even in just like a
103:42 - a small way follow the GitHub repo I'll
103:45 - probably do at least one more live
103:46 - stream maybe move these some of these
103:48 - twitch I don't know
103:49 - um
103:50 - uh and uh or if you would like to
103:54 - actually work on the implementation uh
103:57 - feel free to chime in on an issue uh but
104:02 - probably what would make sense is for us
104:04 - to organize a bit in a Discord
104:07 - um a channel in the coding train Discord
104:09 - so maybe I can set that up depending on
104:12 - the level of interest and who's
104:13 - interested so I'm going to keep going
104:17 - um
104:19 - and
104:21 - uh uh oh there's a there's a switch
104:23 - version of it that's interesting
104:25 - um so I'm gonna keep going with this I
104:27 - appreciate all of you for tuning in and
104:29 - watching this has been a couple hours uh
104:31 - close to two hours
104:33 - um and if in an Ideal World I would
104:35 - carve out a full day to just really like
104:36 - work on this uh maybe without like sort
104:40 - of talking through it even so maybe that
104:41 - would make sense for like a twitch
104:42 - stream to just kind of work on this with
104:45 - less
104:46 - um uh with just sort of like you know in
104:48 - a more ambient way and let people
104:49 - contribute
104:51 - um so what else do I want to say
104:54 - um before I go so
104:56 - um
104:57 - if you haven't
104:59 - I guess uh so first of all this is your
105:02 - first coding train live stream thanks
105:03 - for watching uh I've got a huge back
105:06 - catalog of stuff so enjoy if you if you
105:09 - like this you you could spend you know
105:11 - probably the next six months of your
105:12 - life watching all my videos I don't
105:14 - recommend that uh if you've never
105:16 - programmed before and want to get
105:18 - started learning
105:20 - um I have um go to thecodingtrain.com uh
105:24 - under tracks uh this is your the track
105:26 - for you the beginner programming with
105:29 - p5.js
105:31 - um I also want to encourage everybody to
105:34 - uh check out the sort of latest videos
105:37 - that I've been making about the um
105:40 - uh uh programming in basic on the Apple
105:43 - II which has kind of led me to this uh
105:45 - sort of well the the aligning with this
105:47 - Oregon Trail project
105:50 - um and I also want to encourage people
105:52 - uh to I'm just going to pick wave
105:54 - function collapse to if you're making
105:57 - things
105:58 - um based on videos that you're watching
106:00 - there is an entire way for you to submit
106:02 - your work that can be featured on the
106:04 - website itself uh there's a submission
106:06 - form you can also do it as a pull
106:08 - request and on the home page uh thanks
106:10 - to Kathy who's been helping with this uh
106:12 - we cycle in and out of different uh
106:15 - featured projects that are just up here
106:17 - on the home page of the coding train
106:19 - that are made by viewers just like you
106:21 - uh so I want to say that join the
106:23 - Discord thecodingtrain.com Discord does
106:27 - that still not work
106:34 - what's going on
106:36 - so I don't know what I'm doing wrong
106:39 - uh I'm sorry for those of you who have
106:41 - failed
106:43 - um uh failed to get into the Discord
106:45 - this should be like the easiest thing in
106:47 - the world hold on I'm gonna just do
106:50 - something right now on this other
106:52 - computer which is do invite
106:57 - edit invite link
106:59 - never
107:01 - No Limit generated invite link copy I am
107:05 - putting an invite link into the YouTube
107:08 - chat right now one that I just made I
107:12 - don't understand why my redirect is not
107:14 - working
107:16 - um but if you wanted to join the Discord
107:18 - and you weren't able to there you go
107:21 - just make sure that you read through the
107:24 - readme and it moves you react to the
107:26 - code of conduct it will unlock all the
107:27 - channels for you uh it's I would also
107:30 - recommend you don't need to do this but
107:31 - if you sync your if you do if you did
107:34 - sign up for YouTube membership you
107:36 - should sync your YouTube and Discord
107:39 - account there's like a setting there and
107:41 - Discord from your Integrations where you
107:43 - can authenticate to your YouTube account
107:44 - that will unlock further Badges and
107:46 - things for you
107:48 - um and then
107:50 - I created a permanent invite and we also
107:53 - have a vanity URL invite I don't know
107:55 - what's going on with that but regardless
107:57 - it's there right now
107:59 - um the other thing is
108:01 - um if you uh are interested in
108:04 - subscribing to nebula which is the uh
108:08 - streaming
108:09 - um service that I talked about
108:11 - um that is
108:13 - um
108:17 - built by creators many of which do a lot
108:20 - of educational videos and really
108:22 - interesting videos there are a amazing
108:24 - amount I want to look at Originals this
108:26 - is really what I mentioned there are an
108:27 - incredible amount of really fantastic
108:30 - original content that's only available
108:32 - on nebula
108:34 - um uh I talked about jet lag which is
108:37 - the show that I really like native the
108:39 - coconut is a really fun uh movie
108:42 - um I want to make a they have this
108:43 - series called working titles I'm hoping
108:46 - to make a working titles uh episode
108:48 - which will only be on nebula for
108:51 - um
108:53 - um uh this TV show Severance and there's
108:56 - you know there's an Android app there's
108:57 - an IOS app there's lots of ways um I
109:00 - think there's a Roku app that you can
109:01 - watch uh nebula videos so I uh really
109:04 - recommend
109:05 - um taking a look a lot of the animation
109:07 - stuff is really cool uh you know I'm a
109:09 - huge fan of all the science and
109:10 - engineering uh videos
109:13 - um so nebula but the reason why I'm
109:15 - mentioning it is nebula has nebula
109:16 - classes and
109:18 - um
109:19 - here one of the things one of the
109:21 - classes you'll find this is a great one
109:23 - by the way if you're interested in live
109:24 - streaming from luria Petrucci but is my
109:27 - class what is code and this previously
109:30 - was kind of an expensive purchase but
109:32 - the cheapest way for you to get it now
109:34 - is to go buy the Curiosity stream bundle
109:38 - so you get curiosity stream which is
109:40 - over a thousand documentaries and all of
109:42 - nebula together in one package at that
109:45 - URL for 14.79 for the entire year
109:49 - um and then that doesn't actually give
109:51 - you nebula classes but once you get
109:54 - access to nebula it's only one dollar a
109:56 - month more for nebula classes or ten
109:58 - dollars for the whole year so it's
110:00 - actually cheaper than your standard
110:01 - nebulous subscription to do the bundle
110:04 - plus add-on so if you have questions
110:06 - about that you could join the Discord
110:08 - you can ask me about it you can contact
110:10 - I believe it's help
110:12 - nebula.tv so thank you just wanted to
110:14 - mention that uh sponsorship here at the
110:16 - end
110:18 - um and and that's
110:21 - the the latest I just want to read this
110:24 - comment from DJ Mangus it looks like
110:25 - that version the later ones is copyright
110:27 - The Learning Company and if you don't
110:29 - like people in fringing don't see why
110:31 - you can't recreate but probably
110:33 - shouldn't post the disk images okay
110:36 - that's a good point okay so I think I'm
110:38 - going to remove those disk images from
110:41 - the repo
110:43 - um if anybody if anybody wants to try to
110:48 - I mean I guess I could do this now
110:49 - offline I just don't have I have a
110:51 - Windows computer right here so I can
110:52 - just do it myself but I'm assuming
110:54 - nobody did did anybody try extracting
110:57 - those disc images uh the link to the
111:00 - repo is pinned
111:02 - the link to the repo is pinned in the
111:04 - chat
111:05 - but let me just put it also in the
111:08 - Discord so uh where is the the organ
111:12 - Trail repo here it is
111:14 - should be pretty easy to find
111:17 - um and I'm gonna go to the Discord and
111:20 - I'm gonna go to links
111:22 - and I'll put it here so in the links
111:25 - Channel
111:26 - uh under live so uh uh by the way for
111:30 - those one thing I'll say is like I do
111:32 - sometimes so
111:37 - um
111:39 - Matt Baker just tuned in and said this
111:42 - just popped up as being live have I
111:44 - missed much
111:45 - so yes because I'm wrapping up and I'm
111:47 - finishing I gotta go Saturday night
111:49 - gotta have dinner make dinner and hang
111:51 - out with kids and
111:53 - I don't know do weekend family stuff but
111:56 - um the
111:58 - um if you want to be a person who knows
112:02 - when there will be a live stream in
112:04 - advance your two best paths are one
112:09 - subscribing to the YouTube channel and
112:10 - clicking the Bell thing you know that
112:13 - should notify you whenever I schedule a
112:15 - live stream in advance but uh your most
112:19 - reliable way is to be on Discord and
112:23 - subscribe to the notifications role so I
112:27 - believe the way that you do that is in
112:31 - the channel bot talk
112:34 - if you type in exclamation subscribe
112:41 - I've already subscribed so that just
112:43 - removed that role
112:45 - so I'm going to do it again
112:47 - that will give you the notifications
112:49 - role and that is the role that I tag
112:53 - whenever I am scheduling a live stream
112:57 - now sometimes I will tag at everyone uh
113:01 - but not usually that that's pretty rare
113:04 - I don't like to abuse the at everyone
113:06 - which notifies like you know everybody
113:08 - but if you want to opt into more
113:10 - notifications from me that's your best
113:12 - way of doing it the repo is pinned great
113:17 - um
113:18 - so so that's all I've got
113:21 - um so thank you Matt for your nice
113:22 - comment of saying thanks for the content
113:24 - I'm sorry this is you you will I don't I
113:26 - don't you know sometimes these archives
113:28 - are meaningful for people to watch back
113:30 - later uh sometimes it's really about
113:32 - being here present in the moment so you
113:34 - know certainly not required but you can
113:36 - go back your your main advantage to
113:39 - watching the archive is you could to
113:40 - exit and Skip through stuff and uh thank
113:43 - you to Kathy who has been helping write
113:45 - time codes so uh this is a huge shout
113:48 - out to Kathy like if you go to uh my
113:51 - last live stream
113:54 - um by the way one of the reasons why I'm
113:56 - much more excited to do everything on
113:58 - YouTube now I was excited about trying
114:00 - twitch because twitch has many many
114:02 - excellent features and uh and and for
114:05 - live streaming but I just really like
114:07 - the way now YouTube is organizing videos
114:09 - which is you know you can see here all
114:12 - of my video uploads you can find them
114:14 - right here shorts which I am now diving
114:17 - into
114:18 - for better or worse I've got it's a one
114:20 - month experiment might kill it after the
114:22 - experiment we'll see how that goes
114:23 - honestly they aren't getting a lot of a
114:25 - tremendous amount of traction which is
114:27 - fine but I am I'm getting some positive
114:29 - and some critical feedback
114:32 - um but uh the live streams are now
114:34 - organized under their own tab so you can
114:36 - go back and find all the live streams or
114:39 - you know this is the thing I really do
114:40 - want to organize better but I'm here to
114:42 - say thank you to Kathy because I don't
114:45 - know why this doesn't happen it must be
114:46 - it only happens when I'm logged into my
114:49 - account that the chapters don't show up
114:53 - let's go oh so hold on let me just I I'm
114:57 - going to quickly switch account and I'm
114:59 - going to switch to
115:01 - um I have access to the processing
115:02 - Foundation YouTube
115:05 - so I don't know why this happens but now
115:08 - they're there so one of the things you
115:10 - can do is uh thank you to Kathy who put
115:13 - time codes in so if you're interested in
115:16 - like learning about the coding trade
115:17 - website to talk about it here uh talk
115:20 - about the the recent coding challenge
115:21 - here curiosity stream this is you know
115:24 - the sponsor segment here and this is
115:26 - where I started the playthrough of the
115:27 - Oregon Trail and I'm in so much pain
115:30 - about the fact that my face
115:33 - uh if I skip to that
115:36 - like
115:39 - the whole time my face is right over
115:42 - there
115:43 - talking to the camera and I did not
115:46 - realize that I cropped it so apologies
115:47 - for that
115:49 - um so anyway so thank you to Kathy and
115:51 - you can so if you want you could go back
115:53 - and look at this yesterday and as soon
115:55 - as
115:56 - um I finish uh streaming today
116:00 - um this will also be an archive so yeah
116:02 - you know
116:04 - I have lots of mixed feelings about the
116:07 - uh the idea of our
116:08 - kind of like social media addictions and
116:11 - short form uh video uh you know which I
116:14 - do find quite entertaining and
116:15 - interesting in many ways I don't know
116:18 - where I fit into that world you know you
116:20 - can see I tried a few a while ago that
116:23 - were different and then these are three
116:24 - that I made very recently I'm working
116:26 - with a wonderful team
116:29 - um out of Brazil who's been helping me
116:30 - kind of with the sort of editing and
116:32 - production on these I almost think that
116:34 - one of the issues with these is that the
116:35 - production quality not not what I'm
116:37 - doing but their work it's almost like
116:39 - too good shorts have a are meant to have
116:42 - kind of this more informal quality to
116:44 - them anyway
116:46 - um
116:46 - I'm go I can't stop I'm going on and on
116:49 - uh if you post shorts regularly like one
116:51 - every day and it's supposed to help a
116:52 - lot with Channel growth yeah and I I'm
116:55 - I'm excited to have I want people to be
116:57 - excited and engaged with their
117:00 - creativity and their enthusiasm for
117:02 - coding and their enthusiasm for helping
117:05 - others with code in all the ways that
117:07 - are possible so I'm going to try it all
117:09 - live streaming making the videos the way
117:11 - that I do making shorts I got to grow
117:13 - with the times people can't just can't
117:15 - just coat ride on my
117:18 - Gorgon Trail and coattails so we'll see
117:22 - um more is coming out some of them will
117:24 - just be sort of silly but my goal with
117:26 - the shorts is to ultimately make
117:27 - informational ones that you can get
117:29 - quick tips out of that will spark your
117:31 - imagination or spark your day as well as
117:33 - by the way I'm going to feature people's
117:37 - the passenger Showcase in shorts so I
117:39 - think that's also something nice if you
117:41 - make something for the passenger
117:42 - showcase I can select it share it in a
117:44 - short and it's a nice uh it's a circle
117:46 - of life people the circle of life
117:50 - all right so I've got to go
117:54 - um thanks everybody for tuning in uh if
117:57 - you haven't been live streaming very
117:58 - much and all of a sudden I did
118:00 - two days after a one after another and
118:02 - who knows maybe I'll be back tomorrow or
118:03 - Monday uh it certainly won't be around
118:05 - most of next week uh there's the
118:07 - Thanksgiving holiday happening here
118:09 - um but
118:11 - um be on the lookout for shorts check in
118:14 - say hello and Discord
118:16 - um
118:17 - no new videos are uh coming but I do

118:24 - video gotta take a break from that
118:27 - um
118:28 - I love that you fell in love with Git
118:30 - and GitHub Slumber thanks for that
118:33 - um
118:34 - so yeah uh I'm letting this little track
118:37 - play it's got about two minutes on it
118:39 - any last questions or comments

118:53 - checking out this bundle deal
118:55 - [Music]
118:56 - um gonna start cleaning up and closing
118:59 - things here on my computer
119:03 - um midnight it's a good time
119:06 - the best way to do is to stream
119:09 - everything and cut shorts and highlights
119:10 - out of it that's certainly something I
119:13 - am
119:15 - that was kind of my original
119:17 - uh intention but
119:21 - I don't know that
119:24 - I'm complaining brain dead this is the
119:27 - you know how Cinderella turns into a
119:29 - pumpkin at midnight or whatever after
119:30 - two hours of streaming I cannot put
119:32 - words together
119:37 - all right
119:39 - um
119:40 - good night to Marcus
119:42 - uh come on say goodbye in the chat at
119:45 - least no no you don't do anything we
119:47 - should probably have left already this
119:48 - song is way too long but I'm committed
119:50 - to the bit of letting it play itself out
119:52 - guess what what uh I'll read you some
119:55 - random numbers
119:57 - uh thank you see
119:59 - uh 88709 798-35-02268
120:04 - three four eight nine nine four three
120:06 - five seven six that's what I should
120:08 - really I should just make shorts where
120:10 - all I do is read random numbers
120:13 - that's a someday someday next sabbatical
120:16 - I'm gonna make the audiobook of a

Cleaned transcript:

thank you foreign foreign foreign oh my mic is on [Laughter] you know I didn't realize my mic wasn't muted because the uh these there we go I I computer crashed and the audio's not playing this is a professional operation here people [Laughter] well how's my audio folks I'm gonna mute my mic for a second and see if I can get the music going thank you foreign hi that's right welcome to a sort of popup surprise spur of the moment uh Saturday 409 p.m eastern time live stream of the coding train that's right it's me Dan your friendly neighborhood awkward internet personality live streaming on a Saturday afternoon uh with a lot of incredible unanticipated technical difficulties in getting this thing going um and uh so feeling more unprepared than I did 20 to 30 minutes ago when I decided I've got a moment to just run into the studio and turn the lights on and get this thing going because I started a project yesterday and to be honest uh what I mean by started a project yesterday is I talked about the idea of a project yesterday four two and a half hours and then or I or I talked about other things for about an hour and a half I talked about the idea for an hour and so I wanted to keep the momentum here I don't know that the idea he that I that it's my intention to build this entire project entirely while live streaming but I do feel it's important to kick it off and get it going if I um want to make it possible for the community the viewers like you at home to be able to contribute and participate uh it is 9 p.m 10 p.m 11 p.m everyone 2 A.M no one is there anyone in the chat who was on eastern time I would like to know maybe uh maybe it is earlier in the day is it morning for and like uh is it is it early afternoon for anybody early morning maybe somebody from Hawaii uh um and okay uh zdax wanted to help out true bolt asks hey Dan I have a question when will you make a video where you try to make Geometry Dash on an Apple II Plus I'm sorry to disappoint you but Eastern Daily Time represents says bill yeah um that doesn't sound super likely but not out of the realm of total possibility I think it's more likely if I were to attempt some kind of version of Geometry Dash as a coding challenge that would be happening right here on my trusty uh Apple Macintosh laptop computer um for any of you who are uh supporters on patreon or YouTube membership I've got the Discord chat I'm going to try to keep my eye on it today I'm not gonna run two simultaneous YouTube chat and YouTube q a so if you've got questions throw them in the live chat just know that I basically the way that I interact with the live chat is I kind of peer at it every once in a while and there are some people who have that wrench icon who are moderators who can hopefully help answer some questions and please try to stay on topic and be friendly and kind to each other uh uh um in the chat um it's a freckle pasta hair maybe Tetris Tetris Tetris is really really missing from the library of coding challenges on the coding train so let's um let me talk about two things one uh a correction time I don't know if these really count as Corrections wait a second what hold on hold on I had some really weird stuff going on here that I do not want to uh I messed up my okay I put the wrong I I charge the sound board iPad up and um but I had placed the wrong one in the place with the sound board we'll see if we have some sound later not that we really need it because today is a work day I don't have time to just mess around on a Saturday afternoon if if I'm not taking a nap or playing Monopoly with my children or cooking dinner I better be doing something productive right here I just I started with the nap and then realized oh that's not a good look naps are underrated for me just nothing like a good nap I um I'm getting some Sounds here getting some messages all right um just just bear with me I'm trying to get the sound board going uh oh no go go yes sound cue okay hold on it's happening people the iPad I couldn't charge yesterday is charged Trust oh oh no no no I don't need to do this right now just unplug from there not now not now not now not now not now this is not what I mean to be doing welcome to the coding train where I hook up all the technology of the coding train at the beginning of the live stream you know what they say you got to capture the audience's attention right there at the beginning which is why I usually read random numbers because that really captures the audience's attention well we're doing that today people that's happening if we can get this going just give me a second we're back baby um okay let's do it here um oh okay one eight six two five two three six seven four five three eight five zero three two eight two seven eight one six four seven eight zero eight two zero zero zero four two zero six three five five seven four four eight nine eight zero one four one seven four six two three six eight three nine four foreign all right and with that I think we really can begin today's episode of the coding train C all of that manic energy that frantic neuroticism it's all melted away I am here with you I am the soothing internet coding person who calms your nerves and helps you work through those for loops uh was that music too loud okay sorry uh you remember you know how I did we get a new um did it so did a new member just join did I miss that tie lie welcome to the coding train come on on board where you will receive your very own random number six seven two four one by the way you should everyone should know that I've spent um many a year talking about these custom uh laser etched train whistles that I am making uh as a a token and a pre of appreciation a fun treat to be sent in the mail to supporters and members of the coding train and it's really happening folks um but the the new the truth is uh doing them custom with a custom number and a custom unique random uh random walk has proved to have defeated me uh and so I am um I don't want to say Mass producing them because that's not exactly accurate but I'm just having a batch of about 50 of these made they're all identical they will be numbered but they all have the same algorithmic patterns on them from a few different coding challenges the coding train train and uh this is for I can't remember which level but the conductors or the engineers not um so stay tuned uh if you're not in the Discord uh everyone is welcome and should be in the Discord that's one of the things that I forgot to show yesterday that I wanted to I have three things three Corrections from yesterday um but uh for any of you who are members and are wondering what's happening with your train whistle or or your stickers so some of you are expecting stickers please um con into the uh Discord and make sure you tag me or station manager or any of the um the the folks who help out there in the Discord okay um uh Frank asks are you a professor uh well technically speaking I mean there is a place where you can find the word professor and my name in the same web page and on the deployment logs of a university but I don't know so at some point someone's gonna uh that's I don't know how much longer they're having to be able to keep that up but yes and in fact I am returning to teaching live and in person at NYU uh this spring so I've I've been on leave for a bit which has been wonderful uh I I prothomash great to see you there in the Discord chat um and I'm going back to teaching all right let's go through the corrections and I'm not a CS so for warrior great name um uh pravesh I'm sorry that you have covet I hope that this stream can bring you some little happiness and and help you feel better uh I hope you feel better soon um I'm not uh just to make a correction I am not a computer science Professor uh I do not um uh I am part I I uh I teach at the uh Tish School of the Arts in the interactive media department so um yeah um okay um let's go to Corrections Corrections so a couple things one is let's see I'm very excited that we'll be returning back to the um Apple II today uh and and trying to Port a project here one of the things that happened yesterday do you see my face how I'm talking to you I had cropped it in obs cropped the video in OBS right about here and I didn't realize that so I was in this position most of the stream talking to the camera while typing I didn't look and check the whole time yesterday's live stream you don't see my face so uh I think I fixed it just now let me know if that's the case we'll come back here in a bit that's correction number one uh crook um correction number two uh let's see look at this I fixed my curiosity stream Banner so I I literally have a mulligan here uh today yesterday's stream and today's stream is sponsored by curiositystream and the reason why I was so excited uh for this sponsorship and this collaboration is I recorded a new course um if we go to here and here uh I you know I apologies for those of you tuned in yesterday that this is a total repeat but I imagine there's quite a few uh uh new viewers today um if I go to nebula.tv uh Slash what is code uh nebula is a wonderful streaming service uh built by creators including myself and owned by creators um and if you kind of want if you like a certain set of interesting educational YouTubers I have a feeling you're gonna find most of them on nebula and you can watch all of their videos uh ad free um there's nebula first so a lot of videos get posted to nebula before they go on to YouTube there's lots of wonderful aspects of um of the uh the the site um if I'd like to go to feature and sort of see what's going on here um but um what I wanted to uh mention was classes there's all these wonderful classes one of which I don't let's see if mine is still up here in this like top uh row it doesn't look like it is but all these awesome ones are somewhere here we would find mine if we kept looking but uh what is code and so it used to be that this was a separate purchase that I mentioned on many uh previous um videos but now it just comes with nebula but the um the best way for you to get it is through the Curiosity stream bundle this is the cheapest way at least it's like a price hack so if you go to curiositystream.com choo choo Link in the description sign up for curiosity by the way you're getting thousands of curiosity Street documentaries I'm talking about nebula because that's where my clap my Apple II classes that you might be interested in because you're watching this um but you're you know curiosity stream is an incredible range of content as well so if you go to that link you'll get curiosity stream plus nebula for a full year for 14.79 for the entire year it's a bundle um it's like a little over a dollar a month and then if you uh come on classes uh just for a onetime fee of ten dollars you can upgrade to have classes or a one dollar a month so technically you could watch my class for one dollar extra if you watch it all for the same month I suppose I hope I think you would just once you're there you're going to realize there's so much other stuff you want but anyway so I just wanted to get that out of the way at the beginning of the live stream and correct that um I will I might mention that link again later if you've got any questions about that come to the Discord ask me um all right so that was those are two Corrections ah yes speaking of the Discord this is what I wanted to mention um the Discord so a lot of these things um are in uh my announcements on Discord which I'm showing you right now I talked about sure and I'm not going to go through all this other stuff but here's the links also to the Curiosity stream bundle and the nebula class but what I wanted to show you that I'm really excited about is that um our Discord the coding train Discord now has help forums so there's lots of fun Lively chatter of just people hanging out and talking about I don't know who coding train and there's a pets Channel which is my favorite Channel there's the introductions Channel which is actually truly my favorite Channel because I love hearing about where people are from and how they found the coding train and what they're interested in and their Hobbies I really want it to be a place for people just to enjoy meeting each other and hanging out in online space but one of the things that I feel like we were never able to successfully really do until I would say now it's really happening is be able to provide uh help uh oh Stefan from Germany hello um and I will catch you up name name I love that name name um we've never I've never really found the right tool for people to be able to ask for help and get help with their code as it relates to the coding trade so certainly this is not perfect but let's go take a look at it the help forums I um so you can see here now if you want help with your code you can create a forum post and most of these I'm noticing are like very active um maybe I'm just going to look through here to see there is one here that only has one comment so maybe that's one we'll take a look at here's another one with one comment so there's a few here's one with zero uh maybe we'll look at this one since it has zero but most of these are pretty active you can see that they're new um and so there's a lovely community of folks in here who are helping each other out with their code discussing coding problems I have to admit as you can see it says 24 new posts so I'm not able to be in there on a regular daily basis is answering a lot of questions not to mention the fact that I you know I'm an old man and I don't know very much anymore I mean I I want to thank just speaking of which I want to give a shout out to um F terminal ft Irmo who watched the live stream yesterday and just opened this total pull request to help optimize the build of the coding trade website Gatsby and I'm looking at this and be like I don't know how any of this works I don't understand it somebody asked a question in the Forum about this I'd be like I don't know I gotta ask a question too because I don't know how to do any of this so I'm just thrilled for the community who's been so generous and helpful with the website who's being so generous and helpful with these um uh uh Forum posts and I just want to say thank you and let everyone know about this um so um did I name the stream the coding Trail on purpose yes no nobody it's I meant for it to be but I don't remember doing that yes okay so I kind of wanted to look let's let's I don't have a ton of time and I I it's already been a half an hour and I want to really begin this project in earnest um and welcome to Simon uh one of coding Train's most loyal viewers and I I always think of Simon when I say that because I think once I said Royal by accident like a little Freudian slip if you will and I think Simon truly is a royal viewer of the Kodak train okay um let's look at this one it has one comment and I'm gonna open this wider so I can see it better look at all this look at look at look at me uh messing with these windows okay oops ah no okay no ah it's okay uh I haven't I have haven't completed typing everything but until here it is working the way it should uh oh okay so so one thing I would say is to mushy um is that I'm not sure exactly what you're asking about so one thing that I would say like if you're posting your code questions that could be helpful and I know for many of you uh English is not your first language and so that is a big challenge to overcome if you're in a you know englishcentric uh Discord server um so I would love to think about ways to make it friendlier more accessible for a global audience but um but I'm not so thinking about what the question is also um sometimes including a screenshot so if this code is not working the way you think it should and you have an image of what it the output is currently doing as well as an image of what you think it should look like that can be helpful um posting the code is always excellent a couple notes about this in Discord is uh if I do this that's a way of noting that this is going to be uh um pre what's that not forgetting what preformatted text what does the pre stand for I forget um pre um but uh which will look like this but um if you want to syntax highlight it you can add a JavaScript or a different language and you can see now it's syntax highlighted so that's always something I recommend when you're posting your code but often even better with the P5 web editor uh just posting a link to the code in the web editor is a really good good way of when you're asking for help because um then you know otherwise I'm sitting here and I'm kind of copying and pasting it um and I would say like uh Snippets are better in here but a huge block of code is very hard to parse and read inside of Discord so let's take a look and see if we can help it all um so I can see I see that this looks like something and then uh the poster mushy maybe is expecting it to look like this ah you know what I know what it is okay so let's take a look let's see if we can fix this um so fascinating so first of all I'm seeing dots here I was expecting to see text oh they're points okay well that's interesting so this is also doing something totally different than what I see here so this I think is going to Merit some more time this is pretty cool though well this would be a great coding challenge uh it looks like they tried to take this code and then um ah and then I'm kind of Fork it not for fork it just sort of adapt it and you can see some JavaScript code so I I I think this is perhaps not um unfortunately this is not a great question for me to pursue right here uh I'll try to return to this if somebody can remind me or tag Me Maybe um in this thread later not right now because I won't that the notification will come in I'll see you later but if anybody wants to kind of help maybe we can take it upon ourselves as a community to see um if we can get this working I love the idea of doing this as a uh coding challenge um itself to create an ASCII rendered donut that's pretty cool okay so I always wanted to ask this is a great question from Stefan uh are we just talking about processing Java JavaScript or can we ask about anything coding related Swift swift UI Swift playground okay so great question the the short answer is the the Discord and the community is not limited to processing Java JavaScript and p5.js definitely not any question uh related to the coding train World which encompasses all uh code work and Beyond really is welcome here um in the Discord um so certainly if you have questions about Swift swift playgrounds all these things opening a question here there is a a tagging system so you probably would want to tag other uh tag it as other if you're if you think it makes sense to include something like Swift in this list then uh I would suggest pinging a station at station manager the moderation team who sort of handles and curates this stuff but I think other is pretty good catchall for other things I just think be aware that I uh prob you know I don't have an accounting of this I haven't done some deep dive into uh the sort of skills and the depths and skills in the community but probably there are fewer people who are around in the Discord who know about these things but they may be interested and would love to take a look and participate so yes please all topics related to code and the universe of creativity and design and interactive media and working with computers are all welcome here um ah so Starkey asks a great question I just joined the Discord how come I don't have the help and questions tab on it so most likely if you just joined the Discord all you see is read me um and so um I know that there are newer systems for how Discord can onboard people and Kobe I believe is working on that but you you're you probably have a role called waiting to board let me see if I can find you um so a whole lot of people just joined uh Starkey 3000 let's see uh Starkey 3000 so yeah if I look at you Starkey I see that you have this waiting to board roll and so I could actually manually remove that and every it would unlock everything but what you need to do is read through this uh readme which gives you all of the pertinent information about you know what the different channels are for uh what the different roles are and they need to actually update some of these I realized because Psy has moved on to uh bigger and better things um and so um um but um uh and thank you to CJ who helped you would a lot of this is pulled from the coding Gardens Discord but once you uh react to the with an emoji to the code of conduct sort of accepting the code of conduct of the community um then it should unlock all the channels for you you won't see um some of uh these channels that are for uh supporters only I know you can't even see this right now because it's I'd have to move it over and then just as a key thing as I often post links to things um here and check and just check the announcements recently because I've posted a lot of stuff there okay uh uh saw and everyone uh wish Simon well who has uh broken his arm hopefully it's healing smoothly uh um all right so yes uh prothomash is saying uh Daniel starts coding within 40 minutes of starting the stream challenge impossible mode like can we make that happen yes we got four minutes all right so um let's get going what is the work of today and I don't expect to get super far with this which is why I probably need to ultimately work on this not while streaming or do a more sort of ambient stream but let's go to repositories and let's go to um oh whoops oh did I wait a second help oh you know what I did I didn't realize that yesterday I put the repository under shiftman not coding train so that's let's fix that speaking of Corrections settings uh no um uh settings um uh it's usually here somewhere transfer transfer the ownership um sorry I can barely see my screen uh coding train this is the worst this is what I always do it says type this to uh confirm because it really wants to make sure you really want to do it and I always just copy paste it uh okay so uh now I've gotta find my twofactor code um so please bear with me look I can play music now though no no not now foreign so let's go ahead and clone this repo sure we'll also install the item update why not ah we got some folks from Sweden in the house um guess what I'm sorry I missed you but I was in Sweden over the summer I was had the opportunity to visit your lovely city of Stockholm um I had an incredible time I know this is probably very like touristy like the sort of like obvious tourist thing but the Vasa Museum was incredible I also really enjoyed the Abba you see him uh I had some lovely uh food some lovely beer some good coffee even had a really wonderful time there and um that was it was pretty brief but I was only in Stockholm so that was my only regret I was I'd love to list visit more of Sweden I would um one of my dreams is to go on a trip up as North as you can go up in northern Europe and see the Northern Lights maybe stay in one of those ice hotels I don't know maybe this is like me being like a sort of like really embarrassing American but um uh that's uh that's that sounds really cool to me okay um let's just put it on the desktop grab this repo uh open it up in vs code okay let's actually only open that repo up so we're gonna get the beginning of this going today um and let's also um let me merge this thank you to uh python coder unicorn who helped create this text file which is going to prove enormously um useful um for today's work incred enormously useful incredibly um useful um all right so let's bring this in and uh well it's okay sure we'll take a look at this great all right now what I would like to do wow so many people from Sweden that's really cool um the Discord invite on the website is outdated we're really working on this people so why does this keep happening we went through a whole round of this um so apologies for that please file a GitHub issue for the website uh noting that so we can fix it but yesterday I checked and if you go to thecodingtrain.com Discord uh thecodingtrain.com Discord that should take you to a valid invite I hope okay so let's move on over to the Apple II uh briefly um uh oh where's my button for that okay um okay we're gonna move over to the Apple II and I'm going to apologize in advance because those of you who are you the the Young and have all your faculties and wits about you which is not me my brain moves so slowly these days but my ears do not hear sounds above a certain frequency and this um this monitor emits a very high pitched wine it's an oldfashioned CRT Monitor and uh I should have set it up to put a low fat pass filter but I'm not so you might be hearing that apologies for that once I get back over the computer it does not transfer that far so this is actually all I wanted to do which is I wanted to have this Opening screen because this in many ways is the first thing that I would like to implement today during the live stream so I have this as a reference we can play it as necessary um and then I'm going to come so somebody asked somebody asked um and I and I could put the maybe what I'll do is just put in the top I don't know where but let's uh um video capture device um let's let's bring in a picture and picture of it oh that's the wrong one sorry everybody um uh sorry I should have had this prepared maybe this is unnecessary but I would like to I don't know why that I'm sorry about the um I'm sorry blue boo is anybody is uh if somebody who has access to um Discord invite URLs and could help with that I will I will deal with that in a moment um sorry uh Apple II this is what I'm looking for okay so let's move this up here in a place where I'm just gonna like leave it up here as a very small reference um so apologies about the Discord uh I don't know if Kobe is watching in particular who can help uh with that but um I will get that sorted um blue uh and so somebody remind me when the stream is wrapping up perhaps okay so and I guess probably makes more sense for me to just go over here but here's the real here's the real question this is the sixty four thousand dollar question do I want to do this entirely as canvas or do I want to create this as Dom elements and let me talk you through what I see as the pros and cons of each and um and actually what I'll do here is I'm really getting kind of ridiculous about this oh sorry everybody it's me with a giant green screen okay uh let's just put me here uh and uh chroma key that uh great okay so look at that tiny look at this giant Oregon Trail I want to be able to talk to you with this here I guess I could make myself a little bigger a little bit absurd okay so um pros and cons so for me I like the idea of doing this in canvas because it is more act it reflects the reality of this very low resolution pixel space right um Dom elements you know divs and all of that jazz paragraphs are all kind of the have all of these features for responsive design and uh the sort of modern capabilities of the web and if I want to create something kind of true to the look and feel of this game having a fixed canvas which doesn't mean I couldn't resize it and and alter the sort of Dimensions I think would be more true to the look and feel of it um the uh the disadvantage to doing canvas the downside is uh the text would be not selectable sort of viewable as part of like the source of the page um it would make inevitably I think we'd have some issues around accessibility although come to think of it this could be a really nice opportunity to investigate creating a canvas game that is accessible and what I mean by accessible is works with a screen reader um so Dom elements you know have builtin features to be able to be read to screen reader users um whereas canvas that you know there are capabilities that do that but it's a bigger challenge especially when something is highly visual or animated at a very fast you know frame rate but with this I wouldn't have that issue I just would have to build in some hooks to read the text on screen describe the images I kind of like this idea now canvas presents the most interesting challenge says bite spider which I like that the other thing I like I mean so I'm not I'm not doing this because this doesn't exist like let's look I I haven't uh Oregon Trail uh emulator like let's just see classicroad.com start this is like made with some like plugin I guess um blue okay I can't look at this it's all ads or whatever retro games so here's one I guess it's running in an actual emulator perhaps well this is a 1990 oh you can't see this this is a 1990 version of it wow that's cool so yeah so this is emulating the sort of like 1990 dos uh dos version of it let's see Oregon Trail JavaScript let's try that I'm just I should have researched this in advance a reimagining so somebody's uh six years ago did this oh dear so this looks very much like what I want to do already done this these are Dom elements because they're selectable oh interesting so I do quite like this and it has an interface and it has new images so this is kind of exactly what I want to build uh but I I still think you know I mean the point of this is not is the learning and the challenge of doing it um let's just like take a quick peek at the code just to sort of understand it yeah oh interesting yeah this is kind of what I imagine doing and is a lot of Dom element stuff so this this is a very clever design that I it sort of feels like it could easily be canvas and what is this font because I'm going to want to use a font like this um it is can I find it here I would think that it would show inherit I don't I don't see it in uh the font family vt323 yeah vt323 font ah yes so this could be a great font to use um so Kathy says I think you should update to modern times so I don't know if you mean the visual style of it or the content um so my goal for the so my goal for the project is to stay true to the visual style of it so that doesn't mean the interaction couldn't be a bit more clever and more fluid and there couldn't be some additional like fun animations but I I want it's important to me for the way I'm thinking about this project to and also just my own sort of like capabilities and keeping things constrained to keep the original visual design content wise the reason to do this ultimately is not to play the Oregon Trail but to have the coding Trail well I want to make it somewhat uh templatable so I'm imagining kind of like a big Json file that has all of the narration and the data and all the stuff in it so you could like basically write your own organ Trail Story retitle the game so that's content oh yeah so the content absolutely but right now I don't want to have to uh develop the content so it's easier for me to just use the precise content of the Oregon Trail and uh then once it's sort of up and running we can start to rewrite and redo the content that's kind of my thinking okay um Terminus font I'm afraid to like just look at this but I'm going to trust uh screenshots all right uh this is not showing me anything but oh cool ah yeah that's great yeah I think I used this font in uh I don't know if it was this font that much you used in the recent Apple II video okay so so that's the question that's a starting point um and I don't think I don't think that um and let me go back to here I don't think that any decision that I make right now that I'm going to be so far along in the project that we couldn't switch gears and change it to Dom um but that's kind of what I'm thinking let me put up a poll yeah famously I almost I never do what the audience says in the poll so in fact I have some like Affliction which is to do the opposite um Oregon Trail uh canvas um so no matter what this is going to be canvas or it's going to be P5 and I should really do I should the reason why I have this other laptop here so I can create the poll like this and still talk to I look so weird when I'm over here like off in Never Never Land but I have a computer over here that's what you can't see Canvas OR Dom curious to see the thing that I worry about doing Dom that um uh is that everyone's going to complain that I'm using the P5 Dom Library which is a little bit wonky but um so I'm kind of interested in canvas to be honest that's what I'm leaning towards starting today and while that poll is going let's at least start to create a bit of a framework here what image do we get oh thank you for this yeah I choose Dom so you do it in campus right no no don't try to game the system to Dom but probably still didn't canvas and he wrote canvas I'll just be more clear about where I'm starting I I fully uh expect that I I think there's a a a a a significant chance definitely a nonzero chance that I start with canvas and change to Dom later or kind of use canvas but put Dom uh I could also uh you know what makes sense is actually to have um fixed position Dom elements over the canvas but I'm getting ahead of myself here I haven't even like started this I got we got to get going so I'm going to make a uh file called um index.html I'm going to make a file called sketch.js and I don't know what's going on here should not be in the image directory this should index.html so let's move that let's go to the web editor and let's just grab this and let's go to the web I don't need to grab anything for oh yeah so and let's take a look here oh you're not seeing me again I'm sorry ah see this is why I shouldn't go to that screen because I'm going to forget so sorry about that it it is I did correct it just now um it would be interesting to try to do this in basic and actually what I should do is I should grab the code for it do I have a all right well one step at a time uh canvas is winning uh yes to be clear again I'm not going to use the original Graphics the content is entirely going to change the look and feel of it should be the same the whatever new graphics will be pixelated in the same style as the old Graphics that's the idea um okay um so let's but create a style dot CSS in case we're going to need that um let's add the ubiquitous setup and draw whoops and let's just try um let's try this font just because it's a Google font so I should be able to load it easily how do I okay wait wait wait wait I know how to do this I don't want to download it isn't there a way here to get the um like that like it should give me like the CSS for select yeah so I think I can do this right if I put this I'm just curious right I think if I for any font and I'm sorry this is uh small I think if I copy this put this in the HTML and then now why did this not format I don't know but I'm going to manually do it and then uh and then I think if I were to go into style and do body and again we're gonna I have to be more specific about this at some point and grab this press start to P looks like a 8bit font ah oh and I'm seeing some oh no stop um input handling is much easier doing HTML instead yeah I know that input handling is much easier doing HTML but so there's a comment here which is saying input handling is much easier to do an HTML instead of in canvas but you have to remember whoa this was not written with can't with uh HTML dominant complex input in mind like there's very little input that I need which number on the keyboard did the person press did they say yes or no what number did they enter so uh writing a little engine to get that basic amount of input from the user the player is not going to be is it's going to be work but that's kind of an interesting Challenge and I think a throwback to how these systems were originally done but anyway so yeah I just want to get a sort of hello world thing going here um so I'm going to say text align Center Center let's do a create canvas 640 so the Apple II is 280 by 192 I believe is that right yeah 280 so let's multiply that by two just to sort of like double the resolution and uh let's say um text the Oregon Trail width divided by two height divided by two put that in the center text size let's try like 64 and fill of 250 ah I gotta turn off that autocomplete and no stroke so you've never seen P5 before friendly um uh creative coding environment for drawing into canvas with a lot of other hooks with a very nice API okay so let's go to oh and let me um run a little server here in fact let me actually uh use live server and I I could run a server through vs code okay there we go thank you everybody uh thank you thank you we are done we're done we're done we're done yeah okay uh all right uh the the um what was Simon's great idea in the chat I missed it Trail okay so why didn't my font work um so that would be oh did I take no I mean this shouldn't matter the order right oh you know why canvas is not going to pick up the fonts interesting uh so how do I this is an interesting question P5 load font take a look so it could be a an asset that's if I want to load it as a file but that's not what I want to do unless I can put the URL um text font but what would happen if I whoops text font let's see and again I'm going to use a diff I'm not saying this is the font I'm going to use I just wanted to sort of see oh there we go okay that worked okay awesome um great so we've got this um clearly not exactly the same uh font but something close to this font here pretty interesting all right so we've begun so let's think now um a bit more holistically about this project and I'm going to check the time I'm um I think I'm probably going to wrap up around 5 30 which is a half an hour from now so again my this this really would if I'm really going to build this we'd need like an allday stream uh yeah so making a CLI and node would be super fun like that's a really fun idea a fun project but um not going to make it as easily sort of playable or usable for a wider audience as it would be if it's just on the web um okay um so let's take a look at what uh python unicorn coder had uh offered so python unicorn encoder I don't know whether they were able to find this or just took notes but this is awesome because it's given us a really nice long script for the whole uh game but I think what would be useful to do as an exercise and I'm kind of doing this without a lot of um planning or note taking but I I would like I'm just going to call it data dot let's call it game.json I guess maybe what I would like is to create a data file I'm calling it game.json which stores all of the metadata for the game so and there are references up here I can't see this at all so like for example let's just put it to there so for example I and I I think we're good it's going to need a lot of work but just to start like imagine if I had a um let's just think about this for a second like a array called choices and in those choices would be the options like travel the trail uh learn about the trail uh see the Oregon see the organ top ten um and turn sound off turn sound off so the idea here zdax that is you great so the idea here is that for any given sort of like page of the game part of the game the story The Choices the story and the data are all inside of this um Json file so what I want to do is like play through the game a little bit so let's imagine I I think what I'm going to need is um like we'll call this we're gonna have to do this a little bit on the fly like uh intro which is an object which has the choices the prompt which might be the same for everything what is your choice and then like you know maybe it would have a you know image you could imagine there being like like what was this there's this like imagine if what I did was crop this image and only kept the top let's try that just just as a sort of exercise uh okay so again this is not I'm gonna really have to rethink the way um the source code to the original game was late says Joshua Walker thank you for that let's go look uh I missed a membership upgrade okay okay okay it's hard to keep track of everything no the Super Chat I see someone joined at the conductor level okay fine interrupt me someone who joined to the conductor level it's got to be a way for me to find out who you are welcome thank you for joining the coding trade at the conductor level ah it's Joe who gifted a membership thank you Joe I forgot that we have membership gifting that's a very very very much appreciated um Joe has been a wonderful new member of the coding train posting a lot in the Discord I owe you a reply to an excellent set of questions that you sent me that I've really been thinking about just I haven't had a chance to uh dig into it yet okay so let's do um let's call this title.png so imagining then there's going to be like title dot PNG so this is like kind of the idea that I'm thinking about um the intro is going to have a set of choices a prompt and a title card so we can so we can now go I just want to like go through and start playing the game so I'm going to go over and I gotta end this poll because it's blocking my view of the chat so oh no end poll um okay okay well sorry I I will I'm sorry for whatever I missed it's not showing on my screens I can only do what I can do okay um going to the Oregon Trail come join the Discord so I can say thank you okay yeah BB asked if Emma is Dan I I don't know I want to keep doing twit twitch and I would have normally done this in twitch but I was streaming yesterday on YouTube and I got the setup and then I thought I should continue if I go back and forth so I'm really lost so your help and thoughts and advice and I'm going over to there so um I'll be right there in a second I just apologies um okay um I'm going over now to here and so I think for right now what I'm going to do is I'm not going to bother to work through learn about the trail or see the Oregon top 10. I really have trouble pronouncing Oregon because I think there's a proper way to pronounce it I know it's incorrect to say Oregon that's definitely wrong but Oregon is that right I think I'm not looking at the chat right now so sorry I didn't bring my laptop over here but I'll be back over there in a second um travel the trail so if we go to travel the trail so now we need to do this screen so um so I don't know to what extent it's useful to do all this data entry but I'm going to go back I'm going to do this at least do this okay actually I'm going to skip this because now we kind of understand what I need to do for this just data entry um so let's just I'm gonna go ahead and do the banker again that's what I did yesterday just to kind of do that and see okay what is the first name of the wagon leader okay so we need a this is important we're going to need a um we're going to need I don't I'm going to call it game for right now and the I don't know what to call the people who ride the wagon oh DJ manga says or gen organ or again or again or again okay the Oregon Trail thank you DJ Mangus um so what are the people who ride the wagon so there will be an array with the people who are riding I mean I guess there's the do we need to keep the leader separate I don't call them passengers which would be an array so like for example if I entered my name you know yesterday we had choo choo this Dot and obviously this wouldn't be in the Json in advance because it would be empty it's just sort of like loaded and then these things would get filled in I'm not again I I haven't thought this through maybe we need a separate data structure like but I'm going to keep going with this because I'm figuring this out this time okay so that's the idea but let's leave it empty knowing that the idea is it for it to be filled in and uh let me go over to here so this would also need um this would be part of the story um so um I'm just gonna say uh a simple Dan uh this is what I did yesterday so again so one of the things that people could do today after the stream if this seems like a good direction is help um do the data entry for all of these different uh screens pages are these names correct yes um and then all right so then we need something for this screen with the text okay uh Okay so now we have uh the month that you're leaving so again this is just something to enter just like before so I'm not gonna go back and type this in I'm just going to put in April and this would be another page so money how much cash you have is very important so cash and then the through your inventory so um okay so let's go back and think so again I'm not so sure everything needs to be in this Json file or it's a matter of me just creating variables right because like the amount of money could be just its own variable but I think what I'd like to do right now is I'm kind of working this out is have everything be in here and so this would be um the amount of money you have so you can imagine like it's going to start with some amount then we would have an inventory which would be another object with properties like oxen and then the number so all these would start at zero like this would get filled in Oxen what were the other things a team of oxen clothing I know there's food and there was uh what else was there um recommend having a Json data structure to hold all the game State exactly that's what I'm hoping to do here um State machine we're definitely going to need a conductor right I mean certainly this should be the conductor but again I just I'm not I'm just going to use the language and the story of the Oregon the Oregon Trail right now food okay that computer is very far away let me make more sense when you do this with an emulator so before I leave I'm going to see if I can get the code um okay clothing and I don't think I switched the screen sorry about that um clothing food ammunition spare parts for the wagon food ammunition spare parts oh this would have made things easier if I just saw this okay so we've got oxen food clothing ammunition spare parts oxen clothing food ammunition uh spare parts now the prices I should also yeah what if I made a slide class um and uh would render and wait for input yeah so these are all great ideas I don't know how to organize doing this in a sort of collective way I think what I would love is for those of you who have the idea if you want to contribute and work on some of these features after today because I am going to wrap up pretty soon I'm not going to get much further is um is like file an issue uh with a sort of short description of what you want to try to implement um and then I can kind of like give you the thumbs up I will try to stay really like a close eye on this repo over the next week and then uh and then so people can also track and and don't have uh both people aren't kind of doing the same thing but I know it's this is tricky because the sort of foundation isn't really there yet game State and gang config text should be separate files though since one will be read only and one will be read write um yeah that makes a lot of sense that makes a lot of sense um so these should be also the price like the game state in a way I don't even need it to be a Json file like I'm not going to be I'm not really intending to implement this we might I would use local storage so I guess if I'm using local storage to save the game state so somebody could leave and come back to their browser that would make sense so all right I think what I need to do because I uh is start to wrap this up and file a bunch of issues with sort of some plans and people could I I might work on it knowing these plans um Okay so that's what I'm gonna do so I'm gonna put put a hold on this right now um yeah the money is 1600 right so this is the this is the disconnect right now the money is sixteen hundred dollars but that value doesn't go in here that value is listed with um okay so these are like what are um the Prof I would call them professions so I the professions are Banker um which gets sixteen hundred dollars there might be more to it so um so we like the name of the profession as the banker the money is 1600 right so when so this is why I'm mixing up the important details which was what I can't remember which um viewer just said um um and I have somebody by the way who a a foreign asked about the art um so I have somebody who is interested in helping do who specializes in pixel art and it was interested in helping create all the art so certainly if somebody's interested in that let me know um and I probably just use as placeholder I'm going to kind of like screenshot the actual art from the game and just put it in there but eventually the idea is to have updated new art um the profession also has an effect on score so right all of the details for each profession would go here I don't know if anybody knows off the top of the head what um what amount of money uh the farmer has I'm just gonna put zero in right now so this is really the game State and I think I should take this out here now because uh so let's do a game uh I'm gonna call this game data and I am going to do game state uh which would be this part of me actually wants to make this I'm going to do it this way I'm gonna do actually call it state.js so I'm gonna have a Javascript file which stores the state of the game in a variable so um the idea here is that the game state is not the data we're loading right it's ultimately there is a little bit of an issue here because the language here probably has to match in some way and maybe what the state the initial State like maybe it makes sense for the initial state to be part of the Json file I don't know see there's so many different ways I could take this and I that's why I'm interested in getting people's opinion of people just jumping in but the idea is that this is the current state of the game and it's empty when the game begins then when you select being a banker the amount of money that's tied to the banker would go into the your current money in the state of the game so um but I am just going to uh say let's just see if still loads uh let's do git add git commit uh starting the foundation for the game and I'm sorry you can't really see what I'm doing down here um uh get push well I didn't create another Branch but that's okay by the way if you forget to create another branch and you want to do a pull request I can push the main branch to a different branch on GitHub Itself by doing this uh live I'll just call it live stream two and then I'm going to open up a pull request here and um this is from today's live stream and if I go to YouTube and coding train I should presumably be able to find this uh right it might make sense to make it a class maybe the game State should be a class I like that idea so I'm just going to go ahead and merge it I mean I could leave it unmerged so people could comment on it but I think that's going to be more confusing so let's start by merge attempt failed oh I probably did it twice it has a conflict what is going on what just happened what how is this even possible what did I do okay fine let's do this uh uh let's do this get fetch uh get check out live stream two oh no I don't know what's going on here did I think I hit the merge button twice yeah oh so yeah I think I don't know what just happened did I push it to the wrong thing I have no idea what's going on this is very weird nobody knows I don't know what I just did so strange I'm just gonna close this pull request and just walk away slowly from this um one thing I want to do is add a git ignore file and put DS store in it and remove um I should really step I want to set this up with netlify as well remove git remove no get RN there we go uh uh great let's do this good okay uh do this okay so um great so oh all right States got to keep track of Health yeah everything everything so let me think here let let me start creating some issues um um um do I still have that yeah okay I'm gonna close this issue so I am now looking for in the chat or in I lost the Discord uh supporter chat uh Richard v d Veen thank you is the uh welcome to conductor so Richard if you're still watching I appreciate thank you for your support make sure you link your Discord account come and say hi and Discord um font for the title page okay great so uh um okay so fonts so no brainer uh Chris Sears who just suggested a font that'll work well anybody wants to pull request the font go for it so what are some things that are that people who are watching could do so one is create uh create class to store game state okay so that I welcome is does that make sense um uh yeah I don't rebase it's not for me that's that's very uh you know exciting and I'm sure it's very you know it's kind of like a big party when everyone's get rebasing but but for me I just merge um so what are some things just based on what we've seen today that you could imagine uh doing um that I should create issues for is what I'm looking for in the chat or maybe I should just go work on this more on my own and then come back to another live stream and and let you all know where I am um all right let's do create a class okay um let's see data create a class to store game State all right I'm just going to file that issue uh okay yes so the idea is using the text file so the text file just needs is exactly what we need just needed to be adapted into the Json format um okay adapt text file script into Json format that's something that somebody could work on potentially um another thing could be that I'm thinking of is render a slide maybe there's a better term but taking the data from um game data.json and rendering the text and and choices uh uh so like a framework a simple engine for uh user input so we need to we can use the P5 key press function to just kind of like keep track of user input um then I also want to um accessibility uh screen reader support for each game slide what's the you know game page page um so uh describe p5.js yeah we should be able to use this um uh um read prompts and describe imagery for screen readers p5s describe function might be enough um okay I meant to grab this URL here okay um all right right the shop right so you could use older each screen or slide can also accept input theme it you can use labels to Mark the tasks right all these are great suggestions um the shop interface is uh is its unique one is is kind of unique so like maybe there is a um you know what are list of possible classes so there are there's the um shop there's there's sort of like an interface slide class shop extends interface slide keyboard input class so again I'm kind of just making up stuff as I'm talking here you know if I were building this just all on my own I probably wouldn't be trying to architect it so much I just start like making the first page and then as I go on then I'd refactor a bit but um so uh so um so yeah so so and I'm not really worried about the visual design right now because that can be cleaned up what I would like is kind of like a core framework for the game just to like be able to start it with reduced amount of options play through a few pages um and that's kind of what I'm looking to do um okay so what else can I possibly do before I go here so people jump right in uh to comment file your own issues to propose things the ways uh you know make your uh look freaking there you are um and um uh we'll see I mean I guess I'm gonna work on this a bit this weekend um and over the course of next well week um what I wanted to do see if I have the tools for this okay so let me go over this one of the things I'm curious to see is if I don't know if this game itself the one that you're seeing here is actually um written uh in basic but I want to look at the disk image of the Oregon Trail game which I have on this um micro SD card and I can put it into here the only thing is I need a a card reader which I I have somewhere in this room ah found it so I'm coming back over here I also need a Windows computer which is not this one so I might uh love to get some help from from all from any of you who are watching here um okay so I'm going to put this in here put this here hopefully this is going to appear uh great perfect um Apple II stuff five and a quarter discs uh games so Oregon Trail one and two dot d o that's not a format that I'm used to seeing let's put these on the desktop um so one thing I'm curious about is first of all before I go is can I can I open will it support these do files let's see ah yes awesome so I'm you watching at home the version we're doing this version the 1985 Apple II version um you can play this so would it be weird for me to put in the repo these two files they're tiny files so I think it's fine I don't think they're I think they're they're my public domain so let me add uh let's go here so this is going to help everybody um so let's upload add a file upload files uh all right no all right let me just put them in let's create a branch um it's a couple things uh I'm gonna move some stuff around and put this in there it's a little silly but just in case just let's do some like file management here and let's create a folder called uh original and let's put these disk images there so if anybody you know if if we want to check uh look at the chat create an asset folder however there's a reason you don't usually find that version of alignment instead of the 1978 basic version I kind of I don't am I wrong to want to do this version I kind of like this version um so um so let's do this so get checkout uh get branch file management let's add the wait what happened here let's add the original disk uh 1985 Apple to disk images organize files okay um organizing files and adding original disk images for play at here okay now what I would like to do is this is the best version just not ever released to public domain interesting um thank you DJ Mangus okay so what I would like to do is I think what's the thing I think it's called Cider Apple II disk image cider press yeah so anybody who's watching on a Windows machine right now I'm pretty sure that this tool I know because I've used this and somebody helped me um with Soren who helped me with this um this tool should allow you me you to extract a disk image and convert it to raw files that are that you could open on your Windows computer or on a Mac so if anybody is watching right now who might be able to very quickly uh grab these two disk image files and open them with cider press and let me know if you've got the um uh uh let me know if you've got the um if you're able to access the data that's on these disks because I'm curious what's there is it some kind of you know binary assembly version of the game is there basic code that's running the game uh I wonder so I would love to I would be curious to know um but Gerald this so so now let me talk about one of the reasons why I'm doing this so I so I want to make a faithful version of the original to sort of like learn about it and kind of build this but um there is a podcast that I listen to uh Oregon Trail Rob and Akiva let's see if we can find this Rob and Akiva go on the Oregon Trail um this looks like the version that this is interesting is this the version that um cord on the computer oh they're playing this one so funny okay I'm gonna mute this so this podcast oh so I wonder if I this is the version that they played through and uh I have volunteered which looks very similar to the version that I played through on the Apple II this is a slightly later one so I don't know if um so this is a good question uh um which one to model ours after we should go with the Apple too because that's what I have and it's largely the same so that's the Dos version so unless somebody uh knows like you know like is I guess I'll ask this question is there anything from the Dos version We would like to incorporate again the story is really we could ignore um see uh dos Oregon Trail and I think this is it here right I think this is it yeah um no uh what happened to that lost that page where are we have lost here we go um so I I encourage you to check out the podcast watch that episode but I have volunteered to create a custom version of the game that uh um for their sequel to that episode where they played the Oregon Trail and the idea is that much like if you could imagine if we can make a version of the game that is like the story of the coding train with the coding Train characters and you're trying to journey to find your way to like the promised land of you know your code or whatever um then think of that what I would like to do is make the same idea for that this particular podcast resolve it's weird and fun inside jokes and characters and there's a lot of things going on there so um it's a port from the Apple II version basically the same game yeah that's what I think too so um so um so this is the trajectory here so if anybody would really is interested in being involved with this project I fully understand if you're not um uh then you know go carry on if you're interested you know even in just like a a small way follow the GitHub repo I'll probably do at least one more live stream maybe move these some of these twitch I don't know um uh and uh or if you would like to actually work on the implementation uh feel free to chime in on an issue uh but probably what would make sense is for us to organize a bit in a Discord um a channel in the coding train Discord so maybe I can set that up depending on the level of interest and who's interested so I'm going to keep going um and uh uh oh there's a there's a switch version of it that's interesting um so I'm gonna keep going with this I appreciate all of you for tuning in and watching this has been a couple hours uh close to two hours um and if in an Ideal World I would carve out a full day to just really like work on this uh maybe without like sort of talking through it even so maybe that would make sense for like a twitch stream to just kind of work on this with less um uh with just sort of like you know in a more ambient way and let people contribute um so what else do I want to say um before I go so um if you haven't I guess uh so first of all this is your first coding train live stream thanks for watching uh I've got a huge back catalog of stuff so enjoy if you if you like this you you could spend you know probably the next six months of your life watching all my videos I don't recommend that uh if you've never programmed before and want to get started learning um I have um go to thecodingtrain.com uh under tracks uh this is your the track for you the beginner programming with p5.js um I also want to encourage everybody to uh check out the sort of latest videos that I've been making about the um uh uh programming in basic on the Apple II which has kind of led me to this uh sort of well the the aligning with this Oregon Trail project um and I also want to encourage people uh to I'm just going to pick wave function collapse to if you're making things um based on videos that you're watching there is an entire way for you to submit your work that can be featured on the website itself uh there's a submission form you can also do it as a pull request and on the home page uh thanks to Kathy who's been helping with this uh we cycle in and out of different uh featured projects that are just up here on the home page of the coding train that are made by viewers just like you uh so I want to say that join the Discord thecodingtrain.com Discord does that still not work what's going on so I don't know what I'm doing wrong uh I'm sorry for those of you who have failed um uh failed to get into the Discord this should be like the easiest thing in the world hold on I'm gonna just do something right now on this other computer which is do invite edit invite link never No Limit generated invite link copy I am putting an invite link into the YouTube chat right now one that I just made I don't understand why my redirect is not working um but if you wanted to join the Discord and you weren't able to there you go just make sure that you read through the readme and it moves you react to the code of conduct it will unlock all the channels for you uh it's I would also recommend you don't need to do this but if you sync your if you do if you did sign up for YouTube membership you should sync your YouTube and Discord account there's like a setting there and Discord from your Integrations where you can authenticate to your YouTube account that will unlock further Badges and things for you um and then I created a permanent invite and we also have a vanity URL invite I don't know what's going on with that but regardless it's there right now um the other thing is um if you uh are interested in subscribing to nebula which is the uh streaming um service that I talked about um that is um built by creators many of which do a lot of educational videos and really interesting videos there are a amazing amount I want to look at Originals this is really what I mentioned there are an incredible amount of really fantastic original content that's only available on nebula um uh I talked about jet lag which is the show that I really like native the coconut is a really fun uh movie um I want to make a they have this series called working titles I'm hoping to make a working titles uh episode which will only be on nebula for um um uh this TV show Severance and there's you know there's an Android app there's an IOS app there's lots of ways um I think there's a Roku app that you can watch uh nebula videos so I uh really recommend um taking a look a lot of the animation stuff is really cool uh you know I'm a huge fan of all the science and engineering uh videos um so nebula but the reason why I'm mentioning it is nebula has nebula classes and um here one of the things one of the classes you'll find this is a great one by the way if you're interested in live streaming from luria Petrucci but is my class what is code and this previously was kind of an expensive purchase but the cheapest way for you to get it now is to go buy the Curiosity stream bundle so you get curiosity stream which is over a thousand documentaries and all of nebula together in one package at that URL for 14.79 for the entire year um and then that doesn't actually give you nebula classes but once you get access to nebula it's only one dollar a month more for nebula classes or ten dollars for the whole year so it's actually cheaper than your standard nebulous subscription to do the bundle plus addon so if you have questions about that you could join the Discord you can ask me about it you can contact I believe it's help nebula.tv so thank you just wanted to mention that uh sponsorship here at the end um and and that's the the latest I just want to read this comment from DJ Mangus it looks like that version the later ones is copyright The Learning Company and if you don't like people in fringing don't see why you can't recreate but probably shouldn't post the disk images okay that's a good point okay so I think I'm going to remove those disk images from the repo um if anybody if anybody wants to try to I mean I guess I could do this now offline I just don't have I have a Windows computer right here so I can just do it myself but I'm assuming nobody did did anybody try extracting those disc images uh the link to the repo is pinned the link to the repo is pinned in the chat but let me just put it also in the Discord so uh where is the the organ Trail repo here it is should be pretty easy to find um and I'm gonna go to the Discord and I'm gonna go to links and I'll put it here so in the links Channel uh under live so uh uh by the way for those one thing I'll say is like I do sometimes so um Matt Baker just tuned in and said this just popped up as being live have I missed much so yes because I'm wrapping up and I'm finishing I gotta go Saturday night gotta have dinner make dinner and hang out with kids and I don't know do weekend family stuff but um the um if you want to be a person who knows when there will be a live stream in advance your two best paths are one subscribing to the YouTube channel and clicking the Bell thing you know that should notify you whenever I schedule a live stream in advance but uh your most reliable way is to be on Discord and subscribe to the notifications role so I believe the way that you do that is in the channel bot talk if you type in exclamation subscribe I've already subscribed so that just removed that role so I'm going to do it again that will give you the notifications role and that is the role that I tag whenever I am scheduling a live stream now sometimes I will tag at everyone uh but not usually that that's pretty rare I don't like to abuse the at everyone which notifies like you know everybody but if you want to opt into more notifications from me that's your best way of doing it the repo is pinned great um so so that's all I've got um so thank you Matt for your nice comment of saying thanks for the content I'm sorry this is you you will I don't I don't you know sometimes these archives are meaningful for people to watch back later uh sometimes it's really about being here present in the moment so you know certainly not required but you can go back your your main advantage to watching the archive is you could to exit and Skip through stuff and uh thank you to Kathy who has been helping write time codes so uh this is a huge shout out to Kathy like if you go to uh my last live stream um by the way one of the reasons why I'm much more excited to do everything on YouTube now I was excited about trying twitch because twitch has many many excellent features and uh and and for live streaming but I just really like the way now YouTube is organizing videos which is you know you can see here all of my video uploads you can find them right here shorts which I am now diving into for better or worse I've got it's a one month experiment might kill it after the experiment we'll see how that goes honestly they aren't getting a lot of a tremendous amount of traction which is fine but I am I'm getting some positive and some critical feedback um but uh the live streams are now organized under their own tab so you can go back and find all the live streams or you know this is the thing I really do want to organize better but I'm here to say thank you to Kathy because I don't know why this doesn't happen it must be it only happens when I'm logged into my account that the chapters don't show up let's go oh so hold on let me just I I'm going to quickly switch account and I'm going to switch to um I have access to the processing Foundation YouTube so I don't know why this happens but now they're there so one of the things you can do is uh thank you to Kathy who put time codes in so if you're interested in like learning about the coding trade website to talk about it here uh talk about the the recent coding challenge here curiosity stream this is you know the sponsor segment here and this is where I started the playthrough of the Oregon Trail and I'm in so much pain about the fact that my face uh if I skip to that like the whole time my face is right over there talking to the camera and I did not realize that I cropped it so apologies for that um so anyway so thank you to Kathy and you can so if you want you could go back and look at this yesterday and as soon as um I finish uh streaming today um this will also be an archive so yeah you know I have lots of mixed feelings about the uh the idea of our kind of like social media addictions and short form uh video uh you know which I do find quite entertaining and interesting in many ways I don't know where I fit into that world you know you can see I tried a few a while ago that were different and then these are three that I made very recently I'm working with a wonderful team um out of Brazil who's been helping me kind of with the sort of editing and production on these I almost think that one of the issues with these is that the production quality not not what I'm doing but their work it's almost like too good shorts have a are meant to have kind of this more informal quality to them anyway um I'm go I can't stop I'm going on and on uh if you post shorts regularly like one every day and it's supposed to help a lot with Channel growth yeah and I I'm I'm excited to have I want people to be excited and engaged with their creativity and their enthusiasm for coding and their enthusiasm for helping others with code in all the ways that are possible so I'm going to try it all live streaming making the videos the way that I do making shorts I got to grow with the times people can't just can't just coat ride on my Gorgon Trail and coattails so we'll see um more is coming out some of them will just be sort of silly but my goal with the shorts is to ultimately make informational ones that you can get quick tips out of that will spark your imagination or spark your day as well as by the way I'm going to feature people's the passenger Showcase in shorts so I think that's also something nice if you make something for the passenger showcase I can select it share it in a short and it's a nice uh it's a circle of life people the circle of life all right so I've got to go um thanks everybody for tuning in uh if you haven't been live streaming very much and all of a sudden I did two days after a one after another and who knows maybe I'll be back tomorrow or Monday uh it certainly won't be around most of next week uh there's the Thanksgiving holiday happening here um but um be on the lookout for shorts check in say hello and Discord um no new videos are uh coming but I do hope to record some more uh whatever I do next probably won't be an apple II video gotta take a break from that um I love that you fell in love with Git and GitHub Slumber thanks for that um so yeah uh I'm letting this little track play it's got about two minutes on it any last questions or comments um please let me know in the chat as I start to close things down here I'll leave this banner up for any of you who might be interested still in checking out this bundle deal um gonna start cleaning up and closing things here on my computer um midnight it's a good time the best way to do is to stream everything and cut shorts and highlights out of it that's certainly something I am that was kind of my original uh intention but I don't know that I'm complaining brain dead this is the you know how Cinderella turns into a pumpkin at midnight or whatever after two hours of streaming I cannot put words together all right um good night to Marcus uh come on say goodbye in the chat at least no no you don't do anything we should probably have left already this song is way too long but I'm committed to the bit of letting it play itself out guess what what uh I'll read you some random numbers uh thank you see uh 88709 7983502268 three four eight nine nine four three five seven six that's what I should really I should just make shorts where all I do is read random numbers that's a someday someday next sabbatical I'm gonna make the audiobook of a million random digits that's all that I spent the whole year just reading all of the digits snail from Brazil good night Daniel good night Finn good night Michelle good night goodbye Matt Parker good night Lucas good night everyone's saying good night now because you're you're 30 seconds behind me appreciate you all and I'll see you next time on the coding train as always bye everybody this Dot I'm sorry Mark Rogers that you made it just at the end this stop I agree this dot this dot this Dot that it's late for most of you and that that wasn't the best way that wasn't the best way to end the coding train this will be better I was to frantic manic energy that this thought so foreign to random number ASMR with the coding train 99080 88 992118001 eight eight six nine one five eight four two five minutes and 45 seconds left I bet you everybody left is there anybody still watching this is great you're the true fans you're the true fans the ones who have stayed I have no idea what this sounds like I hope it's not terrible four eight five seven zero five three five seven nine six four seven oh three nine
