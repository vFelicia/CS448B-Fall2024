00:00 - hello welcome to part 3 of my Plinko
00:04 - challenge now one thing you might note
00:05 - is that so my plan here in part 3 is to
00:08 - work on sound but actually I'm not going
00:11 - to get the sound probably just in this
00:12 - part 3 now I'll get back to that in a
00:14 - second because I have some improvements
00:15 - I want to make number one you'll notice
00:17 - right now every single Plinko particle
00:20 - is following the exact same path so the
00:24 - whole point of Plinko is that well one
00:27 - of the main points of Plinko is that you
00:28 - should be a 50% chance of it either
00:30 - going to the left or to the right but it
00:33 - never goes to the right it only goes to
00:34 - the lab so let's look at a way that we
00:36 - might change that so there's a lot of
00:38 - ways we could change that week the
00:39 - member we're making these matter jeaious
00:41 - bodies and those bodies have a velocity
00:44 - we give it like a slightly initial
00:46 - velocity in a different direction or
00:47 - something what I'm going to do is I'm
00:48 - just going to like randomly offset it
00:50 - slightly to the left or the right which
00:52 - will probably do the trick so if I go
00:54 - into the particle object I can write
00:58 - here each particle is getting an X&Y
01:01 - location where it starts so it probably
01:04 - might make sense to go and actually
01:06 - alter the way the explication is set but
01:09 - just as a quick test right now I'm going
01:13 - to just say let's just oh let's just
01:16 - whatever X comes in randomly offset it a
01:19 - little bit to the left or the right with
01:20 - a random number so let's do that now
01:23 - look at that it went to the left that
01:25 - went to the left
01:26 - it went so left I must have done
01:28 - something wrong did I not statement oh I
01:30 - didn't save it let's try it again
01:32 - let's the left way to the right so now
01:36 - you can see whether it's really 50/50 is
01:38 - this exactly accurate sure you could
01:40 - improve on this idea but now we've at
01:42 - least got something happening kind of
01:44 - differently now distinct the other thing
01:45 - that I want to do here though is that
01:48 - really
01:49 - Plinko Plinko balls please Plinko
01:54 - particles that are falling down right
01:56 - now they're kind of bouncing out in a
01:57 - kind of crazy way and I really want to
01:59 - see them pick this one and then this or
02:02 - this one and then this or this one I
02:03 - really want
02:04 - to have that consistent pass or their
02:06 - 50/50 going one way or the other not
02:08 - sort of bouncing far off to the right or
02:10 - left just for the sake of argument here
02:12 - so one way that I might be able to
02:13 - achieve that is by playing with the size
02:15 - of the pegs really simple change so I'm
02:17 - going to go into the pegs are in this
02:20 - Plinko object and I'm going to just
02:22 - change these to being white also and I
02:24 - am going to what am I going to do I'm
02:27 - going to change their size from where do
02:30 - I create a create seven sketch - yes I'm
02:32 - looking in the wrong place where I set
02:34 - them to just uh where do I make them
02:38 - right here for so let's give them a size
02:41 - a radius out of four but let's try
02:43 - sixteen and there we go so you can look
02:47 - at that it listed right on the top so
02:50 - you can see now they've really got to
02:51 - make a decision as to whether to go left
02:53 - or right at each and every moment and
02:55 - just to see how this plays out and let's
02:59 - do a couple things number one is let me
03:00 - make them a little bit darker so we see
03:02 - them as slightly different actually and
03:05 - then let me let me drop them more often
03:10 - so instead of every 60 frames let's try
03:14 - drawing them every twenty frames and
03:17 - let's see now we could sort of see
03:19 - what's going on here so we can really
03:23 - see this has a bit more of quality now I
03:25 - think I probably would want to play with
03:26 - the friction and play with the
03:28 - restitution either to make it a you know
03:31 - slippery ER or more or less bouncy just
03:35 - out of curiosity let's try on let's try
03:37 - messing with the friction for a second
03:38 - so if I go to the Plinko of the Plinko
03:41 - aren't you sent to a friction of zero
03:43 - the particles are set to a friction of
03:44 - zero so that's interesting so I don't
03:46 - know I'll let you guys I think I'm a
03:49 - mess around was kind of how how how some
03:52 - of these physics settings will will
03:56 - alter it and you can be kind of take
03:58 - your own creative take out like you can
03:59 - see now if we let this run for a little
04:01 - while it's going to most of these we're
04:03 - going to see that a bell curve of most
04:06 - of them falling in the center with every
04:07 - once in a while getting one falling out
04:09 - tilt to the edge so now let me I'm going
04:15 - to let this run for all we'll come back
04:16 - to look at it let's just
04:18 - add color to it as well because we
04:19 - should have rainbow colored Plinko
04:23 - things so I'm going to I'm going to add
04:28 - a variable I'm going to use HSB mode for
04:31 - the color first let me just so HSB mode
04:34 - is a way of defining color that is in a
04:37 - different way from RGB so in p5 I can
04:41 - say let me add color mode HSB to set up
04:47 - and let me hit refresh ah
04:50 - so we can see some of the color is off
04:52 - now because what I want to do is
04:54 - actually just set the HSV color you want
04:57 - to make it black so brightness right now
04:58 - brightness no saturation in some hue and
05:01 - so now I have a black background and I'm
05:04 - going to leave the I'll leave the Plinko
05:06 - the peg does white for right now that's
05:07 - fine so now that I have the particles
05:11 - have I can add a variable for each
05:14 - particle called hue and I can make a
05:16 - random Q between 0 and 360 so the
05:19 - default range for Q is 0 to 360 because
05:21 - the hues are like on a color wheel
05:23 - between 0 and 360 degrees and then here
05:27 - we go I could just say fill this dock
05:29 - you missus disgust you and I'm spelling
05:34 - q hu for no reason I'm going to call it
05:36 - Q because that's actually how it's
05:38 - spelled this Q and then I am going to
05:43 - just give it a saturation of 255 and a
05:45 - brightness of 255 and here we go
05:48 - so now we've got all I lost my I was I
05:51 - was waiting to see how much it fills up
05:53 - so now I have to talk for a little bit
05:54 - although what what I'm going to do now
05:56 - is have a little edit point in this
05:57 - video I'm going to take a little nap we
05:59 - were asleep and when I wake up a lot of
06:02 - the Plinko I'll wake up from my dream
06:04 - where I'll be dreaming up San Diego
06:08 - sounds nice sometimes be hurt and I'll
06:09 - wake up and see how many where they are
06:11 - good night okay hello I'm awake look
06:17 - okay so I still own that and when I woke
06:19 - up and told my fling co-simulation out
06:22 - of my oven because I precooked it for
06:24 - this code cooking show up if
06:26 - you could see that we are getting this
06:28 - nice kind of bell curve where most of
06:31 - the particles fall into the center and
06:33 - once we only get lucky in one falls
06:34 - outside now they're filling it up too
06:36 - much and strange things will happen but
06:37 - that's it actually one thing I wanted to
06:39 - sort of play with actually before I go
06:40 - onto the next video is I got a
06:42 - suggestion from somebody in a comment
06:45 - sub warehouse two prizes that I should
06:47 - consider of playing with the density of
06:50 - the particles in order to affect their
06:52 - motion as well as the time step variable
06:54 - so one thing let's just drive before I
06:56 - go is in the particle one of the options
07:00 - I can set here is density and let me go
07:03 - to a browser here I'm already in a
07:04 - browser and I'm going to go to the
07:06 - matter KS website I'm going to go under
07:09 - documentation and I want to look under
07:12 - body and I want to look for density so
07:15 - density a number that define the density
07:18 - of the body that is mass per unit area
07:20 - if you pass by density robotica ID
07:22 - create blah blah blah this is generally
07:24 - preferable to simply setting the mass
07:25 - and allows for a more intuitive
07:27 - definition of material what's the range
07:29 - Oh default 0.001 so that's the default
07:34 - density so let's see what happens if I
07:38 - give them a much higher density and
07:40 - let's just do something rather extreme
07:41 - like one and I'll go back to my code so
07:47 - I don't know if this looks particularly
07:49 - different to you but this might give
07:51 - them kind of a weightier feel to them in
07:53 - terms of how they interact and work with
07:55 - each other let me just make sure that
07:58 - that those values are actually in there
08:00 - so under the body whoops I should see
08:03 - density somewhere as one okay so that
08:06 - value is in there I can't precisely
08:08 - usually see the difference but this is
08:10 - something that you could use to give to
08:12 - try to experiment with different
08:14 - qualities of different materials oh and
08:16 - you really can see maybe that they're a
08:18 - little they're a little heavier when
08:19 - they land less less bouncy I'm not sure
08:20 - if I'm maybe who to speculate imagining
08:22 - that the other thing that I want to do
08:23 - is really work with the time step to be
08:26 - a bit more consistent about this
08:27 - so under engine the function that I'm
08:31 - using is to update so you can see a
08:37 - update
08:39 - Delta Delta is the time step right the
08:42 - value of the newest innovation forward
08:46 - in time by Delta milliseconds so if you
08:49 - think about it what is the default Delta
08:52 - Oh sixteen point sixteen point six six
08:56 - six six milliseconds that must be the
08:58 - default so I'm going to go in sketch a s
09:01 - and what I want to do is look for in
09:04 - draw where I call engine update so I'm
09:08 - going to just pass in sixteen point six
09:11 - six six so this should now behave
09:13 - exactly the same way so this should look
09:17 - no different but if I make the time step
09:21 - much smaller like one point six whoa we
09:27 - get some like very strange behavior
09:31 - because oh they're moving so so slowly
09:33 - I'm creating particles very often but
09:36 - that time step is so small but I could
09:38 - make the time step much larger like ten
09:42 - times larger and now you can see look
09:44 - how fast they're moving through the
09:46 - simulation so this is also something
09:48 - that I can kind of play with in terms of
09:51 - you know if I were to make a much subtle
09:52 - by just kind of like doubling the time
09:54 - step you can see kind of has the feeling
09:56 - of moving much more quickly but that's
09:59 - simply because for each frame of
10:01 - animation I'm moving further ahead in
10:04 - time so really what you want to put in
10:06 - there it depends on what your frame rate
10:07 - is and what the feeling is and you know
10:09 - are you getting errors can you correct
10:11 - for those errors but this is another
10:12 - thing that you can see to play with now
10:14 - here's the fix Oh 1000 divided by 60
10:16 - okay Alka thank you thank you for
10:18 - pointing this out so why is that number
10:20 - one why is that number sixteen point six
10:22 - six six because um because matter digest
10:28 - is assuming a frame rate of 60 frames
10:30 - per second so let's actually look at we
10:33 - could be kind of crazy about this here
10:34 - what I can do is I could say console log
10:37 - frame rate which is a function in p5
10:40 - that will give me the actual frame rate
10:42 - that it's rendering and so I could say a
10:44 - thousand divided by sixty because I want
10:46 - to update the engine at a frame like
10:49 - every moment in time is one sixtieth of
10:52 - second is that right 60
10:53 - frames-per-second I don't know whatever
10:54 - so now you can see but the frame rate
10:58 - that I'm actually really getting is like
10:59 - 30 frames per second so it kind of makes
11:01 - sense that it will want to double that
11:03 - number and you can see this is now with
11:07 - with the simulation running at 30 frames
11:08 - per second and in that case maybe it was
11:11 - silly for me back in the beginning when
11:13 - I was trying to get the world to behave
11:15 - a little better to mess with the gravity
11:17 - so maybe what I really just want is to
11:19 - mess with the density and the time step
11:21 - to get the sort of feeling of how it
11:23 - should look and feel so now it's
11:25 - probably running a little bit slower
11:26 - because I'm console logging but this I
11:27 - think is this is actually I think
11:30 - looking a little bit more realistic now
11:31 - here's the thing I have a confession I
11:34 - am coming to you from the future
11:37 - this third part of the coding challenge
11:40 - is actually been recorded oh we almost a
11:42 - week later than what you watched in
11:43 - weeks
11:44 - part 1 & 2 but the fourth part of the
11:46 - coding challenge that you're about to
11:47 - watch was recorded in the past who in
11:50 - the past so when you go to get to the
11:53 - fourth part of the coding challenge
11:54 - where I focus on adding sound your the
11:58 - codes actually going to revert to a
11:59 - previous state before this so as a
12:01 - challenge to you and maybe I'll record a
12:03 - fifth part at some point putting them
12:05 - together you know if you like some of
12:06 - the improvements I made here you can you
12:09 - can you can mix the sound piece that I
12:11 - add in the next challenge with it when I
12:12 - go and upload the actual code the
12:14 - example code that you might go and play
12:16 - with and iterate on and make your own
12:18 - creative version of this that will have
12:20 - the sort of final version then that will
12:23 - have that will have the final version
12:25 - with this 30 frames per second fix the
12:27 - density is a particularly and the larger
12:30 - tanks but the sound example won't have
12:32 - those larger pegs so just so you know
12:34 - that's the secret truth of all of this
12:36 - welcome to the Future Passed thing and
12:39 - I'll see you when I went to traveling
12:42 - room time in the past if you watch
12:43 - support for the challenge thank you
12:44 - goodbye
12:49 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hello welcome to part 3 of my Plinko challenge now one thing you might note is that so my plan here in part 3 is to work on sound but actually I'm not going to get the sound probably just in this part 3 now I'll get back to that in a second because I have some improvements I want to make number one you'll notice right now every single Plinko particle is following the exact same path so the whole point of Plinko is that well one of the main points of Plinko is that you should be a 50% chance of it either going to the left or to the right but it never goes to the right it only goes to the lab so let's look at a way that we might change that so there's a lot of ways we could change that week the member we're making these matter jeaious bodies and those bodies have a velocity we give it like a slightly initial velocity in a different direction or something what I'm going to do is I'm just going to like randomly offset it slightly to the left or the right which will probably do the trick so if I go into the particle object I can write here each particle is getting an X&Y location where it starts so it probably might make sense to go and actually alter the way the explication is set but just as a quick test right now I'm going to just say let's just oh let's just whatever X comes in randomly offset it a little bit to the left or the right with a random number so let's do that now look at that it went to the left that went to the left it went so left I must have done something wrong did I not statement oh I didn't save it let's try it again let's the left way to the right so now you can see whether it's really 50/50 is this exactly accurate sure you could improve on this idea but now we've at least got something happening kind of differently now distinct the other thing that I want to do here though is that really Plinko Plinko balls please Plinko particles that are falling down right now they're kind of bouncing out in a kind of crazy way and I really want to see them pick this one and then this or this one and then this or this one I really want to have that consistent pass or their 50/50 going one way or the other not sort of bouncing far off to the right or left just for the sake of argument here so one way that I might be able to achieve that is by playing with the size of the pegs really simple change so I'm going to go into the pegs are in this Plinko object and I'm going to just change these to being white also and I am going to what am I going to do I'm going to change their size from where do I create a create seven sketch yes I'm looking in the wrong place where I set them to just uh where do I make them right here for so let's give them a size a radius out of four but let's try sixteen and there we go so you can look at that it listed right on the top so you can see now they've really got to make a decision as to whether to go left or right at each and every moment and just to see how this plays out and let's do a couple things number one is let me make them a little bit darker so we see them as slightly different actually and then let me let me drop them more often so instead of every 60 frames let's try drawing them every twenty frames and let's see now we could sort of see what's going on here so we can really see this has a bit more of quality now I think I probably would want to play with the friction and play with the restitution either to make it a you know slippery ER or more or less bouncy just out of curiosity let's try on let's try messing with the friction for a second so if I go to the Plinko of the Plinko aren't you sent to a friction of zero the particles are set to a friction of zero so that's interesting so I don't know I'll let you guys I think I'm a mess around was kind of how how how some of these physics settings will will alter it and you can be kind of take your own creative take out like you can see now if we let this run for a little while it's going to most of these we're going to see that a bell curve of most of them falling in the center with every once in a while getting one falling out tilt to the edge so now let me I'm going to let this run for all we'll come back to look at it let's just add color to it as well because we should have rainbow colored Plinko things so I'm going to I'm going to add a variable I'm going to use HSB mode for the color first let me just so HSB mode is a way of defining color that is in a different way from RGB so in p5 I can say let me add color mode HSB to set up and let me hit refresh ah so we can see some of the color is off now because what I want to do is actually just set the HSV color you want to make it black so brightness right now brightness no saturation in some hue and so now I have a black background and I'm going to leave the I'll leave the Plinko the peg does white for right now that's fine so now that I have the particles have I can add a variable for each particle called hue and I can make a random Q between 0 and 360 so the default range for Q is 0 to 360 because the hues are like on a color wheel between 0 and 360 degrees and then here we go I could just say fill this dock you missus disgust you and I'm spelling q hu for no reason I'm going to call it Q because that's actually how it's spelled this Q and then I am going to just give it a saturation of 255 and a brightness of 255 and here we go so now we've got all I lost my I was I was waiting to see how much it fills up so now I have to talk for a little bit although what what I'm going to do now is have a little edit point in this video I'm going to take a little nap we were asleep and when I wake up a lot of the Plinko I'll wake up from my dream where I'll be dreaming up San Diego sounds nice sometimes be hurt and I'll wake up and see how many where they are good night okay hello I'm awake look okay so I still own that and when I woke up and told my fling cosimulation out of my oven because I precooked it for this code cooking show up if you could see that we are getting this nice kind of bell curve where most of the particles fall into the center and once we only get lucky in one falls outside now they're filling it up too much and strange things will happen but that's it actually one thing I wanted to sort of play with actually before I go onto the next video is I got a suggestion from somebody in a comment sub warehouse two prizes that I should consider of playing with the density of the particles in order to affect their motion as well as the time step variable so one thing let's just drive before I go

rate is and what the feeling is and you know are you getting errors can you correct for those errors but this is another thing that you can see to play with now here's the fix Oh 1000 divided by 60 okay Alka thank you thank you for pointing this out so why is that number one why is that number sixteen point six six six because um because matter digest is assuming a frame rate of 60 frames per second so let's actually look at we could be kind of crazy about this here what I can do is I could say console log frame rate which is a function in p5 that will give me the actual frame rate that it's rendering and so I could say a thousand divided by sixty because I want to update the engine at a frame like every moment in time is one sixtieth of second is that right 60 framespersecond I don't know whatever so now you can see but the frame rate that I'm actually really getting is like 30 frames per second so it kind of makes sense that it will want to double that number and you can see this is now with with the simulation running at 30 frames per second and in that case maybe it was silly for me back in the beginning when I was trying to get the world to behave a little better to mess with the gravity so maybe what I really just want is to mess with the density and the time step to get the sort of feeling of how it should look and feel so now it's probably running a little bit slower because I'm console logging but this I think is this is actually I think looking a little bit more realistic now here's the thing I have a confession I am coming to you from the future this third part of the coding challenge is actually been recorded oh we almost a week later than what you watched in weeks part 1 & 2 but the fourth part of the coding challenge that you're about to watch was recorded in the past who in the past so when you go to get to the fourth part of the coding challenge where I focus on adding sound your the codes actually going to revert to a previous state before this so as a challenge to you and maybe I'll record a fifth part at some point putting them together you know if you like some of the improvements I made here you can you can you can mix the sound piece that I add in the next challenge with it when I go and upload the actual code the example code that you might go and play with and iterate on and make your own creative version of this that will have the sort of final version then that will have that will have the final version with this 30 frames per second fix the density is a particularly and the larger tanks but the sound example won't have those larger pegs so just so you know that's the secret truth of all of this welcome to the Future Passed thing and I'll see you when I went to traveling room time in the past if you watch support for the challenge thank you goodbye
