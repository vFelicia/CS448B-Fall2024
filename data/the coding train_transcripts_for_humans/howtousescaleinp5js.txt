00:00 - [DING]
00:01 - Hello.
00:01 - So this is a little
bit of a part 2
00:03 - tutorial about transformations.
00:05 - And what I want
to do is show you
00:07 - what the scale function does.
00:09 - And I don't know that
this merits its own video,
00:11 - but I didn't fit it
into the last one,
00:12 - so that's why I'm doing it.
00:14 - So what does the
scale function do?
00:16 - So first of all, we
see-- and there's
00:17 - some other important
details that I'm
00:19 - going to fill in about push
and pop perhaps in this video.
00:22 - So we establish that translate
moves the point of origin.
00:30 - If you translate to
some point, you're
00:32 - translating where the origin is,
and you're drawing everything
00:35 - relative to that new location.
00:37 - Rotate rotates the
view of the canvas
00:40 - so that as you draw things, it
appears as if the shapes are
00:43 - rotating itself.
00:45 - So if we were to
rotate by an angle
00:46 - and then draw something at
0, 0 relative to its corner,
00:49 - we might see a
rectangle something
00:51 - like this rotated by some angle.
00:52 - Scale stretches everything out
or shrinks everything relative
00:58 - also to 0, 0.
01:00 - And there's some really goofy
stuff you can do with scale.
01:02 - So scale can actually
take one argument,
01:07 - or scale can take two arguments.
01:10 - So I could scale the same amount
along the x and the y-axis,
01:14 - or I could stretch something on
the x-axis and shrink something
01:18 - along the y-axis.
01:19 - Plus, I can also put
negative numbers in here.
01:23 - And what negative
numbers do is they
01:25 - not-- so what is
the number-- what
01:27 - is a-- if I put 1
everywhere, this just
01:29 - means 100% the default scale.
01:32 - That's just what it is.
01:34 - If I were to put 2 in here,
suddenly the rectangle
01:38 - will be twice the size.
01:40 - I've scaled it by 200%.
01:42 - 0.5, I've shrunk it 50%.
01:47 - So I can do different things at
a different axis-- the x-axis
01:49 - or the y-axis.
01:50 - But I can also flip the axis.
01:52 - So if I were to
flip the axis, that
01:54 - means this rectangle would
now appear over here, which
01:57 - would draw the other direction.
01:59 - So I can actually use scale
to say y doesn't point down,
02:02 - but y points up,
which sometimes you
02:04 - want to do if you want to
create some type of simulation
02:07 - where you're thinking about the
coordinate system differently.
02:09 - So let's go take a look
at this now in action.
02:12 - So if I have this sketch
here where now all I'm doing
02:15 - is I have a simple
transformation where I'm
02:17 - translating the center
and I'm rotating the view
02:19 - so that this rectangle
rotates around on its own,
02:22 - I can do things
like, say, scale 4.
02:28 - Let's just say scale 4.
02:30 - And now I have this
much larger rectangle.
02:32 - Notice this is something
very important about this.
02:35 - Look at this.
02:36 - What's the difference
between saying scale 4
02:40 - and just saying draw the
rectangle instead of 100,
02:42 - 50, let's multiply that by 4--
02:45 - 400, comma, 200.
02:47 - So I'm going to comment
out now scale 4.
02:51 - And I'm going to say rectangle
0, 0, 400, comma, 200.
02:55 - The math is the same here.
02:56 - I'm now drawing it
four times the width,
02:59 - four times the height.
03:01 - Now, I'm going to hit Refresh.
03:02 - And watch closely.
03:05 - What's different?
03:06 - Is it going to look the same?
03:07 - Or does it look different?
03:07 - Think about it.
03:08 - Think about it.
03:08 - Think about it.
03:10 - Well, it's the same size,
but look at the outline now.
03:12 - The outline is
only one pixel wide
03:15 - because the stroke weight is 1.
03:17 - So scale is not just making
things bigger in the sense
03:21 - that shapes now have a
larger width and height,
03:24 - but it's actually zooming in
on that two-dimensional shape,
03:27 - giving your view of
the window scaled up.
03:30 - So even the width of
the stroke gets bigger.
03:33 - And so if I go back to
here, we can do things
03:36 - like I could scale according
to mouseX divided by 100.
03:44 - So if I do that, we can see
it's kind of like a 3D effect.
03:49 - It's creating a 3D
effect in 2D similarly
03:53 - to how you might work with
something like a map API
03:56 - where you're zooming in
and out of a map for more
03:58 - detail or less detail.
03:59 - And this is the
thing I would like
04:01 - to do in a future coding
challenge, which is to create
04:03 - a 2D zoom and pan of a scene.
04:05 - And you could do that
now with everything I'm
04:07 - giving you because if I just
add translate to this, if I'm
04:10 - able to move the mouse
around to translate,
04:13 - then I also have
pan essentially.
04:16 - How do I click and drag?
04:17 - And is there an offset and that?
04:19 - The interactivity there
is a little tricky,
04:20 - but it's certainly possible.
04:22 - So that's the main thing
to say about scale.
04:26 - Let's look at what it means to
do this with different values.
04:30 - So I could say scale
4 in the x direction
04:33 - and 0.5 in the y direction.
04:36 - And as you can see
this weirdness,
04:38 - I've stretched it out
along the x but shrunk it.
04:40 - It's very weird to look at this.
04:41 - Let's actually say
mouseX divided by 100,
04:47 - mouseY divided by 100.
04:49 - So let's see what
that looks like.
04:50 - So you can see here.
04:52 - And it's a little confusing.
04:53 - I'm going to turn
the rotation off also
04:55 - just to make this a
little bit more clear.
04:57 - So you can see this is me now
stretching it and scaling it
05:01 - in other directions.
05:03 - Now, one thing I
want to do here--
05:05 - hold on-- is I'm going to say--
05:08 - I'm going to just put
scale 1, comma, 1.
05:13 - And I'm going to take
out wrecked mode center.
05:16 - So look.
05:17 - The rectangle is now drawn
with the corner at 0, 0,
05:22 - off to the right.
05:23 - What if I were to
say scale negative 1?
05:27 - Scale negative 1-- so just
negative in the x direction.
05:32 - Now everything
goes the other way.
05:34 - So this is quite interesting.
05:36 - And I could back up for a
second and put the rotation back
05:38 - and actually say,
let's put the scale in.
05:41 - So now I have this.
05:42 - Notice how it's
rotating clockwise--
05:45 - clockwise.
05:47 - If I say scale 1 and then
negative 1 here, whoa.
05:52 - Oh, whoa.
05:54 - It's still rotating clockwise.
05:56 - I took a little break
there to figure this out
05:58 - because my mind stopped working.
06:01 - I thought when I--
06:02 - let me step you through this.
06:04 - So let me turn the rotation
off, and let me put scale back
06:08 - to 1, comma, 1.
06:10 - So this is the rectangle
drawn pointing down.
06:14 - Y points down.
06:15 - If I were to change the y scale
to negative 1, now y points up.
06:22 - So that rectangle is drawn
up in the upwards direction.
06:25 - And then I added rotate back in.
06:27 - And if y now points
up, shouldn't it also
06:29 - rotate backwards?
06:32 - Well, it's not
rotating backwards.
06:33 - It's still rotating
the same way.
06:35 - But once again, [DING] I forgot
about order of operations.
06:41 - Rotate happens before scale.
06:43 - So I rotate the view,
and then I flip the y.
06:46 - So it's drawing it
the other direction,
06:47 - but it's rotating
still before I scale.
06:50 - So this is now before rotate.
06:54 - Look what happens now.
06:55 - Now it's rotating
Now, of course,
06:57 - I could have-- if I just
wanted to rotate the other way,
06:59 - I could just rotate
by a negative angle.
07:00 - I don't need to
use scale for that.
07:02 - The speed of rotation,
the angle of rotation--
07:04 - that can all be
controlled true math.
07:06 - That wasn't the point.
07:07 - But this actually comes up
because a great scenario
07:10 - for this is what if you want
to take an image and mirror it?
07:13 - So you want to draw
the image mirrored?
07:15 - Well, you might
think, oh, I have
07:16 - to rewrite all the pixels
in the opposite direction.
07:18 - You can actually use
scale to flip the image
07:21 - and draw it in the
reverse direction.
07:22 - And this can be
something that you
07:23 - could try if you're working with
images and that sort of thing.
07:26 - All right, so that's what
I want to say about scale.
07:29 - If you're looking
for a challenge
07:30 - to do, try to make a scene
that you can zoom in--
07:33 - almost as if a map that you can
zoom and pan around in a 2D way
07:38 - using scale, push,
pop, translate, rotate.
07:40 - If you do that,
share it with me.
07:42 - I would love to check it out.
07:43 - And hopefully, if
there's interest,
07:45 - I'll come back and do that
in a Coding Challenge video.
07:47 - I'm going to do one more video
just in case I forgot anything.
07:50 - I want to talk a
little bit about why
07:52 - it's called push and
pop and why there
07:53 - are some other functions that
have this matrix word in it.
07:56 - You should probably
just skip that video.
07:58 - I wouldn't watch-- I
haven't made it yet.
08:00 - I mean, maybe when you're
watching this, it'll be there,
08:01 - or it won't be there.
08:02 - It'll come out.
08:03 - But I'm going to try.
08:04 - So who knows?
08:04 - Maybe it'll be fine.
08:05 - See you.
08:06 - Thank you.
08:06 - Goodbye.
