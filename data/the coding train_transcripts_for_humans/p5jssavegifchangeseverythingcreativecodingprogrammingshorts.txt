00:00 - question from Julian I want to include
00:02 - not a single PNG but a gif but I have
00:05 - problems with the correct implementation
00:07 - Julian your question couldn't have come
00:09 - at a better time in the newest release
00:10 - of P5 there is a save GIF function
00:14 - arguments you need to add are the file
00:16 - name for the gift you want to save and
00:18 - how long you want to record the canvas
00:20 - and then there's an additional trick
00:21 - that I'll show you in a minute whoa
00:24 - that was gonna have an overlay that was
00:26 - incredible oh look at that it worked it
00:28 - doesn't Loop perfectly that's because I
00:30 - just said do it for five seconds but
00:32 - what if I said do it for a specific
00:35 - number of frames a full loop is from
00:38 - zero to two Pi so the angle changes by 2
00:41 - pi divided by the number of frames now I
00:43 - could replace the number five with the
00:46 - number of frames and then an options
00:48 - object to tell it the unit I wanted to
00:50 - consider is not seconds I think yeah
00:52 - that's a perfectly looping GIF in P5
00:56 - with one line of code
