02:47 - approximately 12:40 6 p.m. Eastern Time
02:52 - I'll be starting in just a few minutes
02:53 - this is my sound check how is the audio
02:58 - level of my voice I see actually it's
03:00 - getting kind of high so I might just it
03:04 - and versus the audio thank you

05:10 - in a moment here and that's gonna switch
05:14 - to this song usually start at the end of
05:17 - this song everyone okay this should be
05:35 - better now my voice that gets into the
05:39 - red but I advise to speak normally like
05:41 - this hello happy Thursday Thursday is
06:23 - the day for the coding train for the
06:26 - foreseeable future at least for the next
06:28 - few weeks but at least this week at
06:30 - least today today is Thursday and today
06:32 - is a day for the coding train and I
06:36 - expect you all to notice that I did get
06:38 - my haircut finally my like to say semi
06:40 - annual haircut biennial by annual
06:43 - haircut
06:44 - I know twice a year that's about that's
06:47 - about what I do and we begin as we often
06:52 - do on the coding train with the
06:53 - ceremonial reading of the random numbers
06:56 - and I have an update about my search for
06:59 - an original first edition print of this
07:04 - book but and I will
07:10 - begin on page 211 now where we last left
07:17 - off our hero they were in the number
07:22 - 55,000 430 you might recall previously
07:26 - on the coding train and then there was
07:27 - the number of 37,000 351 and now we
07:31 - continue our story on the coding tree
07:36 - thirty thousand three hundred eighty
07:37 - five seventy two thousand four hundred
07:40 - fifty seventy two thousand five hundred
07:44 - two fifty six thousand three hundred
07:47 - seventy six sixty-four thousand four
07:50 - hundred and seventy-two
07:54 - 81,000 could stop me probably I'm very
08:09 - I'm very susceptible to peer pressure
08:11 - and comments and all that sort of stuff
08:14 - I see coating garden is in CJ is in the
08:18 - chat which is one of the first things I
08:20 - wanted to mention that's a helpful
08:22 - reminder for me that yesterday I
08:24 - appeared on the coding garden with CJ
08:29 - and we made let's see if I can pull that
08:31 - up super easily I think if I use if I
08:36 - search for coding garden and it will
08:39 - bring me to the YouTube channel coding
08:41 - garden with CJ and if I find my way
08:44 - there will find a ha look at this build
08:48 - a discord bot with mmm it's a very hard
08:51 - name to pronounce Donnie Ola chief none
08:55 - of the coding trained right there so you
09:00 - can watch this this was really fun I
09:03 - would really appreciate I learned like
09:05 - so many different things from CJ and I
09:08 - definitely encourage you if you want to
09:09 - learn things and get better as a
09:12 - programmer especially in terms of web
09:14 - development and all sorts of other
09:15 - related topics I would encourage you to
09:18 - subscribe and check out the coding
09:20 - garden an incredible amount of useful
09:22 - content there but this was great because
09:25 - we made a basic discord bot sample which
09:30 - was like an Eightball so you could ask
09:32 - it a question what's a yes no maybe in
09:34 - various other Eightball answers and then
09:37 - deployed that bot to CJ's discord the
09:40 - coding garden discord but I also have a
09:44 - coding trade discord and you could join
09:47 - the coding train discord maybe somebody
09:48 - can post post a link to it in the chat
09:51 - to has moderator privileges and
09:55 - eventually I intend to make a set of
09:58 - kind of step by step tutorials to build
10:00 - your own discord bot you know ultimately
10:02 - you should just watch the video on the
10:04 - coding garden because when I make mine
10:05 - it'll be basically the same
10:07 - but I will just be doing it again and
10:09 - stepping through it and ultimately with
10:11 - the goal of connecting some of the other
10:13 - text generation and machine learning
10:15 - algorithms that I have explored on this
10:17 - channel with with this court BOTS oh I
10:22 - have a funny idea
10:24 - Oh hahaha I crack myself up I have a
10:28 - funny idea for a video of that I will be
10:30 - making soon it relates what I'm talking
10:32 - about but I don't want to give it away
10:35 - all these people commenting my hair very
10:39 - much appreciated
10:40 - Julianne who is my barber excellent if
10:44 - anybody wants a recommendation I will I
10:46 - don't know I'm not gonna know like by
10:48 - accident violates somebody's privacy or
10:51 - buzz market something inappropriately
10:53 - but you know yeah you could contact me
10:55 - on the disk or I'll give you some
10:56 - haircut in Brooklyn recommendations
10:59 - alright so that was one thing I wanted
11:03 - to say the other thing is I'm really
11:05 - still on the lookout for I was and I
11:08 - don't have any good news it was someone
11:12 - a couple a couple of different people
11:13 - shared with me I can't remember who
11:15 - originally on Twitter some Amazon links
11:19 - for collect your collectable versions of
11:22 - this book let's see if I can find it let
11:24 - me just go to amazon.com and trust me I
11:29 - much prefer to buy this somewhere else
11:32 - but you know just so I can find this out
11:34 - million random digits so here we go I
11:39 - there is this listing for it and we can
11:43 - see these three these three listings all
11:50 - for quite a large amount of money this
11:53 - is no you know the actual book itself
11:55 - this is the one that I own which is a
11:57 - reprint which is temporary of stock mmm
12:00 - it listed for $59 sixteen cents I can't
12:02 - remember if that's what I paid for it
12:03 - but something like that but I'm very
12:05 - interested in these hard covers which
12:08 - have some kind of information about them
12:11 - but you know I really don't feel that I
12:14 - can purchase this book just on a whim so
12:17 - I emailed each one of these sellers and
12:19 - I said explained exactly
12:20 - I'm looking for all I needed was like a
12:22 - photo or they could just tell me which
12:23 - Edition isn't missing any pages and what
12:25 - condition a little more information and
12:27 - I got the exact same form letter back
12:29 - from each of them which leads me to be a
12:31 - little suspicious
12:32 - like these different like sellers that
12:34 - listed with Amazon which was something
12:37 - like sorry the the stuff we sell it's
12:40 - already in the Amazon warehouse we don't
12:41 - have any interaction with it can't send
12:42 - you any more information so it wasn't
12:44 - just that the message was to say the
12:45 - substance of the message was the same
12:47 - the actual text of the message was
12:49 - identical so very much seemed like a
12:50 - foreign letter that all of these
12:53 - booksellers through Amazon send so I I
12:57 - just couldn't get myself to press the
13:00 - button I maybe there's a nice local you
13:03 - know but that's this is a strand even
13:05 - still exist in New York there's like a
13:06 - local bookstore if you've lived
13:08 - somewhere where somebody happens to have
13:10 - one of these in their attic
13:11 - I will barter just thank pay for I'm
13:17 - really looking for this is what I'm
13:19 - looking for maybe I should just maybe I
13:20 - should just take a leap of faith order
13:22 - all three of these I'm gonna need some
13:24 - quite a few more members maybe of the
13:25 - cooking train all right just go ahead
13:27 - and do that but I'm looking for this I
13:30 - really want to find one so I just wanted
13:33 - to bring that up at the beginning of
13:34 - this live stream when I have
13:35 - approximately 100 ish people watching
13:38 - and maybe someone will know something
13:40 - and can help me out so I want to have
13:47 - you tried rare us sarcasm as a service
13:50 - which is a really wonderful username in
13:52 - the discord supporter discord chat
13:54 - rightz
13:55 - have you tried rare bookstores in New
13:57 - York City seems like you'd have better
13:59 - luck with them I did I have a little bit
14:01 - I've called a couple places
14:03 - do they offer free returns that's a good
14:06 - good that's kind of it Thank You CJ that
14:09 - is a very smart point and perhaps kind
14:14 - of obvious that I don't know why I
14:15 - didn't think of that
14:16 - so that's something that I could
14:17 - potentially check what I was really
14:21 - excited about was like that I saw this
14:22 - look inside here and then I realize like
14:24 - oh it's just the look inside for this
14:26 - Reaper
14:27 - so the reason why I'm like particularly
14:30 - obsessed with this right now is the
14:32 - channel is approaching just cannot even
14:34 - believe these words are gonna come out
14:36 - of my mouth right now but what billion
14:38 - subscribers which is totally nuts
14:41 - you know viewership I would say I have
14:44 - viewership on the same level as much
14:46 - smaller channels in terms of subscriber
14:48 - numbers it's interesting that I think
14:49 - there's a lot of people who like
14:50 - aspirationally subscribe like I'm gonna
14:53 - learn to code and watch all the Kodi
14:54 - videos busy and they just like you know
14:57 - I see it in their feed I don't know why
14:58 - I'm going on if I find it interesting
14:59 - what makes somebody subscribers not
15:01 - subscribed versus watch but this is
15:04 - unfathomable to me that this would this
15:08 - would happen and I would like to do
15:09 - something to celebrate it and I feel
15:11 - like something to do with random numbers
15:13 - and this million dollar remember random
15:15 - book which has been a very well go eat
15:24 - dinner please don't starve memoirs I'm
15:27 - supposed to go eat with my family first
15:28 - of all let me just talk about priorities
15:31 - in life be with family
15:33 - eat coding train I put them in that
15:36 - order I suppose eating is maybe a little
15:38 - bit higher in terms of actual like life
15:40 - force although I would say being with
15:43 - family and you know family can mean a
15:44 - lot of different things for other people
15:46 - it doesn't just vary me in your
15:47 - immediate relatives your family might be
15:49 - any collection of people that is in your
15:51 - life for any number of reasons but I
15:53 - would say you know the coding train
15:56 - should not go above your family your
16:00 - food and your being with people but glad
16:02 - you're here alright let's see here
16:11 - so I go to have a ton of time today I
16:14 - will be live-streaming until around 3
16:17 - p.m. which is two hours from now I will
16:19 - take a break in the middle of the live
16:22 - stream a short intermission to thank
16:24 - brilliant the sponsor of the coding
16:26 - train you can go to them find out more
16:28 - about brilliant at brilliant org slash
16:30 - coding train there are so many fun
16:33 - interactive puzzles and challenges you
16:35 - can do there and a lot of courses that
16:37 - relate to coding and algorithms and
16:39 - things that are on this channel so it's
16:40 - it's a website that I in an app that I
16:43 - use quite often to learn and discover
16:45 - lots of fun topics in math and science
16:47 - and related things so I'll come back and
16:49 - talk a little more about brilliant a
16:51 - little later but what I will be focusing
16:55 - on today is continuing my nature of code
16:58 - series yeah I mean maybe you've been
17:02 - what you are the live stream viewer and
17:04 - this is not so meaningful to you but I
17:06 - think I must have like 10 or 11 edited
17:09 - videos just waiting to be made public on
17:12 - the channel and I'll be making 2 mil you
17:14 - know 1 2 3 more of those today so
17:15 - there's a lot of content in the pipeline
17:17 - we've just been kind of slow to take
17:20 - care of the sort of details of getting
17:22 - them ready to be sitting on the channel
17:24 - if you want us the preview of them you
17:26 - could join as a member but don't worry
17:28 - you don't need to do that they're gonna
17:29 - come out soon enough
17:32 - right Clippy is asking do you have any
17:34 - coding challenge idea for a 1 million
17:36 - subscriber celebration no I'm really
17:40 - hoping though this is my really hoping
17:41 - that I hit 1 million subscribers on
17:43 - April 1st I just think that would be
17:46 - beautiful which is not so unrealistic
17:48 - it's a little I think it'll be a little
17:50 - bit actually I mean I have to look at
17:52 - the what you know what the sort of
17:54 - current herbs and flows of this are but
17:56 - I think that would be a nice alignment
17:58 - of the stars because yeah basically a
18:00 - full of the Internet
18:01 - so April Fool's Day would be a nice time
18:04 - for me to hit that milestone ok Andrew
18:12 - writes of Simon writes you should be
18:15 - celebrating 1,048,576 subs subs - to the
18:19 - 20th power great awesome
18:21 - sold I can wait another two months
18:25 - before worrying about a celebration so I
18:27 - can't get it together from 1 million
18:29 - perfect for my pet 1,048,576 Andrew
18:34 - writes I can say in terms of viewing
18:37 - videos I might go two weeks without
18:39 - seeing a video and then watch like 6
18:41 - hours in one day I hope you take a break
18:43 - take breaks CJ I discovered on the
18:45 - coating garden has a little timer that
18:47 - runs on his computer that reminds him to
18:49 - take a break every so often I should
18:51 - we have that all right I'm going to skip
18:57 - Shari community contributions today I
18:58 - don't know that there are I haven't
19:00 - looked into if I have a collection of
19:02 - those to share socialblade floor and
19:05 - right socialblade says you'll get to 1
19:07 - million on March 28 slow down people
19:10 - march 28 is a little bit early April 1st
19:15 - is what I'm looking for unsubscribe if
19:19 - you just doesn't subscribe if it's
19:20 - getting too fast you could subscribe
19:21 - back alright let me get set up to get
19:26 - moving here
19:27 - it's like one o'clock I'm jumping right
19:29 - in
19:32 - [Music]
19:53 - [Music]
20:27 - [Music]
20:38 - [Music]
20:45 - okay pause again for a second so this is
20:50 - what is coming soon a brand new playlist
20:53 - with a whole lot of videos related to
20:57 - vectors and forces and so I hope by the
21:02 - end of this week I'll have a few of
21:03 - these released you know one thing I'll
21:06 - tell you is that you'll probably be able
21:09 - to find embed like I'll probably have
21:11 - many more videos available as unlisted
21:13 - while I'm still like finishing preparing
21:15 - them so once the first one comes out if
21:18 - you could always like look into the
21:20 - description it'll sometimes be like a
21:21 - link to the next video or they'll be at
21:23 - the end screen a link to the next video
21:25 - would be unlisted I'm not and if you
21:26 - want to join the discord I might share
21:28 - the unlisted videos there so it's it's a
21:30 - the reason why some of them are online
21:32 - but not listed is not because I'm trying
21:34 - to hide them from anyone and just taking
21:37 - the time to get them ready and make sure
21:38 - there are no major problems before they
21:40 - go public cause it's much harder to take
21:42 - down a video and re-upload it once it's
21:44 - been made public so so that's that parem
21:49 - is asking about the music it that the
21:51 - last name of the composer of Tori the
21:53 - dog this particular wonderful piece of
21:55 - music is allow the l8u Adam Lau I
22:00 - believe he is the composer for
22:02 - television and film he is a composer a
22:03 - television film including the FX series
22:05 - you're the worst
22:06 - [Music]
22:10 - all right so so I am getting rid of that
22:17 - and getting rid of this getting rid of
22:18 - this and coming back to here so the good
22:22 - news in terms of getting moving quickly
22:24 - today into some actual coding is very
22:27 - rare rare feet for the coding train to
22:31 - be actually ah but I found something
22:33 - else I want to talk about to be coding
22:34 - within the first like 15 minutes of
22:36 - starting a live stream here's a little
22:37 - past 15 minutes now usually I don't get
22:39 - to coding until at least like 45 minutes
22:41 - in but since I only have two hours I
22:43 - didn't want to show something I have
22:45 - been learning about how to do some kind
22:50 - of taking computational algorithms and
22:52 - making them physical I've been working
22:53 - with a vinyl cutter that I've mentioned
22:55 - but I've also been working with a laser
22:57 - cutter and this is very hard to see
22:59 - because it's clear but what I'm going to
23:02 - be soon doing where to best make this
23:06 - visible like it's my turn to the side oh
23:08 - wait I'll use the overhead camera hold
23:10 - on a sec that's gonna work yeah so this
23:14 - is a piece of plexi and I laser cut a
23:21 - rectangle in it out with these two lines
23:24 - because these train whistles it'll
23:29 - actually it's goes this way let's see if
23:31 - these train was the train whistle will
23:33 - sit right in here go onto the bed of the
23:36 - laser cutter and in between these two
23:38 - lines I will be laser etching the coding
23:41 - train characters along here and putting
23:44 - a little coding train logo maybe on
23:45 - another side I have a box of 200 of
23:48 - these I'm just sort of doing this as a
23:50 - fun experiment also for people who are
23:52 - members at a certain level we'll get one
23:54 - of these in the mail if soon as I can so
23:56 - hopefully tomorrow I have sort of
23:57 - blocked out an hour to try to do this
23:59 - laser etching so we'll see how that goes
24:01 - so stay tuned I'll post images of it in
24:03 - the discord as well and once I get you
24:07 - know at some point I would like to do
24:08 - some videos about how to take a design
24:11 - and processing maybe like the Hilbert
24:13 - curve or the Cole that's conjecture some
24:15 - of the things that I've done in the
24:15 - coating in the Cabana series and Ren
24:17 - that is an SVG or PDF to bring it to
24:19 - illustrator and that kind of stuff
24:21 - you could see it fine in the original
24:23 - view says Ken Haley hi Ken
24:25 - I love seeing names that I recognize in
24:28 - the chat I mean I would recognize a lot
24:29 - of them just because they're the same
24:30 - names that appear but then I recognize
24:32 - names that are like from an email
24:33 - conversation from like 10 years ago
24:35 - it's what a community of viewers you all
24:38 - are and I'm so glad you're here with me
24:39 - today hmm
24:42 - Clippy is asking is that an elgato
24:45 - stream deck yes I love my Elgato stream
24:47 - deck it's how I do things like press a
24:49 - button well it's kind of like a quick
24:51 - shot of this coffee entered the overhead
24:54 - camera on or the sponsor banner and
24:58 - different things like that I can press a
24:59 - button to switch to the whiteboard ooh
25:00 - that camera is really bleeding into the
25:02 - green I won't worry about that right now
25:06 - okay so um good one of the things that I
25:13 - did this morning as I was having my
25:15 - breakfast oatmeal if you wanted to ask
25:18 - thank you for asking you definitely
25:20 - we're asking nuts I like a good organic
25:24 - blueberry did not have any this morning
25:26 - didn't have any at the ready but I while
25:30 - I was having that oatmeal I watched the
25:32 - edited versions of the tutorials I
25:36 - worked through a week ago today so
25:38 - they're fresh in my mind which is good
25:41 - because I want to pick up pick up
25:43 - exactly where I left off last week so if
25:45 - you're just here for the first time
25:47 - welcome thank you
25:49 - train whistle for you oh you have no
25:55 - with your viewing of the coding training
25:57 - you have one but clearly person on the
26:00 - match who will talk to you about forces
26:03 - in simulation and p5 jets in the WebEx
26:06 - [Music]
26:16 - hmm
26:18 - steel cut steel cut oats dusty an answer
26:20 - to your question
26:23 - woman here and yeah I was watching
26:29 - videos it's fresh in my mind
26:31 - welcome if you're new so this might feel
26:34 - like what you don't you might not be you
26:36 - might not have the prior knowledge of
26:39 - some of the other things that I've
26:40 - talked about or taught about or made on
26:41 - this channel try to follow along the
26:43 - best you can or you know take a break do
26:45 - something else and come back on all of
26:46 - the prerequisites a pre requisite stuff
26:51 - that is last week is coming out in
26:53 - edited form soon on the channel alright
26:57 - so um let's pick let me get the
27:02 - whiteboard ready to go
27:09 - [Music]
27:18 - it's the three little bears Goldilocks
27:23 - which one is the one yeah a little green
27:30 - never hurt anybody you just see if it's
27:34 - I don't want to be too extreme and
27:36 - totally like take it off the wall and
27:39 - all that is I have a level that's what
27:42 - I'm checking to see if the camera blah
27:44 - blah pretty good actually
27:47 - that's gonna be good enough there we go
28:28 - [Music]
28:53 - [Music]
29:14 - okay
29:15 - so I am going to begin by the the the
29:23 - thesis of this particular session is the
29:26 - Hat video for Andrew maples thank you
29:30 - for the super chat rightz would love to
29:32 - see do a video from p5 to SVG good good
29:35 - good suggestion for sure yeah I might
29:40 - suggest looking into a library called
29:42 - room yes are you any touch s created by
29:44 - roon Matson which is this with like
29:47 - companion kind of library similarly in
29:50 - the similar vein to p5 but works
29:51 - natively with SVG is other libraries
29:53 - you're like d3 personally for me when
29:55 - I'm trying to render an SVG out of a
29:58 - computational algorithm I'm gonna go to
30:00 - processing because I just the PDF
30:02 - renderer works it does exactly what I
30:03 - want to do it can be trickier to do that
30:06 - from the browser but I would be very
30:07 - happy to investigate that okay
30:11 - so the thesis of today's live session is
30:14 - that I want to move from I'm just say
30:17 - I'm gonna repeat myself in a second from
30:19 - just making up force vectors oh sorry
30:28 - I'm into reading an interesting comment
30:29 - that I'm going to come back to making up
30:32 - force vectors and I want to look at how
30:33 - do you calculate a vector using a kind
30:35 - of real-world physics formula and bring
30:38 - that into code Andrews writing I hope
30:41 - your vector videos has a change of basis
30:45 - maybe let's let's you remind me about
30:48 - that after the live stream is over
30:50 - because I would love to investigate what
30:52 - is it your exactly you're looking
30:54 - forward to see if that's something I can
30:55 - fold in but at present no yeah there's
30:58 - still a green sliver all right it's
31:02 - gonna bother me not you can always just
31:04 - like crop it is the thing but let's I'm
31:07 - gonna go be a bit more extreme oh my god
31:10 - you know what
31:11 - I cannot untighten this Wow somebody
31:14 - came in and really tighten this all
31:16 - right I'm not gonna fight with this it's
31:18 - just gonna be what its gonna be the
31:21 - green sliver will be there is no getting
31:26 - rid of the gleaned green sliver now that
31:28 - I did that I got to check the level
31:29 - again which is a little bit crooked but
31:36 - I think I might just live with it time
31:40 - it that way
31:40 - okay green sliver is going to be there
31:45 - there is no getting rid of the green
31:46 - silver okay here we go oh oh I forgot to
31:53 - hit record disc okay I'm recording to
31:59 - disk I'm now gonna say my record to disc
32:03 - prayer may the record disc not have
32:07 - jumpy dropped frames in it so that when
32:09 - it's time to edit this later all is
32:11 - possible that's beret pre hug often okay
32:17 - um where where this is now I'm gonna say
32:24 - multi quarter go do I miss seeing any
32:28 - dropped frames so far so good and then
32:33 - as a safeguard I am going to do a quick
32:38 - screen record as well hold on a sec have
32:45 - too many different systems
32:48 - okay as a safeguard I'm gonna do and
32:54 - Kobe is suggesting I should have a
32:57 - checklist yes
32:59 - far be it for me to be organized about
33:02 - anything new screen recording nope yep
33:04 - and I just want make sure there's at
33:07 - least some mic going on here
33:09 - Mac yep that's perfect and record all
33:13 - right that's a backup okay here we go
33:23 - one more thing
33:34 - is there
33:44 - just wanna see if the same formula that
33:48 - I'm about to use appears in a similar
33:52 - way static friction and kinetic friction
33:53 - and friction yeah all right I think this
33:58 - actually isn't as useful as I want it to
34:00 - be so that's fine okay
34:11 - welcome to another
34:14 - now with haircut video in Chapter two
34:17 - nature of code and in this video I'm
34:19 - gonna take a leap what I have done so
34:22 - far using the classical laws of motion
34:25 - classical mechanics force equals mass
34:27 - times acceleration I've implemented a
34:29 - system where mover objects can receive
34:32 - forces as vectors and have those forces
34:35 - control how they move about a canvas in
34:38 - p5.js but the way that I have created
34:41 - these force vectors is just by picking
34:44 - numbers out of a hat and I want to do
34:46 - something more I want to look at an
34:48 - actual physics textbook oh could I run
34:52 - and get a physics textbook right now if
34:57 - I had this the finest script then I
35:01 - would know what I'm gonna say and then I
35:03 - would think like Oh get your prop but I
35:05 - do not I do know everything's buzzing I
35:12 - have to turn on my do not disturb
35:14 - because people are messaging me hold on
35:17 - a sec do not disturb on okay I will say
35:27 - for those of you in the discord channel
35:29 - if you have something you want to tag me
35:32 - in wait until after the stream is over
35:37 - because or a direct message because that
35:40 - will sort of like pop up as an extra
35:41 - message that I view during a live stream
35:43 - is like oh this is important to what I'm
35:44 - doing right now like the audio has
35:45 - stopped or I've made a mistake so it's
35:48 - not a big deal but save those for later
35:50 - if you can all right the train is
35:53 - already off the rails as dusty 9:23 says
35:57 - which is absolutely accurate I'm not
36:00 - gonna have a physical I'm I think I know
36:02 - I have a book that I think might have
36:05 - what I'm looking for in it but it's not
36:07 - worth me trying to wander off to find it
36:11 - I'm going to keep going
36:15 - I couldn't find a physics textbook but
36:18 - you know what I'm talking about in those
36:19 - textbooks there our formula Oh what had
36:22 - something in post will have like a book
36:23 - fly in with a formula in it I couldn't
36:29 - find a textbook but here's one for you
36:33 - definitely gonna be able to find where
36:38 - you might see a scary looking formula
36:40 - and I've picked one to start with and
36:43 - the formula that I want to start with is
36:45 - the formula for friction now there are
36:56 - many different kinds of friction and
36:58 - examples of friction and there's static
37:00 - friction which is friction that holds
37:03 - something in place and not moving versus
37:05 - kinetic friction which is the friction
37:07 - that occurs when two surfaces are moving
37:10 - in contact with each other I am going to
37:13 - not worry about any of those things and
37:15 - kind of well not that I'm not worrying
37:17 - about any of those things search google
37:20 - books I could come back and like do a
37:29 - little clip of me like read it with a
37:31 - book like sitting in like a by a
37:33 - fireplace really I dug you like I
37:36 - thought the harp on this but those bone
37:38 - Appetit videos are so good and I don't
37:41 - think that my coding videos are ever
37:43 - gonna achieve that level of like just
37:46 - absolute wonderfulness but there's like
37:50 - really messing with my mind and how I
37:52 - think about my videos all right here's
37:56 - the diagram that I'm using to describe
37:59 - friction and it's a diagram directly
38:01 - from nature of code book
38:12 - - what am I thinking a normal forest
38:15 - force of gravity okay
38:23 - where's my marker okay
38:31 - today's theme is the flirt or a book
38:33 - absolutely true says sarcasm is service
38:37 - here's the diagram that I have to
38:40 - describe the friction force in the
38:42 - nature of code book itself and this is
38:44 - an example of kinetic friction there is
38:46 - a person on a sled coming down a hill
38:49 - there's the force of gravity there's the
38:52 - person's the sleds velocity there's this
38:54 - idea of a normal force and then this
38:55 - other force the friction force pointing
38:58 - in the opposite direction of velocity
39:00 - with a formula right over here let me
39:08 - take a moment to rewrite that formula
39:11 - let's rewrite that formula on the
39:13 - whiteboard and I need a second because
39:15 - unfortunately I know you can't see me
39:17 - right now but oh no wait
39:21 - oh no but it's recording that I'm afraid
39:26 - I'm afraid where's my eraser we go
39:39 - let's take let's I'm gonna rewrite that
39:42 - formula here negative one
40:05 - [Music]
40:09 - I'm gonna take a minute to rewrite that
40:11 - formula over here
40:34 - okay
40:41 - the approach I like to take when finding
40:43 - a formula like this and then trying to
40:46 - figure out how to apply it in code is to
40:48 - unpack each of the elements of the
40:50 - formula one at a time and figure out
40:52 - whether it actually applies or is in
40:54 - fact something that we can ignore to
40:56 - simplify in the case of our two d p5
40:59 - canvas so one let's go into sort of an
41:03 - arbitrary order here but something
41:04 - really to note here is what is this this
41:07 - is the velocity unit vector so why are
41:15 - we doing this let's consider I have this
41:22 - circle at the bottom of the canvas it's
41:24 - moving in this direction that's its
41:27 - current velocity and I want to describe
41:30 - what is the direction of friction well
41:33 - the direction of friction is and this
41:35 - negative one is really important these
41:37 - two go together the direction of
41:39 - friction is a vector in the opposite
41:43 - direction of velocity so the reason why
41:46 - I'm not talking about the magnitude yet
41:48 - the magnitude is important but the first
41:50 - thing anytime that a little bit anytime
41:55 - I want to calculate a force I need to
41:57 - calculate two things direction and
42:01 - magnitude so looking at this formula
42:06 - [Music]
42:08 - explain this because I have a better
42:10 - idea
42:16 - it's fine it's fine it's fine
42:19 - let's move on
42:26 - circling back for a second
42:28 - what am i doing again I'm calculating a
42:30 - force a vector and I need to figure out
42:32 - two things direction and magnitude the
42:37 - direction here is expressed as the unit
42:39 - vector pointing in the velocities
42:41 - direction times negative one so I know
42:43 - that the friction points in this
42:45 - direction
42:46 - that's the friction force what is the
42:48 - magnitude well I have two other
42:50 - variables in this formula and all of
42:54 - these by the way are scalars scalar
42:56 - scalar scalar and this is the vector
42:58 - this is known as mu or the coefficient
43:02 - of friction let's play a little
43:06 - knock-knock joke together
43:08 - knock-knock mu no wait I did exactly my
43:20 - daughter when she was little used to
43:21 - tell the joke in like the wrong order
43:23 - and I just started doing that okay ready
43:25 - knock-knock the interrupting coefficient
43:30 - of friction mu thank you thank you
43:35 - thank you very much thank you very much
43:37 - I will I will I'll be here all week all
43:40 - week uh Fridays and Saturdays hey
43:42 - it's like you there thank you thank you
43:43 - thank you alright
43:51 - mu mu is the good boy that that's like
43:56 - written in the worst way three rapist
44:16 - okay
44:29 - okay coefficient of friction is a value
44:38 - that describes the strength of the
44:41 - friction force based on what material it
44:43 - is you could imagine if this is like ice
44:46 - and this is an ice skate there's gonna
44:47 - be a lot less friction that ice cap will
44:49 - glide across the ice versus this is
44:52 - sandpaper and this is some other kind of
44:53 - rough material and there's a much
44:55 - greater amount of friction so the
44:56 - coefficient of friction is tied
44:58 - specifically to the material itself and
45:01 - and what its behavior as they come as it
45:03 - comes into contact then we have
45:05 - something interesting here this the
45:06 - normal force the normal force and so
45:23 - to describe the normal force let me
45:25 - refer back to the diagram
45:40 - here the purse the sled here the sled is
45:46 - coming into contact with the hill but
45:49 - there would be no friction if there
45:51 - wasn't a force of gravity pulling the
45:54 - sled into that down downwards I don't
45:58 - want to explain this yes I do get a
46:06 - super chat
46:08 - hold your I'm gonna hold my applause to
46:10 - the end I will thank the super chat in a
46:12 - moment this diagram has a sled in
46:22 - contact with a hill and there's also the
46:26 - force of gravity the force of gravity is
46:27 - a force pointing directly down towards
46:29 - the center of the earth and causing the
46:32 - sled to kind of rub in in with the hill
46:34 - as it move and as it comes down the
46:35 - normal force is the force perpendicular
46:38 - to the two surfaces in contact and it's
46:41 - magnitude is tied to the this component
46:45 - of the gravity force the component that
46:48 - is perpendicular to the hill but guess
46:49 - what none of that really matters what I
46:53 - brought up has days I mean all this is
46:55 - like super important in real-world
46:57 - physics but let me remind you what we're
47:00 - doing here I have a ellipse a piece of
47:04 - graphics drawn on a two-dimensional
47:06 - canvas coming into contact with the edge
47:09 - of the canvas so there is a normal force
47:12 - pointing straight down in my world that
47:15 - I'm sort of looking at the I'm looking
47:17 - at a slice of a 3-dimensional world in a
47:19 - way there is a normal force but what its
47:23 - magnitude is is something that I could
47:24 - just make up it's some kind of constant
47:26 - in this case it's a constant guess what
47:31 - else is a constant the coefficient of
47:33 - friction well I could sort of say do I
47:35 - want it to be the friction to be really
47:36 - strong really weak like what kind of
47:38 - material how do I want it to feel that's
47:40 - also a constant constant constant these
47:44 - are both constants I can make up
47:47 - whatever number I want for a constant in
47:49 - this scenario
47:51 - like saying the same thing both of these
47:53 - are constant which really just means I
47:55 - can make up a value depending on how I'm
47:59 - considering the environment and material
48:01 - and all the other aspects that I'm
48:02 - inventing for this made-up world in the
48:04 - first place
48:19 - let me just change this to friction
48:30 - I'm going to simplify this again just
48:33 - have one object so as I add the code for
48:35 - friction into it I'm not dealing with
48:36 - multiple objects
49:15 - ok so I have my single object bouncing
49:19 - up and down oops
49:33 - is the stream down I don't think so
49:37 - not constant and depends on the way no
49:40 - no no no all right all right yes yes yes
49:44 - let me offer a correction yes yes very
49:54 - good point
50:06 - quick quick clarification n is not a
50:10 - constant in the sense that it depends on
50:13 - the weight which depends on the object's
50:16 - mass so for different objects that
50:18 - relative amount of friction would be
50:20 - different because their weights would be
50:22 - different but in the case of one
50:23 - particular object the that per dot but
50:28 - in the case of one particular object I
50:30 - can treat it as a constant here and
50:32 - scale it according to that object's mass
50:54 - I'm going to invent a kind of artificial
50:57 - scenario where I want this mover to only
51:01 - experience friction when it comes in
51:03 - contact with the bottom surface of the
51:05 - canvas so anytime it is in contact with
51:08 - the bottom surface it'll experience
51:10 - friction
51:24 - to make this happen I'm going to write a
51:25 - new function in the mover called
51:27 - friction I'll check to see how far is it
51:35 - away from the bottom
52:09 - I want to know how far is it from the
52:11 - bottom so one of the difference between
52:12 - the height and its position plus the
52:14 - radius because remember the position the
52:16 - Y position is the center so I want to
52:18 - look at the edge in contact with the
52:20 - bottom I will say it's in contact if
52:23 - that difference is within one pixel so
52:35 - let's just run the sketch what we call
52:37 - the function friction
52:50 - I mean maybe I should do it out here
52:52 - whatever I'm gonna do it this way and
52:56 - let's see if when it comes in contact
52:59 - with the edge we get the word friction
53:01 - here in the console so we can see every
53:08 - time it bounces we're seeing the word
53:11 - friction and then this will get sped up
53:14 - here
53:33 - and now we can see as it's rolling along
53:36 - the bottom friction friction friction
53:37 - friction friction because it's in
53:38 - constant contact with the surface maybe
53:42 - I would want to treat the scenario when
53:44 - it like hits the surface once vs. is
53:46 - rolling along the surface differently
53:47 - but I'm not gonna worry about that right
53:49 - now
54:01 - yeah
54:09 - people are all the chat the the live
54:12 - chat that's watching me record this
54:13 - video right now is also pointing out
54:15 - that things would be quite different if
54:17 - my surface were at an angle so how the
54:21 - normal force would be calculated
54:22 - relative the force of gravity that's why
54:24 - I'm happy about this simple scenario of
54:26 - this roof flat surface along the bottom
54:37 - let me first get the direction of the
54:41 - force let me first get the direction of
54:44 - the friction force
54:45 - I need the velocity vector I need a unit
54:48 - vert unit sorry I need the velocity
54:54 - vector normalized to length one
54:55 - multiplied by negative one
55:06 - let me copy the velocity vector let me
55:12 - normalize it and reverse its direction
55:31 - now that I have the direction I need the
55:33 - magnitude what is the magnitude the
55:37 - coefficient what is the magnitude the
55:42 - coefficient of friction mu times the
55:46 - strength of the normal force the normal
55:49 - force is proportional to the weight
55:50 - which is scaled by the mass of the
55:53 - object so I can use mass in my
55:55 - calculation and then you can be a value
55:58 - that I make up so I'm going to say let
55:59 - and often it's used K is used as like
56:02 - the coefficient of friction no does that
56:04 - anything in spring that's right in you
56:08 - let's make up a coefficient of friction
56:10 - mu will say zero point one the normal
56:14 - force will be equal to the mass and then
56:18 - I can say force set magnitude mu times
56:22 - normal
56:30 - I should take magnitude
56:37 - once again any time I'm calculating a
56:41 - force I need to first or both once it's
56:45 - once again any time I'm calculating the
56:48 - force I need to both figure out its
56:50 - direction a normalized vector here
56:53 - pointing in the opposite direction of
56:54 - velocity and its magnitude the
56:56 - coefficient of friction by making up
56:58 - times the normal strip then times the
57:02 - strength of the normal force which is
57:04 - some value scaled according to mass what
57:07 - do I do next apply the force and I'm
57:14 - realizing I want to call this friction
57:47 - let's run this and see what happens
57:57 - I'm gonna have to wait a little while I
57:58 - can wait
58:21 - it came to a stop how delightful
58:27 - yeah people I've been away for the chat
58:29 - to finish saying the audio is gone
58:32 - andrew is asking can you write vector
58:35 - normal eyes Moulton egative one in one
58:37 - line and absolutely you could
58:39 - I think the audio has come back yeah
58:51 - clipping is saying I declared a variable
58:53 - called friction inside of a function
58:55 - called friction you know it's kind of
58:56 - okay because this is this dot Frick that
58:58 - one up there is this dot friction and
59:00 - this is a local variable inside the
59:02 - function so they're actually distinct um
59:04 - the audio was going didn't use the
59:06 - microphone for a second there was a loud
59:07 - noise in the hallway so you can hear
59:08 - because there's like a buzz in the room
59:10 - when I meet the microphone here's the
59:12 - demonstrate the difference not you did
59:16 - not muted
59:20 - okay
60:19 - I just want to quickly point out that
60:20 - this would also be valid so these vector
60:23 - operations can be chained meaning you
60:25 - can say make a copy of the velocity
60:27 - normalize it and multiply it by negative
60:29 - one and the result goes in this vector
60:30 - friction this variable friction but I
60:33 - generally prefer to write it step by
60:35 - step just for clarity sake
60:48 - all right
60:58 - it would be so onerous saying would be
61:00 - cool if you drew the acting forces on
61:02 - the ball yeah yeah yes thank you for
61:05 - suggesting that I mean leave my exercise
61:08 - suggestions our slope slope surface and
61:14 - draw vectors here
61:38 - okay this is a nice moment for me to
61:43 - take a minute and look now that this is
61:45 - working this is a nice moment for me to
61:47 - take a minute and just add an array so
61:48 - we can see a bunch of fees all with
61:50 - different masses and see how they behave
61:52 - within the same environment so let me
61:54 - quickly add that in
62:22 - here you can see I am making ten mover
62:26 - objects everyone will start with a Y
62:28 - position at 200 but each will start at a
62:30 - random X position and with a random mass
62:32 - some value between 1 & 8
62:45 - it also might make sense for this new
62:48 - variable to be a global variable I think
62:50 - you could make reason we could also
62:54 - might make sense for you to make this
62:55 - new variable a global variable just so I
62:57 - can play with it outside of in the
62:59 - interior of the class itself I'm gonna
63:02 - leave it up there
63:15 - and then inside draw this is a nice
63:17 - opportunity to be fruit for me to use a
63:19 - for of loop because I want to say for
63:21 - every mover of its right it's hard to
63:24 - say the word of which when you're
63:25 - describing it's really for each or for
63:27 - and really makes sense but the loop that
63:29 - you want in JavaScript it's more of a
63:30 - whole other video about that but I want
63:32 - to look at every single mover inside of
63:34 - the movers array and one way of doing
63:36 - that is for every mover whoops
63:39 - for every mover of movers run all of
63:43 - this code and let's take a look and see
63:48 - what happens now they're all bouncing
63:52 - together they hit the bottom at a
63:54 - slightly different time they should all
63:55 - respond to wind differently based on
63:58 - their size not their mass and then
64:02 - they'll also have their own friction
64:04 - according that's scaled according to
64:05 - their mass as well
64:15 - and after a little while all of them
64:17 - will roll to a stop does this feel
64:22 - accurate does this what does this feel
64:24 - like well I suspect that by playing
64:28 - around with the coefficient of friction
64:30 - the relative strength of the way the
64:33 - gravitational force all of these things
64:35 - all of these variables you can tune to
64:38 - have the simulation feel more or less
64:41 - like different kinds of material in
64:42 - different kinds of environments
64:51 - now while this was a you know somewhat
64:54 - real-world so while here I am attempting
64:59 - to actually write a code that uses the
65:03 - formula for friction in the real world I
65:05 - could also do this with a very quick and
65:08 - dirty algorithm that I think it's worth
65:10 - showing you just that the sort of tail
65:12 - end of this video
65:18 - ultimately what friction does is it
65:21 - takes a little bit off of the velocity
65:23 - every single frame we lose some speed as
65:25 - this object is coasting along a
65:28 - particular surface the friction slows it
65:31 - down another way to lose a little bit of
65:39 - velocity with each and every step in
65:41 - time would be to just take a percentage
65:43 - of velocity off no I could actually
65:45 - comment all of this out whoops
65:49 - I don't want to do it that way why did
65:52 - it do that Oh cuz this I'll do this
65:59 - I could comment all of this out whatever
66:03 - and just say this dot velocity multiply
66:08 - 0.95 meeting shrink the velocity vector
66:12 - every time step if it's in contact with
66:14 - the with the edge with the bottom
66:15 - surface by 5% and let's just see if this
66:18 - has the same result or different
66:37 - ultimately in the end it's pretty
66:40 - similar they all come rolling to a stop
66:42 - did you notice though that they all seem
66:44 - to come rolling to a stop at exactly the
66:45 - same moment
66:46 - well that's because one flaw with this
66:48 - particular method is that I'm not taking
66:52 - into account the object's mass so you
66:54 - know for just having things sort of
66:55 - slowed down over time this might be a
66:57 - really easy way to do it if you want to
66:59 - make sure that that force that friction
67:01 - force is scaled to mass then maybe doing
67:03 - it the vector way is then what is not
67:05 - inherently better than the other these
67:06 - are just different ways to produce the
67:08 - same kind of effect
67:36 - all right where are we 151 we're doing
67:38 - well people
68:00 - top-down
68:06 - so this wraps up this particular
68:09 - demonstration of coding friction into a
68:11 - simple 2d simulation physics simulation
68:15 - yes different-shaped static yeah static
68:20 - and can I bring this down these are all
68:23 - the things I'm gonna suggest for viewers
68:24 - to do so this wraps up this very basic
68:28 - demonstration of coding a friction force
68:30 - into a simple 2d physics simulation
68:33 - there's a lot that you could try before
68:35 - you move we move on to the next video so
68:36 - we'll try these things as an exercise I
68:38 - wrote them all down one is it's pretty
68:40 - arbitrary that it decided to have this
68:42 - sideways view of the world I'm taking a
68:44 - slice a two-dimensional slice and things
68:46 - are falling up and down and moving left
68:47 - and right what if what I were actually
68:49 - looking at was a top-down view of a 2d
68:51 - world
68:52 - so I'm actually overhead maybe a
68:53 - billiards table and lots of things are
68:55 - rolling around this surface and
68:57 - experiencing friction how might what you
68:59 - could change but if I were sticking into
69:06 - a 2d world how could I do something
69:09 - where the actual surface but if I were
69:16 - staying with it in it but if I were to
69:19 - stay in this world that's the vertical
69:22 - slice what if I wanted instead of having
69:26 - a horizontal surface at the bottom to
69:29 - actually have a sloped surface within
69:32 - the frame and that my objects are
69:36 - falling down and maybe rolling down this
69:38 - particular surface how would I how would
69:41 - I have the force of gravity behave and
69:43 - how would I have the force of friction
69:44 - behave how would I calculate that normal
69:47 - force I haven't really covered how you
69:51 - would do in truth a lot of the things
69:55 - you would truthfully the material that
69:59 - you need to do this is coming in chapter
70:02 - 3 where I'm going to look at angles and
70:04 - polar coordinates and things like a
70:06 - pendulum simulation so some of the ways
70:08 - that you would calculate a force
70:10 - perpendicular to a non horizontal
70:12 - perfectly horizontal surface or coming
70:14 - soon but if you maybe want to look ahead
70:16 - or experiment with how to do that I try
70:18 - that as an exercise
70:19 - I am completely ignoring the difference
70:28 - between static friction
70:30 - what's the friction that's holding
70:31 - something in place when it's not moving
70:34 - versus kinetic friction that friction
70:35 - when it's in motion that might be
70:37 - something you consider folding into this
70:38 - particular example can you demonstrate
70:39 - those two differences and then finally I
70:43 - think this visualization would be so
70:45 - much more compelling or illustrative if
70:48 - I were to actually draw the various
70:50 - vectors so could I draw a velocity
70:53 - vector the gravity vector the wind
70:56 - vector though could I draw the velocity
71:00 - vector as well as vector draw visual
71:02 - representations of all the forces so
71:04 - could I see the drawing of the friction
71:05 - force the gravitational force the wind
71:08 - force all those other forces within the
71:10 - simulation itself so if you try any of
71:11 - those and you make your own version of
71:13 - them please go to the URL that's in this
71:15 - video's description where you can share
71:17 - your variation I would love to check
71:18 - them out and maybe also show them in a
71:20 - future video or live stream where I
71:22 - sometimes show community contributions
71:24 - from the website all right so guess what
71:25 - you might think I'm kind of done with
71:28 - friction no I am going to next in the
71:30 - next video do a different force that's
71:32 - known as a drag force what happened
71:42 - blazing what does it mean for me to be
71:44 - blazing really and I just is it
71:48 - obviously I'm like tired today so what's
71:50 - going on
71:50 - maybe they I lost all my hair and so my
71:52 - brain doesn't work well anymore because
71:54 - it was protecting it somehow from the
71:57 - aliens that are trying to communicate I
71:58 - mean need like some tinfoil to wear now
72:09 - I have two more case studies to look at
72:11 - related to forces one in the next video
72:13 - is very similar to friction I actually
72:15 - look at a drag force of air resistance
72:16 - so what happens when something a body is
72:19 - falling through the air how does what
72:21 - what sort of force acts on it or a body
72:23 - is moving through a liquid so that's
72:25 - known as drag or a fluid resistance I'm
72:27 - gonna look at that force in the next
72:28 - video and then finally I want to circle
72:30 - back to that circle being attracted to
72:33 - the mouth position and unpack a circle
72:37 - back and look at that and finally I want
72:41 - to circle all the way back and look at
72:42 - that first example I made when I looked
72:44 - at acceleration of this object being
72:46 - attracted to the mouse and make a
72:48 - version of that but use the actual
72:50 - formula for gravitational attraction
72:52 - itself so just a couple more videos left
72:55 - in this chapter two and we'll be moving
72:57 - on to chapter three and I hope you're
72:58 - enjoying it and all that stuff see you
73:00 - soon all right um you have to make the
73:10 - circles rainbow-colored it is your duty
73:13 - I agree I agree
73:16 - I don't though there's 320 so all these
73:19 - people have joined this livestream just
73:21 - in time for me to take a break can I do
73:24 - can I do the drag one quickly before I
73:28 - take a break it's been actually very
73:30 - similar to this one Manuel Lopez I'm
73:35 - happily starving while watching digging
73:40 - I think actually I'm taking a break
73:41 - would be useful for me right now so I am
73:44 - going to go ahead it's a half it's
73:45 - halfway through my livestream and I am
73:49 - going gloss
73:51 - LOL glassing Oh glossing over not
73:55 - glazing over oh yeah
73:57 - Oh glazing over 2b means my eyes are
74:01 - glazing over and nothing's making sense
74:02 - anymore did you notice the addition of
74:04 - my haircut I have new glasses you might
74:06 - not notice that I have new glasses
74:08 - because exactly was my old glasses but
74:11 - they're new they're a slightly different
74:12 - color
74:12 - I had a glasses emergency they snapped
74:15 - in half I had the same glasses for like
74:17 - two or three years somebody could
74:18 - probably fact-check that by going back
74:19 - through all my videos and see when I got
74:21 - different glasses but please do that
74:24 - Internet it would just that would be an
74:26 - interesting tidbit from knowledge for me
74:27 - to know but I had to mergency run to the
74:29 - glasses store I they happily had the
74:31 - same pair of glasses in stock with a
74:33 - different color bought them new lenses
74:34 - in boom but I also went to the eye
74:36 - doctor oh this is what you're all here
74:38 - for right my update on my eyes what do
74:41 - the eye doctor I have news for everybody
74:45 - I'm getting a new pair of glasses it's a
74:48 - new prescription in I don't know which
74:53 - sound effect goes with this so soon you
75:01 - will not see me do this this is what I
75:04 - do now I have my coding train notebook
75:06 - where I write down thoughts and feelings
75:08 - and dreams and desires suggested
75:11 - exercise ideas then I go to read my
75:13 - notebook aha I can see it now so
75:18 - hopefully it's gonna help my vision
75:21 - there before I take a break I would like
75:35 - to thank the sponsor of the coding train
75:38 - brilliant brilliant brilliant is an app
75:42 - a website a way of life I suppose
75:45 - it's something that I really found
75:47 - myself enjoying more and more ever since
75:49 - they became a sponsor and I got to use
75:50 - their website and I keep going through
75:52 - it too you know if you I mean if you
75:54 - want to learn about friction and physics
75:56 - I bet there's a whole course on
75:58 - brilliant about that stuff in fact I
76:00 - know that there is I have more recently
76:02 - been looking
76:03 - I'm gonna switch over here to a video
76:04 - there course of computer science
76:06 - fundamentals topics in computer science
76:09 - what the thing that I really love about
76:11 - it is the fact that all the lessons are
76:12 - interactive so it's a different way of
76:14 - learning than having a weirdo on the
76:16 - internet talk to you which is what
76:17 - you're experiencing right now but being
76:19 - able to learn some of these concepts
76:20 - through a step-by-step interactive
76:22 - lessons one thing that's really nice
76:23 - about that is you don't get stuck with
76:24 - all the syntax and so what's what's
76:28 - especially nice for me is like I never
76:29 - really took computer science courses so
76:33 - I just kind of learned a lot of this
76:34 - stuff through different programming
76:35 - classes and other teachers and books
76:37 - that I read and so it's not it helps me
76:39 - and sort of think about the lessons that
76:40 - I want to do to sort of see how somebody
76:42 - else has written InDesign to curriculum
76:44 - so you can see it's all done with sort
76:46 - of like pseudocode style and you can
76:47 - move these blocks around but then what's
76:49 - here now it I really want to show to you
76:52 - is that you can also do everything also
76:54 - with Python so brilliant has built
76:56 - Python into the browser itself so you
76:59 - can run exercises and learn the code
77:01 - concepts and then actually code it with
77:03 - Python and Python you know if I were to
77:06 - suggest a language that I don't use on
77:08 - this channel that you should also
77:09 - experiment way they learned Python would
77:12 - probably be right up there at the top of
77:14 - my list oh I see that dusty in the chat
77:17 - by the way is talking about momentum and
77:19 - angular momentum and inertia again if
77:21 - you want to do a much deeper dive into
77:23 - this physics stuff brilliant is the
77:26 - place for you I mean I'm really glossing
77:28 - over glazing over some of these like
77:31 - lower-level concepts and actually one of
77:33 - the things that well let's look at
77:35 - really quickly together if you go to the
77:38 - website I've signed in I do have a
77:40 - premium account I'll talk about how you
77:41 - can get well you could just go to
77:42 - brilliant org slash coding train you'll
77:44 - get if you want to unlock all the
77:46 - features all of the courses all of the
77:48 - the archive of daily prom challenges you
77:51 - can get 20% off the first 200 people to
77:54 - to go to that link and subscribe to a
77:57 - premium edition we'll get that but just
77:59 - even just scrolling through the daily
78:01 - challenges you'll see that a lot of them
78:03 - are very look at this a spring based one
78:05 - I actually so I did this one earlier and
78:08 - I got it wrong so you know I like to
78:09 - like do a challenge and hope to get it
78:11 - right but I really should just let
78:12 - myself get them wrong I totally did this
78:14 - one I you should try this one I got it
78:16 - wrong I was
78:17 - and I and I make tutorials about spring
78:19 - forces and I got it wrong so I I was
78:21 - gonna do this one which III looked at
78:24 - while I was in a meeting and it looked
78:27 - really fun because it's like so let's
78:30 - see if I can let's see if we could do
78:32 - this quickly before I take my break
78:34 - let's do it together so this is this
78:36 - idea of balancing scales so if s given
78:41 - to balance scales we might ask how the
78:42 - green triangle ways okay the green
78:45 - triangle is T and the blue square is s
78:48 - so s plus T square plus triangle equals
78:51 - three because they're balanced two
78:52 - squares plus one triangle goes v so we
78:55 - could to solve for one of these we could
78:58 - subtract one equation from the other
79:00 - so we'd have like two s minus s is s t
79:05 - minus T is gone then 5 minus 2/3 is 2 so
79:08 - if so if I subtract this bottom equation
79:10 - from this one I would get s equals 2 I
79:14 - did look at this earlier it's sort of
79:19 - like going through this yet s equals 2
79:20 - and it's showing this visually oh this
79:22 - would be awesome to do is like a p5
79:24 - sketch where like as you like
79:26 - interactively take these things on and
79:28 - off it moves
79:29 - somebody do that that'd be cool
79:32 - so you can see this is what I just
79:34 - talked through to s plus t minus s plus
79:37 - t minus 3 s equals 2 so now this I
79:41 - suspect we're going to be able to do
79:43 - with the same methodology let me go to
79:45 - the whiteboard now I think that I want
79:48 - to leave this I'm going to leave this up
79:51 - here because I'm going to do a video I'm
79:59 - gonna the next tutorial I'm going to
80:01 - make use of it but let me write down all
80:03 - of these equations so I've got two T
80:06 - equals s plus 4 let's see if we can do
80:10 - this you guys keep beat 2 T plus s
80:13 - equals 4
80:15 - keep let me know if I'm doing this
80:16 - correctly ok I need to look at the
80:18 - question s plus T equals C for circle S
80:25 - Plus T equals C look at those two
80:28 - equations
80:31 - 2's plus C equals 3t to ass plus what
80:38 - was it C equals 3t ah 2 s plus CC equals
80:46 - 3t okay so what do I want to do well I
80:56 - could do this equation minus this
80:58 - equation right so is if I'm if I'm
81:01 - saying like very little space here a b c
81:05 - let me take equation a minus B so 2t
81:09 - minus T is T s minus s is nothing equals
81:13 - 4 minus C so I know T equals 4 minus C
81:18 - do I have something with just T and C in
81:20 - it yes yes this right
81:24 - oh no but this will is this gonna do
81:29 - what I want
81:30 - what if I were to take oh well I could
81:33 - do s plus 4 minus C equals C right
81:39 - because I could take 4 minus C and put
81:42 - it in there so s equals to C minus 4
81:48 - this is not really getting me anywhere
81:50 - is it well what else do i what else
81:58 - could I do
82:00 - so now C and T for 2's
82:13 - I'm like losing my oh you know what's
82:18 - interesting I could do I have another
82:21 - idea
82:21 - I have another idea
82:28 - what do you add these three t plus two s
82:33 - equals four plus C and then I also have
82:39 - three t minus 2 s equals C aha
82:46 - so let me subtract these two for s
82:51 - equals 4 could that possibly be right s
82:56 - is 1 am i right
83:05 - the first equation is wrong 2 s equals 2
83:14 - T equals s plus 400 I'm solving the
83:22 - wrong problem equation a is 4 let's just
83:30 - start over start over edit all that part
83:32 - out 2 T equals s plus 4 oh this is gonna
83:39 - make this easier isn't it like I still
83:45 - do the same sort of thing I can do 2 t
83:49 - minus C equals 4 minus T oh look at this
83:58 - right and then 3 t minus C equals 4 or C
84:06 - equals 4 minus 3 T right no 3 t minus 4
84:19 - C equals 3 t minus 4 that seems useful
84:25 - right okay plus 4 no minus 4 right so
84:34 - many that chat says 3t plus 4 equals C
84:38 - people are telling me I'm totally doing
84:40 - this wrong I'm gonna get there this is
84:44 - the last thing I do today I'm gonna get
84:45 - there oh this is much harder than I
84:47 - thought
84:47 - it's not I don't think so it's just
84:48 - performance anxiety here okay all right
84:54 - so now what was I doing I wanted to I
85:01 - wanted to add these two together I like
85:05 - that or does that not really do me any
85:12 - good okay what I could say wait let's
85:16 - just confirm is this correct you're
85:21 - correct okay okay I'm correct
85:23 - Simon's probably already solved this
85:25 - like for like the generic case like
85:31 - something I don't know I came in yes
85:33 - let's see where do I want to do next
85:38 - to t minus C equals 4 minus it so C
85:41 - equals 3t minus or what does that get me
85:42 - um because I could replace now we could
85:48 - put this here put this here I want to
85:51 - get rid of look at this this is a 3t
85:56 - okay got it got it got it
85:58 - these two these two these two now huh
86:01 - there we go 2 s C minus C equals 4 s
86:09 - equals 2
86:10 - okay we got 1 s equals to s equals to
86:14 - people s equals 2
86:16 - well that's good to know so we could
86:19 - change a lot of things we've got s so
86:23 - that means
86:26 - I I hate to erase anything but let's say
86:31 - we've solved now that s is 2 so
86:34 - basically I'm saying oh well now this is
86:36 - easy so s equals 2 so 2 T equals 6 so T
86:40 - equals 3 s is 2 and T equals 3 and now I
86:44 - need to just know what C is C is s plus
86:47 - 2 C is 5 I think we got this
86:52 - so now if T right T was what the
86:56 - triangle was 3 so this is 12 how do I
87:01 - make 12 out of 5 and 2 well 2 2 circles
87:09 - and 1 square 2 circles in 1 square is
87:13 - that one of the options
87:22 - Simon didn't solve it yet no that's
87:24 - impossible there's no way I solve this
87:27 - faster than Simon not possible well
87:31 - maybe I got it wrong
87:31 - oh but you enjoyed that and want to have
87:38 - fun with problems like that on your own
87:40 - the other thing that the thing that I
87:42 - really like about this is looking at the
87:44 - explanations in seeing how people did it
87:47 - oh look at this so first of all what I
87:50 - think would be actually quite exciting
87:52 - to do which I didn't I did it through
87:53 - like formula is actually just doing
87:54 - visually by like moving things around
87:56 - which as you can see that's what
87:58 - happened here right oh you could just
87:59 - add look at that oh that is so clever
88:02 - you take the circle put it down here
88:04 - take the triangle the square and put it
88:06 - down here take the two squares away oh
88:08 - my god that would've solved it in like
88:10 - two seconds
88:12 - look this show you that again look at
88:14 - that so if you take well I didn't even
88:18 - need the first one because you just take
88:20 - the triangle two square and put it there
88:22 - put the circle there they're still
88:23 - balanced and then just take two squares
88:26 - away oh that is so cool so if you hope
88:30 - you like stuff like this I encourage you
88:32 - to check out brilliant at brilliant
88:35 - org slash Co d'etre and we'll let them

88:56 - 20% off all right so I'm gonna take a
88:58 - short break when I come back I'm gonna
89:00 - look at drag fluid resistance
89:05 - gravitational attraction I have an hour
89:07 - I have an hour we'll see how we do we'll
89:10 - see how we go all right I'll be back
89:11 - shortly
89:13 - [Music]
89:15 - and by the way quick update Manuel Lopez
89:20 - did finally go and eat eat
89:22 - thank good job I'm glad you've got your
89:25 - belly is full you're full of sustenance
89:27 - stay healthy get sleep next thing is
89:30 - sleep be with family and friends all
89:32 - those things

93:19 - [Music]
94:17 - all right we are back
94:19 - [Music]
94:33 - okay quick announcements or it's not
94:37 - really an announcement thanks again to
94:38 - brilliant I hope you had fun with this
94:40 - puzzle I wanted to mention the coding
94:46 - train score I've talked about this a few
94:48 - times if you would enjoy any of these
94:50 - things they're available to you don't no
94:53 - need for you to buy them if you will not
94:54 - enjoy them it's fine with me either way
94:56 - just want to make the stuff available it
95:00 - is a little bit a little bit extra
95:02 - income to go for that book behind but I
95:07 - did want to make an announcement that
95:08 - I'm told breaking news there have been
95:21 - enough hoodies ordered for the coding
95:24 - train hoodies to be made but get your
95:26 - order in probably sometime in the next
95:29 - week or so I'll post in the discord
95:32 - maybe as a reminder somebody remind me
95:34 - to the exact date but there will be a
95:36 - deadline for this because they're gonna
95:37 - make a certain number of them based on
95:38 - people who ordered them so if you do
95:40 - want one of these and then if you don't
95:41 - you don't need to before I was like
95:43 - please order one because I wanted them
95:45 - to make enough so I could order some for
95:46 - myself but now there's enough so only if
95:48 - you want one there you go
95:51 - I will say no not gonna like be all
95:53 - salesy but these notebooks are so
95:55 - delightful I have like literally like a
95:57 - and I use them all the time now and I
96:01 - really quite enjoy them although I do
96:02 - want to do want to make a another one
96:06 - with because there's one thing like the
96:09 - the graph paper maybe some of those are
96:11 - you can tell me is this like European
96:13 - style graph paper or like um so hold on
96:16 - so this is what the can you see this
96:18 - maybe if I turn the light on it's very
96:23 - very small I don't know I can't I can't
96:25 - see it I don't know if you can but oh
96:28 - look there's me oh and I'm upside down
96:30 - and now I'm right-side up just show this
96:33 - to you kind of closer let's see maybe I
96:35 - can get this in the this is obviously
96:38 - really important what I'm doing right
96:39 - now
96:40 - um come over here so I'd actually work
96:45 - there if I like it focuses on it you can
96:48 - see that graph paper it's like very
96:49 - light and very tiny so I think I want to
96:51 - get a little bit larger graph paper in a
96:53 - little bit darker for the next round the
96:54 - next round okay so back to some coding
97:04 - and stuff
97:05 - next up there we go let's see
97:21 - yeah
97:28 - okay
97:30 - use a black sharpie just measure is it
97:33 - 1/4 inch or X number of millimeters
97:36 - I would guess X number of millimeters
97:47 - okay
97:56 - there we go
98:03 - why is that why do I have a negative in
98:06 - mine and I guess maybe the alright well
98:17 - okay
98:21 - all right so I guess I could have erased
98:26 - that after all because I'm just gonna go
98:28 - erase it now oh the whiteboard camera is
98:31 - off let's do something about that
98:45 - okay
98:56 - all right
99:05 - kind of wanted to okay
99:19 - like a spherical body but I'll just use
99:22 - my eraser
99:35 - welcome back welcome back oh where was
99:42 - the super chat there was a super chat
99:45 - where welcome to the kodi train where we
99:47 - discussed the pitch of notepad graph
99:50 - paper didn't even know pitch was the
99:53 - word to describe that all right I'm
99:57 - really feeling quite sleepy I can I can
100:01 - do this
100:08 - 223 less than an hour
100:11 - I'm so I think I feel confident at a
100:14 - minimum I can cover this topic and at a
100:18 - maximum I will also do the gravitational
100:20 - attraction though that feels a little
100:22 - bit yeah Thank You Koby who's pointing
100:28 - out the difference between the Wikipedia
100:29 - formula on this one
100:31 - welcome back coder that's a good one
100:34 - welcome back dreams and I don't know the
100:40 - words okay welcome back
100:47 - oh hello we are here you're here I am
100:55 - here markers attacking me I know it
101:03 - needs to happen
101:07 - [Music]
101:11 - earlier today on the coding train we
101:15 - left off with number ten thousand eight
101:18 - hundred and fifty eight
101:21 - let's continue
101:25 - 1466
101:26 - [Music]
101:35 - I know it's making me go sleep more
101:36 - inside
101:37 - [Music]
101:47 - I have returned for yet another chapter
101:53 - two video on forces and in this video I
101:56 - want to cover the drag force what is a
102:00 - drag force what's the formula for
102:01 - calculating a drag force and how do I
102:03 - take that formula and apply it in code
102:06 - so previously I did this with friction
102:07 - so this is my little series of case
102:09 - studies when a look at friction I'm
102:11 - gonna look at drag next I'm gonna look
102:12 - at gravitational attraction but these
102:14 - are just three examples they're nice
102:16 - ways for me to show you
102:18 - hey these formulas they're not so scary
102:20 - we can unpack them we can turn them into
102:22 - code and let's just
103:05 - it's getting warm in here again come on
103:07 - air conditioning really hello and
103:14 - welcome back to another video in Chapter
103:17 - two the nature of code about forces so
103:19 - the last video I look at it friction and
103:20 - modeling friction and in this video I
103:22 - want to look at a drag force which is
103:24 - quite similar to friction but also
103:26 - different isn't that that's why I'm
103:27 - looking at it but what I'm really doing
103:29 - here in these in these four wrap up
103:31 - videos to chapter two is it's taking
103:34 - doing some case studies what are
103:35 - formulas that you might find in a
103:37 - textbook or Wikipedia that you just sort
103:39 - of like feel like what are those mean
103:40 - how do I even use that try to unpack
103:42 - those formulas and apply them in code so
104:05 - so the first formula so the case study
104:09 - that this video will examine is drag
104:12 - drag force sometimes called air
104:15 - resistance it's a kind of friction and
104:17 - it's part of the field of study of fluid
104:19 - dynamics and there's all sorts of
104:21 - interesting fluid simulation crazy stuff
104:23 - you could do and there's lift and all
104:26 - sorts of a lot you could get into it's
104:44 - getting hot in here
104:47 - maybe just remove the sweater or that
104:50 - would just be enough Dayenu
105:09 - there's the concept of Reynolds numbers
105:12 - there's laminar flow oh my god there's
105:15 - turbulence most first of topics but I'm
105:17 - going to boil things down and try to
105:20 - look at this particular formula for
105:24 - calculating a drag force
105:35 - and it follows and and I've brought that
105:38 - formula right here into the nature of
105:40 - codebook and this corresponds to this
105:43 - particular diagram okay tell me the tale
105:47 - any of your Stokes I'll tell you a
105:49 - tearing up Navy no Stokes on a winter
105:51 - night started with fluid passing a
105:59 - three-hour computational simulation a
106:01 - three-hour cavitational simulation I I
106:12 - brought that formula right here into the
106:14 - nature of codebook and this is what I'm
106:17 - going to use so let's come over to the
106:18 - whiteboard and replace the friction
106:28 - formula
107:20 - this is the formula we want to implement
107:23 - and the context of what implemented in
107:26 - is a two dimensional p5 canvas where we
107:31 - have a body that's moving with a current
107:34 - I'm gonna point it down that's moving
107:37 - with a current velocity point it down
107:49 - once again we're calculating a force so
107:53 - we need to both determine the direction
107:55 - of the force and the magnitude let's
107:57 - start with direction
108:01 - what is identical to what we did with
108:05 - friction in air is that in turn
108:07 - identical to friction is the direction
108:10 - of drag we have the velocity unit vector
108:13 - and negative 1/2 so the drag force
108:16 - points in the opposite direction of
108:20 - velocity so that's something we already
108:21 - know how to do it's scaled with this
108:23 - negative 1/2 because you know science
108:25 - but to us in our p5 world whether this
108:28 - is negative 1/2 or 5 it's gonna be less
108:30 - important because this is made-up units
108:32 - of measurement anyway then we have to
108:39 - start looking at other aspects of this
108:42 - I forgot what Rho is Rho I know it a is
108:45 - surface area this is speed what's Rho
108:47 - again density that's what I thought yeah
108:52 - yeah okay yeah but coefficient is
108:56 - different than you know whatever
109:13 - let's go through these one at a time so
109:16 - this Greek letter Rho is stands for
109:21 - density so what is this moving through
109:23 - well if I were to take this marker and
109:25 - drop it there would be air resistance
109:26 - it's moving through a gas the air so
109:29 - what is the density of the air versus if
109:30 - it landed in water what's the density of
109:32 - the water versus mud or jello or
109:33 - whatever kind of thing it's moving
109:34 - through but for us the important thing
109:41 - here assuming this is a what am i what
109:47 - am I saying here what's the word I'm
109:49 - looking for it's the same all over the
109:50 - place zooming this is a not universal
109:55 - this is a consistent continuous there's
109:58 - a word I'm looking for us it's
110:00 - completely escape mic it went with my
110:02 - hair it's on the floor of the barbershop
110:03 - with all that air my vocabulary assuming
110:11 - that this is just full of all the same
110:12 - stuff this is a constant so the density
110:16 - is a constant so let's mark this off
110:18 - with a c' for constant now a what is a
110:23 - I'm skipping this one for a second this
110:24 - is the surface area meaning and if I
110:27 - come back to this diagram you can sort
110:29 - of see like oh what is the surface area
110:31 - that's coming in contact with the liquid
110:34 - or gas the fluid uniform uniform
110:38 - buta form uniform uniform why am I not
110:41 - why can I not think of that word oh my
110:43 - god thank you everybody you're the
110:44 - greatest
110:45 - mwah homogeneous magis it's all so good
110:48 - a homogeneous uniform
111:06 - in our p5 world assuming this circle his
111:09 - body is moving through a kind of
111:10 - homogeneous uniform space it's all the
111:12 - same stuff the density of this air or
111:15 - fluid or whatever it is is a constant so
111:18 - Rho the density is a constant shoot I
111:31 - forgot that I had skipping V squared for
111:42 - a second let's go to a so a this is
111:45 - surface area so if I come back to the
111:47 - diagram in the nature of codebook we can
111:49 - see here the idea is what is the surface
111:51 - area of the object coming into contact
111:53 - with the fluid and you can think of it
111:55 - like this is it aerodynamic or not does
111:57 - it come with like a to a sharp point
111:59 - where there's a very little surface area
112:00 - or is it kind of like a wide load and
112:03 - there's a lot of surface area moving
112:05 - through this fluid huh
112:17 - while this is something I absolutely
112:19 - could try to model based on thinking
112:22 - about different shapes and different
112:23 - sizes of those shapes I could also just
112:26 - consider that a constant and maybe I'll
112:28 - just say all of the objects in my world
112:30 - come in with a come in with a surface
112:32 - area of one but I'm really just going to
112:34 - consider this to be a constant so if I
112:38 - were to model it it might make the
112:39 - ultimate simulation more dynamic and
112:41 - more realistic but it's one thing that I
112:43 - think it's a detail that I can mostly
112:45 - ignore especially if I have a lot of
112:47 - circular bodies of relative similar
112:49 - shape especially have a lot of a
112:54 - circular bodies of relative similars so
112:58 - especially if I have a lot of circular
113:00 - bodies of relative similar size then we
113:08 - have the coefficient of drag itself
113:11 - what's that that's a constant it's a
113:13 - constant and one and it's a constant
113:20 - that has to do is the strength of the
113:21 - drag force and has to do with what is
113:23 - the quality of the material the fluid
113:26 - the air the gas the liquid all these
113:29 - words are the same thing it's a cut it's
113:33 - a constant that sort of it's a constant
113:36 - that maps to the relative strength of
113:39 - the drag force itself so is the object
113:41 - moving through mud or is it moving
113:42 - through air or some kind of very
113:44 - lightweight gas versus a heavier liquid
113:47 - density and this coefficient are kind of
113:49 - related but you know what I'm saying is
113:51 - all of these are constants what I'm
113:58 - saying is all of these these three
114:00 - elements with this negative 1/2 which is
114:03 - literally a constant I could consider to
114:05 - be a constant in my simulation so I can
114:08 - actually take this formula and simplify
114:11 - it greatly
114:23 - a drag force is equal to negative 1
114:28 - times the coefficient the cops drag
114:31 - constantly drag force is equal to
114:43 - negative 1 times some constant I'll call
114:46 - that the coefficient of drag it's an
114:48 - acute it's a constant that takes into
114:50 - account the negative 1/2 the surface
114:52 - area the density and the coefficient of
114:54 - drag times V squared times the unit
115:00 - vector V so once again the direction is
115:03 - in the opposite direction of velocity
115:05 - and it's scaled according to some
115:07 - constant times and this one is really
115:08 - important this is the speed squared it's
115:11 - the magnitude of the velocity vector and
115:14 - this is key those faster the object this
115:17 - was not the case with friction not the
115:19 - case with kinetic friction doesn't
115:20 - matter how fast the object was moving
115:22 - the friction force is proportional
115:24 - proportional to that speed but in the
115:26 - case of drag it's absolutely
115:28 - proportional if I were to hold this
115:30 - marker absolutely still it's not moving
115:34 - at all there is no drag force on it but
115:38 - if it's moving very very fast that drag
115:40 - force will be stronger it's moving
115:42 - slowly it'll be weaker and that's
115:44 - absolutely something I want to model so
115:45 - you want the magnitude of this vector
115:46 - squared in our formula and guess what we
115:48 - are ready to put this formula into our
115:52 - code why did I say it that way and we
115:56 - are ready to put this for now that we've
116:00 - boiled it down to this simpler version
116:02 - of the formula we can apply this in code
116:12 - oh right Thank You Koby for the super
116:16 - chat reminder v-squared maybe yes thank
116:27 - you Chris Rea let me I'll also note that
116:37 - the magnitude of a vector is often
116:40 - written as with two bars along the side
116:43 - whoops I should also note that another
116:54 - way that you might see another notation
116:55 - for writing the magnitude of the vector
116:57 - is the name of the vector with two bars
116:59 - along each side so you could also also
117:01 - rewrite this formula like this
117:28 - first voice was the best place keep that
117:30 - keep the crazy voice where are we were
117:34 - timewise 240 okay yeah well I don't
117:36 - think I'm doing the gravitational
117:37 - attraction today but I'm very pleased
117:39 - it's Viking just every time if I get
117:41 - further along through this eventually
117:43 - all the tutorials will be made and this
117:45 - is okay
118:02 - whoops
118:05 - second
118:15 - we just change a couple things have been
118:19 - like
118:32 - okay
118:36 - this is exactly the same example that I
118:39 - finished with in the previous video and
118:41 - the only thing that I've done is well
118:43 - I'm having the movers start a little bit
118:45 - higher up because it's gonna give me
118:46 - more space to work with and I also have
118:49 - changed the name of the function that
118:50 - previously was called friction and now
118:52 - it's called drag so I'm actually just
118:56 - gonna take out all of the code but
118:59 - limonade what was before friction and
119:02 - now calculate a drag force start over
119:17 - I'm going to begin with the code that I
119:19 - had in from the previous video the exact
119:21 - same code the only thing that I've done
119:23 - differently is that I've renamed the
119:24 - friction function and called it drag
119:27 - friction function function friction
119:29 - friction function one more time with
119:33 - feeling
119:40 - I'm going to
119:46 - well how do we even we're at where we're
119:48 - even am I in the world that's that's the
119:50 - question I don't have and have to
119:56 - demonstrate how to implement this I'm
119:57 - taking a exact duplicate of the code I
120:00 - wrote in the previous video
120:01 - demonstrating friction and all I've done
120:03 - here is I've renamed the friction
120:04 - function and I'm calling it drag so what
120:08 - are elements is there anything here that
120:09 - I want to keep well actually there is
120:11 - one thing that I want to keep which is
120:13 - that I want to when I'm getting the
120:15 - direction of the vector
120:17 - I want negative one times the velocity
120:19 - unit vector
120:35 - so this is what I want to keep I want
120:37 - the direction now of the drag force and
120:45 - I've got it here in this variable called
120:47 - drag what's next
120:49 - I need the magnitude of the drag force
120:52 - it is speed squared times the
120:57 - coefficient of drag well let's make up a
121:01 - coefficient let's call it 0.1 the speed
121:06 - is this dot velocity dot mag and now
121:09 - drag set the drags magnitude whoops and
121:19 - then set the drags magnitude to C times
121:23 - speed and apply the force here we go
121:34 - notice anything look how it feels like
121:36 - they're kind of like well I've lost the
121:44 - ability to speak look how these smaller
121:49 - ones are kind of like they're kind of
121:50 - like I'm gonna push their way through
121:52 - whatever it is they're in it's kind of
121:54 - weird like suddenly they're not all
121:55 - falling at the same speed because the
121:57 - fluid resistance is acting on them
121:59 - differently drag resistance
122:10 - let's see what happens if we make C much
122:12 - stronger I'm gonna make it five oh why
122:17 - did those two like why does one fall
122:21 - what is going on that is really weird
122:30 - did the number get so could it be that
122:36 - there's a zero velocity and then if I
122:40 - normalize a zero velocity
122:41 - no what is going on they may know why
122:51 - that's happening Oh speed squared let's
122:59 - go all the way back
123:06 - this is actually quite incorrect
123:08 - remember it's not proportional to the
123:11 - speed it's proportional to the speed
123:13 - squared the time speed guess what though
123:20 - there's actually a function in p5 called
123:22 - mag squared for magnitude squared so be
123:24 - a little bit more efficient if I just
123:27 - call this like speed squared and use the
123:29 - magnitude squared function let's run
123:31 - this ok so we can see that the objects
123:37 - with a width we can see that the objects
123:43 - with less mass
123:56 - we can see that these objects that have
123:58 - less mass have a more difficult time
124:00 - accelerating their that drag force is
124:02 - stronger pushing them the opposite
124:03 - direction of their velocity let's see
124:05 - what happens if I take C and make it
124:07 - like a really high number like 5 you can
124:10 - see this all of these are like really
124:12 - having trouble moving they're just like
124:15 - slower if I make it like 500 can I get
124:17 - them just like the force to be so strong
124:19 - that they don't move whoa
124:20 - so one thing I really have to watch out
124:22 - for is with this mass sorry with the
124:26 - math that I'm doing that force could
124:31 - become so strong it will actually push
124:33 - them back up in the opposite direction
124:34 - and which wouldn't actually happen but
124:37 - you know again with all the various
124:38 - inaccuracies of things that I'm doing I
124:40 - probably need to put some constraints on
124:41 - this but with something like a
124:43 - coefficient of drag of like 0.1 in this
124:45 - context with that I'm getting kind of
124:47 - realistic behavior but I really want to
124:49 - emphasize this in a sort of more
124:51 - meaningful way so I think what I'm going
124:53 - to do is consider half of the canvas to
124:56 - have like a liquid and a thick liquid
124:58 - that has a strong drag to its rack
125:01 - coefficient and the other have to be
125:03 - busily a vacuum with no drag so let's go
125:07 - to the canvas and draw a rectangle let's
125:09 - say fill 255 with an alpha a 50 a
125:12 - rectangle
125:30 - oh let's see
125:37 - and we can make it even a little bit
125:40 - brighter okay so I want to draw on half
125:45 - of the canvas this rectangle that shows
125:47 - sort of like as if these objects are
125:49 - falling and land in water or land in
125:51 - some liquid so in this case I'll just
126:00 - say if mover dot position dot Y is
126:05 - greater than height divided by two mover
126:10 - drag so we should now see them all fall
126:16 - with group all fall
126:19 - at the exact same rate but once they hit
126:22 - the water the fluid resistance will
126:24 - affect them differently
126:32 - pause dot why
126:42 - let's make that drag force even a little
126:44 - bit stronger
126:52 - whoa look at that see that's the issue
126:54 - if it's too strong you can see it's kind
126:57 - of like that's not very realistic
126:59 - it's like bouncing it's like bouncing
127:01 - off of it which is kind of like a weird
127:02 - this is sort of fun a little like bug
127:05 - it's a feature not a bug but obviously
127:07 - it doesn't feel very at realistic
127:23 - maybe it might make sense for me to have
127:25 - this like drag coefficient be a global
127:28 - variable and actually perhaps even it's
127:31 - something that gets passed in to the
127:33 - function itself let's make it point to
127:53 - I'm Victor's asking why postcode for
127:55 - these lessons yeah all this code is all
127:57 - getting posted in fact versions of these
127:58 - examples are already
128:00 - honestly like posted as part of the
128:02 - nature codebook but I'm redoing them a
128:04 - little bit okay so this is now complete
128:14 - one thing that I would say it's like how
128:17 - I'm thinking about the area of the
128:20 - canvas that is the liquid is very just
128:28 - wrap up this video okay I'll answer some
128:34 - questions yeah I'm doing very well on
128:37 - time but I don't want to I don't think I
128:38 - have enough time to get all the way
128:40 - through the next example so I will just
128:42 - answer some questions and stuff for the
128:44 - next ten minutes but let me let me try
128:45 - to wrap this up and Lani has a question
128:49 - that I will a rigid body that I will ask
128:53 - although I about that question okay okay
129:17 - oh god I forgot to check if the
129:19 - recording to disk was working we're just
129:21 - going to hope it was so andrew is
129:25 - mentioning something about surface area
129:26 - I was gonna okay just write this down
129:38 - so this wraps up this particular example
129:40 - to demonstrating a track force here's
129:43 - some exercises of things you could try
129:44 - one is I'm not being very thoughtful
129:46 - about how I'm considering the
129:48 - two-dimensional space that is the canvas
129:50 - I just kind of used height divided by
129:52 - two as this arbitrary marker between
129:55 - vacuum and liquid maybe I would actually
129:57 - want to create a liquid class an object
130:00 - that describes a density a coefficient
130:03 - and a area of the canvas where that
130:06 - liquid or gas is present and then I
130:08 - could build a map right of having
130:10 - different liquids with different
130:11 - coefficients and different parts and
130:13 - have a much more dynamic system of
130:15 - things experiencing different amounts of
130:17 - drag depending on where they are and
130:18 - maybe it's all color coded there's lots
130:20 - of possibilities there another thing
130:22 - that I might consider what's is thinking
130:24 - about surface area surface area wouldn't
130:27 - be so difficult to consider because
130:30 - there's probably away surface area isn't
130:38 - something that's so difficult to
130:40 - consider I could kind of use the idea of
130:41 - a circumference of a circle and think
130:43 - about the mass and how much surface area
130:48 - sorry
130:54 - surface area is something that I
130:55 - definitely could consider there's
130:57 - probably a way having trouble getting my
131:01 - sentence out yeah
131:05 - you know here I'm assuming that all of
131:07 - the objects have the same surface area
131:09 - which isn't true and I can visually see
131:11 - that they don't and there's probably at
131:13 - least a very basic way that I can
131:15 - consider the size the radius or the
131:17 - circumference half circumference of the
131:19 - circle perhaps to be its surface area
131:21 - and have that be a factor in how I
131:23 - calculate the magnitude of a drag force
131:25 - so that's definitely you would something
131:26 - I would suggest trying as well so please
131:40 - so let me know if you have questions
131:42 - about this particular implementation try
131:44 - to make your own version of it think
131:46 - about just even the sort of like visual
131:47 - design and interaction the system but
131:49 - also what kinds of adjustments could you
131:51 - make to how the drag force behaves and
131:53 - what types of results might you get from
131:55 - that and go to the coding training comm
131:57 - where you can share your versions of
131:58 - this particular example and I've got one
132:01 - more chapter two video to make where I'm
132:03 - going to look at the formula for
132:04 - gravitational attraction and look at
132:06 - orbiting orbiting bodies see you there
132:12 - uh-uh
132:13 - another day another video ah reminder
132:19 - from yesterday's stream was CJ about yes
132:21 - Lindt mass is different too but mass is
132:26 - not playing a role in drag I mean it's
132:29 - playing a role in the sense that its
132:32 - motion is based on its moving because of
132:35 - a gravitational force which is scaled
132:37 - according to mass but mass is not part
132:40 - of a drag force a drag force calculation
132:48 - yeah Andrews giving me some great
132:50 - suggestions of a formula that I could
132:51 - use for surface area that I will try
132:56 - maybe later please try and share it with
132:58 - me in the discord
133:02 - okay Pollock rights surface area of the
133:06 - sphere I mean these aren't spheres but
133:08 - the sphere that's hitting the water is
133:09 - the same as the area of a circle with
133:11 - the same radius okay thank you all of
133:19 - you people who are watching and all
133:21 - leaving at this very moment as I can see
133:22 - one of the nice things about the stream
133:23 - deck I mean this probably isn't a nice
133:25 - thing because I should not be so like
133:26 - tied to these numbers but it shows me
133:29 - how many people are tuned in at any
133:31 - given time so I have about well three
133:33 - minutes now I mean my hard hard hard
133:35 - cutoff was 315 but my actual cutoff was
133:38 - 3 so I will be properties of a rigid
133:43 - body like in unity you can add a
133:44 - rigidbody component to objects ok so let
133:47 - me let me address this question from
133:49 - Lonny so I I don't know if I really know
133:53 - the answer to this question but one of
133:55 - the things I'm not doing in any of these
133:57 - examples right now is considering these
133:59 - objects to be rigid bodies and have
134:01 - rigid body collisions and by rigid body
134:03 - I mean that the it is an object that is
134:08 - not soft and two objects can't be in the
134:11 - same place at the same time and so they
134:13 - collide collisions so I'm not modeling
134:15 - anything to do with collisions here and
134:17 - that is something that I have explored
134:19 - through physics libraries like matter
134:20 - dot J s oh hi k weak bond you're here
134:24 - just in time for me to say goodbye and
134:27 - to put on this little bit of music so I
134:31 - will gladly take a few more questions
134:33 - before I go for the day and I will be
134:36 - back I think next week is a normal next
134:40 - it's gonna be every Thursday except for
134:42 - the Thursdays I'm not here
134:44 - but I think for the next two weeks I'm
134:46 - here both Thursday so Thursday is my new
134:48 - live stream days and my goal is three
134:53 - live streams every month one coding in
134:55 - the Cabana video every month so I've got
134:56 - to get to that next coding in the Cabana
134:57 - video
135:00 - [Music]
135:06 - what else what else do I got google
135:09 - Summer of Code google Summer of Code is
135:12 - happening I think the application pier
135:14 - I'm not an official representative
135:15 - Google Summer of Code but I do
135:16 - participate in the processing foundation
135:19 - and we are a mentoring organization for
135:21 - google Summer of Code so if you are a
135:23 - student and you want to apply I
135:25 - encourage you to go to the google Summer
135:27 - of Code website and look through all of
135:32 - the organizations I think there are over
135:35 - 200 and we can see if we recognize or
135:38 - know any of them let's see if I can find
135:42 - processing there we go
135:47 - processing foundation there we go and Oh
135:52 - Dana wait wait is this pure data but
135:55 - it's now per data
135:57 - well can we make processing purchasing
136:00 - or tossing processing fur I love you
136:05 - forever because you a perfect dog puns
136:11 - and cat puns I can't get enough of them
136:15 - [Music]
136:18 - Ricardo asks will you continue to do the
136:21 - coding in the Cabana series what's my
136:25 - favorite food a sushi we continue to do
136:29 - the coding in the Cabana series yes so I
136:32 - think that I was a little bit too overly
136:36 - ambitious in terms of what was realistic
136:38 - I kind of wanted to do coding in the
136:40 - Cabana every week I don't like it's hard
136:43 - for me to find the time to do it I think
136:44 - I need to figure out a better way to
136:46 - like organize my schedule it's an
136:48 - allocate work time for it but I think
136:51 - once a month is hopefully realistic
136:58 - how are you drawing strokes for use in a
137:01 - neural network I'm not sure I understand
137:02 - that question pineapple on pizza
137:04 - no Jenny I'm like a no uncooked
137:08 - pineapple I like pineapple go do the
137:11 - pineapple fried rice with tofu ginger is
137:14 - that a thing that goes in it Persis
137:16 - thing hurts the same yes I have two cats
137:22 - oh if you want to learn if you want to
137:24 - know about my cats follow mango and
137:27 - goose on Instagram I William asked are
137:34 - you going to learn and use unity I would
137:37 - like to I went to a workshop on that was
137:41 - teaching with unity and I was just like
137:45 - what do I want you know that think where
137:47 - your eyes come out of your head and go
137:48 - born weren't went wearing mine that
137:50 - happened to me this is very disturbing I
137:52 - had them took me a while to get the eyes
137:53 - back
137:55 - [Music]
138:00 - thank you all for being with me in this
138:03 - strange adventure that I'm having being
138:05 - the youtubing person I have to say I
138:09 - kind of like I was long as twitch stream
138:11 - with CJ I'm really quite impressed with
138:14 - twitch as a streaming platform and it's
138:17 - just too late for me like I'm here
138:19 - this is where I am maybe I'll move
138:20 - someday but I just couldn't possibly
138:22 - figure out if that makes any sense to do
138:24 - but CJ I turned me on to this I guess
138:34 - I'm getting an ad now but there's all
138:36 - these like live coders on Twitch and
138:38 - there's like insta fluff he's like a
138:40 - really awesome one I don't want to watch
138:41 - this ad anyway people are only feeds to
138:44 - fluff is live streaming right now looked
138:47 - awesome
138:53 - oh yeah
139:01 - Andrew reminds me you asked me to
139:04 - mention the change of basis at the end
139:06 - of this stream so thanks there's a three
139:09 - blue one brown video I believe that has
139:11 - to do with vector math and change in
139:12 - basis that I so I think Andrew I'm gonna
139:15 - take a look at that after the stream is
139:16 - over
139:17 - so let's chat about that later on
139:20 - discord perhaps
139:21 - oh it's a fluff is life if this it's if
139:31 - I've just always live actually that's
139:33 - maybe a reason why I can't stream on
139:34 - Twitch I think the idea of twitch is
139:36 - like for people who stream like very
139:38 - very often not but I'm the way I mean I
139:41 - in some ways I aspire to its three more
139:44 - often I know I can stream to multiple
139:47 - sites at once and I have tried that it's
139:49 - it's a little too much for me to manage
139:50 - all the different systems so here we are
139:53 - this platform works for now little lot
139:57 - asked me about Bluetooth and Chrome
140:00 - that's not something I've really pursued
140:03 - or have the time to pursue right now but
140:05 - there is a p5 ble library which I guess
140:10 - is for Bluetooth Low Energy devices so I
140:14 - would encourage you to check out this p5
140:16 - ble Jes library if you're interested
140:18 - doing stuff with p5 and Bluetooth and
140:20 - it's really nicely documented it's
140:22 - worked on by a bunch of colleagues of
140:24 - mine here at NYU
140:26 - [Music]
140:34 - Lonnie is asking something about the
140:36 - difference between a PDE which I think
140:38 - of as the prosthetic development
140:39 - environment and something an eau de I've
140:40 - no idea
140:42 - sorry I don't know what those are we use
140:45 - the way the check and help sure oh I'm
140:48 - getting some words of encouragement to
140:50 - Stan you dip up and my time is up I will
140:55 - see you all next week next Thursday on
141:00 - the coding trade oh I forgot all those
141:02 - new I forgot to put all the new sound
141:05 - mixes on the sound board so you'll have
141:07 - to live with my usual ones like
141:25 - [Music]
141:54 - [Music]
142:12 - I'm gonna do this this star this star
142:15 - this star this star song never forget
142:17 - the Vista
142:19 - [Music]
142:30 - I'm gonna say once again coordinates
142:40 - [Music]
142:45 - coordinates
142:52 - [Music]
143:02 - auto-tuned and the internet will fix
143:04 - that for me
143:16 - [Music]
143:31 - [Music]
143:33 - so this is random this is noise Perley
143:37 - noise that is in the core random
143:39 - algorithm the actual random algorithm
143:41 - itself those numbers aren't related at
143:44 - all you pick like I'm picking random
143:46 - numbers between zero and ten nine two
143:48 - seven six one nine four eight nine to
143:53 - one thirty I pick nine a lot apparently
143:55 - but with curly noise I might pick
143:57 - numbers like this two three four three
144:00 - four five six five four five six seven
144:04 - five six seven five six seven eight nine
144:06 - eight seven six well this is like Perlin
144:10 - noise performance part
144:11 - [Music]
144:16 - - 1 2 3 4 3 4 5 he was like birthing
144:25 - noise performance apart with curly noise
144:32 - I might pick numbers like this
144:40 - by purling noise that is totally noise
144:43 - so this is Hurley noise that is Hurley
144:45 - noises this is Hurley noise senator Leno
144:47 - so this is Hurley noise that is hurtling
144:53 - noise but with pearly noise I might pick
145:14 - numbers like this
145:15 - [Music]
145:30 - this is like Perlin noise performance
145:33 - part unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes
145:42 - what else is there
145:45 - yes kittens thank you very much kittens
145:48 - and rainbows and cupcakes notice that
145:50 - look what I get I'm really losing my
145:52 - mind
145:56 - [Music]
146:20 - [Music]
146:43 - [Music]
146:52 - [Music]
146:59 - [Music]
147:09 - I feel just sort of like a nice feeling
147:13 - of relaxation everything's gonna be okay
147:15 - today dream is not broken it has not
147:18 - frozen this isn't this is a wonderful
147:20 - thing okay we're gonna do it I'm really
147:23 - getting to something I need my sound
147:30 - [Music]
147:54 - all sorts of text generation analysis
147:57 - things that I will use continuously
148:02 - [Music]
148:14 - kidding
148:19 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

good afternoon everyone it is approximately 1240 6 p.m. Eastern Time I'll be starting in just a few minutes this is my sound check how is the audio level of my voice I see actually it's getting kind of high so I might just it and versus the audio thank you in a moment here and that's gonna switch to this song usually start at the end of this song everyone okay this should be better now my voice that gets into the red but I advise to speak normally like this hello happy Thursday Thursday is the day for the coding train for the foreseeable future at least for the next few weeks but at least this week at least today today is Thursday and today is a day for the coding train and I expect you all to notice that I did get my haircut finally my like to say semi annual haircut biennial by annual haircut I know twice a year that's about that's about what I do and we begin as we often do on the coding train with the ceremonial reading of the random numbers and I have an update about my search for an original first edition print of this book but and I will begin on page 211 now where we last left off our hero they were in the number 55,000 430 you might recall previously on the coding train and then there was the number of 37,000 351 and now we continue our story on the coding tree thirty thousand three hundred eighty five seventy two thousand four hundred fifty seventy two thousand five hundred two fifty six thousand three hundred seventy six sixtyfour thousand four hundred and seventytwo 81,000 could stop me probably I'm very I'm very susceptible to peer pressure and comments and all that sort of stuff I see coating garden is in CJ is in the chat which is one of the first things I wanted to mention that's a helpful reminder for me that yesterday I appeared on the coding garden with CJ and we made let's see if I can pull that up super easily I think if I use if I search for coding garden and it will bring me to the YouTube channel coding garden with CJ and if I find my way there will find a ha look at this build a discord bot with mmm it's a very hard name to pronounce Donnie Ola chief none of the coding trained right there so you can watch this this was really fun I would really appreciate I learned like so many different things from CJ and I definitely encourage you if you want to learn things and get better as a programmer especially in terms of web development and all sorts of other related topics I would encourage you to subscribe and check out the coding garden an incredible amount of useful content there but this was great because we made a basic discord bot sample which was like an Eightball so you could ask it a question what's a yes no maybe in various other Eightball answers and then deployed that bot to CJ's discord the coding garden discord but I also have a coding trade discord and you could join the coding train discord maybe somebody can post post a link to it in the chat to has moderator privileges and eventually I intend to make a set of kind of step by step tutorials to build your own discord bot you know ultimately you should just watch the video on the coding garden because when I make mine it'll be basically the same but I will just be doing it again and stepping through it and ultimately with the goal of connecting some of the other text generation and machine learning algorithms that I have explored on this channel with with this court BOTS oh I have a funny idea Oh hahaha I crack myself up I have a funny idea for a video of that I will be making soon it relates what I'm talking about but I don't want to give it away all these people commenting my hair very much appreciated Julianne who is my barber excellent if anybody wants a recommendation I will I don't know I'm not gonna know like by accident violates somebody's privacy or buzz market something inappropriately but you know yeah you could contact me on the disk or I'll give you some haircut in Brooklyn recommendations alright so that was one thing I wanted to say the other thing is I'm really still on the lookout for I was and I don't have any good news it was someone a couple a couple of different people shared with me I can't remember who originally on Twitter some Amazon links for collect your collectable versions of this book let's see if I can find it let me just go to amazon.com and trust me I much prefer to buy this somewhere else but you know just so I can find this out million random digits so here we go I there is this listing for it and we can see these three these three listings all for quite a large amount of money this is no you know the actual book itself this is the one that I own which is a reprint which is temporary of stock mmm it listed for $59 sixteen cents I can't remember if that's what I paid for it but something like that but I'm very interested in these hard covers which have some kind of information about them but you know I really don't feel that I can purchase this book just on a whim so I emailed each one of these sellers and I said explained exactly I'm looking for all I needed was like a photo or they could just tell me which Edition isn't missing any pages and what condition a little more information and I got the exact same form letter back from each of them which leads me to be a little suspicious like these different like sellers that listed with Amazon which was something like sorry the the stuff we sell it's already in the Amazon warehouse we don't have any interaction with it can't send you any more information so it wasn't just that the message was to say the substance of the message was the same the actual text of the message was identical so very much seemed like a foreign letter that all of these booksellers through Amazon send so I I just couldn't get myself to press the button I maybe there's a nice local you know but that's this is a strand even still exist in New York there's like a local bookstore if you've lived somewhere where somebody happens to have one of these in their attic I will barter just thank pay for I'm really looking for this is what I'm looking for maybe I should just maybe I should just take a leap of faith order all three of these I'm gonna need some quite a few more members maybe of the cooking train all right just go ahead and do that but I'm looking for this I really want to find one so I just wanted to bring that up at the beginning of this live stream when I have approximately 100 ish people watching and maybe someone will know something and can help me out so I want to have you tried rare us sarcasm as a service which is a really wonderful username in the discord supporter discord chat rightz have you tried rare bookstores in New York City seems like you'd have better luck with them I did I have a little bit I've called a couple places do they offer free returns that's a good good that's kind of it Thank You CJ that is a very smart point and perhaps kind of obvious that I don't know why I didn't think of that so that's something that I could potentially check what I was really excited about was like that I saw this look inside here and then I realize like oh it's just the look inside for this Reaper so the reason why I'm like particularly obsessed with this right now is the channel is approaching just cannot even believe these words are gonna come out of my mouth right now but what billion subscribers which is totally nuts you know viewership I would say I have viewership on the same level as much smaller channels in terms of subscriber numbers it's interesting that I think there's a lot of people who like aspirationally subscribe like I'm gonna learn to code and watch all the Kodi videos busy and they just like you know I see it in their feed I don't know why I'm going on if I find it interesting what makes somebody subscribers not subscribed versus watch but this is unfathomable to me that this would this would happen and I would like to do something to celebrate it and I feel like something to do with random numbers and this million dollar remember random book which has been a very well go eat dinner please don't starve memoirs I'm supposed to go eat with my family first of all let me just talk about priorities in life be with family eat coding train I put them in that order I suppose eating is maybe a little bit higher in terms of actual like life force although I would say being with family and you know family can mean a lot of different things for other people it doesn't just vary me in your immediate relatives your family might be any collection of people that is in your life for any number of reasons but I would say you know the coding train should not go above your family your food and your being with people but glad you're here alright let's see here so I go to have a ton of time today I will be livestreaming until around 3 p.m. which is two hours from now I will take a break in the middle of the live stream a short intermission to thank brilliant the sponsor of the coding train you can go to them find out more about brilliant at brilliant org slash coding train there are so many fun interactive puzzles and challenges you can do there and a lot of courses that relate to coding and algorithms and things that are on this channel so it's it's a website that I in an app that I use quite often to learn and discover lots of fun topics in math and science and related things so I'll come back and talk a little more about brilliant a little later but what I will be focusing on today is continuing my nature of code series yeah I mean maybe you've been what you are the live stream viewer and this is not so meaningful to you but I think I must have like 10 or 11 edited videos just waiting to be made public on the channel and I'll be making 2 mil you know 1 2 3 more of those today so there's a lot of content in the pipeline we've just been kind of slow to take care of the sort of details of getting them ready to be sitting on the channel if you want us the preview of them you could join as a member but don't worry you don't need to do that they're gonna come out soon enough right Clippy is asking do you have any coding challenge idea for a 1 million subscriber celebration no I'm really hoping though this is my really hoping that I hit 1 million subscribers on April 1st I just think that would be beautiful which is not so unrealistic it's a little I think it'll be a little bit actually I mean I have to look at the what you know what the sort of current herbs and flows of this are but I think that would be a nice alignment of the stars because yeah basically a full of the Internet so April Fool's Day would be a nice time for me to hit that milestone ok Andrew writes of Simon writes you should be celebrating 1,048,576 subs subs to the 20th power great awesome sold I can wait another two months before worrying about a celebration so I can't get it together from 1 million perfect for my pet 1,048,576 Andrew writes I can say in terms of viewing videos I might go two weeks without seeing a video and then watch like 6 hours in one day I hope you take a break take breaks CJ I discovered on the coating garden has a little timer that runs on his computer that reminds him to take a break every so often I should we have that all right I'm going to skip Shari community contributions today I don't know that there are I haven't looked into if I have a collection of those to share socialblade floor and right socialblade says you'll get to 1 million on March 28 slow down people march 28 is a little bit early April 1st is what I'm looking for unsubscribe if you just doesn't subscribe if it's getting too fast you could subscribe back alright let me get set up to get moving here it's like one o'clock I'm jumping right in okay pause again for a second so this is what is coming soon a brand new playlist with a whole lot of videos related to vectors and forces and so I hope by the end of this week I'll have a few of these released you know one thing I'll tell you is that you'll probably be able to find embed like I'll probably have many more videos available as unlisted while I'm still like finishing preparing them so once the first one comes out if you could always like look into the description it'll sometimes be like a link to the next video or they'll be at the end screen a link to the next video would be unlisted I'm not and if you want to join the discord I might share the unlisted videos there so it's it's a the reason why some of them are online but not listed is not because I'm trying to hide them from anyone and just taking the time to get them ready and make sure there are no major problems before they go public cause it's much harder to take down a video and reupload it once it's been made public so so that's that parem is asking about the music it that the last name of the composer of Tori the dog this particular wonderful piece of music is allow the l8u Adam Lau I believe he is the composer for television and film he is a composer a television film including the FX series you're the worst all right so so I am getting rid of that and getting rid of this getting rid of this and coming back to here so the good news in terms of getting moving quickly today into some actual coding is very rare rare feet for the coding train to be actually ah but I found something else I want to talk about to be coding within the first like 15 minutes of starting a live stream here's a little past 15 minutes now usually I don't get to coding until at least like 45 minutes in but since I only have two hours I didn't want to show something I have been learning about how to do some kind of taking computational algorithms and making them physical I've been working with a vinyl cutter that I've mentioned but I've also been working with a laser cutter and this is very hard to see because it's clear but what I'm going to be soon doing where to best make this visible like it's my turn to the side oh wait I'll use the overhead camera hold on a sec that's gonna work yeah so this is a piece of plexi and I laser cut a rectangle in it out with these two lines because these train whistles it'll actually it's goes this way let's see if these train was the train whistle will sit right in here go onto the bed of the laser cutter and in between these two lines I will be laser etching the coding train characters along here and putting a little coding train logo maybe on another side I have a box of 200 of these I'm just sort of doing this as a fun experiment also for people who are members at a certain level we'll get one of these in the mail if soon as I can so hopefully tomorrow I have sort of blocked out an hour to try to do this laser etching so we'll see how that goes so stay tuned I'll post images of it in the discord as well and once I get you know at some point I would like to do some videos about how to take a design and processing maybe like the Hilbert curve or the Cole that's conjecture some of the things that I've done in the coating in the Cabana series and Ren that is an SVG or PDF to bring it to illustrator and that kind of stuff you could see it fine in the original view says Ken Haley hi Ken I love seeing names that I recognize in the chat I mean I would recognize a lot of them just because they're the same names that appear but then I recognize names that are like from an email conversation from like 10 years ago it's what a community of viewers you all are and I'm so glad you're here with me today hmm Clippy is asking is that an elgato stream deck yes I love my Elgato stream deck it's how I do things like press a button well it's kind of like a quick shot of this coffee entered the overhead camera on or the sponsor banner and different things like that I can press a button to switch to the whiteboard ooh that camera is really bleeding into the green I won't worry about that right now okay so um good one of the things that I did this morning as I was having my breakfast oatmeal if you wanted to ask thank you for asking you definitely we're asking nuts I like a good organic blueberry did not have any this morning didn't have any at the ready but I while I was having that oatmeal I watched the edited versions of the tutorials I worked through a week ago today so they're fresh in my mind which is good because I want to pick up pick up exactly where I left off last week so if you're just here for the first time welcome thank you train whistle for you oh you have no with your viewing of the coding training you have one but clearly person on the match who will talk to you about forces in simulation and p5 jets in the WebEx hmm steel cut steel cut oats dusty an answer to your question woman here and yeah I was watching videos it's fresh in my mind welcome if you're new so this might feel like what you don't you might not be you might not have the prior knowledge of some of the other things that I've talked about or taught about or made on this channel try to follow along the best you can or you know take a break do something else and come back on all of the prerequisites a pre requisite stuff that is last week is coming out in edited form soon on the channel alright so um let's pick let me get the whiteboard ready to go it's the three little bears Goldilocks which one is the one yeah a little green never hurt anybody you just see if it's I don't want to be too extreme and totally like take it off the wall and all that is I have a level that's what I'm checking to see if the camera blah blah pretty good actually that's gonna be good enough there we go okay so I am going to begin by the the the thesis of this particular session is the Hat video for Andrew maples thank you for the super chat rightz would love to see do a video from p5 to SVG good good good suggestion for sure yeah I might suggest looking into a library called room yes are you any touch s created by roon Matson which is this with like companion kind of library similarly in the similar vein to p5 but works natively with SVG is other libraries you're like d3 personally for me when I'm trying to render an SVG out of a computational algorithm I'm gonna go to processing because I just the PDF renderer works it does exactly what I want to do it can be trickier to do that from the browser but I would be very happy to investigate that okay so the thesis of today's live session is that I want to move from I'm just say I'm gonna repeat myself in a second from just making up force vectors oh sorry I'm into reading an interesting comment that I'm going to come back to making up force vectors and I want to look at how do you calculate a vector using a kind of realworld physics formula and bring that into code Andrews writing I hope your vector videos has a change of basis maybe let's let's you remind me about that after the live stream is over because I would love to investigate what is it your exactly you're looking forward to see if that's something I can fold in but at present no yeah there's still a green sliver all right it's gonna bother me not you can always just like crop it is the thing but let's I'm gonna go be a bit more extreme oh my god you know what I cannot untighten this Wow somebody came in and really tighten this all right I'm not gonna fight with this it's just gonna be what its gonna be the green sliver will be there is no getting rid of the gleaned green sliver now that I did that I got to check the level again which is a little bit crooked but I think I might just live with it time it that way okay green sliver is going to be there there is no getting rid of the green silver okay here we go oh oh I forgot to hit record disc okay I'm recording to disk I'm now gonna say my record to disc prayer may the record disc not have jumpy dropped frames in it so that when it's time to edit this later all is possible that's beret pre hug often okay um where where this is now I'm gonna say multi quarter go do I miss seeing any dropped frames so far so good and then as a safeguard I am going to do a quick screen record as well hold on a sec have too many different systems okay as a safeguard I'm gonna do and Kobe is suggesting I should have a checklist yes far be it for me to be organized about anything new screen recording nope yep and I just want make sure there's at least some mic going on here Mac yep that's perfect and record all right that's a backup okay here we go one more thing is there just wanna see if the same formula that I'm about to use appears in a similar way static friction and kinetic friction and friction yeah all right I think this actually isn't as useful as I want it to be so that's fine okay welcome to another now with haircut video in Chapter two nature of code and in this video I'm gonna take a leap what I have done so far using the classical laws of motion classical mechanics force equals mass times acceleration I've implemented a system where mover objects can receive forces as vectors and have those forces control how they move about a canvas in p5.js but the way that I have created these force vectors is just by picking numbers out of a hat and I want to do something more I want to look at an actual physics textbook oh could I run and get a physics textbook right now if I had this the finest script then I would know what I'm gonna say and then I would think like Oh get your prop but I do not I do know everything's buzzing I have to turn on my do not disturb because people are messaging me hold on a sec do not disturb on okay I will say for those of you in the discord channel if you have something you want to tag me in wait until after the stream is over because or a direct message because that will sort of like pop up as an extra message that I view during a live stream is like oh this is important to what I'm doing right now like the audio has stopped or I've made a mistake so it's not a big deal but save those for later if you can all right the train is already off the rails as dusty 923 says which is absolutely accurate I'm not gonna have a physical I'm I think I know I have a book that I think might have what I'm looking for in it but it's not worth me trying to wander off to find it I'm going to keep going I couldn't find a physics textbook but you know what I'm talking about in those textbooks there our formula Oh what had something in post will have like a book fly in with a formula in it I couldn't find a textbook but here's one for you definitely gonna be able to find where you might see a scary looking formula and I've picked one to start with and the formula that I want to start with is the formula for friction now there are many different kinds of friction and examples of friction and there's static friction which is friction that holds something in place and not moving versus kinetic friction which is the friction that occurs when two surfaces are moving in contact with each other I am going to not worry about any of those things and kind of well not that I'm not worrying about any of those things search google books I could come back and like do a little clip of me like read it with a book like sitting in like a by a fireplace really I dug you like I thought the harp on this but those bone Appetit videos are so good and I don't think that my coding videos are ever gonna achieve that level of like just absolute wonderfulness but there's like really messing with my mind and how I think about my videos all right here's the diagram that I'm using to describe friction and it's a diagram directly from nature of code book what am I thinking a normal forest force of gravity okay where's my marker okay today's theme is the flirt or a book absolutely true says sarcasm is service here's the diagram that I have to describe the friction force in the nature of code book itself and this is an example of kinetic friction there is a person on a sled coming down a hill there's the force of gravity there's the person's the sleds velocity there's this idea of a normal force and then this other force the friction force pointing in the opposite direction of velocity with a formula right over here let me take a moment to rewrite that formula let's rewrite that formula on the whiteboard and I need a second because unfortunately I know you can't see me right now but oh no wait oh no but it's recording that I'm afraid I'm afraid where's my eraser we go let's take let's I'm gonna rewrite that formula here negative one I'm gonna take a minute to rewrite that formula over here okay the approach I like to take when finding a formula like this and then trying to figure out how to apply it in code is to unpack each of the elements of the formula one at a time and figure out whether it actually applies or is in fact something that we can ignore to simplify in the case of our two d p5 canvas so one let's go into sort of an arbitrary order here but something really to note here is what is this this is the velocity unit vector so why are we doing this let's consider I have this circle at the bottom of the canvas it's moving in this direction that's its current velocity and I want to describe what is the direction of friction well the direction of friction is and this negative one is really important these two go together the direction of friction is a vector in the opposite direction of velocity so the reason why I'm not talking about the magnitude yet the magnitude is important but the first thing anytime that a little bit anytime I want to calculate a force I need to calculate two things direction and magnitude so looking at this formula explain this because I have a better idea it's fine it's fine it's fine let's move on circling back for a second what am i doing again I'm calculating a force a vector and I need to figure out two things direction and magnitude the direction here is expressed as the unit vector pointing in the velocities direction times negative one so I know that the friction points in this direction that's the friction force what is the magnitude well I have two other variables in this formula and all of these by the way are scalars scalar scalar scalar and this is the vector this is known as mu or the coefficient of friction let's play a little knockknock joke together knockknock mu no wait I did exactly my daughter when she was little used to tell the joke in like the wrong order and I just started doing that okay ready knockknock the interrupting coefficient of friction mu thank you thank you thank you very much thank you very much I will I will I'll be here all week all week uh Fridays and Saturdays hey it's like you there thank you thank you thank you alright mu mu is the good boy that that's like written in the worst way three rapist okay okay coefficient of friction is a value that describes the strength of the friction force based on what material it is you could imagine if this is like ice and this is an ice skate there's gonna be a lot less friction that ice cap will glide across the ice versus this is sandpaper and this is some other kind of rough material and there's a much greater amount of friction so the coefficient of friction is tied specifically to the material itself and and what its behavior as they come as it comes into contact then we have something interesting here this the normal force the normal force and so to describe the normal force let me refer back to the diagram here the purse the sled here the sled is coming into contact with the hill but there would be no friction if there wasn't a force of gravity pulling the sled into that down downwards I don't want to explain this yes I do get a super chat hold your I'm gonna hold my applause to the end I will thank the super chat in a moment this diagram has a sled in contact with a hill and there's also the force of gravity the force of gravity is a force pointing directly down towards the center of the earth and causing the sled to kind of rub in in with the hill as it move and as it comes down the normal force is the force perpendicular to the two surfaces in contact and it's magnitude is tied to the this component of the gravity force the component that is perpendicular to the hill but guess what none of that really matters what I brought up has days I mean all this is like super important in realworld physics but let me remind you what we're doing here I have a ellipse a piece of graphics drawn on a twodimensional canvas coming into contact with the edge of the canvas so there is a normal force pointing straight down in my world that I'm sort of looking at the I'm looking at a slice of a 3dimensional world in a way there is a normal force but what its magnitude is is something that I could just make up it's some kind of constant in this case it's a constant guess what else is a constant the coefficient of friction well I could sort of say do I want it to be the friction to be really strong really weak like what kind of material how do I want it to feel that's also a constant constant constant these are both constants I can make up whatever number I want for a constant in this scenario like saying the same thing both of these are constant which really just means I can make up a value depending on how I'm considering the environment and material and all the other aspects that I'm inventing for this madeup world in the first place let me just change this to friction I'm going to simplify this again just have one object so as I add the code for friction into it I'm not dealing with multiple objects ok so I have my single object bouncing up and down oops is the stream down I don't think so not constant and depends on the way no no no no all right all right yes yes yes let me offer a correction yes yes very good point quick quick clarification n is not a constant in the sense that it depends on the weight which depends on the object's mass so for different objects that relative amount of friction would be different because their weights would be different but in the case of one particular object the that per dot but in the case of one particular object I can treat it as a constant here and scale it according to that object's mass I'm going to invent a kind of artificial scenario where I want this mover to only experience friction when it comes in contact with the bottom surface of the canvas so anytime it is in contact with the bottom surface it'll experience friction to make this happen I'm going to write a new function in the mover called friction I'll check to see how far is it away from the bottom I want to know how far is it from the bottom so one of the difference between the height and its position plus the radius because remember the position the Y position is the center so I want to look at the edge in contact with the bottom I will say it's in contact if that difference is within one pixel so let's just run the sketch what we call the function friction I mean maybe I should do it out here whatever I'm gonna do it this way and let's see if when it comes in contact with the edge we get the word friction here in the console so we can see every time it bounces we're seeing the word friction and then this will get sped up here and now we can see as it's rolling along the bottom friction friction friction friction friction because it's in constant contact with the surface maybe I would want to treat the scenario when it like hits the surface once vs. is rolling along the surface differently but I'm not gonna worry about that right now yeah people are all the chat the the live chat that's watching me record this video right now is also pointing out that things would be quite different if my surface were at an angle so how the normal force would be calculated relative the force of gravity that's why I'm happy about this simple scenario of this roof flat surface along the bottom let me first get the direction of the force let me first get the direction of the friction force I need the velocity vector I need a unit vert unit sorry I need the velocity vector normalized to length one multiplied by negative one let me copy the velocity vector let me normalize it and reverse its direction now that I have the direction I need the magnitude what is the magnitude the coefficient what is the magnitude the coefficient of friction mu times the strength of the normal force the normal force is proportional to the weight which is scaled by the mass of the object so I can use mass in my calculation and then you can be a value that I make up so I'm going to say let and often it's used K is used as like the coefficient of friction no does that anything in spring that's right in you let's make up a coefficient of friction mu will say zero point one the normal force will be equal to the mass and then I can say force set magnitude mu times normal I should take magnitude once again any time I'm calculating a force I need to first or both once it's once again any time I'm calculating the force I need to both figure out its direction a normalized vector here pointing in the opposite direction of velocity and its magnitude the coefficient of friction by making up times the normal strip then times the strength of the normal force which is some value scaled according to mass what do I do next apply the force and I'm realizing I want to call this friction let's run this and see what happens I'm gonna have to wait a little while I can wait it came to a stop how delightful yeah people I've been away for the chat to finish saying the audio is gone andrew is asking can you write vector normal eyes Moulton egative one in one line and absolutely you could I think the audio has come back yeah clipping is saying I declared a variable called friction inside of a function called friction you know it's kind of okay because this is this dot Frick that one up there is this dot friction and this is a local variable inside the function so they're actually distinct um the audio was going didn't use the microphone for a second there was a loud noise in the hallway so you can hear because there's like a buzz in the room when I meet the microphone here's the demonstrate the difference not you did not muted okay I just want to quickly point out that this would also be valid so these vector operations can be chained meaning you can say make a copy of the velocity normalize it and multiply it by negative one and the result goes in this vector friction this variable friction but I generally prefer to write it step by step just for clarity sake all right it would be so onerous saying would be cool if you drew the acting forces on the ball yeah yeah yes thank you for suggesting that I mean leave my exercise suggestions our slope slope surface and draw vectors here okay this is a nice moment for me to take a minute and look now that this is working this is a nice moment for me to take a minute and just add an array so we can see a bunch of fees all with different masses and see how they behave within the same environment so let me quickly add that in here you can see I am making ten mover objects everyone will start with a Y position at 200 but each will start at a random X position and with a random mass some value between 1 & 8 it also might make sense for this new variable to be a global variable I think you could make reason we could also might make sense for you to make this new variable a global variable just so I can play with it outside of in the interior of the class itself I'm gonna leave it up there and then inside draw this is a nice opportunity to be fruit for me to use a for of loop because I want to say for every mover of its right it's hard to say the word of which when you're describing it's really for each or for and really makes sense but the loop that you want in JavaScript it's more of a whole other video about that but I want to look at every single mover inside of the movers array and one way of doing that is for every mover whoops for every mover of movers run all of this code and let's take a look and see what happens now they're all bouncing together they hit the bottom at a slightly different time they should all respond to wind differently based on their size not their mass and then they'll also have their own friction according that's scaled according to their mass as well and after a little while all of them will roll to a stop does this feel accurate does this what does this feel like well I suspect that by playing around with the coefficient of friction the relative strength of the way the gravitational force all of these things all of these variables you can tune to have the simulation feel more or less like different kinds of material in different kinds of environments now while this was a you know somewhat realworld so while here I am attempting to actually write a code that uses the formula for friction in the real world I could also do this with a very quick and dirty algorithm that I think it's worth showing you just that the sort of tail end of this video ultimately what friction does is it takes a little bit off of the velocity every single frame we lose some speed as this object is coasting along a particular surface the friction slows it down another way to lose a little bit of velocity with each and every step in time would be to just take a percentage of velocity off no I could actually comment all of this out whoops I don't want to do it that way why did it do that Oh cuz this I'll do this I could comment all of this out whatever and just say this dot velocity multiply 0.95 meeting shrink the velocity vector every time step if it's in contact with the with the edge with the bottom surface by 5% and let's just see if this has the same result or different ultimately in the end it's pretty similar they all come rolling to a stop did you notice though that they all seem to come rolling to a stop at exactly the same moment well that's because one flaw with this particular method is that I'm not taking into account the object's mass so you know for just having things sort of slowed down over time this might be a really easy way to do it if you want to make sure that that force that friction force is scaled to mass then maybe doing it the vector way is then what is not inherently better than the other these are just different ways to produce the same kind of effect all right where are we 151 we're doing well people topdown so this wraps up this particular demonstration of coding friction into a simple 2d simulation physics simulation yes differentshaped static yeah static and can I bring this down these are all the things I'm gonna suggest for viewers to do so this wraps up this very basic demonstration of coding a friction force into a simple 2d physics simulation there's a lot that you could try before you move we move on to the next video so we'll try these things as an exercise I wrote them all down one is it's pretty arbitrary that it decided to have this sideways view of the world I'm taking a slice a twodimensional slice and things are falling up and down and moving left and right what if what I were actually looking at was a topdown view of a 2d world so I'm actually overhead maybe a billiards table and lots of things are rolling around this surface and experiencing friction how might what you could change but if I were sticking into a 2d world how could I do something where the actual surface but if I were staying with it in it but if I were to stay in this world that's the vertical slice what if I wanted instead of having a horizontal surface at the bottom to actually have a sloped surface within the frame and that my objects are falling down and maybe rolling down this particular surface how would I how would I have the force of gravity behave and how would I have the force of friction behave how would I calculate that normal force I haven't really covered how you would do in truth a lot of the things you would truthfully the material that you need to do this is coming in chapter 3 where I'm going to look at angles and polar coordinates and things like a pendulum simulation so some of the ways that you would calculate a force perpendicular to a non horizontal perfectly horizontal surface or coming soon but if you maybe want to look ahead or experiment with how to do that I try that as an exercise I am completely ignoring the difference between static friction what's the friction that's holding something in place when it's not moving versus kinetic friction that friction when it's in motion that might be something you consider folding into this particular example can you demonstrate those two differences and then finally I think this visualization would be so much more compelling or illustrative if I were to actually draw the various vectors so could I draw a velocity vector the gravity vector the wind vector though could I draw the velocity vector as well as vector draw visual representations of all the forces so could I see the drawing of the friction force the gravitational force the wind force all those other forces within the simulation itself so if you try any of those and you make your own version of them please go to the URL that's in this video's description where you can share your variation I would love to check them out and maybe also show them in a future video or live stream where I sometimes show community contributions from the website all right so guess what you might think I'm kind of done with friction no I am going to next in the next video do a different force that's known as a drag force what happened blazing what does it mean for me to be blazing really and I just is it obviously I'm like tired today so what's going on maybe they I lost all my hair and so my brain doesn't work well anymore because it was protecting it somehow from the aliens that are trying to communicate I mean need like some tinfoil to wear now I have two more case studies to look at related to forces one in the next video is very similar to friction I actually look at a drag force of air resistance so what happens when something a body is falling through the air how does what what sort of force acts on it or a body is moving through a liquid so that's known as drag or a fluid resistance I'm gonna look at that force in the next video and then finally I want to circle back to that circle being attracted to the mouth position and unpack a circle back and look at that and finally I want to circle all the way back and look at that first example I made when I looked at acceleration of this object being attracted to the mouse and make a version of that but use the actual formula for gravitational attraction itself so just a couple more videos left in this chapter two and we'll be moving on to chapter three and I hope you're enjoying it and all that stuff see you soon all right um you have to make the circles rainbowcolored it is your duty I agree I agree I don't though there's 320 so all these people have joined this livestream just in time for me to take a break can I do can I do the drag one quickly before I take a break it's been actually very similar to this one Manuel Lopez I'm happily starving while watching digging I think actually I'm taking a break would be useful for me right now so I am going to go ahead it's a half it's halfway through my livestream and I am going gloss LOL glassing Oh glossing over not glazing over oh yeah Oh glazing over 2b means my eyes are glazing over and nothing's making sense anymore did you notice the addition of my haircut I have new glasses you might not notice that I have new glasses because exactly was my old glasses but they're new they're a slightly different color I had a glasses emergency they snapped in half I had the same glasses for like two or three years somebody could probably factcheck that by going back through all my videos and see when I got different glasses but please do that Internet it would just that would be an interesting tidbit from knowledge for me to know but I had to mergency run to the glasses store I they happily had the same pair of glasses in stock with a different color bought them new lenses in boom but I also went to the eye doctor oh this is what you're all here for right my update on my eyes what do the eye doctor I have news for everybody I'm getting a new pair of glasses it's a new prescription in I don't know which sound effect goes with this so soon you will not see me do this this is what I do now I have my coding train notebook where I write down thoughts and feelings and dreams and desires suggested exercise ideas then I go to read my notebook aha I can see it now so hopefully it's gonna help my vision there before I take a break I would like to thank the sponsor of the coding train brilliant brilliant brilliant is an app a website a way of life I suppose it's something that I really found myself enjoying more and more ever since they became a sponsor and I got to use their website and I keep going through it too you know if you I mean if you want to learn about friction and physics I bet there's a whole course on brilliant about that stuff in fact I know that there is I have more recently been looking I'm gonna switch over here to a video there course of computer science fundamentals topics in computer science what the thing that I really love about it is the fact that all the lessons are interactive so it's a different way of learning than having a weirdo on the internet talk to you which is what you're experiencing right now but being able to learn some of these concepts through a stepbystep interactive lessons one thing that's really nice about that is you don't get stuck with all the syntax and so what's what's especially nice for me is like I never really took computer science courses so I just kind of learned a lot of this stuff through different programming classes and other teachers and books that I read and so it's not it helps me and sort of think about the lessons that I want to do to sort of see how somebody else has written InDesign to curriculum so you can see it's all done with sort of like pseudocode style and you can move these blocks around but then what's here now it I really want to show to you is that you can also do everything also with Python so brilliant has built Python into the browser itself so you can run exercises and learn the code concepts and then actually code it with Python and Python you know if I were to suggest a language that I don't use on this channel that you should also experiment way they learned Python would probably be right up there at the top of my list oh I see that dusty in the chat by the way is talking about momentum and angular momentum and inertia again if you want to do a much deeper dive into this physics stuff brilliant is the place for you I mean I'm really glossing over glazing over some of these like lowerlevel concepts and actually one of the things that well let's look at really quickly together if you go to the website I've signed in I do have a premium account I'll talk about how you can get well you could just go to brilliant org slash coding train you'll get if you want to unlock all the features all of the courses all of the the archive of daily prom challenges you can get 20% off the first 200 people to to go to that link and subscribe to a premium edition we'll get that but just even just scrolling through the daily challenges you'll see that a lot of them are very look at this a spring based one I actually so I did this one earlier and I got it wrong so you know I like to like do a challenge and hope to get it right but I really should just let myself get them wrong I totally did this one I you should try this one I got it wrong I was and I and I make tutorials about spring forces and I got it wrong so I I was gonna do this one which III looked at while I was in a meeting and it looked really fun because it's like so let's see if I can let's see if we could do this quickly before I take my break let's do it together so this is this idea of balancing scales so if s given to balance scales we might ask how the green triangle ways okay the green triangle is T and the blue square is s so s plus T square plus triangle equals three because they're balanced two squares plus one triangle goes v so we could to solve for one of these we could subtract one equation from the other so we'd have like two s minus s is s t minus T is gone then 5 minus 2/3 is 2 so if so if I subtract this bottom equation from this one I would get s equals 2 I did look at this earlier it's sort of like going through this yet s equals 2 and it's showing this visually oh this would be awesome to do is like a p5 sketch where like as you like interactively take these things on and off it moves somebody do that that'd be cool so you can see this is what I just talked through to s plus t minus s plus t minus 3 s equals 2 so now this I suspect we're going to be able to do with the same methodology let me go to the whiteboard now I think that I want to leave this I'm going to leave this up here because I'm going to do a video I'm gonna the next tutorial I'm going to make use of it but let me write down all of these equations so I've got two T equals s plus 4 let's see if we can do this you guys keep beat 2 T plus s equals 4 keep let me know if I'm doing this correctly ok I need to look at the question s plus T equals C for circle S Plus T equals C look at those two equations 2's plus C equals 3t to ass plus what was it C equals 3t ah 2 s plus CC equals 3t okay so what do I want to do well I could do this equation minus this equation right so is if I'm if I'm saying like very little space here a b c let me take equation a minus B so 2t minus T is T s minus s is nothing equals 4 minus C so I know T equals 4 minus C do I have something with just T and C in it yes yes this right oh no but this will is this gonna do what I want what if I were to take oh well I could do s plus 4 minus C equals C right because I could take 4 minus C and put it in there so s equals to C minus 4 this is not really getting me anywhere is it well what else do i what else could I do so now C and T for 2's I'm like losing my oh you know what's interesting I could do I have another idea I have another idea what do you add these three t plus two s equals four plus C and then I also have three t minus 2 s equals C aha so let me subtract these two for s equals 4 could that possibly be right s is 1 am i right the first equation is wrong 2 s equals 2 T equals s plus 400 I'm solving the wrong problem equation a is 4 let's just start over start over edit all that part out 2 T equals s plus 4 oh this is gonna make this easier isn't it like I still do the same sort of thing I can do 2 t minus C equals 4 minus T oh look at this right and then 3 t minus C equals 4 or C equals 4 minus 3 T right no 3 t minus 4 C equals 3 t minus 4 that seems useful right okay plus 4 no minus 4 right so many that chat says 3t plus 4 equals C people are telling me I'm totally doing this wrong I'm gonna get there this is the last thing I do today I'm gonna get there oh this is much harder than I thought it's not I don't think so it's just performance anxiety here okay all right so now what was I doing I wanted to I wanted to add these two together I like that or does that not really do me any good okay what I could say wait let's just confirm is this correct you're correct okay okay I'm correct Simon's probably already solved this like for like the generic case like something I don't know I came in yes let's see where do I want to do next to t minus C equals 4 minus it so C equals 3t minus or what does that get me um because I could replace now we could put this here put this here I want to get rid of look at this this is a 3t okay got it got it got it these two these two these two now huh there we go 2 s C minus C equals 4 s equals 2 okay we got 1 s equals to s equals to people s equals 2 well that's good to know so we could change a lot of things we've got s so that means I I hate to erase anything but let's say we've solved now that s is 2 so basically I'm saying oh well now this is easy so s equals 2 so 2 T equals 6 so T equals 3 s is 2 and T equals 3 and now I need to just know what C is C is s plus 2 C is 5 I think we got this so now if T right T was what the triangle was 3 so this is 12 how do I make 12 out of 5 and 2 well 2 2 circles and 1 square 2 circles in 1 square is that one of the options Simon didn't solve it yet no that's impossible there's no way I solve this faster than Simon not possible well maybe I got it wrong oh but you enjoyed that and want to have fun with problems like that on your own the other thing that the thing that I really like about this is looking at the explanations in seeing how people did it oh look at this so first of all what I think would be actually quite exciting to do which I didn't I did it through like formula is actually just doing visually by like moving things around which as you can see that's what happened here right oh you could just add look at that oh that is so clever you take the circle put it down here take the triangle the square and put it down here take the two squares away oh my god that would've solved it in like two seconds look this show you that again look at that so if you take well I didn't even need the first one because you just take the triangle two square and put it there put the circle there they're still balanced and then just take two squares away oh that is so cool so if you hope you like stuff like this I encourage you to check out brilliant at brilliant org slash Co d'etre and we'll let them know that you found it through me it's a nice thing to do if you can you can have you can do all the free stuff there's no need to pay for anything but if you want to unlock all the features you can get a premium subscription you can also give a premium as a gift it's a thing you could do and you'll get first two hundred people to go through this URL will get 20% off all right so I'm gonna take a short break when I come back I'm gonna look at drag fluid resistance gravitational attraction I have an hour I have an hour we'll see how we do we'll see how we go all right I'll be back shortly and by the way quick update Manuel Lopez did finally go and eat eat thank good job I'm glad you've got your belly is full you're full of sustenance stay healthy get sleep next thing is sleep be with family and friends all those things all right we are back okay quick announcements or it's not really an announcement thanks again to brilliant I hope you had fun with this puzzle I wanted to mention the coding train score I've talked about this a few times if you would enjoy any of these things they're available to you don't no need for you to buy them if you will not enjoy them it's fine with me either way just want to make the stuff available it is a little bit a little bit extra income to go for that book behind but I did want to make an announcement that I'm told breaking news there have been enough hoodies ordered for the coding train hoodies to be made but get your order in probably sometime in the next week or so I'll post in the discord maybe as a reminder somebody remind me to the exact date but there will be a deadline for this because they're gonna make a certain number of them based on people who ordered them so if you do want one of these and then if you don't you don't need to before I was like please order one because I wanted them to make enough so I could order some for myself but now there's enough so only if you want one there you go I will say no not gonna like be all salesy but these notebooks are so delightful I have like literally like a and I use them all the time now and I really quite enjoy them although I do want to do want to make a another one with because there's one thing like the the graph paper maybe some of those are you can tell me is this like European style graph paper or like um so hold on so this is what the can you see this maybe if I turn the light on it's very very small I don't know I can't I can't see it I don't know if you can but oh look there's me oh and I'm upside down and now I'm rightside up just show this to you kind of closer let's see maybe I can get this in the this is obviously really important what I'm doing right now um come over here so I'd actually work there if I like it focuses on it you can see that graph paper it's like very light and very tiny so I think I want to get a little bit larger graph paper in a little bit darker for the next round the next round okay so back to some coding and stuff next up there we go let's see yeah okay use a black sharpie just measure is it 1/4 inch or X number of millimeters I would guess X number of millimeters okay there we go why is that why do I have a negative in mine and I guess maybe the alright well okay all right so I guess I could have erased that after all because I'm just gonna go erase it now oh the whiteboard camera is off let's do something about that okay all right kind of wanted to okay like a spherical body but I'll just use my eraser welcome back welcome back oh where was the super chat there was a super chat where welcome to the kodi train where we discussed the pitch of notepad graph paper didn't even know pitch was the word to describe that all right I'm really feeling quite sleepy I can I can do this 223 less than an hour I'm so I think I feel confident at a minimum I can cover this topic and at a maximum I will also do the gravitational attraction though that feels a little bit yeah Thank You Koby who's pointing out the difference between the Wikipedia formula on this one welcome back coder that's a good one welcome back dreams and I don't know the words okay welcome back oh hello we are here you're here I am here markers attacking me I know it needs to happen earlier today on the coding train we left off with number ten thousand eight hundred and fifty eight let's continue 1466 I know it's making me go sleep more inside I have returned for yet another chapter two video on forces and in this video I want to cover the drag force what is a drag force what's the formula for calculating a drag force and how do I take that formula and apply it in code so previously I did this with friction so this is my little series of case studies when a look at friction I'm gonna look at drag next I'm gonna look at gravitational attraction but these are just three examples they're nice ways for me to show you hey these formulas they're not so scary we can unpack them we can turn them into code and let's just it's getting warm in here again come on air conditioning really hello and welcome back to another video in Chapter two the nature of code about forces so the last video I look at it friction and modeling friction and in this video I want to look at a drag force which is quite similar to friction but also different isn't that that's why I'm looking at it but what I'm really doing here in these in these four wrap up videos to chapter two is it's taking doing some case studies what are formulas that you might find in a textbook or Wikipedia that you just sort of like feel like what are those mean how do I even use that try to unpack those formulas and apply them in code so so the first formula so the case study that this video will examine is drag drag force sometimes called air resistance it's a kind of friction and it's part of the field of study of fluid dynamics and there's all sorts of interesting fluid simulation crazy stuff you could do and there's lift and all sorts of a lot you could get into it's getting hot in here maybe just remove the sweater or that would just be enough Dayenu there's the concept of Reynolds numbers there's laminar flow oh my god there's turbulence most first of topics but I'm going to boil things down and try to look at this particular formula for calculating a drag force and it follows and and I've brought that formula right here into the nature of codebook and this corresponds to this particular diagram okay tell me the tale any of your Stokes I'll tell you a tearing up Navy no Stokes on a winter night started with fluid passing a threehour computational simulation a threehour cavitational simulation I I brought that formula right here into the nature of codebook and this is what I'm going to use so let's come over to the whiteboard and replace the friction formula this is the formula we want to implement and the context of what implemented in is a two dimensional p5 canvas where we have a body that's moving with a current I'm gonna point it down that's moving with a current velocity point it down once again we're calculating a force so we need to both determine the direction of the force and the magnitude let's start with direction what is identical to what we did with friction in air is that in turn identical to friction is the direction of drag we have the velocity unit vector and negative 1/2 so the drag force points in the opposite direction of velocity so that's something we already know how to do it's scaled with this negative 1/2 because you know science but to us in our p5 world whether this is negative 1/2 or 5 it's gonna be less important because this is madeup units of measurement anyway then we have to start looking at other aspects of this I forgot what Rho is Rho I know it a is surface area this is speed what's Rho again density that's what I thought yeah yeah okay yeah but coefficient is different than you know whatever let's go through these one at a time so this Greek letter Rho is stands for density so what is this moving through well if I were to take this marker and drop it there would be air resistance it's moving through a gas the air so what is the density of the air versus if it landed in water what's the density of the water versus mud or jello or whatever kind of thing it's moving through but for us the important thing here assuming this is a what am i what am I saying here what's the word I'm looking for it's the same all over the place zooming this is a not universal this is a consistent continuous there's a word I'm looking for us it's completely escape mic it went with my hair it's on the floor of the barbershop with all that air my vocabulary assuming that this is just full of all the same stuff this is a constant so the density is a constant so let's mark this off with a c' for constant now a what is a I'm skipping this one for a second this is the surface area meaning and if I come back to this diagram you can sort of see like oh what is the surface area that's coming in contact with the liquid or gas the fluid uniform uniform buta form uniform uniform why am I not why can I not think of that word oh my god thank you everybody you're the greatest mwah homogeneous magis it's all so good a homogeneous uniform in our p5 world assuming this circle his body is moving through a kind of homogeneous uniform space it's all the same stuff the density of this air or fluid or whatever it is is a constant so Rho the density is a constant shoot I forgot that I had skipping V squared for a second let's go to a so a this is surface area so if I come back to the diagram in the nature of codebook we can see here the idea is what is the surface area of the object coming into contact with the fluid and you can think of it like this is it aerodynamic or not does it come with like a to a sharp point where there's a very little surface area or is it kind of like a wide load and there's a lot of surface area moving through this fluid huh while this is something I absolutely could try to model based on thinking about different shapes and different sizes of those shapes I could also just consider that a constant and maybe I'll just say all of the objects in my world come in with a come in with a surface area of one but I'm really just going to consider this to be a constant so if I were to model it it might make the ultimate simulation more dynamic and more realistic but it's one thing that I think it's a detail that I can mostly ignore especially if I have a lot of circular bodies of relative similar shape especially have a lot of a circular bodies of relative similars so especially if I have a lot of circular bodies of relative similar size then we have the coefficient of drag itself what's that that's a constant it's a constant and one and it's a constant that has to do is the strength of the drag force and has to do with what is the quality of the material the fluid the air the gas the liquid all these words are the same thing it's a cut it's a constant that sort of it's a constant that maps to the relative strength of the drag force itself so is the object moving through mud or is it moving through air or some kind of very lightweight gas versus a heavier liquid density and this coefficient are kind of related but you know what I'm saying is all of these are constants what I'm saying is all of these these three elements with this negative 1/2 which is literally a constant I could consider to be a constant in my simulation so I can actually take this formula and simplify it greatly a drag force is equal to negative 1 times the coefficient the cops drag constantly drag force is equal to negative 1 times some constant I'll call that the coefficient of drag it's an acute it's a constant that takes into account the negative 1/2 the surface area the density and the coefficient of drag times V squared times the unit vector V so once again the direction is in the opposite direction of velocity and it's scaled according to some constant times and this one is really important this is the speed squared it's the magnitude of the velocity vector and this is key those faster the object this was not the case with friction not the case with kinetic friction doesn't matter how fast the object was moving the friction force is proportional proportional to that speed but in the case of drag it's absolutely proportional if I were to hold this marker absolutely still it's not moving at all there is no drag force on it but if it's moving very very fast that drag force will be stronger it's moving slowly it'll be weaker and that's absolutely something I want to model so you want the magnitude of this vector squared in our formula and guess what we are ready to put this formula into our code why did I say it that way and we are ready to put this for now that we've boiled it down to this simpler version of the formula we can apply this in code oh right Thank You Koby for the super chat reminder vsquared maybe yes thank you Chris Rea let me I'll also note that the magnitude of a vector is often written as with two bars along the side whoops I should also note that another way that you might see another notation for writing the magnitude of the vector is the name of the vector with two bars along each side so you could also also rewrite this formula like this first voice was the best place keep that keep the crazy voice where are we were timewise 240 okay yeah well I don't think I'm doing the gravitational attraction today but I'm very pleased it's Viking just every time if I get further along through this eventually all the tutorials will be made and this is okay whoops second we just change a couple things have been like okay this is exactly the same example that I finished with in the previous video and the only thing that I've done is well I'm having the movers start a little bit higher up because it's gonna give me more space to work with and I also have changed the name of the function that previously was called friction and now it's called drag so I'm actually just gonna take out all of the code but limonade what was before friction and now calculate a drag force start over I'm going to begin with the code that I had in from the previous video the exact same code the only thing that I've done differently is that I've renamed the friction function and called it drag friction function function friction friction function one more time with feeling I'm going to well how do we even we're at where we're even am I in the world that's that's the question I don't have and have to demonstrate how to implement this I'm taking a exact duplicate of the code I wrote in the previous video demonstrating friction and all I've done here is I've renamed the friction function and I'm calling it drag so what are elements is there anything here that I want to keep well actually there is one thing that I want to keep which is that I want to when I'm getting the direction of the vector I want negative one times the velocity unit vector so this is what I want to keep I want the direction now of the drag force and I've got it here in this variable called drag what's next I need the magnitude of the drag force it is speed squared times the coefficient of drag well let's make up a coefficient let's call it 0.1 the speed is this dot velocity dot mag and now drag set the drags magnitude whoops and then set the drags magnitude to C times speed and apply the force here we go notice anything look how it feels like they're kind of like well I've lost the ability to speak look how these smaller ones are kind of like they're kind of like I'm gonna push their way through whatever it is they're in it's kind of weird like suddenly they're not all falling at the same speed because the fluid resistance is acting on them differently drag resistance let's see what happens if we make C much stronger I'm gonna make it five oh why did those two like why does one fall what is going on that is really weird did the number get so could it be that there's a zero velocity and then if I normalize a zero velocity no what is going on they may know why that's happening Oh speed squared let's go all the way back this is actually quite incorrect remember it's not proportional to the speed it's proportional to the speed squared the time speed guess what though there's actually a function in p5 called mag squared for magnitude squared so be a little bit more efficient if I just call this like speed squared and use the magnitude squared function let's run this ok so we can see that the objects with a width we can see that the objects with less mass we can see that these objects that have less mass have a more difficult time accelerating their that drag force is stronger pushing them the opposite direction of their velocity let's see what happens if I take C and make it like a really high number like 5 you can see this all of these are like really having trouble moving they're just like slower if I make it like 500 can I get them just like the force to be so strong that they don't move whoa so one thing I really have to watch out for is with this mass sorry with the math that I'm doing that force could become so strong it will actually push them back up in the opposite direction and which wouldn't actually happen but you know again with all the various inaccuracies of things that I'm doing I probably need to put some constraints on this but with something like a coefficient of drag of like 0.1 in this context with that I'm getting kind of realistic behavior but I really want to emphasize this in a sort of more meaningful way so I think what I'm going to do is consider half of the canvas to have like a liquid and a thick liquid that has a strong drag to its rack coefficient and the other have to be busily a vacuum with no drag so let's go to the canvas and draw a rectangle let's say fill 255 with an alpha a 50 a rectangle oh let's see and we can make it even a little bit brighter okay so I want to draw on half of the canvas this rectangle that shows sort of like as if these objects are falling and land in water or land in some liquid so in this case I'll just say if mover dot position dot Y is greater than height divided by two mover drag so we should now see them all fall with group all fall at the exact same rate but once they hit the water the fluid resistance will affect them differently pause dot why let's make that drag force even a little bit stronger whoa look at that see that's the issue if it's too strong you can see it's kind of like that's not very realistic it's like bouncing it's like bouncing off of it which is kind of like a weird this is sort of fun a little like bug it's a feature not a bug but obviously it doesn't feel very at realistic maybe it might make sense for me to have this like drag coefficient be a global variable and actually perhaps even it's something that gets passed in to the function itself let's make it point to I'm Victor's asking why postcode for these lessons yeah all this code is all getting posted in fact versions of these examples are already honestly like posted as part of the nature codebook but I'm redoing them a little bit okay so this is now complete one thing that I would say it's like how I'm thinking about the area of the canvas that is the liquid is very just wrap up this video okay I'll answer some questions yeah I'm doing very well on time but I don't want to I don't think I have enough time to get all the way through the next example so I will just answer some questions and stuff for the next ten minutes but let me let me try to wrap this up and Lani has a question that I will a rigid body that I will ask although I about that question okay okay oh god I forgot to check if the recording to disk was working we're just going to hope it was so andrew is mentioning something about surface area I was gonna okay just write this down so this wraps up this particular example to demonstrating a track force here's some exercises of things you could try one is I'm not being very thoughtful about how I'm considering the twodimensional space that is the canvas I just kind of used height divided by two as this arbitrary marker between vacuum and liquid maybe I would actually want to create a liquid class an object that describes a density a coefficient and a area of the canvas where that liquid or gas is present and then I could build a map right of having different liquids with different coefficients and different parts and have a much more dynamic system of things experiencing different amounts of drag depending on where they are and maybe it's all color coded there's lots of possibilities there another thing that I might consider what's is thinking about surface area surface area wouldn't be so difficult to consider because there's probably away surface area isn't something that's so difficult to consider I could kind of use the idea of a circumference of a circle and think about the mass and how much surface area sorry surface area is something that I definitely could consider there's probably a way having trouble getting my sentence out yeah you know here I'm assuming that all of the objects have the same surface area which isn't true and I can visually see that they don't and there's probably at least a very basic way that I can consider the size the radius or the circumference half circumference of the circle perhaps to be its surface area and have that be a factor in how I calculate the magnitude of a drag force so that's definitely you would something I would suggest trying as well so please so let me know if you have questions about this particular implementation try to make your own version of it think about just even the sort of like visual design and interaction the system but also what kinds of adjustments could you make to how the drag force behaves and what types of results might you get from that and go to the coding training comm where you can share your versions of this particular example and I've got one more chapter two video to make where I'm going to look at the formula for gravitational attraction and look at orbiting orbiting bodies see you there uhuh another day another video ah reminder from yesterday's stream was CJ about yes Lindt mass is different too but mass is not playing a role in drag I mean it's playing a role in the sense that its motion is based on its moving because of a gravitational force which is scaled according to mass but mass is not part of a drag force a drag force calculation yeah Andrews giving me some great suggestions of a formula that I could use for surface area that I will try maybe later please try and share it with me in the discord okay Pollock rights surface area of the sphere I mean these aren't spheres but the sphere that's hitting the water is the same as the area of a circle with the same radius okay thank you all of you people who are watching and all leaving at this very moment as I can see one of the nice things about the stream deck I mean this probably isn't a nice thing because I should not be so like tied to these numbers but it shows me how many people are tuned in at any given time so I have about well three minutes now I mean my hard hard hard cutoff was 315 but my actual cutoff was 3 so I will be properties of a rigid body like in unity you can add a rigidbody component to objects ok so let me let me address this question from Lonny so I I don't know if I really know the answer to this question but one of the things I'm not doing in any of these examples right now is considering these objects to be rigid bodies and have rigid body collisions and by rigid body I mean that the it is an object that is not soft and two objects can't be in the same place at the same time and so they collide collisions so I'm not modeling anything to do with collisions here and that is something that I have explored through physics libraries like matter dot J s oh hi k weak bond you're here just in time for me to say goodbye and to put on this little bit of music so I will gladly take a few more questions before I go for the day and I will be back I think next week is a normal next it's gonna be every Thursday except for the Thursdays I'm not here but I think for the next two weeks I'm here both Thursday so Thursday is my new live stream days and my goal is three live streams every month one coding in the Cabana video every month so I've got to get to that next coding in the Cabana video what else what else do I got google Summer of Code google Summer of Code is happening I think the application pier I'm not an official representative Google Summer of Code but I do participate in the processing foundation and we are a mentoring organization for google Summer of Code so if you are a student and you want to apply I encourage you to go to the google Summer of Code website and look through all of the organizations I think there are over 200 and we can see if we recognize or know any of them let's see if I can find processing there we go processing foundation there we go and Oh Dana wait wait is this pure data but it's now per data well can we make processing purchasing or tossing processing fur I love you forever because you a perfect dog puns and cat puns I can't get enough of them Ricardo asks will you continue to do the coding in the Cabana series what's my favorite food a sushi we continue to do the coding in the Cabana series yes so I think that I was a little bit too overly ambitious in terms of what was realistic I kind of wanted to do coding in the Cabana every week I don't like it's hard for me to find the time to do it I think I need to figure out a better way to like organize my schedule it's an allocate work time for it but I think once a month is hopefully realistic how are you drawing strokes for use in a neural network I'm not sure I understand that question pineapple on pizza no Jenny I'm like a no uncooked pineapple I like pineapple go do the pineapple fried rice with tofu ginger is that a thing that goes in it Persis thing hurts the same yes I have two cats oh if you want to learn if you want to know about my cats follow mango and goose on Instagram I William asked are you going to learn and use unity I would like to I went to a workshop on that was teaching with unity and I was just like what do I want you know that think where your eyes come out of your head and go born weren't went wearing mine that happened to me this is very disturbing I had them took me a while to get the eyes back thank you all for being with me in this strange adventure that I'm having being the youtubing person I have to say I kind of like I was long as twitch stream with CJ I'm really quite impressed with twitch as a streaming platform and it's just too late for me like I'm here this is where I am maybe I'll move someday but I just couldn't possibly figure out if that makes any sense to do but CJ I turned me on to this I guess I'm getting an ad now but there's all these like live coders on Twitch and there's like insta fluff he's like a really awesome one I don't want to watch this ad anyway people are only feeds to fluff is live streaming right now looked awesome oh yeah Andrew reminds me you asked me to mention the change of basis at the end of this stream so thanks there's a three blue one brown video I believe that has to do with vector math and change in basis that I so I think Andrew I'm gonna take a look at that after the stream is over so let's chat about that later on discord perhaps oh it's a fluff is life if this it's if I've just always live actually that's maybe a reason why I can't stream on Twitch I think the idea of twitch is like for people who stream like very very often not but I'm the way I mean I in some ways I aspire to its three more often I know I can stream to multiple sites at once and I have tried that it's it's a little too much for me to manage all the different systems so here we are this platform works for now little lot asked me about Bluetooth and Chrome that's not something I've really pursued or have the time to pursue right now but there is a p5 ble library which I guess is for Bluetooth Low Energy devices so I would encourage you to check out this p5 ble Jes library if you're interested doing stuff with p5 and Bluetooth and it's really nicely documented it's worked on by a bunch of colleagues of mine here at NYU Lonnie is asking something about the difference between a PDE which I think of as the prosthetic development environment and something an eau de I've no idea sorry I don't know what those are we use the way the check and help sure oh I'm getting some words of encouragement to Stan you dip up and my time is up I will see you all next week next Thursday on the coding trade oh I forgot all those new I forgot to put all the new sound mixes on the sound board so you'll have to live with my usual ones like I'm gonna do this this star this star this star this star song never forget the Vista I'm gonna say once again coordinates coordinates autotuned and the internet will fix that for me so this is random this is noise Perley noise that is in the core random algorithm the actual random algorithm itself those numbers aren't related at all you pick like I'm picking random numbers between zero and ten nine two seven six one nine four eight nine to one thirty I pick nine a lot apparently but with curly noise I might pick numbers like this two three four three four five six five four five six seven five six seven five six seven eight nine eight seven six well this is like Perlin noise performance part 1 2 3 4 3 4 5 he was like birthing noise performance apart with curly noise I might pick numbers like this by purling noise that is totally noise so this is Hurley noise that is Hurley noises this is Hurley noise senator Leno so this is Hurley noise that is hurtling noise but with pearly noise I might pick numbers like this this is like Perlin noise performance part unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what else is there yes kittens thank you very much kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice that look what I get I'm really losing my mind I feel just sort of like a nice feeling of relaxation everything's gonna be okay today dream is not broken it has not frozen this isn't this is a wonderful thing okay we're gonna do it I'm really getting to something I need my sound all sorts of text generation analysis things that I will use continuously kidding
