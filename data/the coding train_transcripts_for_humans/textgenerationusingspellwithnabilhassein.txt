00:22 - >> IEL SHIFFMAN: HELLO, 
EVERYONE!  WELCOME TO THIS 
00:25 - LIVE-CODE TRAINING EPISODE, OR 
EVENT, AND IT IS SPONSORED BY 
00:29 - SPELL.  YOU CAN GO TO 
SPELL.COM/CODING
00:36 - SPELL.COM/CODINGTRAIN.  THERE'S 
AN INTRO TO SPELL PLATFORM.
00:41 - WE HAD A TUTORIAL ON HOW TO
00:48 - TRAIN A STYLE MODEL.  WE
00:55 - HAVE NABIL HASSEIN WHO IS GOING 
TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO
01:06 - THANE  TRAIN AN LSTM MODEL.  
THANK YOU TO WHITE COAT 
01:11 - CAPTIONING, THERE SHOULD BE 
CAPTIONS SAYING THINGS LIKE 
01:15 - MANGO, BLUEBERRY, BANANA, 
HOPEFULLY.  AND I WILL TELL YOU 
01:23 - ABOUT NABIL, HE IS A 
BROOKLYN-BASED ARTIST, WEB 
01:28 - DEVELOPER, AND ALUMNI OF 
01:39 - NYU.  
HE .
01:42 - YOU CAN FIND OUT MORE ABOUT 
NABIL AND THE WORK HE IS DOING 
01:45 - AND THE PROJECTS HE IS 
ININVOLVED IN AT THE WEBSITE.  
01:49 - AND NOW, RIGHT NOW, THE 
DESCRIPTION IS PRETTY BARE, IT 
01:55 - IS NABIL'S BILLOW AND A FEW 
WORDS ABOUT WHAT WE'RE GOING
02:04 - TO DO TODAY.  SO YOU SHOULD LOOK
AT THE LIVE CHAT HERE TO MAKE 
02:10 - SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS WORKING.
I WILL BRING NABIL ON AND LOOK 
02:15 - AT THE LIVE CHAT AND LET ME KNOW
IF THERE ARE TECHNICAL ISSUES WE
02:18 - CAN FIX BEFORE WE GET STARTED 
WITH THE TUTORIAL.  ANYTHING I 
02:21 - MISSED?
SO I WILL BRING NABIL IN, AND 
02:24 - WE'RE GOING TO AWKWARDLY SWITCH 
PLACES, I WILL WATCH THE CHAT, 
02:31 - IF THERE ARE QUESTIONS, POST 
THEM THERE.
02:33 - OKAY, THANKS.  AND HERE WE GO.  
WELCOME, NABIL.
02:40 - NABIL HASSEIN: WELCOME, 
EVERYONE.  THANK YOU FOR THE 
02:42 - GREAT INTRODUCTION, AND THANKS 
SPELL FOR PAYING ME TO MAKE THIS
02:46 - VIDEO, OR DO THE LIVE STREAM.  I
HAVE AN OUTLINE OF WHAT I 
02:50 - PLANNED TO GO THROUGH.  SO I 
GUESS I WILL INTRODUCE MYSELF.  
02:55 - I'M NABIL, I LIVE IN BROOKLYN, 
I'M A FREELANCE TECHNOLOGIST, 
02:59 - EDUCATOR, I DO SOME OTHER 
THINGS.  AGAIN, THANK YOU SPELL 
03:03 - FOR SPONSORING THIS VIDEO.
SO THIS LIVE STREAM IS ABOUT HOW
03:06 - TO TRAIN AN LSTM MODEL USING THE
SPELL PLATFORM, SO ON SOME 
03:11 - REMOTE MACHINES SOMEWHERE.
AND THEN HOW TO USE THAT MODEL 
03:15 - THAT WE'VE TRAINED USING A 
LIBRARY CALLED ML5.JS, A 
03:22 - BROWSER-BASED FRONT END LIBRARY 
FOR USING MACHINE LEARNING 
03:26 - MODELS. SO IN THIS VIDEO, I WILL
TRY TO DO A FEW THINGS, TRULY 
03:31 - LIVE FOR YOU HERE TODAY.  I'M 
GOING TO EXTEND A PROJECT THAT I
03:36 - DID AT THE SCHOOL FOR 
COMPUTATION, WHICH DAN 
03:41 - MENTIONED, LAST SUMMER.  SO THE 
PROJECT, I CAN SHOW YOU THE 
03:43 - VERSION OF IT THAT IS LIVE ON 
THE WEB.
03:48 - SO THIS I TRAINED USING A MARKOV
MODEL.  SO THIS IS A RHYME 
03:53 - GENERATOR, BASED ON THE LYRICS 
OF ONE OF MY FAVORITE EMCEES, MF
04:01 - DOOM.  EVERY TIME I CLICK A 
RHYME BUTTON, IT GENERATES 
04:06 - RANDOM RHYMES PATTERNED ON HIS 
LYRICS.  THIS VIDEO ISN'T REALLY
04:12 - ABOUT THAT PROJECT, IT IS ABOUT 
HOW TO USE SPELL.  BUT IT GIVE 
04:16 - YOU A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND, 
AND THE CODE IS LIVE IF YOU WANT
04:18 - TO -- OR THE CODE IS PUBLIC ON 
GITHUB IF YOU WANT TO CHECK IT 
04:22 - OUT AT SOME POINT.
AND I USED A LIBRARY CALLED 
04:26 - PRONOUNCING, WHICH WAS CREATED 
-- AND I'M NOT SURE IF TOO MANY 
04:31 - PEOPLE -- A LOT OF WORK WAS DONE
BY ALLISON PERISH AND I USED 
04:37 - THAT LIBRARY TO GENERATE A PAIR 
OF RHYMING WORDS, I TRAINED THE 
04:41 - MODEL BACKWARDS ON THE INPUT 
TEXT SO I CAN GENERATE THE REST 
04:46 - OF THE SENTENCE GOING FROM THE 
END TO THE BEGINNING, AND THEN 
04:50 - REVERSE ORDER.
DANIEL SHIFFMAN: APPARENTLY 
04:53 - THERE IS STATIC IN THE AUDIO.
LET ME SEE IF I CAN HEAR IT 
04:58 - HERE.
NABIL HASSEIN TEST : TESTING, 
05:02 - TESTING. SHOULD I MOVE THE MIC?
UNCLIP IT FOR
05:15 - A SECOND.
08:33 - NABIL HASSEIN: OKAY, SO TALKING 
ABOUT THE VUD VIDEO, TRAINING AN
08:45 - LSTM MODEL.  SO LET'S GO AHEAD 
AND GET INTO IT.
08:47 - SO THE NEXT THING: SO I'M NOT 
REALLY GOING TO TALK TOO MUCH IN
08:53 - THIS VIDEO ABOUT THE THEORY OF 
NEURAL NETWORKS OR WHAT AN LSTM 
09:00 - MODEL IS, BUT IT STANDS FOR 
LONG-SHORT TERM MEMORY.  IT IS A
09:05 - SPECIFIC TYPE OF RECURRENT 
NEURAL NETWORK AND WHAT IS 
09:10 - USEFUL ABOUT RECURRENT NEURAL 
NETWORKS IS THE WAY THEIR 
09:15 - ARCHITECTURE INCLUDES LOOPS.  
AND THAT CAN BE USEFUL FOR KIND 
09:18 - OF KEEPING DATA AROUND IN THE 
NETWORKS, SO TO SPEAK, WHICH IS 
09:22 - USEFUL FOR APPLICATIONS 
INVOLVING NATURAL LANGUAGE, 
09:26 - HUMAN LANGUAGE.
BECAUSE CONTEXT MATTERS SO MUCH 
09:30 - IN LANGUAGE.
LIKE, PREDICTING THE NEXT 
09:32 - CHARACTER, OR THE NEXT WORD, 
MIGHT BE -- YOU MIGHT GET A MUCH
09:36 - BETTER PREDICTION IF YOU 
ACTUALLY REMEMBER WHAT WAS SAID,
09:39 - EVEN SOME WHILE AGO, MAYBE MUCH 
EARLIER IN A LONG SENTENCE.  SO 
09:45 - I HAVE A FEW QUICK REFERENCES 
HERE, WHICH RIGHT NOW ARE A 
09:48 - LITTLE OLD.  BUT THIS IS -- 
THESE ARE WHAT I READ TO LEARN A
09:52 - LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT RECURRENT 
NEURAL NETWORKS.  SO THERE'S A 
09:58 - BLOG POST, THE UNREASONABLE 
EFFECTIVE OVER RECURRENT NEURAL 
10:02 - NETWORKS AND THERE'S A BLOG POST
CALLED UNDERSTANDING LSTMS, OR 
10:07 - -- DID I TYPE ALL OF THIS 
SOMEHOW? I MUST HAVE.  I WILL 
10:13 - FIX THAT.
YEAH, IT IS CALLED UNDERSTANDING
10:17 - LSTMS.
SO, YEAH, THIS GIVES A LITTLE 
10:20 - BIT OF OVERVIEW OF THE STUFF I 
WAS TALKING ABOUT.  HUMANS ARE 
10:24 - THINKING FROM SCRATCH EVERY 
SECOND, YOU UNDERSTAND A WORD 
10:27 - BASED ON THE UNDERSTANDING FROM 
PREVIOUS WORDS, AND WITH THE 
10:32 - NETWORK, THAT'S WHY WE ARE USING
THIS LSTM MODEL.
10:35 - AND, YEAH, I KNOW THAT BEFORE I 
HAD THE CHANCE -- WHILE 
10:39 - PREPARING FOR THIS VIDEO TO 
WATCH A VIDEO ON AN OVERVIEW OF 
10:45 - THE SPELL PLATFORM, A LINK TO 
THAT WILL BE ADDED TO THE VIDEO 
10:48 - DESCRIPTION AND YOU CAN GET MORE
IN-DEPTH ABOUT USING SPELL, AND 
10:53 - I WILL MENTION SOME THINGS ABOUT
USING SPELL AS WE GO THROUGH 
10:57 - THIS.  SO WHEN YOU WANT TO DO A 
PROJECT LIKE THIS, FIRST YOU 
11:00 - HAVE TO GET YOUR CORPUS OF DATA.
AND SO IN THIS CASE, SINCE I WAS
11:06 - GETTING SONG LYRICS, I USED A 
SITE CALLED GENIUS.COM, WHICH 
11:12 - YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH, IT A 
POPULAR LYRICS WEBSITE.  AND THE
11:16 - MAIN THING I USE IT FOR IS 
READING LYRICS.
11:19 - AND SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO, I 
WILL DO EVERYTHING FROM SCRATCH,
11:24 - SO TO SPEAK, SO YOU SHOULD BE 
ABLE TO FOLLOW ALONG IN THEORY. 
11:29 - SO THIS IS OVER A FOLDER THAT I 
USED TO PREPARE.  WHAT I WILL DO
11:34 - IS MAKE A NEW FOLDER, CALLED 
SPELL LIVESTREAM, I WILL DO 
11:39 - EVERYTHING FROM INSIDE OF THIS 
FOLDER, WHICH IS LIVED SOMEWHERE
11:43 - IN MY COMPUTER.  SO RIGHT NOW, 
THIS FOLDER IS EMPTY.
11:47 - AND SO THE FIRST THING THAT I'M 
GOING TO DO IS CLONE MY 
11:55 - GENERATIVE DOOM REPOSITORY FROM 
GITHUB.  AND THERE IS ONLY ONE 
11:58 - FILE IN THERE THAT I CARE ABOUT,
SO MAYBE -- MAYBE I WILL NOT 
12:02 - CLONE THE WHOLE FILE STORY.  I 
WILL GET THE ONE FILE.  SO I'M
12:10 - JUST GOING TO -- I DON'T KNOW 
WHERE THIS IS.
12:12 - DID I PUSH IT UP? I HAVE SO MANY
BRANCHES HERE.  I WILL USE THE 
12:16 - ONE THAT I HAVE ON MY COMPUTER. 
SO I'M JUST GOING TO COPY A FILE
12:20 - THAT I HAVE ON MY COMPUTER INTO 
THIS FOLDER.  SO WHERE WAS THAT,
12:26 - IN SPELL
12:32 - SPELLDEMO/GENERATIVEDOOM/DATA.  
I HAVE A FILE, INPUT.TXT THAT I 
12:39 - BROUGHT A COPY OF INTO THE 
CURRENT DIRECTORY.  SO YOU CAN 
12:43 - SEE THIS IS
12:47 - JUST A LIST OF LYRICS, THIS IS 
MY CORPUS.  AND IT IS WORTH 
12:51 - NOTING THAT THE DATA SET I'M 
USING FOR THIS EXAMPLE ISN'T 
12:54 - THAT BIG.  WE CAN CHECK THE SIZE
OF IT WITH THE COMMAND LINE 
12:59 - UTILITY, DU, FOR DISK USAGE, AND
YOU CAN TELL HOW BIG THIS FILE 
13:04 - IS.  IT IS ABOUT 308 KILOBYTES. 
IT IS NOT HUGE.  
13:09 - NORMALLY WHEN YOU ARE TRAINING 
MACHINE LEARNING MODELS, THE 
13:12 - MORE DATA, THE BETTER.  BUT I 
GOT ALL THE LYRICS I COULD FIND.
13:15 - THIS IS REALLY THE MOST THAT I 
COULD GET.  SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE
13:19 - GOING TO USE.
COOL.
13:24 - SO IT IS ALSO WORTH NOTING THAT 
YOU HAVE TO CLEAN THE DATA 
13:27 - BEFORE YOU TRAIN IT.  SO I CAN 
ACTUALLY GO AHEAD AND SHOW -- I 
13:33 - CAN GO AHEAD AND SHOW THE CODE 
THAT I USED TO GET THE LYRICS.  
13:38 - IT IS ON MY GITHUB IF YOU WANT 
TO CHECK IT OUT.
13:42 - SO LET'S PUT IT
13:46 - OVER HERE.
SO I HAPPENED TO DO MY SCRAPING 
13:51 - USING PYTHON, YOU CAN USE ANY 
LANGUAGE, NODE.JS, RUBY, OR 
13:56 - WHATEVER YOUR LANGUAGE IS.  I 
USED A PYTHON LIBRARY, BEAUTIFUL
14:01 - SOUP, WHICH IS VERY USEFUL FOR 
WEB SCRAPING.  AND SO IT SO 
14:05 - HAPPENS THAT GENIUS.COM HAPPENS 
TO KEEP THEIR LYRICS IN, LIKE, 
14:10 - THEIR URLS, THEY FOLLOW A 
PATTERN LIKE THIS, 
14:19 - GENIUS.COM/ARTIST NAME AND THE 
NAME OF THE SONG, AND THEN I 
14:22 - USED ANOTHER PYTHON LIBRARY, 
REQUESTS, TO JUST GO AHEAD AND 
14:25 - FETCH ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT 
THINGS.  SO THIS IS THE BASIC 
14:28 - IDEA, I'M NOT GOING TO GO INTO 
FULL DEPTH, BUT I HARD-CODED A 
14:32 - LOT OF NAMES OF DIFFERENT SONGS 
INTO HERE AND THEN I HAVE A MAIN
14:37 - LOOP WHICH LOOPS THROUGH EACH 
ARTIST'S NAME, BECAUSE DOOM HAS 
14:43 - RECORDED UNDER DIFFERENT NAMES. 
AND THEN THE SAME THING FOR THE 
14:47 - ALBUMS, AND THEN THE SONGS, IN 
ORDER TO GO AHEAD AND FETCH ALL 
14:51 - OF THIS
14:57 - DATA.
WHEN YOU GO DIRECTLY TO SOME, 
15:01 - YOU KNOW, LYRIC'S WEBSITE, WHEN 
YOU FETCH THE DATA ON THE PAGE, 
15:06 - YOU GET A LOT OF OTHER DATA YOU 
DON'T CARE ABOUT IN THE HTML.  
15:10 - SO YOU HAVE -- AN IMPORTANT STEP
IS TO CLEAN THE DATA, SO WHEN 
15:13 - YOU ARE TRAINING THE MODEL, YOU 
ARE ONLY TRAINING IT ON THE 
15:16 - CORPUS THAT YOU CARE ABOUT, YOU 
ARE NOT TRAINING IT ON THE 
15:20 - BRACKETS OF THE HTML TAGS THAT 
YOU DON'T ACTUALLY WANT.
15:24 - SO I THINK I HAVE THE CODE THAT 
I USED TO CLEAN IT ON GITHUB, 
15:31 - AND IF NOT, THERE ARE OTHER 
RESOURCES YOU CAN USE TO LEARN 
15:34 - ABOUT DATA CLEANING.  THIS IS 
ABOUT TRAINING MACHINE LEARNING 
15:39 - MODELS USING SPELL AND USING 
THEM IN THE BROWSER.  LET'S GO 
15:42 - BACK TO THAT.  AND PROJECT 
GUTENBERG, THAT'S A RESOURCE 
15:47 - WITH A LOT OF FREE TEXT IN THE 
PUBLIC DOMAIN THAT YOU CAN JUST 
15:51 - USE.  AND WEB SCRAPING WITH 
NODE.JS IS ANOTHER RESOURCE FOR 
15:55 - DOING THIS KIND OF THING.  AND 
ALTHOUGH MY SCRAPE.PY FILE IN 
16:01 - THE DOOM REPOSITORY DOESN'T SHOW
THIS, THE ORIGINAL VERSION, I 
16:04 - JUST KIND OF KEPT EACH FILE -- I
KEPT EACH SONG IN ITS OWN FILE 
16:12 - OF LYRICS.  BUT THE MACHINE, 
WHAT I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU NEXT,
16:17 - WORKS WITH AN INPUT THAT'S ONE 
BIG INPUT FILE, INPUT.TXT AND I 
16:26 - DID BORING SHELL SCRIPT STUFF 
THAT CONCATENATES THE FILE 
16:29 - TOGETHER.  AND THAT'S ALL I 
WANTED TO SAY ABOUT GETTING 
16:32 - DATA.  SO LET'S GET INTO THE 
MAIN THING.  SO I DID THIS PART,
16:37 - I CREATED A NEW DIRECTORY FOR 
ALL OF THIS STUFF TO
16:49 - LIVE IN.
SO IT IS A GOOD HABIT TO USE 
16:53 - VIRTUAL N, AT LEAST WITH PYTHON 
DO, I UNDERSTAND THAT THINGS 
16:57 - HAVE MOVED ON A BIT WITH PYTHON 
THREE, BUT I'M ON THE PYTHON 
17:00 - TWO.  SO I'M GOING TO USE
17:05 - THIS VIRTWOMAN UAL N THING TO 
KEEP MY DEPENDENCIES ISOLATED.  
17:12 - AND I HAVE SOME OTHER VIRTUAL 
ENDS ACTIVE, I SEE IT FROM MY 
17:17 - COMMAND PROMPT OVER HERE.  I RAN
THE COMMAND, DEACTIVATE, TO GET 
17:20 - RID OF THAT.  I WILL CLEAR THE 
SCREEN, TO MAKE IT LESS NOISY 
17:25 - HERE.  AND AND THEN I WILL 
CREATE A NEW VIRTUAL N, SPELL 
17:31 - VIDEO 
17:36 - VIRTUAL N.
SO IT IS SETTING UP A NEW 
17:39 - VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT WHICH LIVES 
INSIDE
17:46 - OF THIS FOLDER HERE.  AND THE 
WAY YOU USE PYTHON VIRTUAL END 
17:51 - TO GET IT ACTIVE, SPELL,
18:00 - VIDEO VIRTUALENV, SOURCE, AND 
THEN THE PATH TO
18:06 - ACTIVATE SCRIPT.
AND NOW YOU CAN SEE MY PROMPT 
18:11 - CHANGED BECAUSE I HAD MY 
TERMINAL PREFERENCES SET UP THAT
18:14 - WAY, I CAN REMEMBER WHICH 
VIRTUALENV I'M IN.
18:17 - OKAY, SO I DID THAT.  I GOT THE 
INPUT FILE, WHICH I SHOULD PUSH 
18:26 - IT UP.  I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY 
PUSHED UP TO THE GITHUB, LIKE 
18:29 - THE ONE FILE VERSION, BUT LIFE 
IS MESSY.
18:36 - SO I WILL GET THE PROPER VERSION
FROM GITHUB IS THIS REPOSITORY 
18:41 - CALLED TRAINING LSTM.  SO I'M 
GOING TO CLONE THAT.  AND WE 
18:45 - WILL GO AND TAKE A LOOK AT THAT 
REPOSITORY AND ITS READ 
18:57 - ME. .
  I WILL CLONE, COPY, AND PASTE 
19:01 - IT IN.
SO YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS -- FROM
19:04 - THE DESCRIPTION OF THIS 
REPOSITORY, TRAINING IN LSTM 
19:10 - NETWORK AND USING THE NETWORK 
ML5.JS IS HIGHLY RELEVANT TO 
19:16 - WHAT WE ARE DOING IN THIS VIDEO.
SO THIS REPOSITORY'S READ ME ARE
19:21 - BASED ON WHAT YOU WOULD WANT TO 
DO IF YOU WERE TRAINING THE 
19:28 - MACHINE LEARNING MODEL LOCALLY 
ON YOUR OWN COMPUTER.
19:30 - AND SO IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT 
TO DO, YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND 
19:33 - FOLLOW THIS.  SINCE THIS VIDEO 
IS ABOUT HOW TO USE SPELL, 
19:39 - THAT'S WHAT CAN ARE I WILL DO.  
I WILL NOT FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS
19:44 - EXACTLY, BUT CERTAIN PARTS OF 
IT.  SO I CLONED THIS 
19:47 - REPOSITORY, THAT'S THE LAST 
COMMAND THAT WHERE RAN.   I RAN.
19:51 - I WILL ENTER INTO THAT 
REPOSITORY.  AND THEN WHAT I 
19:55 - WANT TO DO IS CREATE A DIRECTORY
INSIDE OF HERE CALLED DATA.  AND
20:00 - THENP I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND 
MOVE AHEAD THAT INPUT.TXT FILE 
20:07 - INTO THAT DATA DIRECTORY.
OR A COPY OF IT, RATHER.  I 
20:12 - COULD DELETE AND GET A 
DIRECTORY, BUT WHATEVER.
20:15 - OKAY, GREAT.
SO THIS IS THE SET-UP.
20:19 - WE HAVE A REPOSITORY, WE HAVE 
THIS REPOSITORY LOCALLY THAT IS 
20:25 - GOING TO HELP US TRAIN THE LSTM 
NETWORK USING TENSORFLOW.  AFTER
20:30 - WE TRAINED THE MODEL, WE CAN USE
IT IN ML5.JS.  SO WE'RE DONE 
20:34 - WITH THE SET UP, SO LET'S GET 
INTO TRAINING THE MODEL.
20:37 - SO AGAIN, THIS IS THE LINK THAT 
YOU CAN USE TO SIGN UP FOR SPELL
20:42 - IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY.  IT SO 
HAPPENS THAT I HAVE ALREADY.
20:46 - SO I SHOULD BE LOGGED IN HERE, I
WILL MAKE SURE I DON'T HAVE TO 
20:49 - LOG OUT, I HAVEN'T.
SO I AM IN HERE IN SPELL.RUN AND
20:54 - IT GIVES ME INFORMATION ABOUT 
HOW TO INSTALL SPELL, HOW TO LOG
20:58 - IN WITH SPELL, THERE'S A 
QUICKSTART GUIDE AND THE 
21:01 - RESOURCES THAT I USED IN 
PREPARING FOR THIS VIDEO.
21:05 - SO LIKE I MENTIONED, THE OTHER 
TRAINING LSTM REPOSITORY SHOWS 
21:09 - YOU HOW TO RUN LOCALLY.  FOR US,
ALL WE NEED TO INSTALL IS SPELL.
21:15 - SO I WILL GO AHEAD AND DO THAT. 
I WILL PIP INSTALL SPELL AND IT 
21:24 - WILL FETCH SPELL AND WHATEVER 
THINGS THAT SPELL DEPENDS ON 
21:29 - FROM THE PYTHON PACKAGE, PYPY, 
OR WHATEVER IT IS CALLED.  IT 
21:32 - WILL GO AHEAD AND GET THAT.
AND THEN ONCE IT IS DONE 
21:38 - INSTALLING, I WILL BE ABLE TO 
21:46 - LOG IN, I WILL USE MY USER NAME 
AND PASSWORD IF I CAN REMEMBER 
21:57 - IT.
I CAN REMEMBER IT.  YOU CAN SEE 
22:00 - THE READ ME, THAT IS ME, I'M 
LOGGED IN AS MYSELF.
22:03 - AND IF YOU EVER FORGET THAT YOU 
ARE LOGGED IN, FOR SOME REASON, 
22:08 - THIS SPELL COMMAND HAS A LOT OF 
SUB COMMANDS.  SPELL WHO AM I 
22:11 - WILL TELL YOU WHO YOU ARE.  BUT 
I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND GET 
22:15 - STARTED WITH TRAINING THIS 
MODEL.  AND THE FIRST THING THAT
22:17 - WE NEED TO DO IS TO UPLOAD THE 
FILE TO SPELL.
22:23 - OKAY?
SO WHAT I WANT TO RUN IS THIS 
22:26 - COMMAND HERE, SPELL UPLOAD THE 
PATH OF THE LOCAL COMPUTER ON TO
22:33 - THE FILE.  AND THEN I WANT TO 
GIVE IT A NAME OF WHERE I'M 
22:35 - GOING TO UPLOAD IT TO.
SO SPELL UPLOAD MY 
22:47 - DATA/INPUT.TXT TO THIS DEST
22:53 - DESTINATION.  IT WILL WANT IT 
MOMENTARILY.  SO I WILL TELL 
22:57 - SPELL TO UPLOAD THE FILE I 
WANTED TO UPLOAD.  AND THEN IT 
23:01 - TELLS ME THAT THE FILE, THIS IS 
THE PATH TO IT ON MY LOCAL THAT 
23:06 - I'M TYPING ON RIGHT NOW, IS 
ACCESSIBLE AT 
23:12 - UPLOAD/NAME/INPUT.TXT.  AND 
THAT'S THE NAME THAT I WANT TO 
23:15 - PUT IN.  SO I'M GOING TO DELETE 
THE PART I DON'T WANT AND PUT 
23:18 - IN, WHAT WAS 
23:22 - IT, NABIL SPELL LIVESTREAM DOOM.
OKAY?
23:29 - I WILL UPLOAD AT 307K, THAT IS 
CLOSE TO WHAT WE SAW WHEN WE RAN
23:34 - THE DU COMMAND EARLIER.
AND THE UPLOAD IS COMPLETED.
23:39 - SO THAT'S GREAT.
AND SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO 
23:42 - NOW, AND THIS IS KIND OF THE 
MOST -- PROBABLY THE MOST
23:50 - COMPLICATED COMMAND WE ARE GOING
TO RUN, BUT THE ONLY ONE.  AND 
23:53 - THIS IS WHAT IT IS SAYING TO 
ACTUALLY GO AHEAD AND RUN THE 
23:56 - PYTHON SCRIPT THAT WE DOWNLOADED
FROM TRAIN, THAT TRAINING LSTM 
24:01 - GIT REPOSITORY.
OKAY?
24:02 - WE'RE GOING TO RUN THAT, THIS 
TRAINING PY SCRIPT, WITH THE 
24:10 - DATA SETDATA SET DEAREST TO WHAT
I CALLED DATA, THAT'S THE NAME 
24:13 - OF THE FOLDER WHERE I PUT THE 
INPUT.TXT.  AND I'M GOING TO RUN
24:18 - IT, AND I'M GOING TO MOUNT THE 
DATA -- I WILL MOUNT THE FOLDER 
24:25 - THAT I CREATED BY UPLOADING THAT
FILE.
24:28 - THAT IS AS THE NAME DATA SO IT 
CAN UNDERSTAND THIS DATA 
24:31 - DIRECTORY.
SO I SHOULD GET, I THINK, ONE 
24:35 - ERROR WHEN I DO THIS AND I WILL 
TALK ABOUT WHY.
24:40 - SO SPELL RUN, MOUNT, UPLOAD, 
NABIL, I CALLED IT
24:53 - LIVE STREAM. 
 -- THIS IS FROM WHEN I 
24:55 - PRACTICED.  I WILL GO AHEAD AND
25:01 - FIX THAT.
IT TELLS ME THAT THERE ARE 
25:05 - UNTRACKED FILES ON THIS 
REPOSITORY AND THEY ARE NOT 
25:07 - AVAILABLE ON THIS RUN.  THAT'S 
THE FILE THAT I CARE ABOUT.
25:10 - SO SPELL ENCOURAGES US TO USE 
THE GIT VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM 
25:15 - TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DATA THAT 
WE'RE TRAINING ON IS CHECKED IN 
25:17 - AND THAT IS VERY GOOD FOR 
25:24 - REPRODUCEANT ABILITY IF WE WANT 
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS THERE.
25:27 - SO I WILL DO AND TALL LOW FOLLOW
THE SUGGESTED 
25:35 - WORKFLOW.  SO I WILL GIT, ADD 
DOT, OR WHATEVER IN THIS 
25:39 - PARTICULAR CASE.  AND I WILL SAY
ADD DATA.INPUT.TXT OF DOOM 
25:47 - LYRICS.
  AND NOW, HAVING DONE THAT, IF 
25:50 - I RUN THE SAME COMMAND, IT WILL 
NOT GIVE ME THE SAME WARNING 
25:53 - SINCE THE FILES ARE TRACKED 
INSTEAD OF BEING 
26:01 - UNTRACKED.
YEAH, SO LET ME GO AHEAD AND 
26:03 - SEARCH THROUGH THIS, AND I WILL 
MENTION THE OTHER THING I SAID I
26:07 - WAS GOING TO MENTION.  I WILL 
PRESS UP A FEW TIMES AND RUN THE
26:10 - SAME COMMAND AGAIN.  SO RUN, I'M
MOUNTING THE DATA FOLDER I 
26:17 - UPLOADED TO BE CALLED DATA.
AND I PUT IT IN THE
26:24 - WRONG FOLDER.
DANIEL SHIFFMAN: IF YOU ARE 
26:28 - GOING TO MOUNT THE DATA FOLDERDO
, DO YOU HAVE TO COMMIT IT? SO 
26:32 - IF YOU DON'T WANT TO UPLOAD IT 
WITH GIT, THEN YOU CAN DO --.
26:37 -   NABIL HASSEIN: OH, RIGHT.
SO THERE IS MORE THAN ONE WAY TO
26:41 - WORK WITH SPELL, AND I CONFLATED
THE TWO OF THEM A LITTLE BIT.
26:44 - SO, YEAH, I DIDN'T ACTUALLY DO 
THE GIT COMMIT BECAUSE OF THE 
26:48 - WAY THAT I'M DOING -- THAT I'M 
DOING THIS, BECAUSE I UPLOADED 
26:52 - IT BEFORE.  AND THEN I WILL ALSO
GET THE SAME REPRODUCIBILITY 
26:57 - BENEFITS, BECAUSE SPELL WILL 
KEEP A RECORD OF WHAT WE 
27:00 - UPLOADED, BUT IT DOES NOT HURT 
TO GIT COMMIT IT EITHER.  SO I 
27:04 - WILL FIX THAT TYPO.
DANIEL SHIFFMAN: IN THIS CASE IT
27:10 - IS A SMALL FILE, IT DOESN'T 
MATTER, BUT IF IT IS HUGE, YOU 
27:13 - WANT TO UPLOAD THE SEPARATELY 
WITHOUT HAVING TO COMMIT IT.
27:17 - NABIL HASSEIN: YES, GIT IS NOT 
THE BEST FOR COMMITTING LARGE 
27:21 - FILES, SO THERE ARE TOOLS LIKE 
SPELL AND GIT, THERE'S A BUNCH 
27:25 - OF TOOLS.  SO COOL.
SO LET ME GO AHEAD AND FIX THAT 
27:29 - TYPO AND IN MY NOTES AS WELL.  
IT TELLS ME EVERYTHING IS UP TO 
27:32 - DATE, BECAUSE I DID MAKE A 
COMMIT, AND LIKE I MENTIONED, I 
27:36 - DOESN'T HAVE TO.  IT IS TELLING 
ME IT IS CASTING SPELL IN 16, I 
27:41 - HAVE USED IT ABOUT 15 TIMES
27:46 - BEFORE.  I CAN REQUEST AND IT IS
RUNNING, AND IT IS STARTING TO 
27:52 - TRAIN THE MACHINE LEARNING MODEL
AND GIVING ME SOME DATA ABOUT 
27:55 - HOW THAT TRAINING IS GOING IN 
THESE, YOU KNOW, IN THESE
28:04 - DIFFERENT POINTS.
DANIEL SHIFFMAN: 30 MINUTES HAS 
28:10 - PASSED.
  NABIL HASSEIN: AND I'M BACK.  
28:12 - AND THIS IS STILL RUNNING, AND 
LIKE IT TOLD ME BEFORE, I CAN 
28:15 - JUST GET OUT OF THE LOGS IN MY 
LOCAL TERMINAL, CONTROL CC.  
28:21 - THIS IS RUNNING ON A REMOTE 
MACHINE THAT IS PROVISIONED FOR 
28:25 - ME.  I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT IT.  
SO I'M NOT STOPPING THE RUN FROM
28:28 - HAVING MY CONTROL C, JUST FROM 
THE LOGS FROM APPEARINGING IN MY
28:33 - OWN TERMINAL.  IF I WANT TO 
CHECK OUT THE LOGS, I CAN SAY 
28:37 - SPELL LOGS 16, AND THEY WILL 
START APPEARING AGAIN.
28:41 - AND THERE ARE SOME OTHER 
COMMANDS IT TOLD ME ABOUT.  I 
28:44 - CAN KILL IT WITH SPELL KILL, I 
WILL NOT, BECAUSE I WANT IT TO 
28:48 - KEEP RUNNING.  AND BESIDES 
CHECKING OUT THE LOGS LOCALLY 
28:51 - WITH SPELL LOGS, THE NUMBER OF 
THE RUN, YOU CAN ALSO COME OVER 
28:56 - HERE TO THIS SPELL -- IN THIS 
SPELL WEB UI AND CHECK OUT 
28:59 - DIFFERENT INFORMATION ABOUT THE 
RUN IN HERE.  BUT UNTHUS VIDEO I
29:06 - HAVE A PREFERENCE FOR THE 
COMMAND LINE.  I WILL DO IT THAT
29:10 - WAY.
SO COOL, LET'S SEE.  AND ONE 
29:12 - THING I WANTED TO MENTION IS THE
PERIMETERS IS CALLED 
29:15 - HYPERPERIMETERS OF THE NETWORK. 
SO LET'S GO BACK TO THE GIT READ
29:22 - ME.
SO THIS GIVES YOU INFORMATION 
29:25 - ABOUT HOW YOU WOULD RUN IT 
LOCALLY, AND YOU CAN PASS 
29:29 - ADDITIONAL FLAGS TO CONTROL MORE
OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE 
29:34 - NETWORK: ITS SIZE, HOW MANY 
LAYERS THEY ARE, THE LENGTH OF 
29:38 - THE SEQUENCE, AND VARIOUS OTHER 
THINGS THAT YOU CAN READ MORE 
29:41 - ABOUT IN THIS REPOSITORY.  THEY 
HAVE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS FOR 
29:48 - WHAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO SELECT 
FOR YOUR HYPERPERIMETERS, 
29:51 - ACCORDING TO THE SIZE OF YOUR 
TRAINING DATASET.  BECAUSE MY 
29:57 - TRAINING DATA SET IS SO SMALL, I
DECIDED TO 
30:04 - DEFAULT.
THOSE ARE THE OLD NOTES, I DID 
30:07 - THAT PART.
OH, YEAH.
30:08 - AND THE NEXT THING THAT I WANTED
TO TALK ABOUT IS THE
30:16 - DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RUNNING ON 
CPU VERSUS GPU.
30:22 - AND I'M A FAN OF REVIEWING 
MATERIAL.  CPU IS THE CENTRAL 
30:28 - PROCESSING UNIT OF YOUR COM  
COMPUTER WITH A LITTLE BIT OF 
30:33 - PARALLELISM, BUT FOR THE MOST 
PART IS BEST AT RUNNING THINGS 
30:38 - SEQUENTIALLY REALLY FAST.  AND 
THE MODEL OF COMPUTATION IS 
30:42 - DIFFERENT FROM A GPU, AT SOME 
POINT IT STOOD FOR GRAPHICS 
30:46 - PROCESSING UNIT, AND MAYBE IT 
STILL DOES, BUT THAT ACRONYM IS 
30:52 - RETIRED BY NOW BECAUSE GPU HAS 
APPLICATIONS OTHER THAN 
30:56 - GRAPHICS, INCLUDING TRAINING 
NEURAL NETWORKS ON TEXT.  GPUS 
31:00 - HISTORICALLY, THEY GOT THAT NAME
BECAUSE, EACH
31:08 - PIXEL ON A SCREEN IS INDEPENDENT
OF EACH OTHER ONE AND CAN BE 
31:11 - COMPUTED INDEPENDENTLY.  AND A 
GPU IS MUCH MORE HIGHLY PARALLEL
31:15 - COMPARED TO A CPU.  IT IS NOT 
GOING TO BE AS FAST AS 
31:19 - COMPLETING ONE SINGLE TASK, BUT 
IT -- IT IS VERY GOOD FOR 
31:25 - DISPLAYING THINGS ON SCREENS AND
ALSO VERY GOOD FOR TRAINING 
31:29 - NEURAL NETWORKS.
SO IN THE LAST COMMAND THAT I 
31:33 - RAN OVER HERE ON THE COMMAND 
LINE TO TRAIN THE NEURAL 
31:37 - NETWORK, THIS IS RUNNING VIA A 
CPU.
31:43 - AND WHAT I CAN DO, IF I WANT 
SPELL TO RUN MY CODE ON A GPU, I
31:47 - WILL TELL IT THE BEST TYPE OF 
MACHINE I WANT BY ADDING THIS 
31:53 - DASH DASH MACHINE TYPE FLAG.  
AND THEN THE MACHINE TYPE I WILL
32:00 - USE IS K80.  WHERE DOES IT COME 
FROM?
32:03 - IF YOU CHECK OUT 
SPELL.RUN/PRICING, YOU WILL SEE
32:13 - INFORMATION ABOUT HOW MUCH SPELL
CHARGES FOR YOUR MACHINE TYPES, 
32:19 - WHETHER THIS CPU OR THAT GPU IS 
BEST FOR THE PARTICULAR TASK.  
32:23 - THERE'S CPU, CPU BIG, KED -- 
THAT IS ONE OF THE LESS 
32:30 - EXPENSIVE GPU UNITS.  AND THAT'S
WHAT I'M GOING TO
32:40 - USE.
EVERYTHING IS UP TO DATE, WE SEE
32:43 - A VERY SIMILAR BIT OF OUTPUT AS 
WE DID BEFORE AS IT IS READY TO 
32:49 - START TRAINING THE
32:53 - MODEL.
IN A MOMENT WE SHOULD START 
32:55 - SEEING THE LOGS, I'M SURE IT 
READS THE TEXT 
33:04 - FILE.
I WILL LOOK AT THE NOTES WHILE I
33:06 - WAIT
33:10 - FOR THAT.
SO THAT'S COOL, ALL RIGHT.
33:14 - SO THIS RUN IS RUNNING, AND I 
DON'T KNOW HOW OBVIOUS THIS IS 
33:21 - IF YOU ARE FOLLOWING ALONG.  
THIS IS HAPPENING A LOT FASTER, 
33:24 - THIS MODEL IS BEING TRAINED A 
LOT FASTER BY A GPU THAN THE CPU
33:28 - ONE WAS.
AND SO THE CPU ONE GOT A HEAD 
33:31 - START, BUT I STILL EXPECTED THE 
GPU ONE WILL FINISH 
33:36 - SUBSTANTIALLY FASTER.  WE ARE AT
113 OUT OF 6,000 ITERATIONS THAT
33:41 - IT IS GOING THROUGH IN SHARING 
THE MODEL.  IF WE CHECK IN ON 
33:46 - THE PREVIOUS ONE, I WILL SEE HOW
FAR IT IS.
33:50 - THE HEAD START I HAD WAS PRETTY 
BIG.  BUT YOU CAN SEE THE GPU 
33:54 - ONE IS MOVING FASTER.
AND LIKE IF WE ACTUALLY GO IN, 
33:58 - BECAUSE LIKE IT  I MENTIONED 
BEFORE, I HAD A FEW PRACTICE 
34:04 - RUNS HERE BEFORE.  WE CAN LOOK 
AT A FEW ONES THAT I DID BEFORE.
34:11 - AND USING A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT 
MODEL, WE CAN SEE HERE.
34:15 - BUT THIS ONE, ON CPU, TOOK CLOSE
TO FIVE YEARS AND ON GPU IT TOOK
34:21 - ONLY MORE THAN 15 MINUTES.
AND, YEAH.
34:27 - SO GPU IS FASTER FOR THIS 
PARTICULAR USE CASE.
34:33 - SO JUST FOR THE
34:40 - SAKE OF TIME, I WILL GRAB A 
MODEL THAT I TRAIN ED BEFORE.
34:48 -   SO WHAT I WANT TO DO TO GRAB 
THE DATA FROM SPELL IS TO RUN 
34:53 - THIS COMMAND HERE.
THIS IS SPELL CP RUNS/THE NUMBER
34:58 - OF THE RUN/MODELS.  THAT'S HOW I
WILL FETCH THAT DATA.
35:05 - SO I'M JUST GOING TO SEE IT UP 
HERE AND NOW I'M IN MY HOME 
35:10 - FOLDER OF ALL THE DIFFERENT 
THINGS THAT I'M GRABBING FROM 
35:13 - HERE, GRABBING FROM THERE, TO 
PUT TOGETHER INTO THIS DEMO.  I 
35:17 - WILL GO AHEAD AND RUN SPELL CP, 
AND I WILL LOOK HERE AGAIN.
35:25 - SO YOU CAN SEE THAT IS USING THE
SAME TRAINING, LSTM, THAT I WAS 
35:29 - TALKING ABOUT.  IT COMPLETED IN 
5 MINUTES, THIS SHOULD COMPLETE 
35:32 - PRETTY QUICKLY, TOO.  AND THAT 
WAS THE NEXT RUN THAT I DID JUST
35:37 - A FEW MINUTES BEFORE THE LIVE 
STREAM STARTED.  SO SPELL CP 
35:45 - RUNS/15/MODELS.
AND IT IS COPYING 10 FILES THAT 
35:48 - ARE FROM
35:53 - THERE.
SO THIS IS LS DATA, IT REMEMBERS
35:55 - THE SAME DATA DIRECTORY THAT I 
PASSED IN BEFORE AS THE NAME.
36:00 - AND THESE 10 FILES CONSTITUTE 
THE MODEL.
36:04 - OKAY?
AND I'M NOT GOING TO GO INTO 
36:06 - DEPTH ABOUT WHAT ARE THESE 
FILES, WHAT IS IN THEM.
36:08 - BUT IF I FOLLOW ALONG, YOU CAN 
BUILD INTO THEM AND CHECK IT 
36:13 - OUT.
COOL.
36:15 - SO WE FRAMED THE MODEL.  WE HAVE
USED SPELL TO TRAIN AN LSTM 
36:22 - MODEL ON A CORPUS OF DATA THAT 
WE OBTAINED, AND NOW THAT WE 
36:25 - HAVE THE MODEL, LET'S USE IT FOR
SOMETHING.
36:29 - SO I'M GOING TO BORROW AND THEN 
MODIFY AN EXAMPLE FROM THIS 
36:36 - REPOSITORY HERE, ON THE ML5.JS 
GITHUB ACCOUNT, THEY HAVE A 
36:41 - REPOSITORY CALLED ML5
36:47 - EXAMPLES.
SO THERE'S A COLLECTION OF 
36:49 - EXAMPLES, THERE'S A BUNCH OF 
THEM, YOU CAN FIND ABOUT HOW TO 
36:52 - ORGANIZE AND SOME OTHER STUFF 
FROM THEIR READ ME.
36:54 - AND I WILL USE ONE IN THE P5.JS 
FOLDER, WE ARE WORRIED ABOUT 
37:02 - LSTMS, AND THIS INTERACTIVE ONE 
IS INTERESTING.  THERE'S MORE, I
37:08 - MEAN, IT IS -- I'M NOT GOING TO 
DESCRIBE IT.  WE WILL USE THE 
37:12 - NON-INTERACTIVE VERSION, THE 
LSTM TEXT.  AND WE HAVE HERE 
37:15 - JUST A FEW FILES, SO THEY 
ACTUALLY HAVE A PRE-TRAINED 
37:18 - MODEL THAT I'M GOING TO IGNORE 
AND NOT USE BECAUSE WE'RE GOING 
37:20 - TO USE OUR MODEL THAT WE JUST 
TRAINED.  AND WHAT I'M GOING TO 
37:24 - DO IS JUST FETCH THESE TWO 
FILES, THIS HTML FILE AND 
37:27 - SKETCH.JS FILE AND BECAUSE THIS 
REPOSITORY IS BIG AND I JUST 
37:30 - DON'T WANT TO WAIT TO CLONE IT, 
I'M GOING TO FETCH THESE TWO 
37:34 - FILES AND NOTHING
37:38 - ELSE.
SO WHAT I'M GOING X2  TO DO IS 
37:42 - JUST CREATE A DIRECTORY, AND 
WHAT NOT.  AND THIS IS ML5 LSTM 
37:49 - EXAMPLE, AND I WILL CHANGE THE 
CURRENT DIRECTORY TO BE IN 
37:54 - THERE.  I WILL CLEAR THE SCREEN 
FOR CLARITY'S SAKE.  I WILL USE 
37:59 - THE COMMAND LINE PROGRAM, W GET,
WHICH WILL FETCH THE RAW FILE, 
38:04 - AS A QUICK RAW IN GITHUB, AND 
WILL FETCH IT INTO MY -- ON TO 
38:09 - MY LOCAL MACHINE.
I WILL DO THAT.  AND THEN I GO 
38:13 - BACK AND I DO THE SAME THING 
WITH SKETCH.JS.  I WILL FIND THE
38:17 - ONE RAW FILE, COPY THE URL, AND 
I WILL USE THE PROGRAM W GET TO 
38:23 - DOWNLOAD IT LOCALLY.
SO NOW IF I LIST WHAT IS HERE, I
38:26 - WILL HAVE THESE TWO FILES, 
INDEX.HTML AND SKETCH.JS AND WE 
38:32 - WILL TAKE A MOMENT TO CHECK OUT 
-- WE WILL READ THE FILES 
38:35 - THEMSELVES AND USE THEM.  SO 
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS RUN A 
38:39 - PROGRAM, HTTP SERVER, WHICH YOU 
CAN INSTALL IF YOU WANT.  IF YOU
38:44 - DON'T HAVE IT, YOU CAN RUN IT 
WITH NPM INSTALL, AND IF YOU ARE
38:49 - USED TO USING A DIFFERENT WEB 
SERVER, ANYTHING THAT WILL SERVE
38:52 - UP AN INDEX.HTML IN YOUR LOCAL 
FOLDER IS FINE.  SO IT TELLS ME 
38:58 - WHERE, THE URL THAT I CAN GO TO 
ON LOCAL HOST TO CHECK IT OUT.  
39:03 - SO I'M GOING TO GO THERE.
AND SO LSTM TEXT GENERATION 
39:09 - EXAMPLE, THIS IS A CORPUS ON 
VIRGINIA WOLF, I'M NOT GOING TO 
39:12 - DO THAT, SO I WILL CHANGE THAT. 
SO I WILL GO INTO THIS FILE AND 
39:16 - ALSO LOOK AT THE
39:19 - JAVASCRIPT FILE.
SO I WILL OPEN UP THE REPO, 
39:26 - SPELL LIVE
39:30 - STREAM.
THESE ARE THE TWO FILES THAT I 
39:32 - DOWNLOADED A MOMENT AGO, 
INDEX.HTML AND SKETCH.JS.  I 
39:38 - WILL OPEN IT UP IN A WAY THAT IS
MORE READABLE FOR
39:48 - YOU.
SO I WILL DO IT OVER HERE, THEN.
39:50 - THE FOLDERS DO NOT REALLY BOTHER
THE VIDEO AS MUCH AS THIS ONE 
39:55 - DOES.
OKAY, SO WE HAVE HERE AN HTML 
39:58 - DOCUMENT WHICH RELIES ON P5 AND 
ML5 AS THE LIBRARIES THAT ARE 
40:04 - BEING USED.
AND PRETTY MUCH NOTHING ELSE.
40:10 - SO THIS EXAMPLE USES A 
PRE-TRAINED MODEL ON A CORPUS OF
40:15 - MF DOOM.  I WILL MAKE IT
40:20 - NICE MEANING OF LIFE IS -- THIS 
IS SOMETHING THAT I DON'T 
40:23 - REMEMBER DOOM SAYING, WE CAN 
REMEMBER IT AS THE SEED TEXT FOR
40:26 - NOW.  IT IS INPUT.HTML, I CAN 
CHANGE IT.  WE HAVE A FEW 
40:31 - SLIDERS OF HOW LONG THE OUTPUT 
WILL BE AND THE TEMPERATURE, 
40:34 - WHICH I WILL TALK ABOUT LATER. 
AND WHAT IS INTERESTING IS THE 
40:37 - SKETCH.JS FILE, WE WILL TAKE A
40:47 - LOOK THERE.
OKAY, SO WE DECLARE A FEW
40:56 - VARIABLES HERE.  THIS VIDEO IS 
NOT ABOUT P5, BUT IT IS A COOL 
40:59 - LIBRARY, I ENCOURAGE YOU TO 
CHECK IT OUT IF YOU ARE NOT 
41:03 - FAMILIAR WITH IT ALREADY.  IT IS
GOOD FOR ARTISTIC CODING AND 
41:05 - OTHER PROJECTS AS WELL.
SO THERE ARE TWO
41:14 - MAIN FUNCTIONS IN -- I'M NOT 
GOING TO GET INTO P5.
41:18 - SO WE'RE GOING TO START WITH THE
SET-UP FUNCTION, AND P5 WILL RUN
41:23 - THIS SET-UP FUNCTION FOR US IN 
THE BEGINNING.  AND IT SAYS 
41:26 - CREATE THE LSTM GENERATOR, 
PASSING THE MODEL DIRECTORY.  SO
41:31 - I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING CALLED 
MODEL/WOLF BECAUSE I DID NOT 
41:35 - CLONE THE WHOLE REPOSITORY.  I 
NEED TO MOCK  MAKE SURE THAT 
41:39 - THIS, WHEN IT IS GENERATING, 
LIKE WHEN IT IS CREATING THE 
41:43 - LSTM THAT WE'RE GOING TO USE, I 
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS 
41:46 - POINTING TOWARDS THE PROPER PATH
WHERE WE HAVE OUR FILES.  SO LET
41:49 - ME GO AHEAD AND REMIND MYSELF ON
THE COMMAND LINE OF WHERE I'M 
41:56 - KEEPING EVERYTHING.
I WILL START THE SERVER AGAIN IN
41:59 - A MINUTE.
SO THIS APPEARS Y HAVE DATA UP 
42:05 - THERE, WHICH IS WHAT I WANTED.
AND SO I WILL COPY THAT FOLDER 
42:12 - INTO HERE WHERE I AM.
I WILL SAY WHAT IS IT, LOWER 
42:18 - CASE R, CAPITAL, FOR RECURSIVE 
COPY.
42:23 - AND THIS IS HERE, BESIDES THE 
TWO FILES THAT I FETCH FROM 
42:27 - GITHUB USING W GET, I ALSO HAVE 
ALL OF THE DATA FILES RIGHT 
42:31 - HERE.
AND SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS 
42:40 - CHANGE THIS TO SAY DATA, THAT'S 
WHERE MY DATA IS.
42:44 - AND THEN HERE, THERE IS OTHER 
CODE, THIS IS ABOUT THE USER 
42:48 - INTERACTION OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
SLIDERS AND GET MOVED AROUND AND
42:51 - BUTTONS ARE CLICKED, SO I'M NOT 
GOING TO GO OVER THAT.
42:56 - AND WHAT WE WILL JUST FAKE -- 
TAKE A MINUTE TO LOOK AT IS THIS
43:02 - GENERATE FUNCTION.  AND AGAIN, 
WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO ALL THE 
43:05 - WAY THROUGH, BUT IT LETS YOU 
KNOW IT IS GENERATING STUFF, 
43:08 - JUST SO THAT THE USER KNOWS 
SOMETHING IS HAPPENING, IT GRABS
43:13 - THE INPUT FROM THE SEED TEXT, 
AND IT USES THESE PERIMETERS: 
43:22 - TEMPERATURE AND LENGTH.  THE 
ML5.JS LIBRARY DOES THE HEAVY 
43:28 - LIFTING FOR US.  WE CALL THE 
43:33 - LSTM GENERATE FUNCTION WITH OUR 
DATA AND PATCH UP THE CALL-BACK 
43:36 - FUNCTION WHICH WE WILL UPDATE 
THE DOM AND THE HTML PAGE WHEN 
43:41 - THAT FUNCTION IS DONE RUNNING, 
OR DONE GENERATING THE TEXT THAT
43:43 - THE MODEL HAS PREDICTED BASED ON
THE INPUT SEED.
43:47 - OKAY?
SO YOU CAN SEE THIS IS A PRETTY 
43:49 - SHORT FILE, AND THEN WE WILL GO 
THROUGH EVERY DETAIL, BUT IT IS 
43:55 - ON GITHUB, YOU CAN CHECK IT OUT.
I MADE ONE SMALL CHANGE TO IT.
43:58 - SO I WILL GO BACK TO MY NOTES, I
AM PRETTY SURE I KNOW WHAT I 
44:04 - WANT TO DO NEXT BUT IT IS GOOD
44:14 - TO BE SURE.
I WILL RUN THE SERVER AGAIN, IT 
44:19 - IS UPDATED WITH THIS.  THE MODEL
IS
44:27 - LOADED.
CLICK GENERATE, AND I DON'T KNOW
44:30 - HOW MANY PEOPLE LISTEN TO DOOM, 
BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HE 
44:38 - MIGHTSY.  WE CAN  ADJUST THE 
LENGTH TO MAKE IT LONGER OR 
44:45 - SHORTER, AND THEN WE CAN USE 
THIS TEMPERATURE THING, LIKE THE
44:49 - TEMPERATURE IS SOMETHING LIKE 
INTUITIVELY, IT IS THE 
44:52 - RANDOMNESS OF THE TEXT.  THE 
HIGHER THE TEMPERATURE, THE LESS
44:56 - RANDOM IT WILL BE, THE MORE 
DERIVATIVE IT WILL BE OF THE 
45:01 - ORIGINAL TEXT.  AND IF YOU TURN 
IT UP VERY HIGH, IT IS LIKELY 
45:06 - THAT YOU GET DIRECT QUOTES FROM 
THE ORIGINAL CORPUS U. IF IT IS 
45:11 - LOWER, THEN MAYBE IT IS A LITTLE
BIT MORE CHAOTIC, SO TO SPEAK.
45:17 - AND THAT CAN GENERATE THINGS 
THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE OUT 
45:23 - THERE OR ORIGINAL.  IF YOU START
TO DO IT TOO LOW, YOU GET 
45:30 - NONSENSE.  THEY WILL NOT MAKE 
MUCH SENSE
45:40 - AT ALL.
I WILL HOLD MY OPINION ON THE 
45:46 - GENERATIVE LYRICS FOR NOW.  
THAT'S REALLY THE MAIN THING.  
45:52 - IF I WAS GOING TO GO AHEAD AND 
REPRODUCE MY ORIGINAL PROJECT, 
45:56 - WHAT I WOULD DO NOW IS PULL IN 
ANOTHER DEPENDENCY WHICH IS THE 
46:01 - PRONOUNCING LIBRARY AND THEN I 
WOULD HAVE, WHAT I SHOULD HAVE 
46:05 - DONE, I DO THIS NOW, IS TRAIN 
THE MODEL 
46:15 - BACKWARDS.  IF WE LOOK AT THIS 
INPUT.TXT, YOU CAN SEE THESE 
46:20 - LYRICS ARE FORWARDED AND THE 
MODEL DOES IT ALSO.  THAT'S 
46:25 - SOMETHING I WANT TO DO IS TO 
REVERT THE INPUT, TRAIN THE 
46:29 - MODEL BACKWARDS, I CAN USE THE 
PRONOUNCING THING TO GO 
46:33 - BACKWARDS.  INSTEADS OF DOING 
THAT, IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO 
46:37 - TAKE QUESTIONS FROM PEOPLE ON 
THE LIVE STREAM, BECAUSE THAT IS
46:41 - PRETTY MUCH IT.
SO WE GOT THROUGH WHAT IS LSTM, 
46:48 - GETTINGGETTING DATA, SETTING 
THINGS UP, TRAINING THE MODEL 
46:53 - USING SPELL IN ML5.JS.  SO I 
LOOK FORWARD TO ANY QUESTIONS.
47:00 - DANIEL SHIFFMAN: I WILL SLIDE 
NEXT TO YOU, I MIGHT HAVE SOME 
47:03 - QUESTIONS.
  SO I LOVED THAT CREATIVE 
47:06 - SOLUTION, I NEVER THOUGHT OF 
THIS, THAT I THINK IT IS 
47:11 - INTERESTING TO REALIZE THAT THE 
TEXT, THE NEURAL NETWORK ISN'T 
47:16 - LEARNING ANYTHING ABOUT THE 
MEANING OF TEXT.  YOU THINK, OH,
47:21 - MACHINE LEARNING, AI  IS DOING 
WHAT A HUMAN BEING DOES, BUT IT 
47:24 - IS LEARNING ABOUT THE SEQUENCE 
OF WHAT CHARACTERS TEND TO 
47:27 - APPEAR AFTER ANOTHER.  SO WE CAN
JUST AS EASILY LEARN IT 
47:32 - BACKWARDS OR FORWARDS.
  NABIL HASSEIN: AND ESPECIALLY 
47:36 - WITH THE MARKOV MODEL THAT I 
USED, THE MARKOV PROPERTY MEANS 
47:39 - THERE IS NO MEMORY.  SO IT WAS A
VERY NATURAL THING TO DO.  BUT 
47:43 - IT WAS A LITTLE WEIRD.
  DANIEL SHIFFMAN: ONE OF THE 
47:47 - QUESTIONS THAT CAME UP, SOMEONE 
NOTICED -- I WILL MAKE SURE THAT
47:53 - THE MIC IS ON.
YOUR FILE SIZE WHICH IS 300KB 
47:59 - WHICH IS PERFECT FOR A
48:03 - QUICK DEMONSTRATION LIKE THIS.  
DOES IT GIVE YOU A SENSE OF HOW 
48:07 - MUCH DATA THAT YOU NEED TO GET 
THE RESULTS YOU MIGHT WANT TO 
48:14 - GET?
NABIL HASSEIN: MORE DATA IS 
48:18 - BETTER, IT DEPENDS ON THE 
APPLICATION.  I WANTED THE 
48:22 - LYRICS TO SOUND LIKE THIS 
PERSON.  AND I MEAN, YEAH, 3KB 
48:27 - OF LYRICS IS A GOOD AMOUNT FOR 
48:36 - AN ARTIST.
AND I WOULD SAY GENERALLY MORE 
48:39 - IS BETTER, AND IT REALLY DEPENDS
ON THE APPLICATION.
48:43 - DANIEL SHIFFMAN: AND IT DEPENDS 
ON WHAT YOU ARE
48:51 - TROIG TRYING TO GENERATE.  IF IT
IS TWO LINES, THAT IS EASIER TO 
48:57 - GENERATE THAN A NOVEL.  AND I 
HAVE TUTORIALS 
49:04 - ON MARKOV MODELS, AND WITH 
LARGER.WE ARE GOING TO PRODUCE 
49:11 - MORE SURPRAISES
49:15 - PRIZES AND
49:18 - CREATIVE OUTPUT.
  AND USE SPELL CP ON A FINISHED
49:22 - RUN, IS THAT THE SAME AS A FRESH
RUN? WHAT HAPPENS IF I USE SPELL
49:26 - CP WHEN IT IS TRAINING?
DANIEL SHIFFMAN: WE SHOULD CHECK
49:30 - TO SEE IF IT FINISHED, AND I 
THINK THE ANSWER TO THIS IS THAT
49:35 - SCRIPT, THAT PYTHON SCRIPT  
SCRIPT THAT WE'RE USING DOES NOT
49:41 - GENERATE THE FINISHED MODEL 
FILES UNTIL IT IS DONE.  SO 
49:45 - THERE IS NOT ANYTHING TO SPELL 
CP, BUT MOST TRAINING SCRIPTS 
49:50 - WILL GENERATE IN PROGRESS 
VERSIONS, CHECK POINTS, A 
49:54 - VERSION OF THE MODEL IN 
PROGRESS, AND DAYS AND DAYS AND 
49:57 - DAYS, IT CRASHES IN THE LAST 10 
SECONDS, YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT
50:00 - YOU CAN WORK WITH.  THE BASIC 
EXAMPLE FROM THE ML5 PROJECT 
50:05 - WHICH IS BASED ON TENSORFLOW -- 
I DON'T THINK WE ARE GENERATING 
50:08 - THE CHECK POINTS, MAYBE WE ARE, 
WE SHOULD.  SO WE WILL ADD THAT 
50:16 - PROJECT.
  NABIL HASSEIN: BOTH RUNS 
50:19 - FINISHED.
  THE GPU RUN WAS 3 TIMES 
50:23 - FASTER, IT TOOK 5 MINUTES, 
VERSUS 17 ON CPU.
50:27 - DANIEL SHIFFMAN: AND BECAUSE IT 
IS SUCH A SMALL AMOUNT OF DATA, 
50:32 - THAT DIFFERENCE IS LESS EXTREME.
IF YOU HAD 10MB OF TEXT OR 100MB
50:37 - OF TEXT AND YOU ARE WORKING WITH
AN  IMAGE DID I TELL  -- 
50:46 - DATABASE, IT CAN BE DAU
50:52 - AYS OR WEEKS LESS.
  NABIL HASSEIN: AND YOU CAN 
50:57 - START THE RUN, DO WHATEVER YOU 
ARE DOING, AND THEN THE MODEL 
51:01 - FINISHES AND YOU CAN USE IT 
LATER INSTEAD OF LEAVING THE 
51:05 - COMPUTER RUNNING, RUNNING ON CPU
INSTEAD OF GPU BECAUSE YOUR 
51:10 - LAPTOP IS NOT AS POWERFUL AS THE
DATA CENTER MACHINES.
51:16 - DANIEL SHIFFMAN: AND THEN YOU 
CAN GO TO SLEEP AND WAIT 
51:19 - INTEREST THE
51:23 - -- FOR THE NOTIFICATION TO COME 
IN.
51:27 - AND TRUNCATED SENTENCES, I KNOW 
WHAT IT DOES, GENERATE 100 
51:32 - CHARACTERS.  IT IS ARBITRARY OF 
WHERE IT CUTS OFF.  IN THE 
51:36 - PREVIOUS VERSION OF THE PRODUCT,
WAS THAT A CONSIDERATION, WHERE 
51:41 - TO END IT?
NABIL HASSEIN: THERE'S A FEW 
51:45 - THINGS.  THESE LSTM MODELS CAN 
BE TRAINED BY CHARACTER OR BY  
51:51 - WORD.  IF YOU TRAIN BY WORD, YOU
SHOULD BE GETTING WORDS.  THAT'S
51:55 - ONE THING YOU CAN DO.  I DID 
LEAVE SOMETHING, AND I HAD 
52:00 - SOMETHING ELSE.  WHAT WAS IT? 
THIS IS THE PYTHON VERSION
52:10 - THAT I 
52:16 - HAVE.  
DANIEL SHIFFMAN: AND YOU CAN 
52:19 - FIND A NICER POINT TO END.  IF 
YOU ARE TRAINING OFF OF SONG 
52:27 - LYRICS, THE LINE BREAK IS A 
CHARACTER THAT THE MODEL WILL 
52:30 - LEARN.  BUT IT WILL GENERATE 
THINGS AND PUT THE LINE BREAKS 
52:34 - IN THEM.  SO IT DEPENDS ON HOW 
YOU FORMAT
52:45 - THE TRAINING DATA
52:52 - .
  NABIL HASSEIN: I CUT IT OFF AT
52:59 - THE SPACE.
  DANIEL SHIFFMAN: HOW DO YOU 
53:03 - USE SPELL WITH JAVASCRIPT? SO IN
THIS LIVE STREAM TODAY, WHAT 
53:06 - NABIL SHOWED USH  US IS A PYTHON
SCRIPT.  WE SWITCHED TO 
53:12 - JAVASCRIPT TO EXECUTE THE MODEL 
IN THE BROWSER TO MAKE IT 
53:16 - INTERACTIVE, BUT THE TRAINING 
WAS IN PYTHON AND THAT IS 
53:18 - TYPICAL, MOST MACHINE LEARNING 
TRAINING SYSTEMS AND THINGS YOU 
53:22 - WILL FIND ARE IN PYTHON OR 
SOMETHING LIKE TORCH IS A THING,
53:26 - AND THERE ARE OTHER SCIENTIFIC 
COMPUTING LANGUAGES AND 
53:30 - PLATFORMS FOR DOING MACHINE 
LEARNING.
53:32 - HOWEVER, YOU MIGHT WANT TO RUN A
NODE SCRIPT, NODE IS A 
53:36 - JAVASCRIPT FRAMEWORK FOR DOING 
SERVER-SIDE PROGRAMMING AND 
53:38 - OTHER STUFF, TOO.  AND SO THERE 
IS ACTUALLY TENSORFLOW HAS -- 
53:45 - JAVASCRIPT TENSORFLOW RUNS IN 
NODE.  SO WHAT THE SPELL FOLKS 
53:48 - MEANS IS THAT THERE'S AN 
ARGUMENT WHICH IS DASH DASH, YOU
53:51 - CAN FIND IT IN THE DOCUMENTATION
SOMEWHERE, DASH DASH APT, AND 
53:56 - THAT'S WHERE YOU CAN TELL IT -- 
WE DID NOT HAVE TO INSTALL 
53:59 - TENSORFLOW AS IT DEPENDENCY, 
BECAUSE I THINK SPELL INCLUDES 
54:04 - THOSE.  IN THE LIVE STREAM FROM 
BEFORE SHE HAD TO ADD AN 
54:09 - ADDITIONAL DEPENDENCY.  YOU CAN 
CONFIGURE THE SPELL COMMAND TO 
54:13 - SAY DASH DASH APD SPACE NODE AND
IT KNOWS I NEED TO USE NODE FOR 
54:19 - THIS.  I WILL PUT A VIDEO TO 
SHOW YOU WHERE TO RUN THE 
54:26 - DOCUMENTATION.
  NABIL HASSEIN: YOU CAN TELL 
54:29 - SPELL TO RUN ECHO --.
  DANIEL SHIFFMAN: ANYTHING YOU 
54:34 - CAN TYPE INTO THE CONSOLE OR 
TERMINAL IN YOUR COMPUTER, YOU 
54:37 - CAN RUN INSTEAD OF ON YOUR 
COMPUTER ON THE SPELL PLATFORM.
54:42 - AND
54:47 - THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS
54:51 - ON THIS LIVE STREAM, IT IS SUPER
INTERESTING AND WE ARE JUST 
54:54 - TALKING ABOUT THE TEXT EDITOR.  
IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT I -- I 
55:01 - DID NOT LEARN BY, I
55:05 - LEARNED PROGRAMMING -- I WAS FAR
ON THE OTHER SPECTRUM INTERFACE.
55:09 - IT IS GREAT TO SEE THAT, YOU ARE
WORKING WITH HOW EFFICIENT IT 
55:14 - IS.
NABIL HASSEIN: YES, IT TAKES AN 
55:17 - INVESTMENT, TO BE HONEST, I 
DON'T KNOW IF I RECOMMEND THAT 
55:20 - OTHER PEOPLE START USING IT.  IF
YOU HAVE TIME TO LEARN IT, IT IS
55:24 - NICE THAT IT INTEGRATES NICELY 
WITH PYTHON, JAVASCRIPT, AND A 
55:28 - MILLION OTHER LANGUAGES.  AND I 
KEEP MOST OF MY NOTES USING THE 
55:33 - FORMAT, WHICH LETS ME DO THIS 
NICE OUTLINE STUFF AND STUFF 
55:38 - LIKE THAT.
DANIEL SHIFFMAN: OKAY, I THINK 
55:41 - -- I WAS GOING TO BE LIKE, OH, 
WE'RE DONE.  THERE IS ONE MORE 
55:44 - QUESTION.  CAN THE MODEL COPY 
THE EXACT LYRICS IN THE DATASET?
55:49 - INTERESTING QUESTION.
  NABIL HASSEIN: IT CAN, I DON'T
55:52 - KNOW IF WE WANT IT TO.  THE MORE
-- THE HIGHER THE TEMPERATURE 
55:56 - IS, THE MORE LIKELY IT WOULD BE.
DANIEL SHIFFMAN: THE POINT HERE,
56:05 - YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT CONCEPTUAL 
IDEA FOR WHY YOU WANT TO USE 
56:09 - THIS MODEL.  AND WHAT NABIL IS 
DEMONSTRATING IS THE IDEA OF 
56:12 - HAVING THE MODEL GENERATE 
SOMETHING THAT IS SIMILAR IN 
56:17 - STYLE AND SUBSTANCE, BUT NOT THE
SAME.  AND CERTAINLY,
56:24 - PROBABILITY-WISE, THERE IS 
LIKELIHOOD THAT IT IS THE EXACT 
56:29 - LINE FOR THE LYRICS.  THERE ARE 
SO MANY COMPUTATIONS AND 
56:34 - PERMUTATIONS THAT IT IS NOT 
LIKELY TO HAPPEN.
56:36 - SO I THINK WE'RE GOING TO WRAP 
UP.  THIS WAS AMAZINGLY 
56:40 - EFFICIENT, A ONE-HOUR LIVE 
STREAM, IT NEVER HAPPENS, AND WE
56:43 - ONLY HAD A FEW GLITCHES.
AND ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THE 
56:48 - AUDIO PROBLEMS WE HAD EARLIER, 
WE WILL HAVE AN
56:57 - EDITED VERSION OF THIS.
AND THIS ARCHIVE WILL BE 
57:01 - AVAILABLE AFTER I TURN IT OFF.  
YOU CAN WATCH IT, AND I WILL GET
57:04 - THE NOTES FROM NABIL AND PUT 
EVERYTHING IN THE DESCRIPTION.  
57:07 - IF YOU WANT THE COMMANDS AND THE
URLS, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN 
57:12 - SEE IN THE CHAT, THE IDEA OF A 
RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK IS A 
57:15 - NEW CONCEPT, SO THE READINGS ARE
REFERENCES TO GET AN 
57:21 - UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE PIECES
ARE.  SO STAY TUNED FOR THAT, 
57:25 - YOU CAN ASK QUESTIONS LATER IN 
THE COMMENTS AND I WILL ALSO BE 
57:30 - BACK THIS AFTERNOON BECAUSE I'M 
DOING A SERIES ON MAKING 
57:35 - MASTADON BOTS.  I WANT TO SHOW 
HOW TO RUN A PROSING SKETCH TO 
57:42 - GENERATE.  SO LOOK FOR THAT 
AROUND FOR THAT AT 3:30PM, FOR 
57:50 - AN HOUR OR SO.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.  AWESOME FOR 
57:55 - YOU TO BE HERE, GREAT TO SEE 
ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF  TRAINING 
58:01 - WITH PYTHON.
SO I WAS SAYING THIS EARLIER, I 
58:04 - DON'T HAVE ANY GOOD SYSTEM FOR 
THIS.  I WILL GO TO THE WEB 
58:08 - PAGE, THE CAMERA WENT OFF.  
PERFECT TIMING.  I WILL TURN IT 
58:15 - ON SO WE CAN WAVE GOOD BYE AND I
WILL HIT STOP STREAMING AND WE 
58:19 - ARE DONE FOR THE DAY.
IF YOU WANT TO TRY THIS, YOU CAN

>> IEL SHIFFMAN HELLO, EVERYONE! WELCOME TO THIS LIVECODE TRAINING EPISODE, OR EVENT, AND IT IS SPONSORED BY SPELL. YOU CAN GO TO SPELL.COM/CODING SPELL.COM/CODINGTRAIN. THERE'S AN INTRO TO SPELL PLATFORM. WE HAD A TUTORIAL ON HOW TO TRAIN A STYLE MODEL. WE HAVE NABIL HASSEIN WHO IS GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO THANE TRAIN AN LSTM MODEL. THANK YOU TO WHITE COAT CAPTIONING, THERE SHOULD BE CAPTIONS SAYING THINGS LIKE MANGO, BLUEBERRY, BANANA, HOPEFULLY. AND I WILL TELL YOU ABOUT NABIL, HE IS A BROOKLYNBASED ARTIST, WEB DEVELOPER, AND ALUMNI OF NYU. HE . YOU CAN FIND OUT MORE ABOUT NABIL AND THE WORK HE IS DOING AND THE PROJECTS HE IS ININVOLVED IN AT THE WEBSITE. AND NOW, RIGHT NOW, THE DESCRIPTION IS PRETTY BARE, IT IS NABIL'S BILLOW AND A FEW WORDS ABOUT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO TODAY. SO YOU SHOULD LOOK AT THE LIVE CHAT HERE TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS WORKING. I WILL BRING NABIL ON AND LOOK AT THE LIVE CHAT AND LET ME KNOW IF THERE ARE TECHNICAL ISSUES WE CAN FIX BEFORE WE GET STARTED WITH THE TUTORIAL. ANYTHING I MISSED? SO I WILL BRING NABIL IN, AND WE'RE GOING TO AWKWARDLY SWITCH PLACES, I WILL WATCH THE CHAT, IF THERE ARE QUESTIONS, POST THEM THERE. OKAY, THANKS. AND HERE WE GO. WELCOME, NABIL. NABIL HASSEIN WELCOME, EVERYONE. THANK YOU FOR THE GREAT INTRODUCTION, AND THANKS SPELL FOR PAYING ME TO MAKE THIS VIDEO, OR DO THE LIVE STREAM. I HAVE AN OUTLINE OF WHAT I PLANNED TO GO THROUGH. SO I GUESS I WILL INTRODUCE MYSELF. I'M NABIL, I LIVE IN BROOKLYN, I'M A FREELANCE TECHNOLOGIST, EDUCATOR, I DO SOME OTHER THINGS. AGAIN, THANK YOU SPELL FOR SPONSORING THIS VIDEO. SO THIS LIVE STREAM IS ABOUT HOW TO TRAIN AN LSTM MODEL USING THE SPELL PLATFORM, SO ON SOME REMOTE MACHINES SOMEWHERE. AND THEN HOW TO USE THAT MODEL THAT WE'VE TRAINED USING A LIBRARY CALLED ML5.JS, A BROWSERBASED FRONT END LIBRARY FOR USING MACHINE LEARNING MODELS. SO IN THIS VIDEO, I WILL TRY TO DO A FEW THINGS, TRULY LIVE FOR YOU HERE TODAY. I'M GOING TO EXTEND A PROJECT THAT I DID AT THE SCHOOL FOR COMPUTATION, WHICH DAN MENTIONED, LAST SUMMER. SO THE PROJECT, I CAN SHOW YOU THE VERSION OF IT THAT IS LIVE ON THE WEB. SO THIS I TRAINED USING A MARKOV MODEL. SO THIS IS A RHYME GENERATOR, BASED ON THE LYRICS OF ONE OF MY FAVORITE EMCEES, MF DOOM. EVERY TIME I CLICK A RHYME BUTTON, IT GENERATES RANDOM RHYMES PATTERNED ON HIS LYRICS. THIS VIDEO ISN'T REALLY ABOUT THAT PROJECT, IT IS ABOUT HOW TO USE SPELL. BUT IT GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND, AND THE CODE IS LIVE IF YOU WANT TO OR THE CODE IS PUBLIC ON GITHUB IF YOU WANT TO CHECK IT OUT AT SOME POINT. AND I USED A LIBRARY CALLED PRONOUNCING, WHICH WAS CREATED AND I'M NOT SURE IF TOO MANY PEOPLE A LOT OF WORK WAS DONE BY ALLISON PERISH AND I USED THAT LIBRARY TO GENERATE A PAIR OF RHYMING WORDS, I TRAINED THE MODEL BACKWARDS ON THE INPUT TEXT SO I CAN GENERATE THE REST OF THE SENTENCE GOING FROM THE END TO THE BEGINNING, AND THEN REVERSE ORDER. DANIEL SHIFFMAN APPARENTLY THERE IS STATIC IN THE AUDIO. LET ME SEE IF I CAN HEAR IT HERE. NABIL HASSEIN TEST TESTING, TESTING. SHOULD I MOVE THE MIC? UNCLIP IT FOR A SECOND. NABIL HASSEIN OKAY, SO TALKING ABOUT THE VUD VIDEO, TRAINING AN LSTM MODEL. SO LET'S GO AHEAD AND GET INTO IT. SO THE NEXT THING SO I'M NOT REALLY GOING TO TALK TOO MUCH IN THIS VIDEO ABOUT THE THEORY OF NEURAL NETWORKS OR WHAT AN LSTM MODEL IS, BUT IT STANDS FOR LONGSHORT TERM MEMORY. IT IS A SPECIFIC TYPE OF RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK AND WHAT IS USEFUL ABOUT RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS IS THE WAY THEIR ARCHITECTURE INCLUDES LOOPS. AND THAT CAN BE USEFUL FOR KIND OF KEEPING DATA AROUND IN THE NETWORKS, SO TO SPEAK, WHICH IS USEFUL FOR APPLICATIONS INVOLVING NATURAL LANGUAGE, HUMAN LANGUAGE. BECAUSE CONTEXT MATTERS SO MUCH IN LANGUAGE. LIKE, PREDICTING THE NEXT CHARACTER, OR THE NEXT WORD, MIGHT BE YOU MIGHT GET A MUCH BETTER PREDICTION IF YOU ACTUALLY REMEMBER WHAT WAS SAID, EVEN SOME WHILE AGO, MAYBE MUCH EARLIER IN A LONG SENTENCE. SO I HAVE A FEW QUICK REFERENCES HERE, WHICH RIGHT NOW ARE A LITTLE OLD. BUT THIS IS THESE ARE WHAT I READ TO LEARN A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS. SO THERE'S A BLOG POST, THE UNREASONABLE EFFECTIVE OVER RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS AND THERE'S A BLOG POST CALLED UNDERSTANDING LSTMS, OR DID I TYPE ALL OF THIS SOMEHOW? I MUST HAVE. I WILL FIX THAT. YEAH, IT IS CALLED UNDERSTANDING LSTMS. SO, YEAH, THIS GIVES A LITTLE BIT OF OVERVIEW OF THE STUFF I WAS TALKING ABOUT. HUMANS ARE THINKING FROM SCRATCH EVERY SECOND, YOU UNDERSTAND A WORD BASED ON THE UNDERSTANDING FROM PREVIOUS WORDS, AND WITH THE NETWORK, THAT'S WHY WE ARE USING THIS LSTM MODEL. AND, YEAH, I KNOW THAT BEFORE I HAD THE CHANCE WHILE PREPARING FOR THIS VIDEO TO WATCH A VIDEO ON AN OVERVIEW OF THE SPELL PLATFORM, A LINK TO THAT WILL BE ADDED TO THE VIDEO DESCRIPTION AND YOU CAN GET MORE INDEPTH ABOUT USING SPELL, AND I WILL MENTION SOME THINGS ABOUT USING SPELL AS WE GO THROUGH THIS. SO WHEN YOU WANT TO DO A PROJECT LIKE THIS, FIRST YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR CORPUS OF DATA. AND SO IN THIS CASE, SINCE I WAS GETTING SONG LYRICS, I USED A SITE CALLED GENIUS.COM, WHICH YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH, IT A POPULAR LYRICS WEBSITE. AND THE MAIN THING I USE IT FOR IS READING LYRICS. AND SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO, I WILL DO EVERYTHING FROM SCRATCH, SO TO SPEAK, SO YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO FOLLOW ALONG IN THEORY. SO THIS IS OVER A FOLDER THAT I USED TO PREPARE. WHAT I WILL DO IS MAKE A NEW FOLDER, CALLED SPELL LIVESTREAM, I WILL DO EVERYTHING FROM INSIDE OF THIS FOLDER, WHICH IS LIVED SOMEWHERE IN MY COMPUTER. SO RIGHT NOW, THIS FOLDER IS EMPTY. AND SO THE FIRST THING THAT I'M GOING TO DO IS CLONE MY GENERATIVE DOOM REPOSITORY FROM GITHUB. AND THERE IS ONLY ONE FILE IN THERE THAT I CARE ABOUT, SO MAYBE MAYBE I WILL NOT CLONE THE WHOLE FILE STORY. I WILL GET THE ONE FILE. SO I'M JUST GOING TO I DON'T KNOW WHERE THIS IS. DID I PUSH IT UP? I HAVE SO MANY BRANCHES HERE. I WILL USE THE ONE THAT I HAVE ON MY COMPUTER. SO I'M JUST GOING TO COPY A FILE THAT I HAVE ON MY COMPUTER INTO THIS FOLDER. SO WHERE WAS THAT, IN SPELL SPELLDEMO/GENERATIVEDOOM/DATA. I HAVE A FILE, INPUT.TXT THAT I BROUGHT A COPY OF INTO THE CURRENT DIRECTORY. SO YOU CAN SEE THIS IS JUST A LIST OF LYRICS, THIS IS MY CORPUS. AND IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT THE DATA SET I'M USING FOR THIS EXAMPLE ISN'T THAT BIG. WE CAN CHECK THE SIZE OF IT WITH THE COMMAND LINE UTILITY, DU, FOR DISK USAGE, AND YOU CAN TELL HOW BIG THIS FILE IS. IT IS ABOUT 308 KILOBYTES. IT IS NOT HUGE. NORMALLY WHEN YOU ARE TRAINING MACHINE LEARNING MODELS, THE MORE DATA, THE BETTER. BUT I GOT ALL THE LYRICS I COULD FIND. THIS IS REALLY THE MOST THAT I COULD GET. SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO USE. COOL. SO IT IS ALSO WORTH NOTING THAT YOU HAVE TO CLEAN THE DATA BEFORE YOU TRAIN IT. SO I CAN ACTUALLY GO AHEAD AND SHOW I CAN GO AHEAD AND SHOW THE CODE THAT I USED TO GET THE LYRICS. IT IS ON MY GITHUB IF YOU WANT TO CHECK IT OUT. SO LET'S PUT IT OVER HERE. SO I HAPPENED TO DO MY SCRAPING USING PYTHON, YOU CAN USE ANY LANGUAGE, NODE.JS, RUBY, OR WHATEVER YOUR LANGUAGE IS. I USED A PYTHON LIBRARY, BEAUTIFUL SOUP, WHICH IS VERY USEFUL FOR WEB SCRAPING. AND SO IT SO HAPPENS THAT GENIUS.COM HAPPENS TO KEEP THEIR LYRICS IN, LIKE, THEIR URLS, THEY FOLLOW A PATTERN LIKE THIS, GENIUS.COM/ARTIST NAME AND THE NAME OF THE SONG, AND THEN I USED ANOTHER PYTHON LIBRARY, REQUESTS, TO JUST GO AHEAD AND FETCH ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT THINGS. SO THIS IS THE BASIC IDEA, I'M NOT GOING TO GO INTO FULL DEPTH, BUT I HARDCODED A LOT OF NAMES OF DIFFERENT SONGS INTO HERE AND THEN I HAVE A MAIN LOOP WHICH LOOPS THROUGH EACH ARTIST'S NAME, BECAUSE DOOM HAS RECORDED UNDER DIFFERENT NAMES. AND THEN THE SAME THING FOR THE ALBUMS, AND THEN THE SONGS, IN ORDER TO GO AHEAD AND FETCH ALL OF THIS DATA. WHEN YOU GO DIRECTLY TO SOME, YOU KNOW, LYRIC'S WEBSITE, WHEN YOU FETCH THE DATA ON THE PAGE, YOU GET A LOT OF OTHER DATA YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT IN THE HTML. SO YOU HAVE AN IMPORTANT STEP IS TO CLEAN THE DATA, SO WHEN YOU ARE TRAINING THE MODEL, YOU ARE ONLY TRAINING IT ON THE CORPUS THAT YOU CARE ABOUT, YOU ARE NOT TRAINING IT ON THE BRACKETS OF THE HTML TAGS THAT YOU DON'T ACTUALLY WANT. SO I THINK I HAVE THE CODE THAT I USED TO CLEAN IT ON GITHUB, AND IF NOT, THERE ARE OTHER RESOURCES YOU CAN USE TO LEARN ABOUT DATA CLEANING. THIS IS ABOUT TRAINING MACHINE LEARNING MODELS USING SPELL AND USING THEM IN THE BROWSER. LET'S GO BACK TO THAT. AND PROJECT GUTENBERG, THAT'S A RESOURCE WITH A LOT OF FREE TEXT IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN THAT YOU CAN JUST USE. AND WEB SCRAPING WITH NODE.JS IS ANOTHER RESOURCE FOR DOING THIS KIND OF THING. AND ALTHOUGH MY SCRAPE.PY FILE IN THE DOOM REPOSITORY DOESN'T SHOW THIS, THE ORIGINAL VERSION, I JUST KIND OF KEPT EACH FILE I KEPT EACH SONG IN ITS OWN FILE OF LYRICS. BUT THE MACHINE, WHAT I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU NEXT, WORKS WITH AN INPUT THAT'S ONE BIG INPUT FILE, INPUT.TXT AND I DID BORING SHELL SCRIPT STUFF THAT CONCATENATES THE FILE TOGETHER. AND THAT'S ALL I WANTED TO SAY ABOUT GETTING DATA. SO LET'S GET INTO THE MAIN THING. SO I DID THIS PART, I CREATED A NEW DIRECTORY FOR ALL OF THIS STUFF TO LIVE IN. SO IT IS A GOOD HABIT TO USE VIRTUAL N, AT LEAST WITH PYTHON DO, I UNDERSTAND THAT THINGS HAVE MOVED ON A BIT WITH PYTHON THREE, BUT I'M ON THE PYTHON TWO. SO I'M GOING TO USE THIS VIRTWOMAN UAL N THING TO KEEP MY DEPENDENCIES ISOLATED. AND I HAVE SOME OTHER VIRTUAL ENDS ACTIVE, I SEE IT FROM MY COMMAND PROMPT OVER HERE. I RAN THE COMMAND, DEACTIVATE, TO GET RID OF THAT. I WILL CLEAR THE SCREEN, TO MAKE IT LESS NOISY HERE. AND AND THEN I WILL CREATE A NEW VIRTUAL N, SPELL VIDEO VIRTUAL N. SO IT IS SETTING UP A NEW VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT WHICH LIVES INSIDE OF THIS FOLDER HERE. AND THE WAY YOU USE PYTHON VIRTUAL END TO GET IT ACTIVE, SPELL, VIDEO VIRTUALENV, SOURCE, AND THEN THE PATH TO ACTIVATE SCRIPT. AND NOW YOU CAN SEE MY PROMPT CHANGED BECAUSE I HAD MY TERMINAL PREFERENCES SET UP THAT WAY, I CAN REMEMBER WHICH VIRTUALENV I'M IN. OKAY, SO I DID THAT. I GOT THE INPUT FILE, WHICH I SHOULD PUSH IT UP. I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY PUSHED UP TO THE GITHUB, LIKE THE ONE FILE VERSION, BUT LIFE IS MESSY. SO I WILL GET THE PROPER VERSION FROM GITHUB IS THIS REPOSITORY CALLED TRAINING LSTM. SO I'M GOING TO CLONE THAT. AND WE WILL GO AND TAKE A LOOK AT THAT REPOSITORY AND ITS READ ME. . I WILL CLONE, COPY, AND PASTE IT IN. SO YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS FROM THE DESCRIPTION OF THIS REPOSITORY, TRAINING IN LSTM NETWORK AND USING THE NETWORK ML5.JS IS HIGHLY RELEVANT TO WHAT WE ARE DOING IN THIS VIDEO. SO THIS REPOSITORY'S READ ME ARE BASED ON WHAT YOU WOULD WANT TO DO IF YOU WERE TRAINING THE MACHINE LEARNING MODEL LOCALLY ON YOUR OWN COMPUTER. AND SO IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO DO, YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND FOLLOW THIS. SINCE THIS VIDEO IS ABOUT HOW TO USE SPELL, THAT'S WHAT CAN ARE I WILL DO. I WILL NOT FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS EXACTLY, BUT CERTAIN PARTS OF IT. SO I CLONED THIS REPOSITORY, THAT'S THE LAST COMMAND THAT WHERE RAN. I RAN. I WILL ENTER INTO THAT REPOSITORY. AND THEN WHAT I WANT TO DO IS CREATE A DIRECTORY INSIDE OF HERE CALLED DATA. AND THENP I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND MOVE AHEAD THAT INPUT.TXT FILE INTO THAT DATA DIRECTORY. OR A COPY OF IT, RATHER. I COULD DELETE AND GET A DIRECTORY, BUT WHATEVER. OKAY, GREAT. SO THIS IS THE SETUP. WE HAVE A REPOSITORY, WE HAVE THIS REPOSITORY LOCALLY THAT IS GOING TO HELP US TRAIN THE LSTM NETWORK USING TENSORFLOW. AFTER WE TRAINED THE MODEL, WE CAN USE IT IN ML5.JS. SO WE'RE DONE WITH THE SET UP, SO LET'S GET INTO TRAINING THE MODEL. SO AGAIN, THIS IS THE LINK THAT YOU CAN USE TO SIGN UP FOR SPELL IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY. IT SO HAPPENS THAT I HAVE ALREADY. SO I SHOULD BE LOGGED IN HERE, I WILL MAKE SURE I DON'T HAVE TO LOG OUT, I HAVEN'T. SO I AM IN HERE IN SPELL.RUN AND IT GIVES ME INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO INSTALL SPELL, HOW TO LOG IN WITH SPELL, THERE'S A QUICKSTART GUIDE AND THE RESOURCES THAT I USED IN PREPARING FOR THIS VIDEO. SO LIKE I MENTIONED, THE OTHER TRAINING LSTM REPOSITORY SHOWS YOU HOW TO RUN LOCALLY. FOR US, ALL WE NEED TO INSTALL IS SPELL. SO I WILL GO AHEAD AND DO THAT. I WILL PIP INSTALL SPELL AND IT WILL FETCH SPELL AND WHATEVER THINGS THAT SPELL DEPENDS ON FROM THE PYTHON PACKAGE, PYPY, OR WHATEVER IT IS CALLED. IT WILL GO AHEAD AND GET THAT. AND THEN ONCE IT IS DONE INSTALLING, I WILL BE ABLE TO LOG IN, I WILL USE MY USER NAME AND PASSWORD IF I CAN REMEMBER IT. I CAN REMEMBER IT. YOU CAN SEE THE READ ME, THAT IS ME, I'M LOGGED IN AS MYSELF. AND IF YOU EVER FORGET THAT YOU ARE LOGGED IN, FOR SOME REASON, THIS SPELL COMMAND HAS A LOT OF SUB COMMANDS. SPELL WHO AM I WILL TELL YOU WHO YOU ARE. BUT I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED WITH TRAINING THIS MODEL. AND THE FIRST THING THAT WE NEED TO DO IS TO UPLOAD THE FILE TO SPELL. OKAY? SO WHAT I WANT TO RUN IS THIS COMMAND HERE, SPELL UPLOAD THE PATH OF THE LOCAL COMPUTER ON TO THE FILE. AND THEN I WANT TO GIVE IT A NAME OF WHERE I'M GOING TO UPLOAD IT TO. SO SPELL UPLOAD MY DATA/INPUT.TXT TO THIS DEST DESTINATION. IT WILL WANT IT MOMENTARILY. SO I WILL TELL SPELL TO UPLOAD THE FILE I WANTED TO UPLOAD. AND THEN IT TELLS ME THAT THE FILE, THIS IS THE PATH TO IT ON MY LOCAL THAT I'M TYPING ON RIGHT NOW, IS ACCESSIBLE AT UPLOAD/NAME/INPUT.TXT. AND THAT'S THE NAME THAT I WANT TO PUT IN. SO I'M GOING TO DELETE THE PART I DON'T WANT AND PUT IN, WHAT WAS IT, NABIL SPELL LIVESTREAM DOOM. OKAY? I WILL UPLOAD AT 307K, THAT IS CLOSE TO WHAT WE SAW WHEN WE RAN THE DU COMMAND EARLIER. AND THE UPLOAD IS COMPLETED. SO THAT'S GREAT. AND SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO NOW, AND THIS IS KIND OF THE MOST PROBABLY THE MOST COMPLICATED COMMAND WE ARE GOING TO RUN, BUT THE ONLY ONE. AND THIS IS WHAT IT IS SAYING TO ACTUALLY GO AHEAD AND RUN THE PYTHON SCRIPT THAT WE DOWNLOADED FROM TRAIN, THAT TRAINING LSTM GIT REPOSITORY. OKAY? WE'RE GOING TO RUN THAT, THIS TRAINING PY SCRIPT, WITH THE DATA SETDATA SET DEAREST TO WHAT I CALLED DATA, THAT'S THE NAME OF THE FOLDER WHERE I PUT THE INPUT.TXT. AND I'M GOING TO RUN IT, AND I'M GOING TO MOUNT THE DATA I WILL MOUNT THE FOLDER THAT I CREATED BY UPLOADING THAT FILE. THAT IS AS THE NAME DATA SO IT CAN UNDERSTAND THIS DATA DIRECTORY. SO I SHOULD GET, I THINK, ONE ERROR WHEN I DO THIS AND I WILL TALK ABOUT WHY. SO SPELL RUN, MOUNT, UPLOAD, NABIL, I CALLED IT LIVE STREAM. THIS IS FROM WHEN I PRACTICED. I WILL GO AHEAD AND FIX THAT. IT TELLS ME THAT THERE ARE UNTRACKED FILES ON THIS REPOSITORY AND THEY ARE NOT AVAILABLE ON THIS RUN. THAT'S THE FILE THAT I CARE ABOUT. SO SPELL ENCOURAGES US TO USE THE GIT VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DATA THAT WE'RE TRAINING ON IS CHECKED IN AND THAT IS VERY GOOD FOR REPRODUCEANT ABILITY IF WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS THERE. SO I WILL DO AND TALL LOW FOLLOW THE SUGGESTED WORKFLOW. SO I WILL GIT, ADD DOT, OR WHATEVER IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE. AND I WILL SAY ADD DATA.INPUT.TXT OF DOOM LYRICS. AND NOW, HAVING DONE THAT, IF I RUN THE SAME COMMAND, IT WILL NOT GIVE ME THE SAME WARNING SINCE THE FILES ARE TRACKED INSTEAD OF BEING UNTRACKED. YEAH, SO LET ME GO AHEAD AND SEARCH THROUGH THIS, AND I WILL MENTION THE OTHER THING I SAID I WAS GOING TO MENTION. I WILL PRESS UP A FEW TIMES AND RUN THE SAME COMMAND AGAIN. SO RUN, I'M MOUNTING THE DATA FOLDER I UPLOADED TO BE CALLED DATA. AND I PUT IT IN THE WRONG FOLDER. DANIEL SHIFFMAN IF YOU ARE GOING TO MOUNT THE DATA FOLDERDO , DO YOU HAVE TO COMMIT IT? SO IF YOU DON'T WANT TO UPLOAD IT WITH GIT, THEN YOU CAN DO . NABIL HASSEIN OH, RIGHT. SO THERE IS MORE THAN ONE WAY TO WORK WITH SPELL, AND I CONFLATED THE TWO OF THEM A LITTLE BIT. SO, YEAH, I DIDN'T ACTUALLY DO THE GIT COMMIT BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT I'M DOING THAT I'M DOING THIS, BECAUSE I UPLOADED IT BEFORE. AND THEN I WILL ALSO GET THE SAME REPRODUCIBILITY BENEFITS, BECAUSE SPELL WILL KEEP A RECORD OF WHAT WE UPLOADED, BUT IT DOES NOT HURT TO GIT COMMIT IT EITHER. SO I WILL FIX THAT TYPO. DANIEL SHIFFMAN IN THIS CASE IT IS A SMALL FILE, IT DOESN'T MATTER, BUT IF IT IS HUGE, YOU WANT TO UPLOAD THE SEPARATELY WITHOUT HAVING TO COMMIT IT. NABIL HASSEIN YES, GIT IS NOT THE BEST FOR COMMITTING LARGE FILES, SO THERE ARE TOOLS LIKE SPELL AND GIT, THERE'S A BUNCH OF TOOLS. SO COOL. SO LET ME GO AHEAD AND FIX THAT TYPO AND IN MY NOTES AS WELL. IT TELLS ME EVERYTHING IS UP TO DATE, BECAUSE I DID MAKE A COMMIT, AND LIKE I MENTIONED, I DOESN'T HAVE TO. IT IS TELLING ME IT IS CASTING SPELL IN 16, I HAVE USED IT ABOUT 15 TIMES BEFORE. I CAN REQUEST AND IT IS RUNNING, AND IT IS STARTING TO TRAIN THE MACHINE LEARNING MODEL AND GIVING ME SOME DATA ABOUT HOW THAT TRAINING IS GOING IN THESE, YOU KNOW, IN THESE DIFFERENT POINTS. DANIEL SHIFFMAN 30 MINUTES HAS PASSED. NABIL HASSEIN AND I'M BACK. AND THIS IS STILL RUNNING, AND LIKE IT TOLD ME BEFORE, I CAN JUST GET OUT OF THE LOGS IN MY LOCAL TERMINAL, CONTROL CC. THIS IS RUNNING ON A REMOTE MACHINE THAT IS PROVISIONED FOR ME. I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT IT. SO I'M NOT STOPPING THE RUN FROM HAVING MY CONTROL C, JUST FROM THE LOGS FROM APPEARINGING IN MY OWN TERMINAL. IF I WANT TO CHECK OUT THE LOGS, I CAN SAY SPELL LOGS 16, AND THEY WILL START APPEARING AGAIN. AND THERE ARE SOME OTHER COMMANDS IT TOLD ME ABOUT. I CAN KILL IT WITH SPELL KILL, I WILL NOT, BECAUSE I WANT IT TO KEEP RUNNING. AND BESIDES CHECKING OUT THE LOGS LOCALLY WITH SPELL LOGS, THE NUMBER OF THE RUN, YOU CAN ALSO COME OVER HERE TO THIS SPELL IN THIS SPELL WEB UI AND CHECK OUT DIFFERENT INFORMATION ABOUT THE RUN IN HERE. BUT UNTHUS VIDEO I HAVE A PREFERENCE FOR THE COMMAND LINE. I WILL DO IT THAT WAY. SO COOL, LET'S SEE. AND ONE THING I WANTED TO MENTION IS THE PERIMETERS IS CALLED HYPERPERIMETERS OF THE NETWORK. SO LET'S GO BACK TO THE GIT READ ME. SO THIS GIVES YOU INFORMATION ABOUT HOW YOU WOULD RUN IT LOCALLY, AND YOU CAN PASS ADDITIONAL FLAGS TO CONTROL MORE OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE NETWORK ITS SIZE, HOW MANY LAYERS THEY ARE, THE LENGTH OF THE SEQUENCE, AND VARIOUS OTHER THINGS THAT YOU CAN READ MORE ABOUT IN THIS REPOSITORY. THEY HAVE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS FOR WHAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO SELECT FOR YOUR HYPERPERIMETERS, ACCORDING TO THE SIZE OF YOUR TRAINING DATASET. BECAUSE MY TRAINING DATA SET IS SO SMALL, I DECIDED TO DEFAULT. THOSE ARE THE OLD NOTES, I DID THAT PART. OH, YEAH. AND THE NEXT THING THAT I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RUNNING ON CPU VERSUS GPU. AND I'M A FAN OF REVIEWING MATERIAL. CPU IS THE CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT OF YOUR COM COMPUTER WITH A LITTLE BIT OF PARALLELISM, BUT FOR THE MOST PART IS BEST AT RUNNING THINGS SEQUENTIALLY REALLY FAST. AND THE MODEL OF COMPUTATION IS DIFFERENT FROM A GPU, AT SOME POINT IT STOOD FOR GRAPHICS PROCESSING UNIT, AND MAYBE IT STILL DOES, BUT THAT ACRONYM IS RETIRED BY NOW BECAUSE GPU HAS APPLICATIONS OTHER THAN GRAPHICS, INCLUDING TRAINING NEURAL NETWORKS ON TEXT. GPUS HISTORICALLY, THEY GOT THAT NAME BECAUSE, EACH PIXEL ON A SCREEN IS INDEPENDENT OF EACH OTHER ONE AND CAN BE COMPUTED INDEPENDENTLY. AND A GPU IS MUCH MORE HIGHLY PARALLEL COMPARED TO A CPU. IT IS NOT GOING TO BE AS FAST AS COMPLETING ONE SINGLE TASK, BUT IT IT IS VERY GOOD FOR DISPLAYING THINGS ON SCREENS AND ALSO VERY GOOD FOR TRAINING NEURAL NETWORKS. SO IN THE LAST COMMAND THAT I RAN OVER HERE ON THE COMMAND LINE TO TRAIN THE NEURAL NETWORK, THIS IS RUNNING VIA A CPU. AND WHAT I CAN DO, IF I WANT SPELL TO RUN MY CODE ON A GPU, I WILL TELL IT THE BEST TYPE OF MACHINE I WANT BY ADDING THIS DASH DASH MACHINE TYPE FLAG. AND THEN THE MACHINE TYPE I WILL USE IS K80. WHERE DOES IT COME FROM? IF YOU CHECK OUT SPELL.RUN/PRICING, YOU WILL SEE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW MUCH SPELL CHARGES FOR YOUR MACHINE TYPES, WHETHER THIS CPU OR THAT GPU IS BEST FOR THE PARTICULAR TASK. THERE'S CPU, CPU BIG, KED THAT IS ONE OF THE LESS EXPENSIVE GPU UNITS. AND THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO USE. EVERYTHING IS UP TO DATE, WE SEE A VERY SIMILAR BIT OF OUTPUT AS WE DID BEFORE AS IT IS READY TO START TRAINING THE MODEL. IN A MOMENT WE SHOULD START SEEING THE LOGS, I'M SURE IT READS THE TEXT FILE. I WILL LOOK AT THE NOTES WHILE I WAIT FOR THAT. SO THAT'S COOL, ALL RIGHT. SO THIS RUN IS RUNNING, AND I DON'T KNOW HOW OBVIOUS THIS IS IF YOU ARE FOLLOWING ALONG. THIS IS HAPPENING A LOT FASTER, THIS MODEL IS BEING TRAINED A LOT FASTER BY A GPU THAN THE CPU ONE WAS. AND SO THE CPU ONE GOT A HEAD START, BUT I STILL EXPECTED THE GPU ONE WILL FINISH SUBSTANTIALLY FASTER. WE ARE AT 113 OUT OF 6,000 ITERATIONS THAT IT IS GOING THROUGH IN SHARING THE MODEL. IF WE CHECK IN ON THE PREVIOUS ONE, I WILL SEE HOW FAR IT IS. THE HEAD START I HAD WAS PRETTY BIG. BUT YOU CAN SEE THE GPU ONE IS MOVING FASTER. AND LIKE IF WE ACTUALLY GO IN, BECAUSE LIKE IT I MENTIONED BEFORE, I HAD A FEW PRACTICE RUNS HERE BEFORE. WE CAN LOOK AT A FEW ONES THAT I DID BEFORE. AND USING A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT MODEL, WE CAN SEE HERE. BUT THIS ONE, ON CPU, TOOK CLOSE TO FIVE YEARS AND ON GPU IT TOOK ONLY MORE THAN 15 MINUTES. AND, YEAH. SO GPU IS FASTER FOR THIS PARTICULAR USE CASE. SO JUST FOR THE SAKE OF TIME, I WILL GRAB A MODEL THAT I TRAIN ED BEFORE. SO WHAT I WANT TO DO TO GRAB THE DATA FROM SPELL IS TO RUN THIS COMMAND HERE. THIS IS SPELL CP RUNS/THE NUMBER OF THE RUN/MODELS. THAT'S HOW I WILL FETCH THAT DATA. SO I'M JUST GOING TO SEE IT UP HERE AND NOW I'M IN MY HOME FOLDER OF ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT I'M GRABBING FROM HERE, GRABBING FROM THERE, TO PUT TOGETHER INTO THIS DEMO. I WILL GO AHEAD AND RUN SPELL CP, AND I WILL LOOK HERE AGAIN. SO YOU CAN SEE THAT IS USING THE SAME TRAINING, LSTM, THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT. IT COMPLETED IN 5 MINUTES, THIS SHOULD COMPLETE PRETTY QUICKLY, TOO. AND THAT WAS THE NEXT RUN THAT I DID JUST A FEW MINUTES BEFORE THE LIVE STREAM STARTED. SO SPELL CP RUNS/15/MODELS. AND IT IS COPYING 10 FILES THAT ARE FROM THERE. SO THIS IS LS DATA, IT REMEMBERS THE SAME DATA DIRECTORY THAT I PASSED IN BEFORE AS THE NAME. AND THESE 10 FILES CONSTITUTE THE MODEL. OKAY? AND I'M NOT GOING TO GO INTO DEPTH ABOUT WHAT ARE THESE FILES, WHAT IS IN THEM. BUT IF I FOLLOW ALONG, YOU CAN BUILD INTO THEM AND CHECK IT OUT. COOL. SO WE FRAMED THE MODEL. WE HAVE USED SPELL TO TRAIN AN LSTM MODEL ON A CORPUS OF DATA THAT WE OBTAINED, AND NOW THAT WE HAVE THE MODEL, LET'S USE IT FOR SOMETHING. SO I'M GOING TO BORROW AND THEN MODIFY AN EXAMPLE FROM THIS REPOSITORY HERE, ON THE ML5.JS GITHUB ACCOUNT, THEY HAVE A REPOSITORY CALLED ML5 EXAMPLES. SO THERE'S A COLLECTION OF EXAMPLES, THERE'S A BUNCH OF THEM, YOU CAN FIND ABOUT HOW TO ORGANIZE AND SOME OTHER STUFF FROM THEIR READ ME. AND I WILL USE ONE IN THE P5.JS FOLDER, WE ARE WORRIED ABOUT LSTMS, AND THIS INTERACTIVE ONE IS INTERESTING. THERE'S MORE, I MEAN, IT IS I'M NOT GOING TO DESCRIBE IT. WE WILL USE THE NONINTERACTIVE VERSION, THE LSTM TEXT. AND WE HAVE HERE JUST A FEW FILES, SO THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A PRETRAINED MODEL THAT I'M GOING TO IGNORE AND NOT USE BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO USE OUR MODEL THAT WE JUST TRAINED. AND WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS JUST FETCH THESE TWO FILES, THIS HTML FILE AND SKETCH.JS FILE AND BECAUSE THIS REPOSITORY IS BIG AND I JUST DON'T WANT TO WAIT TO CLONE IT, I'M GOING TO FETCH THESE TWO FILES AND NOTHING ELSE. SO WHAT I'M GOING X2 TO DO IS JUST CREATE A DIRECTORY, AND WHAT NOT. AND THIS IS ML5 LSTM EXAMPLE, AND I WILL CHANGE THE CURRENT DIRECTORY TO BE IN THERE. I WILL CLEAR THE SCREEN FOR CLARITY'S SAKE. I WILL USE THE COMMAND LINE PROGRAM, W GET, WHICH WILL FETCH THE RAW FILE, AS A QUICK RAW IN GITHUB, AND WILL FETCH IT INTO MY ON TO MY LOCAL MACHINE. I WILL DO THAT. AND THEN I GO BACK AND I DO THE SAME THING WITH SKETCH.JS. I WILL FIND THE ONE RAW FILE, COPY THE URL, AND I WILL USE THE PROGRAM W GET TO DOWNLOAD IT LOCALLY. SO NOW IF I LIST WHAT IS HERE, I WILL HAVE THESE TWO FILES, INDEX.HTML AND SKETCH.JS AND WE WILL TAKE A MOMENT TO CHECK OUT WE WILL READ THE FILES THEMSELVES AND USE THEM. SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS RUN A PROGRAM, HTTP SERVER, WHICH YOU CAN INSTALL IF YOU WANT. IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT, YOU CAN RUN IT WITH NPM INSTALL, AND IF YOU ARE USED TO USING A DIFFERENT WEB SERVER, ANYTHING THAT WILL SERVE UP AN INDEX.HTML IN YOUR LOCAL FOLDER IS FINE. SO IT TELLS ME WHERE, THE URL THAT I CAN GO TO ON LOCAL HOST TO CHECK IT OUT. SO I'M GOING TO GO THERE. AND SO LSTM TEXT GENERATION EXAMPLE, THIS IS A CORPUS ON VIRGINIA WOLF, I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT, SO I WILL CHANGE THAT. SO I WILL GO INTO THIS FILE AND ALSO LOOK AT THE JAVASCRIPT FILE. SO I WILL OPEN UP THE REPO, SPELL LIVE STREAM. THESE ARE THE TWO FILES THAT I DOWNLOADED A MOMENT AGO, INDEX.HTML AND SKETCH.JS. I WILL OPEN IT UP IN A WAY THAT IS MORE READABLE FOR YOU. SO I WILL DO IT OVER HERE, THEN. THE FOLDERS DO NOT REALLY BOTHER THE VIDEO AS MUCH AS THIS ONE DOES. OKAY, SO WE HAVE HERE AN HTML DOCUMENT WHICH RELIES ON P5 AND ML5 AS THE LIBRARIES THAT ARE BEING USED. AND PRETTY MUCH NOTHING ELSE. SO THIS EXAMPLE USES A PRETRAINED MODEL ON A CORPUS OF MF DOOM. I WILL MAKE IT NICE MEANING OF LIFE IS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I DON'T REMEMBER DOOM SAYING, WE CAN REMEMBER IT AS THE SEED TEXT FOR NOW. IT IS INPUT.HTML, I CAN CHANGE IT. WE HAVE A FEW SLIDERS OF HOW LONG THE OUTPUT WILL BE AND THE TEMPERATURE, WHICH I WILL TALK ABOUT LATER. AND WHAT IS INTERESTING IS THE SKETCH.JS FILE, WE WILL TAKE A LOOK THERE. OKAY, SO WE DECLARE A FEW VARIABLES HERE. THIS VIDEO IS NOT ABOUT P5, BUT IT IS A COOL LIBRARY, I ENCOURAGE YOU TO CHECK IT OUT IF YOU ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH IT ALREADY. IT IS GOOD FOR ARTISTIC CODING AND OTHER PROJECTS AS WELL. SO THERE ARE TWO MAIN FUNCTIONS IN I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO P5. SO WE'RE GOING TO START WITH THE SETUP FUNCTION, AND P5 WILL RUN THIS SETUP FUNCTION FOR US IN THE BEGINNING. AND IT SAYS CREATE THE LSTM GENERATOR, PASSING THE MODEL DIRECTORY. SO I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING CALLED MODEL/WOLF BECAUSE I DID NOT CLONE THE WHOLE REPOSITORY. I NEED TO MOCK MAKE SURE THAT THIS, WHEN IT IS GENERATING, LIKE WHEN IT IS CREATING THE LSTM THAT WE'RE GOING TO USE, I NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS POINTING TOWARDS THE PROPER PATH WHERE WE HAVE OUR FILES. SO LET ME GO AHEAD AND REMIND MYSELF ON THE COMMAND LINE OF WHERE I'M KEEPING EVERYTHING. I WILL START THE SERVER AGAIN IN A MINUTE. SO THIS APPEARS Y HAVE DATA UP THERE, WHICH IS WHAT I WANTED. AND SO I WILL COPY THAT FOLDER INTO HERE WHERE I AM. I WILL SAY WHAT IS IT, LOWER CASE R, CAPITAL, FOR RECURSIVE COPY. AND THIS IS HERE, BESIDES THE TWO FILES THAT I FETCH FROM GITHUB USING W GET, I ALSO HAVE ALL OF THE DATA FILES RIGHT HERE. AND SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS CHANGE THIS TO SAY DATA, THAT'S WHERE MY DATA IS. AND THEN HERE, THERE IS OTHER CODE, THIS IS ABOUT THE USER INTERACTION OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SLIDERS AND GET MOVED AROUND AND BUTTONS ARE CLICKED, SO I'M NOT GOING TO GO OVER THAT. AND WHAT WE WILL JUST FAKE TAKE A MINUTE TO LOOK AT IS THIS GENERATE FUNCTION. AND AGAIN, WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO ALL THE WAY THROUGH, BUT IT LETS YOU KNOW IT IS GENERATING STUFF, JUST SO THAT THE USER KNOWS SOMETHING IS HAPPENING, IT GRABS THE INPUT FROM THE SEED TEXT, AND IT USES THESE PERIMETERS TEMPERATURE AND LENGTH. THE ML5.JS LIBRARY DOES THE HEAVY LIFTING FOR US. WE CALL THE LSTM GENERATE FUNCTION WITH OUR DATA AND PATCH UP THE CALLBACK FUNCTION WHICH WE WILL UPDATE THE DOM AND THE HTML PAGE WHEN THAT FUNCTION IS DONE RUNNING, OR DONE GENERATING THE TEXT THAT THE MODEL HAS PREDICTED BASED ON THE INPUT SEED. OKAY? SO YOU CAN SEE THIS IS A PRETTY SHORT FILE, AND THEN WE WILL GO THROUGH EVERY DETAIL, BUT IT IS ON GITHUB, YOU CAN CHECK IT OUT. I MADE ONE SMALL CHANGE TO IT. SO I WILL GO BACK TO MY NOTES, I AM PRETTY SURE I KNOW WHAT I WANT TO DO NEXT BUT IT IS GOOD TO BE SURE. I WILL RUN THE SERVER AGAIN, IT IS UPDATED WITH THIS. THE MODEL IS LOADED. CLICK GENERATE, AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE LISTEN TO DOOM, BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HE MIGHTSY. WE CAN ADJUST THE LENGTH TO MAKE IT LONGER OR SHORTER, AND THEN WE CAN USE THIS TEMPERATURE THING, LIKE THE TEMPERATURE IS SOMETHING LIKE INTUITIVELY, IT IS THE RANDOMNESS OF THE TEXT. THE HIGHER THE TEMPERATURE, THE LESS RANDOM IT WILL BE, THE MORE DERIVATIVE IT WILL BE OF THE ORIGINAL TEXT. AND IF YOU TURN IT UP VERY HIGH, IT IS LIKELY THAT YOU GET DIRECT QUOTES FROM THE ORIGINAL CORPUS U. IF IT IS LOWER, THEN MAYBE IT IS A LITTLE BIT MORE CHAOTIC, SO TO SPEAK. AND THAT CAN GENERATE THINGS THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE OUT THERE OR ORIGINAL. IF YOU START TO DO IT TOO LOW, YOU GET NONSENSE. THEY WILL NOT MAKE MUCH SENSE AT ALL. I WILL HOLD MY OPINION ON THE GENERATIVE LYRICS FOR NOW. THAT'S REALLY THE MAIN THING. IF I WAS GOING TO GO AHEAD AND REPRODUCE MY ORIGINAL PROJECT, WHAT I WOULD DO NOW IS PULL IN ANOTHER DEPENDENCY WHICH IS THE PRONOUNCING LIBRARY AND THEN I WOULD HAVE, WHAT I SHOULD HAVE DONE, I DO THIS NOW, IS TRAIN THE MODEL BACKWARDS. IF WE LOOK AT THIS INPUT.TXT, YOU CAN SEE THESE LYRICS ARE FORWARDED AND THE MODEL DOES IT ALSO. THAT'S SOMETHING I WANT TO DO IS TO REVERT THE INPUT, TRAIN THE MODEL BACKWARDS, I CAN USE THE PRONOUNCING THING TO GO BACKWARDS. INSTEADS OF DOING THAT, IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO TAKE QUESTIONS FROM PEOPLE ON THE LIVE STREAM, BECAUSE THAT IS PRETTY MUCH IT. SO WE GOT THROUGH WHAT IS LSTM, GETTINGGETTING DATA, SETTING THINGS UP, TRAINING THE MODEL USING SPELL IN ML5.JS. SO I LOOK FORWARD TO ANY QUESTIONS. DANIEL SHIFFMAN I WILL SLIDE NEXT TO YOU, I MIGHT HAVE SOME QUESTIONS. SO I LOVED THAT CREATIVE SOLUTION, I NEVER THOUGHT OF THIS, THAT I THINK IT IS INTERESTING TO REALIZE THAT THE TEXT, THE NEURAL NETWORK ISN'T LEARNING ANYTHING ABOUT THE MEANING OF TEXT. YOU THINK, OH, MACHINE LEARNING, AI IS DOING WHAT A HUMAN BEING DOES, BUT IT IS LEARNING ABOUT THE SEQUENCE OF WHAT CHARACTERS TEND TO APPEAR AFTER ANOTHER. SO WE CAN JUST AS EASILY LEARN IT BACKWARDS OR FORWARDS. NABIL HASSEIN AND ESPECIALLY WITH THE MARKOV MODEL THAT I USED, THE MARKOV PROPERTY MEANS THERE IS NO MEMORY. SO IT WAS A VERY NATURAL THING TO DO. BUT IT WAS A LITTLE WEIRD. DANIEL SHIFFMAN ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT CAME UP, SOMEONE NOTICED I WILL MAKE SURE THAT THE MIC IS ON. YOUR FILE SIZE WHICH IS 300KB WHICH IS PERFECT FOR A QUICK DEMONSTRATION LIKE THIS. DOES IT GIVE YOU A SENSE OF HOW MUCH DATA THAT YOU NEED TO GET THE RESULTS YOU MIGHT WANT TO GET? NABIL HASSEIN MORE DATA IS BETTER, IT DEPENDS ON THE APPLICATION. I WANTED THE LYRICS TO SOUND LIKE THIS PERSON. AND I MEAN, YEAH, 3KB OF LYRICS IS A GOOD AMOUNT FOR AN ARTIST. AND I WOULD SAY GENERALLY MORE IS BETTER, AND IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE APPLICATION. DANIEL SHIFFMAN AND IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU ARE TROIG TRYING TO GENERATE. IF IT IS TWO LINES, THAT IS EASIER TO GENERATE THAN A NOVEL. AND I HAVE TUTORIALS ON MARKOV MODELS, AND WITH LARGER.WE ARE GOING TO PRODUCE MORE SURPRAISES PRIZES AND CREATIVE OUTPUT. AND USE SPELL CP ON A FINISHED RUN, IS THAT THE SAME AS A FRESH RUN? WHAT HAPPENS IF I USE SPELL CP WHEN IT IS TRAINING? DANIEL SHIFFMAN WE SHOULD CHECK TO SEE IF IT FINISHED, AND I THINK THE ANSWER TO THIS IS THAT SCRIPT, THAT PYTHON SCRIPT SCRIPT THAT WE'RE USING DOES NOT GENERATE THE FINISHED MODEL FILES UNTIL IT IS DONE. SO THERE IS NOT ANYTHING TO SPELL CP, BUT MOST TRAINING SCRIPTS WILL GENERATE IN PROGRESS VERSIONS, CHECK POINTS, A VERSION OF THE MODEL IN PROGRESS, AND DAYS AND DAYS AND DAYS, IT CRASHES IN THE LAST 10 SECONDS, YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN WORK WITH. THE BASIC EXAMPLE FROM THE ML5 PROJECT WHICH IS BASED ON TENSORFLOW I DON'T THINK WE ARE GENERATING THE CHECK POINTS, MAYBE WE ARE, WE SHOULD. SO WE WILL ADD THAT PROJECT. NABIL HASSEIN BOTH RUNS FINISHED. THE GPU RUN WAS 3 TIMES FASTER, IT TOOK 5 MINUTES, VERSUS 17 ON CPU. DANIEL SHIFFMAN AND BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A SMALL AMOUNT OF DATA, THAT DIFFERENCE IS LESS EXTREME. IF YOU HAD 10MB OF TEXT OR 100MB OF TEXT AND YOU ARE WORKING WITH AN IMAGE DID I TELL DATABASE, IT CAN BE DAU AYS OR WEEKS LESS. NABIL HASSEIN AND YOU CAN START THE RUN, DO WHATEVER YOU ARE DOING, AND THEN THE MODEL FINISHES AND YOU CAN USE IT LATER INSTEAD OF LEAVING THE COMPUTER RUNNING, RUNNING ON CPU INSTEAD OF GPU BECAUSE YOUR LAPTOP IS NOT AS POWERFUL AS THE DATA CENTER MACHINES. DANIEL SHIFFMAN AND THEN YOU CAN GO TO SLEEP AND WAIT INTEREST THE FOR THE NOTIFICATION TO COME IN. AND TRUNCATED SENTENCES, I KNOW WHAT IT DOES, GENERATE 100 CHARACTERS. IT IS ARBITRARY OF WHERE IT CUTS OFF. IN THE PREVIOUS VERSION OF THE PRODUCT, WAS THAT A CONSIDERATION, WHERE TO END IT? NABIL HASSEIN THERE'S A FEW THINGS. THESE LSTM MODELS CAN BE TRAINED BY CHARACTER OR BY WORD. IF YOU TRAIN BY WORD, YOU SHOULD BE GETTING WORDS. THAT'S ONE THING YOU CAN DO. I DID LEAVE SOMETHING, AND I HAD SOMETHING ELSE. WHAT WAS IT? THIS IS THE PYTHON VERSION THAT I HAVE. DANIEL SHIFFMAN AND YOU CAN FIND A NICER POINT TO END. IF YOU ARE TRAINING OFF OF SONG LYRICS, THE LINE BREAK IS A CHARACTER THAT THE MODEL WILL LEARN. BUT IT WILL GENERATE THINGS AND PUT THE LINE BREAKS IN THEM. SO IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU FORMAT THE TRAINING DATA . NABIL HASSEIN I CUT IT OFF AT THE SPACE. DANIEL SHIFFMAN HOW DO YOU USE SPELL WITH JAVASCRIPT? SO IN THIS LIVE STREAM TODAY, WHAT NABIL SHOWED USH US IS A PYTHON SCRIPT. WE SWITCHED TO JAVASCRIPT TO EXECUTE THE MODEL IN THE BROWSER TO MAKE IT INTERACTIVE, BUT THE TRAINING WAS IN PYTHON AND THAT IS TYPICAL, MOST MACHINE LEARNING TRAINING SYSTEMS AND THINGS YOU WILL FIND ARE IN PYTHON OR SOMETHING LIKE TORCH IS A THING, AND THERE ARE OTHER SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING LANGUAGES AND PLATFORMS FOR DOING MACHINE LEARNING. HOWEVER, YOU MIGHT WANT TO RUN A NODE SCRIPT, NODE IS A JAVASCRIPT FRAMEWORK FOR DOING SERVERSIDE PROGRAMMING AND OTHER STUFF, TOO. AND SO THERE IS ACTUALLY TENSORFLOW HAS JAVASCRIPT TENSORFLOW RUNS IN NODE. SO WHAT THE SPELL FOLKS MEANS IS THAT THERE'S AN ARGUMENT WHICH IS DASH DASH, YOU CAN FIND IT IN THE DOCUMENTATION SOMEWHERE, DASH DASH APT, AND THAT'S WHERE YOU CAN TELL IT WE DID NOT HAVE TO INSTALL TENSORFLOW AS IT DEPENDENCY, BECAUSE I THINK SPELL INCLUDES THOSE. IN THE LIVE STREAM FROM BEFORE SHE HAD TO ADD AN ADDITIONAL DEPENDENCY. YOU CAN CONFIGURE THE SPELL COMMAND TO SAY DASH DASH APD SPACE NODE AND IT KNOWS I NEED TO USE NODE FOR THIS. I WILL PUT A VIDEO TO SHOW YOU WHERE TO RUN THE DOCUMENTATION. NABIL HASSEIN YOU CAN TELL SPELL TO RUN ECHO . DANIEL SHIFFMAN ANYTHING YOU CAN TYPE INTO THE CONSOLE OR TERMINAL IN YOUR COMPUTER, YOU CAN RUN INSTEAD OF ON YOUR COMPUTER ON THE SPELL PLATFORM. AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS ON THIS LIVE STREAM, IT IS SUPER INTERESTING AND WE ARE JUST TALKING ABOUT THE TEXT EDITOR. IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT I I DID NOT LEARN BY, I LEARNED PROGRAMMING I WAS FAR ON THE OTHER SPECTRUM INTERFACE. IT IS GREAT TO SEE THAT, YOU ARE WORKING WITH HOW EFFICIENT IT IS. NABIL HASSEIN YES, IT TAKES AN INVESTMENT, TO BE HONEST, I DON'T KNOW IF I RECOMMEND THAT OTHER PEOPLE START USING IT. IF YOU HAVE TIME TO LEARN IT, IT IS NICE THAT IT INTEGRATES NICELY WITH PYTHON, JAVASCRIPT, AND A MILLION OTHER LANGUAGES. AND I KEEP MOST OF MY NOTES USING THE FORMAT, WHICH LETS ME DO THIS NICE OUTLINE STUFF AND STUFF LIKE THAT. DANIEL SHIFFMAN OKAY, I THINK I WAS GOING TO BE LIKE, OH, WE'RE DONE. THERE IS ONE MORE QUESTION. CAN THE MODEL COPY THE EXACT LYRICS IN THE DATASET? INTERESTING QUESTION. NABIL HASSEIN IT CAN, I DON'T KNOW IF WE WANT IT TO. THE MORE THE HIGHER THE TEMPERATURE IS, THE MORE LIKELY IT WOULD BE. DANIEL SHIFFMAN THE POINT HERE, YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT CONCEPTUAL IDEA FOR WHY YOU WANT TO USE THIS MODEL. AND WHAT NABIL IS DEMONSTRATING IS THE IDEA OF HAVING THE MODEL GENERATE SOMETHING THAT IS SIMILAR IN STYLE AND SUBSTANCE, BUT NOT THE SAME. AND CERTAINLY, PROBABILITYWISE, THERE IS LIKELIHOOD THAT IT IS THE EXACT LINE FOR THE LYRICS. THERE ARE SO MANY COMPUTATIONS AND PERMUTATIONS THAT IT IS NOT LIKELY TO HAPPEN. SO I THINK WE'RE GOING TO WRAP UP. THIS WAS AMAZINGLY EFFICIENT, A ONEHOUR LIVE STREAM, IT NEVER HAPPENS, AND WE ONLY HAD A FEW GLITCHES. AND ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THE AUDIO PROBLEMS WE HAD EARLIER, WE WILL HAVE AN EDITED VERSION OF THIS. AND THIS ARCHIVE WILL BE AVAILABLE AFTER I TURN IT OFF. YOU CAN WATCH IT, AND I WILL GET THE NOTES FROM NABIL AND PUT EVERYTHING IN THE DESCRIPTION. IF YOU WANT THE COMMANDS AND THE URLS, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN SEE IN THE CHAT, THE IDEA OF A RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK IS A NEW CONCEPT, SO THE READINGS ARE REFERENCES TO GET AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE PIECES ARE. SO STAY TUNED FOR THAT, YOU CAN ASK QUESTIONS LATER IN THE COMMENTS AND I WILL ALSO BE BACK THIS AFTERNOON BECAUSE I'M DOING A SERIES ON MAKING MASTADON BOTS. I WANT TO SHOW HOW TO RUN A PROSING SKETCH TO GENERATE. SO LOOK FOR THAT AROUND FOR THAT AT 330PM, FOR AN HOUR OR SO. THANK YOU SO MUCH. AWESOME FOR YOU TO BE HERE, GREAT TO SEE ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF TRAINING WITH PYTHON. SO I WAS SAYING THIS EARLIER, I DON'T HAVE ANY GOOD SYSTEM FOR THIS. I WILL GO TO THE WEB PAGE, THE CAMERA WENT OFF. PERFECT TIMING. I WILL TURN IT ON SO WE CAN WAVE GOOD BYE AND I WILL HIT STOP STREAMING AND WE ARE DONE FOR THE DAY. IF YOU WANT TO TRY THIS, YOU CAN GO TO SPELL.RUN/CODINGTRAIN TO SIGN UP FOR AN
