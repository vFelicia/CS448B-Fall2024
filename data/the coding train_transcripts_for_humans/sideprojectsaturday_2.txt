05:08 - hmm
06:15 - hello happy 3 34 pm
06:20 - on a saturday november 7th
06:23 - it is me dan schiffman from the coding
06:25 - train coming to you live
06:26 - from my attic do i look more beautiful
06:29 - today than i usually do
06:30 - i have some new lights and a new setup
06:32 - that i would like to
06:34 - experiment with a little bit here it's
06:36 - been a week
06:37 - to say the least i can't believe that
06:39 - the last time i was here live streaming
06:41 - was
06:42 - halloween one week ago today
06:46 - otherwise known as about 67 years
06:49 - eight months and 31 hours ago
06:52 - i'm very tired and typically i do try to
06:56 - live stream in the morning
06:57 - um but this morning i had a special
07:01 - socially distanced parents versus kids
07:04 - little league
07:05 - masked little league game to play um
07:08 - and so uh that's what i was doing and so
07:12 - but it's i'm actually in a very good
07:14 - mood
07:16 - i'm very tired my brain is barely
07:18 - functioning
07:20 - before i forget let me please thank
07:22 - today's sponsor of the coding train
07:27 - no wrong button there he is
07:30 - brilliant uh brilliant oh
07:33 - that is a website for when you have when
07:35 - you're well rested and feeling ready to
07:37 - learn
07:38 - you can go there and try a lot of
07:40 - interactive exercises
07:42 - they have all these courses in uh so
07:44 - many things related to the kinds of
07:46 - things that i love
07:47 - and try to write code examples around
07:48 - here in the coding train from
07:50 - geometry to maths to neural networks to
07:52 - computer science to algorithms
07:54 - all that kind of good stuff so i
07:56 - definitely encourage you to meow meow
07:57 - there's a new
07:58 - new design new look new set of
08:00 - illustrations on the website
08:02 - check out brilliant.org codingtrain you
08:04 - can sign up there for free
08:06 - um and let's if you go through that link
08:08 - it lets them know that you found it the
08:09 - coding train and then if you would like
08:10 - to unlock
08:10 - all of their content um you uh the first
08:13 - 200 people to do so will get a 20
08:15 - discount off the premium subscription
08:18 - back to my camera here um
08:23 - let's see let i'm looking over here at
08:26 - my monitor and i think i am
08:28 - positively glowing there is a little bit
08:30 - of an issue with
08:31 - the uh key uh it just my green screen is
08:34 - like uh the camera's a little bit wonky
08:36 - but
08:36 - let's see let's do let's run a little
08:38 - test here i got these new uh
08:40 - lights um elgato not a sponsor but hey
08:44 - i'm very available um let's see done
08:47 - here
08:48 - i'm in my elgato control center on my
08:51 - phone
08:52 - and any moment now
08:55 - um the control panel for these lights
08:58 - should pop up they're connected to my
09:00 - wi-fi network
09:00 - i literally set this up within the last
09:03 - five minutes ah there we go
09:04 - so i should be able to i've got a key
09:06 - light over here
09:08 - i'm going to press a button it is now
09:09 - off i have a key light air over here
09:12 - i'm going to press a button it is now
09:13 - off look i'm in the dark full of noise
09:16 - my face it is not showing its true
09:19 - beauty
09:21 - now i will turn this light back on and
09:23 - this light back on
09:25 - and uh let's just i'm just curious here
09:28 - this is like an eye
09:29 - test i'm gonna make i'm gonna go all
09:32 - full brightness
09:33 - oh no that's the color temperature full
09:36 - brightness
09:37 - full brightness no that's the color
09:39 - temperature full brightness
09:41 - let's go to 55 000 lumens or k
09:45 - or whatever the stuff means i don't even
09:46 - know
09:48 - 5 000 how do i look too bright
09:51 - too oh too bright let's go back down so
09:53 - anyway i uh could use uh consultant here
09:56 - to help me figure out how to sort of
09:58 - optimally get these lights going but i
10:00 - think this is going to be a big
10:01 - improvement
10:02 - um you know i realized that the
10:03 - placement might not be ideal i am
10:05 - wearing a baseball cap
10:06 - because no one wants to see my hair
10:09 - right now
10:10 - it's bad one of the nice things about
10:14 - live streaming from home
10:15 - from your own attic nobody knows if you
10:19 - showered or not
10:20 - i might have showered sometime in the
10:23 - last week
10:24 - possibly more than once i don't know
10:26 - it's all a big blur
10:28 - i slept also there were some times when
10:30 - i slept there were many times where i'm
10:32 - just like
10:33 - refreshing various browser tabs i'm
10:36 - going to take a deep breath i hope
10:37 - everybody has been taking care of
10:38 - themselves and doing well this week
10:40 - um that you're having a nice weekend it
10:42 - is i'm i'm in brooklyn new york and boy
10:44 - is it a gorgeous day outside i spent the
10:47 - entire day outside
10:49 - until um just now i do have a fan
10:52 - running i think i might turn that off
10:54 - because it's a little noisy for the
10:55 - microphone
10:58 - oh that's turning it higher there's got
11:01 - to be a way to turn this off there we go
11:03 - the fan is now awesome there should be a
11:04 - little less noise microphone should be a
11:06 - little clearer i also am getting a new
11:08 - microphone
11:09 - so soon enough this will no longer be my
11:11 - microphone
11:12 - that's exciting stuff all right what do
11:14 - i have to do
11:15 - today
11:19 - i have to blow the train whistle i have
11:21 - to say thank you to the members
11:24 - through the youtube membership program
11:25 - thing of the coding train it's actually
11:27 - the fact that a lot of people have
11:29 - recently been joining at least
11:31 - in my relative scale um that i felt
11:33 - confident to acquire some new lights
11:36 - to try to make things uh look a little
11:37 - nicer so cheers to you
11:39 - i don't have a really strong plan for
11:42 - today
11:42 - um i do want to read some random numbers
11:45 - i know that unoriginal pun who woke up
11:47 - apparently at 5 30 on a sunday it's
11:50 - still saturday where i am
11:52 - you are coming to me from the future
11:53 - that's very exciting to me
11:55 - has not received their random number yet
11:57 - so i will have to
11:59 - provide an original pun with a random
12:00 - number uh
12:02 - and then i have a lot of news
12:06 - coding train
12:10 - breaking news from the coding trade news
12:12 - desk
12:13 - oh no no no no not that kind of news
12:16 - although that was a lot of news
12:17 - a lot of news
12:25 - my breaking news is there's a new
12:26 - version of ml5js
12:28 - kind of a little bit of a soft release i
12:30 - can't remember if the medium post went
12:31 - up yet or not
12:32 - but um 0.6.0 is there some new stuff in
12:35 - ml5.js i want to take a look at that
12:36 - today
12:37 - i have been working on a new set of
12:39 - video tutorials
12:40 - uh related to convolutional neural
12:42 - networks in ml5.js and
12:44 - maybe i'll look at some of the examples
12:46 - i've been working on for those
12:48 - everything's taking me a really long
12:49 - time these days so apologies for not a
12:51 - lot of new
12:52 - sequence tutorial content that's come
12:54 - out um but
12:56 - there are three how to make your own
12:58 - discord bot videos just
12:59 - waiting they're actually on the channel
13:01 - you can find them right now but
13:03 - i have to like flip a couple switches
13:04 - turn a couple keys press a few more
13:06 - buttons
13:07 - and they'll be available for you to
13:08 - watch they're right now sitting at
13:09 - members only
13:10 - i'm still finishing up the captions for
13:12 - one of them and a few minor details
13:14 - so those will be happening
13:18 - uh i don't know i might just release one
13:21 - of them right after i finish live
13:22 - streaming which will be at around
13:24 - 5 30 p.m today
13:30 - i'm trying to speak slowly and calmly
13:34 - today
13:35 - i was a little bit too crazy i think
13:37 - last week on halloween to be frank
13:39 - so maybe today i'll be a little a little
13:40 - more of the usual regular
13:43 - everyday coding train choo choo
13:47 - ah the other thing's on my mind i have
13:49 - been working with runway ml
13:51 - um and trying to uh and creating a new
13:54 - template on glitch for you to use hosted
13:57 - machine learning models with runway ml
13:59 - as well as hide your api keys in a emv
14:02 - file using glitch
14:03 - so much stuff that's something that i've
14:05 - been sort of putting together i would
14:06 - like to show you that
14:07 - i hope someone's keeping track of this
14:08 - list because i'm not just making it up
14:10 - as i go
14:12 - i think what i'm actually going to start
14:13 - with is i need to update the http
14:16 - requests library for processing that's
14:17 - gonna possibly be the most
14:19 - one of the more boring things i've ever
14:20 - done in the live stream uh
14:22 - you could turn it off now come back a
14:24 - few hours i won't still be here but i'll
14:26 - probably still be trying to figure out
14:27 - how ant works again
14:29 - an eclipse
14:32 - so that i've got to work on and so i
14:36 - started ml5
14:39 - processing and community contributions
14:42 - by the last message in the discord
14:44 - is from bruno it just says the lights
14:45 - look great and every time i look over i
14:47 - see that message
14:48 - the lights look great and i think ah the
14:50 - lights look great i feel like maybe i
14:52 - turn them up too bright are they too
14:53 - bright do i need to make them warmer
14:55 - cooler i don't know i don't know i don't
14:58 - know
15:00 - all right um what is going on
15:03 - now let me move over to my fancy laptop
15:07 - computer machine
15:08 - thank you again to brilliant as the
15:10 - sponsor of today's live stream look
15:12 - look at the key i feel like with these
15:14 - new lights the green screen key is like
15:16 - well it's not flawless oh thank you
15:20 - simon
15:21 - the live poll that's actually very high
15:24 - primarily up on my list
15:28 - something i don't know if you can hear
15:29 - it when my children start to get loud
15:31 - can you hear them they're downstairs i
15:33 - can hear them very clearly but i don't
15:34 - think it makes its way into this
15:38 - microphone
15:40 - computec is asking about discord bot
15:43 - with discord.js
15:44 - let's just have a look-see here
15:51 - my computer's not working how do i open
15:53 - up a web browser
15:54 - there's a web browser uh let me move
15:57 - over here
15:59 - um we move this here so we see our nice
16:01 - masked sun
16:02 - i'm gonna go to thecodingtrain.com brand
16:04 - new on the coding train
16:06 - whoa ah well first of all no that's not
16:09 - brand new
16:13 - breaking news here on the coding train
16:15 - news desk
16:16 - i've got something i know there's
16:19 - nothing in my ear i
16:20 - i'm pressing there is there's this in my
16:22 - ear but no
16:23 - no i don't have a producer can't do math
16:26 - check the map producer talking to me
16:29 - news stuff just me
16:30 - just me here uh more no learning
16:33 - discord bot so the first two are
16:36 - actually right here and one of the
16:37 - things i'm excited to share with you
16:39 - is this new uh thumbnail design there is
16:41 - a new coding trained character
16:43 - choo choo the bot there's a little bit
16:45 - of a problem with the choo choo bot name
16:47 - which is there's actually on twitter
16:49 - there is a wonderful uh twitter bot
16:51 - called choo choo bot already
16:53 - uh which um tweets uh just little
16:57 - uh random uh emoji train themes
17:01 - i'm just the only thing that i'm sad
17:03 - about this because it's like the
17:04 - greatest thing ever
17:05 - is that i didn't make it myself so maybe
17:07 - i shouldn't be using the choo choo bot
17:08 - name
17:09 - but certainly on twitter this is choo
17:10 - choo bot but my discord bot is choo choo
17:12 - bot
17:13 - so again i will maybe flip the switch to
17:15 - these after the live stream today to
17:17 - make them public
17:18 - but um if you are a member they're
17:20 - available and they're coming and the
17:21 - third one
17:22 - should be you know tomorrow monday
17:23 - tuesday the third one we're actually
17:25 - start getting
17:25 - and writing code that will be available
17:28 - okay
17:30 - um
17:33 - now let's begin
17:38 - let's begin with our ceremonial reading
17:41 - of the random numbers
17:48 - find my book
17:53 - unoriginal pun it's time
17:58 - it's time to find you a random number oh
18:01 - this is a really interesting one it's
18:02 - where my eye was drawn to
18:04 - immediately it's on page 97 it is
18:09 - row 4815 column
18:17 - column seven and it is the random number
18:22 - three thousand four hundred all right
18:25 - that is unoriginal puns new random
18:27 - number
18:28 - now let me find where i last left off
18:32 - in our book story time here on the
18:35 - coding train
18:36 - um i believe it is here
18:41 - it was halloween oh it was
18:44 - last week exactly
18:47 - seven years ago on october 31
18:51 - 2020 row 12 column 15. that's right
18:56 - i'm just still here on the first page
18:59 - just on the first page of this book this
19:02 - whole book
19:03 - i don't know i'm not gonna am i ever
19:05 - gonna get to the second page
19:07 - obviously not if i keep talking like
19:08 - this
19:10 - row twelve column five
19:16 - seventy thousand seventy eight eighteen
19:20 - thousand four hundred and seventy five
19:23 - forty thousand six hundred and ten
19:26 - sixty eight thousand seven hundred and
19:28 - eleven
19:29 - seventy seven thousand eight hundred and
19:31 - seventeen
19:33 - eighty eight thousand six hundred and
19:35 - eighty five
19:37 - forty thousand two hundred
19:40 - eighty six thousand five hundred and
19:42 - seven
19:44 - fifty eight thousand four hundred and
19:46 - one
19:48 - thirty six thousand seven hundred and
19:50 - sixty six
19:52 - 67 951
19:57 - 90 364.
20:01 - 74 493
20:05 - nine thousand six hundred and nine
20:09 - eleven thousand and sixty two
20:12 - ninety nine thousand five hundred and
20:15 - ninety four
20:17 - sixty seven thousand 348.
20:27 - just in case you thought that this was
20:29 - something that you might be watching
20:31 - with any actual
20:33 - useful content just wanted to make it
20:36 - clear
20:37 - this is the vibe okay it's a mood
20:41 - that's that's what that's what people
20:43 - say these days the kids that's they are
20:45 - called
20:47 - what was the last number i read 99 817
20:50 - no no no no no wait where was i wrote 12
20:53 - column five
20:54 - no i think i got to 67 348 so i think
20:57 - i'm on row 14
20:59 - column two row 14
21:02 - column 2.
21:06 - uh next random number
21:10 - row 14 column 2. so in case you're
21:14 - wondering what is this over here this is
21:16 - the
21:17 - coding train discord it is where the
21:20 - community comes together
21:22 - to chat with each other about all sorts
21:24 - of things
21:25 - um and i encourage you to join you can
21:28 - actually join by going to
21:30 - thecodingtrain.com discord or i just
21:33 - press the button and the uh a direct
21:35 - link to the uh discord invite should
21:36 - show up in the chat as well
21:38 - so please come on and join the water is
21:40 - warm
21:42 - and fuzzy there are random numbers to be
21:45 - had
21:46 - there is code to explore
21:49 - it is what it is
21:55 - all right now let's look at some
21:58 - community contributions
21:59 - one of the things that the coding train
22:01 - discord bot
22:02 - created by this stream chat to stream
22:04 - chatbot thing
22:05 - is i could say exclamation point wheel
22:08 - and it will take me to
22:09 - the uh community the wheel of community
22:13 - contributions which we will now do
22:16 - on the first segment of the coding train
22:18 - here live i will take a look through let
22:20 - me refresh this page
22:22 - uh i will take a look through this wheel
22:24 - of community contributions
22:26 - and i will spin that wheel like this
22:32 - and wherever it lands we'll take a look
22:34 - it's something that somebody made from
22:36 - the coding train
22:38 - it's usually by david snyder
22:41 - it has been submitted to the coding
22:43 - terrain website uh for every video and
22:45 - challenge and example there's a place
22:47 - where you can make your own version of
22:48 - it and submit it
22:49 - this one is called amplitude frequency
22:52 - phase
22:56 - and i shall uh click on it and view it
23:00 - and this one is uh ah based off the
23:02 - fourier
23:03 - series coding challenge and it is
23:05 - contributed by abdul halig
23:08 - abdul thank you for participating in
23:11 - this thing that we do where we like to
23:12 - try to be creative and make stuff with
23:14 - our code and share it with each other
23:16 - um and i'm so excited that yours was
23:18 - picked just now for me to get to look at
23:19 - experience so i am going to click on
23:22 - that and go over it looks like it was
23:23 - made in the
23:25 - whoa oh my goodness this is really cool
23:28 - this is awesome all right so this looks
23:30 - like it is
23:31 - the fourier a fourier series
23:35 - that is approximating a square wave
23:38 - um this is covered you know extensively
23:40 - in the particular video that i made on
23:42 - the subject
23:43 - but it looks like what abdul has added
23:46 - is an ability to alter
23:50 - the visualization based on a set of
23:53 - parameters and properties so i i'm gonna
23:55 - have to sort of speculate and wonder
23:56 - like what
23:57 - is this even let me minimize uh discord
24:00 - here it is
24:01 - kind of in the way um so this must be
24:04 - one of these must be period or frequency
24:07 - or offset or something like that
24:09 - i don't know what the zero is and then
24:11 - there's some like
24:12 - sliders here one thing that i can kind
24:14 - of make sense of
24:15 - is square versus soft tooth versus
24:18 - phased
24:19 - square so let's just look at that here's
24:21 - a
24:22 - approximation of a sawtooth wave uh
24:25 - which looks more like this
24:27 - diagonal pattern coming up and going
24:28 - down oh i loved how it just kind of like
24:31 - stopped there for a moment why why why
24:35 - must i get
24:38 - notifications on my wrist while i'm live
24:41 - streaming all right that's a sawtooth
24:42 - wave
24:43 - let's look at the phased square wave
24:46 - what's a phase square wave versus a
24:48 - square wave
24:52 - it looks like the top and bottom sort of
24:54 - peaks and valleys of the wave
24:56 - have its own kind of
24:59 - variable oscillation to them let's go
25:01 - back to square
25:02 - and see if we can understand what these
25:03 - sliders do
25:05 - so this is um ah this must be the number
25:09 - of sort of
25:10 - iterations uh that uh that are
25:14 - used to approximate the wave so we can
25:15 - see it is much more square
25:17 - let's move this back down to like a sort
25:19 - of middle point
25:22 - um now let me take a look at what this
25:24 - slider might do
25:26 - zooming in and out it looks like or no
25:29 - just increasing the amplitude it's not
25:30 - zooming
25:31 - it's uh it's i think it's just altering
25:33 - the amplitude i'm not sure why i'm
25:35 - yeah because as the amplitude grows the
25:37 - radius of this
25:38 - first what are these called epicycles
25:41 - circular
25:42 - loops rotational patterns whatever the
25:45 - word might be
25:46 - i need more camera space for my arms i'm
25:48 - really in this tiny little box here
25:50 - i want to be able to gesture further up
25:53 - but i can't
25:54 - someday i'll i'll figure that out
25:57 - uh my other setup where i record the
25:59 - tutorials i have so much more green
26:00 - screen space to work with than
26:02 - here in my attic um
26:05 - now so that's cool to see let's put this
26:07 - on let's see what this one is
26:10 - and this is the um well certainly the
26:13 - period or the frequency of the wave the
26:15 - period being
26:17 - i always get this wrong the period is
26:19 - the amount of
26:20 - time it takes for one full
26:23 - cycle of the wave and the frequency is
26:26 - the number of cycles of the wave
26:29 - through one unit of time so they're in
26:31 - there the frequency is the inverse of
26:33 - the period
26:34 - um this is wonderful thank you for this
26:36 - excellent work i love to this is what i
26:38 - really like to one of the things i
26:39 - really like to see with my coding
26:40 - challenges
26:41 - is i'm usually like sort of rushing to
26:42 - just get something working up on the
26:44 - screen
26:45 - and i'm hard coding in various
26:46 - parameters and variables and
26:48 - thinking about how you might
26:49 - thoughtfully create an interface to
26:52 - alter the different parameters of a
26:54 - system really allow
26:56 - other people to explore the algorithm
26:59 - the generative process more deeply and
27:02 - so i think this is a really excellent
27:03 - example of that
27:04 - i might suggest if i may be so bold here
27:07 - is the uh
27:08 - moment of critique the constructive
27:10 - positive the compliment sandwich if you
27:12 - will because i think this is wonderful
27:15 - and i'm just gonna say it's wonderful
27:17 - again in a moment and here's what i
27:18 - might suggest abdul
27:19 - is that for me looking at this um i need
27:22 - a little bit more hand holding so i
27:24 - would love some labels to know
27:25 - what these various sliders do uh
27:27 - something that could be an interesting
27:29 - thing to think about
27:29 - are there like are there some presets
27:32 - that i that are sort of known
27:34 - presets that would allow me to sort of
27:36 - quickly see
27:37 - how different parameters might uh lead
27:40 - to specific kinds of results
27:42 - um but this is uh wonderful i i really
27:45 - love it
27:48 - all right so thank you abdul a big
27:52 - ring the bell for you and we will move
27:54 - on to look at
27:56 - another community
28:00 - contribution we are spinning that wheel
28:02 - and we are landing on
28:14 - chin scratch emoji
28:17 - editable ah editable
28:21 - this whole time i'm looking at that
28:23 - thinking
28:24 - what does it mean for the game of life
28:27 - to be edible
28:32 - this is gonna take me a minute
28:35 - the animals don't need the game of life
28:38 - don't eat me game of life no no
28:40 - editable i think i have a sense of what
28:42 - that means let's take a look at the
28:44 - editable
28:45 - editable game of life by
28:48 - uh kobe uh
28:51 - kobe a frequent contributor uh and help
28:55 - maintainer manager person of
29:00 - the coding trained discord created this
29:02 - editable
29:03 - game of life and i'm also noting in the
29:05 - chat here that
29:06 - uh k weekman pointed out that it is
29:09 - nanowrimo
29:10 - that is relevant for coding terrain i
29:12 - knew that and i sort of forgot about
29:14 - that
29:15 - i would love to touch on that or talk
29:17 - about that
29:18 - um in a little bit okay yes yes yes
29:22 - by the way now you know what you have to
29:25 - do this weekend program your own edible
29:27 - game of life
29:28 - maybe oh you could wouldn't it be nice
29:30 - if i ever have another birthday which
29:32 - presumably i will
29:34 - i want a game of life cake it just has
29:37 - like a game of life pattern
29:38 - so if i don't really like cake maybe you
29:40 - could make me a nice like sort of vegan
29:43 - carrot cake not too much sugar
29:47 - high in you know you use some whole
29:49 - wheat flour maybe it's kind of my speed
29:54 - now back to the game of life again
29:57 - uh editable game of life let's take a
30:00 - look at this
30:00 - so i'm going to assume here that what
30:02 - the idea of it being editable
30:05 - it's kind of like when i have the
30:07 - metaballs coding challenge that i just
30:09 - couldn't stop seeing it as meatballs
30:13 - maybe i have like i ate a very large
30:15 - meal
30:16 - at like 2 30 which is one of the reasons
30:18 - why i had to push this back because i
30:19 - hadn't eaten all day so i'm not hungry
30:22 - i'm sleepy i'm very sleepy and i'm
30:25 - surprised how many words are able to
30:26 - come out of my mouth in sequence based
30:28 - on how sleepy i am
30:33 - um but let's click around and let's edit
30:37 - this game of life
30:38 - so now what i'm wondering is
30:41 - am i not seeing ah okay
30:44 - let's shrink it here so what i was
30:47 - looking for
30:48 - is when is it going to activate so i can
30:51 - create my own
30:53 - pattern by clicking on these
30:56 - and what does this slider do
30:59 - maybe that's like a speed once i play it
31:01 - but it's not actually
31:03 - going from generation to generation so
31:06 - maybe
31:06 - the game of life is unfamiliar to you
31:08 - first of all um the game of life was
31:11 - invented by
31:11 - john conway who passed away um this year
31:14 - um
31:15 - from complications with the coronavirus
31:17 - which is um very sad uh john conway i
31:19 - think he was
31:20 - i don't know if he it was had reached 90
31:22 - years old but he was i believe
31:24 - in his 80s very well known mathematician
31:26 - who pioneered a lot of things famously
31:28 - hated maybe that's not the right words
31:30 - to use but
31:31 - famously sort of um was maybe frustrated
31:35 - with
31:36 - people's interpretations of the game of
31:38 - life might be the right way to
31:39 - characterize it
31:40 - uh maybe some of you could provide some
31:42 - resources or writings about uh
31:44 - his thoughts on the game of life in the
31:45 - chat i'm i'm uh um i don't wanna i don't
31:48 - wanna
31:48 - uh mischaracterize his actual opinion on
31:51 - it but
31:51 - it is a system that i really fell in
31:53 - love with as one of the first
31:55 - generative systems that i learned about
31:56 - it is a grid
31:58 - of cells every cell has a state on or
32:01 - off
32:02 - as visualized by black or white and the
32:04 - next state is a function of its
32:06 - neighboring states
32:08 - um so let's see what happens with this
32:10 - particular configuration i'm going to
32:11 - hit play
32:13 - and i'm guessing that this is the speed
32:16 - because if i ramp this up it's going to
32:17 - go faster now
32:19 - this does not look like the game of life
32:21 - to me
32:23 - this distinct i don't know if kobe or
32:25 - saint plays 82
32:27 - simon said he died at the age of 82. um
32:31 - this does not at all look like what the
32:33 - game of life looks like to me it is i
32:34 - wonder if this is also
32:36 - a variation on the algorithm itself um
32:39 - so i would i don't uh kobe is often i
32:42 - know kobe is on a different time zone so
32:44 - i wouldn't be surprised
32:46 - i don't i don't know who any of you are
32:47 - who are watching this right now
32:49 - at 5 30 a.m or 3 a.m but please make
32:52 - sure you're taking
32:52 - self-care getting some rest i will live
32:56 - stream with other times in the future
32:58 - mostly i'm just wasting time here
32:59 - reading random numbers so
33:01 - you're not missing anything but um
33:04 - if kobe does show up or if anybody knows
33:07 - uh further context this looks quite
33:08 - different which is one of the things
33:11 - to ring the bell about one of the
33:13 - reasons why i love
33:14 - systems like the game of life and
33:15 - teaching about those systems
33:17 - is not because well reproducing the game
33:20 - of life as
33:21 - its original rules is a moment of wonder
33:24 - and happiness that can be for you
33:27 - um but
33:30 - um what might might find even more
33:32 - thrilling is to
33:33 - invent your own game of life so to speak
33:35 - so what kind of rules can you develop uh
33:37 - create
33:38 - makeup um and i encourage you to do so
33:41 - and i'm getting
33:42 - uh some breaking news in my ear here
33:46 - uh this was a sketch created in
33:49 - a voice chat um yeah so i think this
33:53 - that's what simon was telling me there
33:55 - was a voice chat where this sketch was
33:56 - created okay
33:59 - how about one more it's four o'clock
34:01 - everybody feeling
34:02 - good about one more community
34:03 - contribution because
34:06 - i am here because of you
34:10 - the coding trade community you keep me
34:13 - going you
34:13 - and sanka
34:17 - is that still a thing can you get sanka
34:23 - i like to drink beverages with caffeine
34:26 - in them
34:27 - when i'm very tired and haven't slept
34:28 - all week because
34:30 - one week sometimes lasts a month or a
34:33 - year
34:34 - and that's how this week has been
34:37 - and how the last
34:40 - several months have been the last year
34:42 - has been the last several years have
34:43 - been
34:46 - we're doing another community
34:47 - contribution
34:53 - uh how do i get out of this close whoa
34:57 - and we're gonna spin this wheel
35:02 - by the way in this room is an actual
35:05 - drum kit my son plays the drums he's
35:07 - been playing on an electronic drum kit
35:09 - for the longest time
35:10 - and a friend was moving and giving away
35:14 - their drum kit
35:14 - so now we have a drum kit i do not play
35:16 - the drums but if i could get it set up
35:18 - over here i could try to do my own drum
35:20 - roll all right where do we land
35:21 - troll sweeper now i'm pretty sure
35:25 - that these have been vetted one of the
35:27 - reasons why i can use this wheel
35:30 - is because of the vetting process the
35:31 - community contributions
35:33 - they actually went through two processes
35:35 - one is they were merged
35:36 - as a pull request into the coding train
35:39 - so there was a
35:40 - process of checking them then and then
35:42 - actually these are separately being
35:43 - pulled from a spreadsheet although
35:45 - fun planet if that's the right uh viewer
35:48 - name
35:48 - created this api to all the challenges
35:50 - and so if you are interested in
35:52 - contributing and working on this
35:54 - it is a project that is a community
35:56 - driven and lead project to create this
35:58 - wheel of contributions
35:59 - but let's take a look at troll sweeper
36:01 - no trolls were harmed i assume
36:04 - in the creation of the troll sweeper
36:06 - this was made by klaus klaus
36:08 - class class if you're in the if you're
36:10 - watching today
36:11 - or if anybody happens to know class or
36:13 - know that name how to pronounce it
36:14 - correctly please let me know
36:16 - gil and the original challenge is
36:18 - minesweeper
36:20 - so minesweeper is a game much like the
36:23 - game of life
36:24 - that operates on a grid uh cells can
36:27 - have um
36:28 - i think i made it b sweeper because you
36:30 - know i'm a
36:31 - kind of non-violent pacifist kind of
36:34 - person and i didn't want to sort of
36:36 - think about bombs blowing up on a grid
36:38 - so
36:38 - i called it b sweeper i think but the
36:40 - original game is about mines and you're
36:42 - trying to find the mines or avoid the
36:43 - mines
36:44 - etcetera etcetera let's take a look at
36:45 - troll sweeper
36:47 - and use shift plus
36:50 - mouse click to flag a troll r to restart
36:55 - okay let's see if i can play and win
36:58 - this game
36:59 - there are 12 of them somewhere
37:02 - okay so i can do shift mouse click to
37:05 - flag one there oh this is just
37:07 - this is flag sweeper there's definitely
37:09 - one there right
37:10 - there's one there and there can't be one
37:12 - here then
37:14 - and there can't be one here then and
37:15 - then there can't be one here here
37:17 - can't be one here or here there has to
37:19 - be one here
37:21 - i know how to play this game
37:25 - this is very scary what if i get it
37:26 - wrong
37:30 - and now we see the trolls i did i did it
37:33 - on purpose
37:34 - i don't know if you noticed i could play
37:37 - again this is fun
37:38 - actually i really like about this um is
37:41 - that sort of moment of surprise
37:43 - when the trolls all appear i think that
37:46 - one of the things i
37:47 - i often wonder about creative coding
37:50 - interactive systems
37:51 - and it might sound corny to say this but
37:53 - you i would suspect that most of you had
37:56 - the experience of
37:57 - watching a film or listening to a piece
38:00 - of music
38:01 - where you had you know really strong
38:03 - feelings whether fear or love or sadness
38:06 - um and can you create those kinds of
38:08 - feelings from interactive systems
38:10 - and i would say here a little shock
38:11 - surprise little moment there
38:14 - when i saw those trolls appear so great
38:16 - work um
38:18 - you know i i would be interesting to
38:20 - think about i mean this is a sort of
38:22 - tried and true game but are there other
38:24 - kinds of variations about how the grid
38:26 - is organized
38:28 - what kind of multiple kinds of
38:29 - characters there could be that you want
38:31 - to find or don't want
38:32 - to find what other kinds of interactions
38:35 - might you consider beyond just
38:36 - mouse clicks could you build this as a
38:38 - physical device
38:39 - i think a lot of possibilities of things
38:41 - you could think about with
38:42 - projects like this okay
38:46 - now i think that's good for our
38:49 - community contributions today
38:51 - i am a
38:55 - happy boy i don't know this song from
38:58 - wherever i download this
38:59 - royalty few music it's called happy boy
39:01 - theme so
39:03 - i'm gonna move on
39:06 - and i think
39:10 - i think i've got to take a look at the
39:11 - live poll
39:13 - because um i don't want to let that
39:15 - project
39:16 - just linger and go nowhere and once we
39:19 - have it really working i think it'll be
39:21 - a very exciting thing to
39:23 - use on the coding train where i can very
39:25 - quickly put up a live poll
39:27 - and have people interact with it and
39:28 - sort of see results
39:30 - live on the screen so let's go take a
39:31 - look at that
39:33 - so for the next little bit i will be
39:36 - taking a look at your
39:38 - issues and pull requests related to the
39:41 - live
39:42 - poll application this is definitely a
39:44 - maintenance day on the coding train i
39:46 - don't particularly want to
39:47 - uh start anything new or look at
39:49 - anything uh new
39:50 - um and mostly i just want to like kind
39:52 - of keep some things up to date
39:54 - and work on a few things that i'm a
39:56 - little bit behind on
39:57 - um so
40:00 - let's see here
40:10 - there are 13 pull requests 13. how many
40:14 - get through 13 pull requests
40:18 - okay let's take a look we'll go in
40:20 - reverse time order
40:22 - and uh take a look here at this pull
40:26 - request from drc let's actually run the
40:28 - live poll
40:29 - just so i can sort of see where it is so
40:31 - what is the live poll
40:32 - application the idea of the live poll is
40:36 - to create a
40:37 - web application where i can quickly spin
40:39 - up a
40:40 - question which has multiple answers
40:43 - people can
40:44 - answer them in real time and using a
40:47 - view of that poll and an overlay in open
40:49 - broadcast studio
40:50 - i'll be able to see the results in real
40:52 - time um as an overlay onto my camera
40:55 - feed here
40:56 - and i'm sure this already exists and i
40:58 - could just use some software to do it
41:00 - but we're trying i'm trying to make my
41:02 - own coding train i'm you know when i say
41:03 - i
41:04 - am trying to help facilitate a coding
41:06 - train one
41:07 - being made um so i'm pretty sure that i
41:09 - have this on the desktop still
41:12 - uh here let's go to the main
41:17 - branch let's just kind of like grab
41:20 - whatever
41:21 - was there from last time uh let's open
41:24 - it up with
41:24 - visual studio code
41:29 - and see what i've got going here
41:32 - and um let's run it
41:37 - let's go to port 3000
41:40 - and see there we go so this is
41:44 - the poll uh it is both
41:48 - it needs a lot of work um it is both the
41:52 - um the results of the poll
41:55 - and the interface for voting all in one
41:59 - so presumably if i click a and hit
42:02 - vote many times
42:10 - oh my goodness there's already been so
42:12 - so many votes
42:13 - and now i'm gonna go in this i'm gonna
42:15 - freak out i'm going to database db and i
42:17 - forget that i'm using this crazy
42:18 - database thing that doesn't delete the
42:19 - old records
42:21 - okay well
42:26 - i don't know about you but i'm feeling
42:28 - very stressed out right now so that's
42:30 - the idea let's go take a look at what
42:32 - sort of uh pull requests we've got going
42:34 - on here
42:35 - um this is from october 4th wow over a
42:38 - month ago
42:38 - apologies to drc um and thank you
42:42 - um let's take a look here and by the way
42:43 - the um
42:45 - de pam sen i believe is the github user
42:47 - who created the coding train
42:48 - um api so um
42:52 - i figured i would improve on the rest
42:53 - endpoints to use destructuring for the
42:55 - request parameters
42:56 - and update the database call to
42:58 - increment on update rather than
42:59 - searching and updating
43:00 - so this all sounds like a good idea
43:06 - and there's some discussion here how am
43:08 - i really this is hard to do live
43:11 - um okay
43:14 - i really like the new database calls but
43:15 - there are some other changes oh i wrote
43:17 - this
43:18 - 28 days ago resolve the conflicts okay
43:22 - this is how i review pull requests on
43:24 - the coding trade scan over it
43:26 - the button is green which means i can
43:29 - merge it
43:31 - do you hear the haunt the horns honking
43:33 - horns honking all day long
43:34 - cheering loudly in brooklyn is wonderful
43:37 - um
43:38 - so i'm going to click uh merge pull
43:40 - requests
43:41 - um here yeah that's this
43:45 - got sidetracked um this is how i like to
43:47 - do things
43:49 - i don't necessarily recommend this is
43:50 - how you maintain your open source
43:52 - projects
43:53 - it works for me merge pull request and
43:57 - let's just make sure um things work
44:00 - still i will grab
44:03 - the new uh uh
44:07 - the changes oh
44:10 - what i have changes why do i have
44:13 - changes
44:17 - something sad happened i don't i feel
44:19 - like my changes are meaningless
44:21 - i'm going to stash
44:24 - oh i was supposed to i could have
44:25 - squashed it yeah well let's let's go to
44:27 - squash a different one i always like to
44:29 - squash my pull requests and
44:32 - it's very important to not hold any
44:34 - grudges
44:35 - to to be kind and squash those pull
44:39 - requests
44:39 - okay get pull origin mean okay i've got
44:41 - those changes in
44:42 - now let's run it again
44:46 - uh refresh the page looks the same
44:50 - could i clear the database totally i
44:52 - won't do that yet let's keep going
44:53 - through the progress so i think that if
44:55 - i recall correctly
44:56 - um that was a pull request that just
44:58 - cleaned up the code a little bit and
44:59 - used object destructuring which is a way
45:02 - of
45:03 - setting varia or taking an object apart
45:05 - and putting it into individual variables
45:07 - which is very convenient to do in
45:08 - javascript
45:09 - moving along the twitter library is a
45:12 - thing that i need to work on too
45:14 - uh pull requests we're down to 12.
45:19 - okay so now we're going to go back to
45:21 - pull requests
45:23 - and let's go to add a simple oh right
45:25 - now i remember we discussed this
45:28 - so i think this i'm going to hold off on
45:31 - i think i would like to try a different
45:33 - database for this project
45:36 - and so maybe i will let this happen in
45:40 - parallel
45:41 - i'm a little bit afraid to merge this in
45:42 - right now because i'm not super familiar
45:44 - with sqlite
45:45 - and we will we will come back to that
45:48 - one
45:49 - so let's go to pull request number
45:52 - 10 refactor to use a post request
45:58 - oh this is from simon you can create an
46:00 - interface but for now you can use a
46:02 - piece of software called
46:03 - insomnia to make post requests so this
46:06 - also i think is a nice
46:07 - a wonderful um
46:11 - excellent point to raise and discuss
46:15 - that uh i could use this sort of voting
46:18 - with a post request instead of a get
46:21 - request
46:22 - i think i might like to leave it as a
46:24 - get request right now
46:25 - i tend to use those when
46:30 - there is not sort of information that
46:32 - needs to be hidden that's being passed
46:34 - through the request
46:35 - and if the information is coming in in
46:37 - very very small bite-sized chunks
46:40 - so the id and the choice are i think can
46:43 - be
46:44 - sort of easily passed through the route
46:46 - i am open to hearing other points of
46:48 - view
46:48 - thank you simon for this i think um
46:50 - let's hold off on this one for right now
46:52 - and keep things simple with a get
46:54 - request
46:56 - so thank you
47:10 - and let's write a little note here um
47:14 - and um i always use my most used emoji
47:17 - of course is the sparkle heart
47:19 - because it's how i feel about all of you
47:21 - who are submitting pull requests
47:24 - and um there we go so now oh
47:28 - we got through another one i don't think
47:29 - i can ring the bell unless i merge it
47:30 - some small
47:31 - fixes um
47:35 - let's see oh there's some conflicts
47:36 - let's take a look at it first so one
47:38 - thing i might suggest
47:39 - um const 219 i haven't done my work
47:42 - here which is to set up the repository
47:45 - with a pull request template
47:47 - which would guide you through the kinds
47:48 - of things that i'm expecting to see
47:50 - in the description so i apologize that's
47:53 - my uh sort of failing on my end but i
47:56 - would say that a good practice is when
47:58 - you submit a pull request
47:59 - if you can write a little bit even
48:01 - introduce yourself um
48:02 - in the description of the pull request
48:03 - that's always helpful for the maintainer
48:05 - of an open source
48:06 - repo let's go look at files changed
48:09 - um oh editor config
48:12 - oh i love this i don't know what it is
48:14 - but i'm desperate to learn how this kind
48:16 - of stuff works
48:17 - because i think you can create these
48:19 - config files that
48:21 - basically control how your code editor
48:23 - works on a project by project basis
48:25 - so i'll keep that adding um
48:29 - dot env to get ignore that makes sense i
48:33 - don't have anything yet that i need to
48:35 - store in
48:36 - env but certainly if i did i would want
48:37 - to add that um and then requiring the
48:40 - env package i'm good with that uh name
48:43 - lowercase is supposed to be lowercase
48:45 - i'll take that these all look fine with
48:46 - me let's see what our
48:48 - merge conflicts are i have my merge
48:50 - conflict theme song which i don't really
48:51 - have but
48:53 - all right everybody it's time just like
48:57 - i like to squash those pull requests
48:59 - i like to resolve all my conflicts
49:05 - oh package.lock this i don't know what
49:08 - to do
49:09 - pause hold timeout
49:13 - uh oh po post i'm being told
49:17 - i'm being told that my point of view on
49:19 - post
49:20 - get and post is is not um the
49:23 - conventional wisdom
49:25 - uh post makes more semantic sense here
49:27 - because it's for sending data
49:29 - i understand i agree i'm probably i'm
49:31 - usually wrong in these cases
49:36 - i i optimize for
49:39 - readability and educational purposes
49:43 - and i think a get is much easier to work
49:45 - with on the client side
49:47 - uh than a post from whatever
49:50 - clients might ultimately want to connect
49:52 - to this live poll so for example let's
49:54 - say we wanted to
49:56 - build a raspberry pi an arduino with
49:58 - buttons to vote
49:59 - um by able to submit our vote through a
50:01 - get request we might make that
50:03 - a little bit easier uh to sort of manage
50:05 - and deal with
50:06 - i might be wrong still okay um
50:10 - i don't know what to do about this uh
50:12 - merge conflict in the package
50:14 - um i know i never understand what
50:18 - packaged lock is it has something to do
50:20 - with like versions and all that
50:21 - and dependencies i think if i just take
50:24 - this out
50:26 - and do this and do this
50:29 - and then that looks right now right did
50:33 - i fix it
50:35 - i mean is there something else i need to
50:38 - oh
50:40 - i think i did that right
50:44 - and i'm being told i'm being told a post
50:47 - is much
50:47 - easier so maybe my thinking is very
50:51 - flawed there
50:52 - i've always thought this way about
50:54 - teaching
50:55 - and in sort of the sort of creative
50:56 - coding rapid prototyping context
50:59 - um who knows if i got that package.lock
51:01 - right i understand
51:03 - i underst i understand what i'm doing i
51:05 - take all the risks and responsibility
51:07 - i'm here to merge
51:08 - to resolve my conflicts and squash and
51:11 - merge so what
51:13 - does squash and merge do if you have not
51:15 - heard of that before
51:16 - so first of all um the the original
51:19 - button is
51:19 - was just this merge pull request what
51:21 - that is doing
51:23 - is it's taking the changes from
51:26 - all of the various commits and here you
51:28 - can see there are
51:29 - one two three four commits and adding
51:31 - them to the history of the project
51:33 - and sometimes within open source
51:35 - projects it's advisable to take even if
51:37 - a given pull request has
51:39 - many different separate commits in them
51:41 - it can be
51:42 - uh useful to squash all of those into
51:44 - one commit
51:45 - so the project's actual history then has
51:48 - the
51:49 - all the change of the pull request
51:50 - within one um
51:52 - one commit and it it you don't actually
51:55 - lose you can still have multiple authors
51:56 - and differentiate these in
51:58 - in various ways it's a very
51:59 - sophisticated system but i do think that
52:01 - kind of does make sense i'll switch to
52:03 - squash
52:04 - and merge don't ask me to explain rebase
52:06 - and merge i'm not prepared for that
52:08 - today
52:08 - maybe another week squash and merge
52:11 - let's do that
52:14 - and now let's uh
52:20 - grab that so by the way the proper way
52:21 - for me to do this would be for me to
52:24 - pull that branch and test the branch
52:26 - locally
52:27 - and then merge or to actually have tests
52:30 - but for me i'm just sort of playfully
52:32 - enjoying this
52:34 - and um
52:37 - see and kind of just enjoying merging
52:39 - them and pulling them and we'll fix it
52:40 - somebody will fix it later this is all
52:42 - for our own i was going to say
52:45 - edification
52:49 - that's a callback um let's run it again
52:52 - oh no okay npm install
52:54 - so there was a new package.env my
52:57 - microphone is really i'm afraid to move
52:59 - the microphone
53:01 - and this is really insane what just
53:03 - happened because i don't know if you can
53:04 - see the light
53:05 - flashing you can see my arm
53:08 - because i just got a very very
53:10 - ridiculously generous super chat
53:14 - i it kind of makes me a little
53:15 - uncomfortable if i'm being perfectly
53:16 - honest
53:17 - uh thank you alexander sapphire i'll
53:19 - read your message uh four years ago i
53:21 - watched your first ever coding challenge
53:22 - video four years later i'm a software
53:24 - engineer
53:25 - consultant and stem evangelist who
53:27 - specializes in web technologies
53:29 - i owe you my career that's that that's
53:31 - got to be a little bit strong but i
53:33 - appreciate it
53:34 - for introducing me to js thank you for
53:36 - everything you do
53:37 - and a lot of heart emojis which of
53:39 - course
53:41 - by the way these kind of messages i uh
53:43 - really uh they do mean a lot to me to
53:45 - get them
53:46 - uh i i love to receive them uh without
53:48 - there's no need to provide
53:50 - a super chat or any kind of donation
53:53 - along with them you can always send them
53:54 - to daniel at thecodingtrain.com
53:56 - i do it takes me a long time to get to
53:58 - that email inbox
54:00 - but i do read all of the messages that
54:02 - come to there eventually you know within
54:04 - a few months my other email boxes are no
54:06 - better
54:07 - but um so please uh thank you for that
54:10 - message and the chat
54:11 - um i will um you have won
54:15 - you don't win anything i mean you've won
54:16 - your whoa camera oh
54:19 - oh no so i got a confession to make here
54:24 - and i apologize for this i installed my
54:27 - two
54:28 - elgato key lights hold on a second here
54:31 - we're gonna this is gonna be fun uh let
54:34 - me go to
54:36 - this
54:40 - uh and now i am just give me a second
54:42 - here everybody
54:44 - this is going to be worth it
54:50 - microphone's still going right okay
54:52 - whoops uh
54:54 - wrong camera here we go um so
54:57 - um this is me uh one of the one of the
54:59 - things that i love is oh
55:01 - you don't see that is this new uh way of
55:03 - just wirelessly
55:04 - getting a feed from my camera um into
55:07 - the live stream
55:07 - and you can see here that's one of the
55:09 - key lights that's the other key life
55:12 - i'll show you my like incredibly messy
55:14 - attic full of toys and various things
55:16 - and the
55:16 - sort of console that i'm looking at and
55:18 - laptop so here i am again um the camera
55:20 - that i use
55:21 - which is this camera here um i keep it
55:24 - plugged in but i thought
55:26 - i got to plug in these new lights i only
55:28 - have two plugs it's fully charged it'll
55:30 - last through a live stream
55:32 - i don't know whether it went to sleep
55:34 - like my cameras used to do all the time
55:35 - on the coding train
55:36 - if you were back from those days welcome
55:39 - again
55:39 - but um or if it actually the battery
55:41 - died so i am now uh walking around
55:45 - um i'm gonna take a look here and see
55:47 - whether it went to sleep or whether the
55:48 - battery actually died
55:51 - looks like it just went to sleep so i
55:53 - think unfortunately no battery exhausted
55:55 - look at that
55:57 - um oh it said uh let's see if we
56:01 - so it said by the way so this is my
56:02 - setup you can see now with a one light
56:05 - um and another light little behind the
56:06 - scenes here uh this is the camera view
56:08 - and battery exhausted
56:10 - so i will i think for the time being
56:13 - unplug one of my key lights to plug the
56:16 - camera back in
56:18 - i need another extension cord oh there's
56:20 - my knee hello everyone
56:22 - i think you're still seeing you probably
56:23 - can't barely hear me because the mic
56:24 - isn't coming through my phone
56:26 - far away now the camera is plugged back
56:30 - in um and it's quite a bit darker in
56:33 - here i probably should figure out how to
56:37 - oh i got dizzy stood up too fast
56:40 - um it should come it still says battery
56:44 - exhausted but it's plugged in now
56:47 - so you would think it's going to come
56:48 - back
56:53 - i guess what i'll do is it it is
56:56 - charging
56:57 - we can see there that it is charging
56:58 - that light's on so i think i'll turn it
57:01 - off
57:02 - and i will just give it um a few minutes
57:06 - um is it time for my break yet probably
57:08 - not
57:10 - this is kind of fun to stream this way i
57:11 - can just move this oops
57:15 - move this over here uh and i'll just put
57:18 - this here there we go all right while
57:21 - it's charging
57:23 - this is uh what was i doing the live
57:25 - poll
57:30 - i was thinking alexander i was going to
57:31 - give alexander
57:33 - a random number but you know what i
57:34 - wanted to say is that
57:37 - i do get messages like this you know oh
57:39 - thank you i got a job
57:40 - because of you or some things along
57:42 - those kind of lines and i
57:43 - i would like to say i appreciate that
57:46 - but i would say to all of you
57:48 - look into yourself you got that job for
57:50 - yourself
57:51 - you found that passion for yourself i'm
57:52 - thrilled to play whatever small
57:54 - tiny role in providing a little help or
57:56 - inspiration along the way
57:58 - but um i you know um really that all of
58:01 - the wonder of
58:02 - expression and creativity with code and
58:04 - the things that you are doing
58:05 - all of that is is comes comes from you
58:08 - and i i i love that you choose to share
58:10 - it with me and that i get to
58:12 - like be a small part of it so thank you
58:14 - okay um
58:15 - i hope that camera goes back on soon
58:18 - what was i doing
58:18 - i installed wait okay random number for
58:21 - alexander
58:22 - um the random number uh we have the book
58:24 - right here
58:26 - uh um i think for a super chat we'll go
58:28 - to the
58:29 - table of gaussian deviates which is uh
58:32 - 1.498
58:33 - we'll take uh where's that camera right
58:35 - there that's that'll be your
58:37 - camera all right moving along
58:40 - i assume that the camera i'm gonna be
58:42 - able to turn it back on any second
58:45 - how long could it possibly take let's go
58:47 - back to the browser
58:49 - and i merged that another pull request
58:54 - uh refactor oh no we already
58:58 - make the emojis make more sense oh oh
59:01 - how could the emojis make any more sense
59:03 - that they already do they're all trains
59:06 - these make tremendous sense okay let's
59:09 - see
59:10 - uh what do we got here
59:14 - instead of constantly scaling so that
59:16 - the winning option is full of emojis has
59:17 - each
59:18 - emoji represent one vote then after it
59:20 - goes off the screen have each emoji
59:21 - represent five votes
59:23 - 25 votes i like this i like this idea
59:26 - this is very exciting this sounds like a
59:28 - difficult math problem and
59:30 - uh and okay let's see here so
59:34 - it looks like maybe there's some merge
59:36 - conflicts so let's take a look at that
59:38 - i'm going to resolve our merge conflicts
59:41 - um
59:44 - this looks like that'll be fine to keep
59:46 - the max emojis there now as a new thing
59:50 - um and then anything else
59:53 - the number of emojis is is w
59:57 - not being used anymore so is that what
59:59 - was being replaced
60:01 - from simon w was previously used to
60:04 - maybe
60:05 - um in some sort of rendering
60:09 - of the emojis but let's so let's do that
60:12 - let's take this out i think and so num
60:15 - emoji ah i see
60:16 - so this is the process of
60:19 - um figuring out what's 4 30. uh figuring
60:23 - out
60:24 - um what the divisor is based off of how
60:28 - many emojis
60:29 - how many votes there have been overall
60:30 - got it thank you simon this is wonderful
60:32 - so let's uh mark this as resolved commit
60:35 - this merge
60:36 - and then we shall
60:42 - um squash
60:45 - we we've we've resolved our conflicts
60:48 - we're squatching
60:49 - our pull requests everything is so happy
60:53 - today
60:54 - confirm squash and merge okay
60:57 - there we go oh i have something i wanted
60:59 - to uh highlight and mention
61:00 - um today that i that i have to remember
61:02 - to do okay
61:04 - uh but i should do that right now before
61:05 - i forget um
61:08 - all right emerge another polar crest
61:10 - let's try to move more quickly here
61:11 - add a dev script to run nodemon that
61:13 - sounds awesome
61:15 - um uh oh package.lock you are the bane
61:19 - of my existence
61:21 - um let's add uh
61:25 - nodemon should be fine i don't know what
61:29 - i just did
61:30 - but okay whatever
61:35 - well this is bad this is bad
61:39 - no this is bad okay wait wait wait wait
61:42 - wait wait
61:43 - i don't know
61:49 - i think this is right i resolve
61:52 - no remove all conflicts
61:55 - this doesn't i i haven't had this
61:57 - experience before where
61:59 - package.lock gets all wonky can i just
62:01 - delete it and like ignore it
62:03 - and uh i don't want it shouldn't be in
62:05 - git ignore but
62:06 - can't it like work itself out in a
62:08 - different way
62:10 - somebody explained what package.lock was
62:12 - to me before
62:13 - um okay so i think this is good scroll
62:15 - back up
62:16 - i think the camera's gotta have gotten
62:18 - enough juice now by now right
62:20 - so let me go see if the camera has come
62:27 - turning it on
62:31 - it is not telling me the battery is
62:33 - exhausted
62:37 - so it is telling me that the battery is
62:40 - dead but it is staying on and it is
62:43 - plugged in
62:44 - so hopefully it won't uh wow it really
62:46 - lasted so
62:48 - so little okay so i can oh boy i really
62:51 - need that other light huh
62:55 - oh this is so sad this is so all of this
62:58 - expensive high-tech equipment
63:01 - i have here and i can't manage to find
63:05 - three plugs i guess i i do have an
63:08 - extension cord that might just be what i
63:10 - need to do because i have many more
63:11 - plugs
63:11 - in this room um please hold
63:16 - let me get that other light plugged in
63:23 - i need to mute myself okay i'm just i'm
63:25 - gonna get my extension cord out
63:43 - i'm running here
63:46 - plugging in extension cord and hopefully
63:48 - i'm not going to
63:49 - unplug something and shut this whole
63:51 - thing down by accident it's plugged in
63:53 - this is like a 40 foot extension cord to
63:56 - go about
63:57 - two and a half feet that i need
64:02 - but now everything's plugged in both of
64:05 - my lights
64:09 - and i return to a brightly lit
64:14 - space okay all right
64:19 - thanks for bearing with me here
64:20 - everybody uh we've got nodemon now
64:23 - um i should read this discussion ah oh
64:27 - so one of the interesting things is
64:29 - um i typically um just install
64:32 - nodemon not as a dev develop dependency
64:35 - but as a global module
64:36 - so it's just like a command i can always
64:38 - run i don't know what the sort of proper
64:41 - um you know sort of
64:44 - so-called proper technique is but let's
64:46 - see what this does
64:48 - so let's squash and merge this one
64:53 - uh get pull origin main
64:58 - oh i can do npm install and let it sort
65:00 - out the files yeah that's what i thought
65:02 - but it's still like um
65:10 - why is it showing up in the uh as a
65:13 - conflict in the pull request
65:15 - like i still have to deal with it there
65:17 - um
65:21 - so let's do npm install now
65:25 - um and let's just see npm run dev
65:29 - yeah so it's running nodemon so by the
65:31 - way i should probably get
65:34 - used to doing this so typically the way
65:37 - that i
65:37 - tend to work is just to like execute a
65:40 - particular javascript file
65:42 - by saying node index.js but in a
65:45 - project's package.json
65:47 - um under main uh it's listed as index.js
65:52 - and these are various scripts that can
65:53 - be run so start
65:55 - is an alias essentially to node index.js
65:58 - and dev is an alias to nodemon index.js
66:01 - in the ml5 library for example there's
66:04 - npn build and nbm run build nbn run
66:07 - start
66:07 - npm run serve like there's all these
66:09 - different things to like
66:10 - build the website to build the library
66:12 - to to
66:14 - there's like a laundry list of things
66:15 - you can run so i should probably get in
66:17 - the habit of demonstrating that
66:18 - and saying npm run start so
66:22 - um but the the nice thing about nodemon
66:25 - is um nodemon or node monitor
66:28 - listens to the files listens like keeps
66:31 - keeps its eye
66:32 - doesn't have any ears or eyes but it
66:34 - tracks the files and if any changes are
66:36 - made it will restart the server
66:38 - all right um
66:41 - let's see here um sorry
66:44 - i know that i know i know that this
66:46 - might not be the most exciting
66:48 - live stream ever but this is really
66:50 - useful stuff for me to do
66:52 - um updated ui
66:55 - um this looks good although i love oh i
67:00 - like this as a trained car
67:02 - now i think i'm gonna start getting into
67:04 - the place where
67:06 - um i can't resolve the merge conflicts
67:09 - anymore
67:10 - because so i love this idea um
67:14 - and i'm sorry that so one thing i want
67:16 - to apologize to people
67:17 - if you were hoping that these pull
67:19 - requests would be part of hacktoberfest
67:21 - i kind of forgot about that and now it
67:23 - is november
67:24 - so if anybody were really had their
67:26 - heart set on this being a hacktoberfest
67:29 - uh accepted pull request and it's like
67:31 - it's i'm entirely responsible for you
67:32 - not getting your
67:33 - tree planted or t-shirt let me know
67:35 - maybe i can send you a sticker or
67:37 - something
67:38 - um but um let me just write here
67:40 - apologies
67:42 - i think i need to move a little more
67:43 - quickly here through some of the ones
67:44 - that i can actually implement
67:46 - um i love this and would like what
67:49 - i think what i should be doing is ones
67:52 - that i've reviewed and like the idea of
67:55 - if those get updated after the live
67:57 - stream i shouldn't wait till the next
67:58 - time i'm looking at a live stream to
67:59 - merge it it should just go in more
68:01 - quickly so
68:08 - i hope please let us
68:11 - know sparkle
68:15 - and so let's do that thank you so much
68:17 - for everyone who's contributed
68:19 - um let's move on to um improved poll
68:23 - structure a post
68:27 - for creating a new poll question string
68:31 - option string votes number okay
68:35 - change votes poll idea route to poll
68:38 - poll idea to avoid confusion with vote
68:41 - make necessary changes to work with
68:42 - arrays this all seems really really
68:44 - useful and i
68:45 - really do want to be able to create new
68:46 - polls to test
68:49 - cleardatabase.bdb uncomment create new
68:52 - poll function invocation
68:53 - commented back i really want to merge
68:56 - this so can i resolve these conflicts
68:59 - let's see here um
69:02 - this seems kind of uh silly
69:06 - it's just like silly formatting that got
69:11 - conflicted then this is
69:16 - um the poll id
69:19 - oh merch conflicts are so hard i think
69:22 - maybe
69:23 - maybe this wasn't the best idea for how
69:26 - to sort of like manage
69:27 - and maintain this project i also
69:28 - realized the reason it's getting darker
69:30 - in here and i'm getting more shadowing
69:31 - is the sun is going down and i was
69:33 - really benefiting from the sun
69:35 - shining through the window that's over
69:36 - there i guess i could point this light
69:38 - more this direction
69:39 - or make it a little bit brighter just
69:41 - wanna see if i turn it a little bit
69:43 - if that helps the keying maybe a little
69:46 - bit
69:47 - um all right now oh this is going to be
69:49 - hard
69:50 - so this was the new thing
69:55 - oh oh so so hard
69:58 - can i merge this this is so hard this is
70:01 - so hard okay
70:02 - i want to add this yes so this changed
70:04 - the name
70:06 - from pull pull id
70:15 - to vote oh okay okay okay
70:18 - that makes sense and this just had the
70:21 - object destructuring stuff oh no what
70:23 - what
70:24 - oh right okay i see i think if i'm right
70:30 - that this
70:33 - is the new stuff i want to keep and then
70:37 - i don't need this anymore okay so that's
70:40 - that this is the new poll
70:43 - great so i think we're good and i just
70:45 - need to figure out
70:46 - what the changes are so this is also
70:49 - really um
70:50 - using a new a different branch name
70:51 - would be super helpful here
70:53 - because then i could tell uh if you're
70:56 - like
70:57 - making your pull requests from your own
70:58 - main branch then it's hard for me to see
71:00 - the different branches
71:02 - because they're both called main but i
71:04 - think this is
71:05 - the more recent object destructuring
71:09 - so that can
71:12 - that can be kept in lieu of these two
71:14 - lines
71:16 - and then this
71:21 - if no poll would return error if the
71:24 - choice
71:25 - it's less than the length return and
71:27 - then
71:28 - increase i think this is all good
71:32 - i think it was just that okay i think
71:34 - we're good here
71:36 - so this is going to be exciting to try
71:38 - mark is resolved
71:40 - oh no no oh there's also sketch.js
71:43 - which just has now i think the idea is
71:47 - that it was changed
71:49 - to
71:52 - oh my god
71:57 - oh this is hard okay i think i know
71:58 - what's going on here i think
72:00 - that um de palm sen
72:03 - changed it to pole
72:07 - and simon added max emojis so i want to
72:10 - get rid of
72:11 - votes and keep pull but i want to keep
72:14 - the max emojis
72:16 - and then down here i want
72:20 - simon's new
72:23 - loop here which is replaces
72:28 - this no wait
72:32 - this finds the max votes then this is
72:35 - simon's loop oh my god
72:38 - oh no no no oh boy yes cause
72:43 - oh this is hard i need simon's algorithm
72:46 - to make its way back up here
72:50 - okay i got it now so this
72:53 - is the new way of doing it with poll
72:56 - options
72:58 - and simon
73:01 - let's try to pull simon's code up so
73:04 - let's get
73:05 - max votes and the divisor sorted out
73:09 - that that would replace this
73:13 - and instead of choice of choices
73:18 - the new way of doing it is poll
73:22 - dot votes i this is really insane
73:27 - uh
73:30 - and that's
73:35 - that and then this
73:38 - is fine okay but i need max uh
73:42 - where does max emojis that was already
73:44 - defined up here perfect
73:46 - okay so that's good
73:50 - um that's fixed and now
73:54 - this is i equals zero i is less than
73:58 - poll.options.length
74:01 - and then variables breakdown is this
74:06 - i is index before it was choice which
74:09 - was an alphabet
74:10 - so this should be poll.votes
74:15 - dot votes index i
74:21 - okay 10 and then i think that's right
74:24 - that's the only thing that changes with
74:25 - simon's new algorithm
74:28 - all right we're going to find out we
74:30 - might have to do some more fixing
74:35 - and the white space is all messed up
74:38 - this is going to require some work
74:41 - but this is exciting we're making
74:42 - serious progress here people
74:47 - once again the button is green it means
74:49 - i can click it
74:54 - i'm gonna take a break in a minute and
74:56 - kind of move on from this project
74:58 - uh squash and merge the button is green
75:01 - it means i can push it
75:03 - yeah i'm gonna fix whatever indentation
75:05 - bracket stuff
75:07 - uh now here on my own
75:10 - um so let's go take a look at
75:14 - uh here and i think if i do save whoa
75:20 - right so um
75:24 - whoops ah no ah
75:29 - i want to format the document wait what
75:32 - happened to my
75:33 - pritier uh oh
75:39 - oh no so something is wrong right okay
75:42 - so let's take a look at this
75:43 - clear background pull options
75:50 - oops for
75:53 - loop
75:57 - oh pull the number of votes pull options
76:00 - the actual option
76:04 - okay
76:10 - what's going on here oh let's see
76:15 - am i running the server
76:24 - okay sketch.js line 70 unexpected so i
76:27 - have an
76:28 - error on line 70. do i have an extra
76:34 - aha
76:41 - okay i think it format i might have
76:42 - taken out format on save
76:46 - uh format oh no it is format on safe who
76:49 - knows what's going on all right
76:51 - hopefully now we're good
76:56 - okay uh
76:59 - huh what's happening on the server oh
77:02 - id is not defined index.js 30
77:06 - line 11. oh i've really i've really done
77:10 - a horrible thing here
77:11 - 30 line uh okay
77:18 - get poll poll id constant id
77:22 - equals await database update
77:30 - what
77:38 - yeah profit mesh is writing ideally
77:41 - after each pull request
77:42 - merge everyone else who raised a pull
77:44 - request needs to update their local copy
77:46 - and resolve the merge conflict
77:47 - on their end and then update their pull
77:49 - crest resolve code yeah
77:51 - i think maybe this methodology is not
77:54 - gonna is not working out for me to try
77:56 - to resolve these conflicts
77:57 - especially when i am not used to reading
78:00 - code that is now written with some of
78:01 - the styles that have that are here
78:03 - but i don't know if somebody um
78:07 - um i don't know if somebody can can
78:10 - catch
78:11 - what i missed this is the this is let's
78:13 - look at this route
78:15 - the idea of this route is we
78:19 - are getting everything from a pole so
78:22 - and what
78:28 - i think let me go back
78:31 - and look at the project uh history for a
78:35 - second
78:38 - because i think the change here um and
78:41 - let's look at the history
78:45 - let's look at the um i think this is the
78:48 - change that i have now
78:49 - messed up so let's look at what was
78:52 - changed here
78:54 - um the id the idea is that this
79:00 - is changed to this oh
79:04 - oh my god
79:10 - oh i'm gonna have to put this aside i'm
79:13 - gonna have to call on the community to
79:14 - save me
79:17 - because i this this is very clear to me
79:19 - what happened in this change
79:21 - um i'm pull this is like pulling out ah
79:24 - i didn't know you could do object
79:26 - destructuring like this
79:28 - pole id id equals request
79:31 - params look at that
79:34 - so this is like
79:38 - i d i d huh
79:43 - pole id id this is the same as what i
79:48 - did
79:48 - here you're getting the id as the poll
79:51 - idea
79:51 - id now i'm getting the id as the poll id
79:55 - so i should be getting this id as the
79:59 - poll id
80:00 - my lights are blinking does that mean
80:02 - that this is supposed to be this
80:04 - and that was my mistake
80:14 - oh wait should you snowden
80:21 - cannot access id before initialization
80:23 - was that the
80:28 - await database update
80:34 - i think i know how to fix this
80:36 - javascript is so crazy
80:38 - i do know how to fix this which is that
80:45 - i can do i don't even understand like
80:48 - where is it getting this stuff from
80:52 - where is it getting choice
80:55 - i i really messed this up
80:59 - i deleted complete functions i really
81:01 - ruined it
81:02 - okay yeah i lost like a whole
81:07 - let's go look at i think what i need to
81:09 - do is look at
81:10 - um this branch here
81:16 - i need to look at the um what was the
81:18 - one that i what i was this one okay
81:20 - let's look at this
81:21 - um
81:25 - let's go back and look at um
81:30 - let's look at d-pawn mensan's uh branch
81:33 - so what did what was changed here
81:36 - this is without my messing it up under
81:39 - pull pull id
81:44 - oh maybe maybe this pull request
81:47 - actually had a mistake in it because it
81:48 - looks like
81:56 - uh this looks like
82:00 - what it what i have
82:05 - a reverb
82:10 - do we need a code style guide yeah
82:14 - all right everyone uh it's time to read
82:16 - some brands things have gone awry
82:18 - i'm gonna look at this later i was
82:20 - hoping to get like a nice little win
82:22 - here to like at least have this be able
82:24 - to create a new poll
82:26 - which i'm very excited to have this
82:27 - feature but i uh
82:29 - when your philosophy on on pull request
82:32 - is to just if the
82:33 - button is green to press the button i
82:35 - might need to
82:36 - uh adjust uh adjust my way of doing this
82:40 - also why i sometimes i like to write
82:42 - things even if it's more long-winded
82:44 - without this kind of object
82:45 - destructuring stuff because i find it
82:47 - very hard
82:48 - to read and understand um what's going
82:51 - on
82:52 - but um yeah like if i just go here let's
82:55 - just look at the
82:56 - this is i'm in
83:00 - oh no no no no no no go here
83:03 - no i'm in the wrong place ah
83:06 - what i want to do how come it's not
83:08 - taking me to where i want to go
83:10 - i want to go here
83:13 - there we go and i want to look at what
83:16 - branches
83:17 - there main and i want to look here this
83:20 - is what i want to see
83:26 - right this is this is the way the
83:30 - function
83:32 - is written here
83:44 - it looks the same right
83:59 - oh no error oh no there's air here
84:11 - id is not fine so i think there's a
84:13 - mistake in
84:17 - okay well where was id defined
84:22 - i'm very stubborn as you all know and i
84:25 - i sometimes have a lot of trouble
84:33 - ah
84:36 - oh i see i did everything right
84:41 - but for this new system to work
84:44 - the create new poll function has to be
84:46 - called for there to be an id
84:49 - because that create new poll
84:54 - returns id well now let's go and look at
84:58 - let's look at the instructions that i
84:59 - didn't read
85:01 - uh and then i'm really pulling that
85:03 - putting this aside
85:07 - uh where was it did i did i close it
85:10 - um is this one
85:14 - okay to test
85:18 - clear database dot db uncomment
85:21 - create new poll all right so let's let's
85:23 - follow these instructions
85:26 - database.db i deleted everything from it
85:33 - we're going to then uncomment create new
85:36 - poll function
85:38 - invocation
85:42 - then comment it back after poll is
85:46 - created
85:46 - in sketch.js fix all poll ids
85:50 - okay 9 and 32.
85:54 - interesting
85:58 - so now
86:02 - there's a pull and an id
86:05 - though right because there's a whole new
86:06 - database structure oh
86:09 - there's a whole new database structure
86:11 - so now here
86:13 - line 9 that's the new id
86:17 - which is line 10 and
86:21 - line 32
86:26 - which i guess here
86:29 - hopefully
86:34 - now
86:38 - oh wait no i have to uncomment it
86:42 - uncomment create new poll
86:47 - run it again
86:52 - ah still id is not defined i think
86:56 - i think there's a mistake
87:02 - database dot update returns an object
87:04 - result of the function is what you're
87:05 - destructuring right
87:07 - right that i sort of understood
87:12 - okay okay so if i really want to solve
87:15 - this which i
87:16 - insist on doing
87:22 - i want to do the following
87:27 - let me let me be stubborn
87:31 - and solve this and then i will take my
87:39 - break
87:44 - um
87:51 - right can't i do this
87:57 - right shouldn't i be able to look at it
88:00 - and see what it's giving me back now
88:04 - um if i do this right i just want to
88:06 - like what's that object that comes out
88:09 - but yeah
88:12 - still there's something here that
88:13 - doesn't there's a thing that doesn't
88:14 - make any sense to me here but i will
88:16 - humor me for a second here
88:21 - yeah it's this
88:24 - like am i supposed to set
88:35 - like
88:40 - oh wait a sec wait a second wait a sec
88:42 - wait a sec
88:46 - yeah no no why oh i know it
88:49 - what got deleted by accident
88:58 - yeah this whole thing
89:03 - yeah hello people this
89:12 - this this was missing
89:16 - where did that that got deleted
89:18 - somewhere
89:20 - right i have to pull the particular id
89:23 - that's the whole point
89:28 - oh this was a disaster
89:31 - choice is not defined there's no choice
89:39 - that's up here
89:42 - oh i'm in the wrong place this
89:46 - these functions got merged oh
89:47 - everything's gone so horrible
89:50 - everything's everything's gone so wrong
89:54 - a pixel i appreciate your messages
89:55 - sometimes i have to like
89:57 - get revert to the rescue okay i'm
90:00 - canceling this
90:01 - so i i um i i've learned my lesson
90:05 - i thought i could do uh something
90:07 - somewhat superhuman that i clearly could
90:09 - not do
90:14 - um i i am going to come back to this
90:18 - i'm gonna move on to some other stuff
90:20 - this was a this was a failure
90:22 - i am sorry i don't know i i can't even
90:25 - speak
90:26 - let's let's take i'm gonna take a break
90:28 - i'm gonna thank the sponsor
90:30 - so i'm gonna have to totally like
90:32 - reorient my entire brain
90:35 - take a deep breath uh anybody who wants
90:38 - to
90:39 - um kind of fix this i'm actually going
90:42 - to um
90:47 - stash all the stuff i just if anybody
90:50 - wants to
90:50 - work on fixing this right now um while i
90:53 - take my break you are welcome to
90:56 - um you can find the horrible disaster
90:59 - that is everything right here in this
91:01 - github repo
91:02 - i will paste it as a link into the
91:05 - discord
91:06 - but i am going to oh this is really
91:09 - rough
91:10 - um i'm going to take a minute here to
91:13 - thank today's sponsor
91:16 - here's the thing coding is really hard
91:19 - and in particular
91:21 - managing web applications that involve
91:25 - databases and front-ends and back-ends
91:29 - is really something that's particularly
91:30 - hard to do especially while you're live
91:32 - streaming
91:32 - which is why most of the content i tend
91:35 - to focus on
91:36 - has to do with algorithms generative art
91:41 - patterns visualizations kind of stuff
91:44 - that i can kind of bite off and chew in
91:46 - in a single chunk and a place where i
91:49 - essentially harvest so many of these
91:52 - ideas
91:52 - is a website called brilliant and
91:54 - brilliant is both an app and a website
91:56 - and has a lot of other aspects to it as
91:58 - well so
92:00 - i'm um going to open something up here
92:03 - so one thing that's
92:04 - really um exciting to me about
92:07 - brilliant so first of all what is
92:09 - brilliant it's a website and app that
92:11 - makes learning accessible and fun
92:13 - their approach is based on problem
92:15 - solving and active learning
92:17 - so everything unlike the disaster that
92:19 - you're watching
92:20 - that is my live stream it's actually a
92:22 - place where instead of watching somebody
92:23 - else do stuff
92:24 - you can go and read and interact and try
92:26 - and try different puzzles and
92:28 - interactive exercises
92:29 - to learn a particular topic algebra
92:32 - programming
92:33 - neural networks and actually new there's
92:35 - a whole lot of new design
92:37 - elements and an entire new uh
92:40 - illustration style called pixp i x and
92:43 - you can see it highlighted in particular
92:45 - in its
92:46 - um a refresh of
92:49 - its um geometry fundamentals course so
92:52 - the geometry fundamentals course is
92:54 - really awesome
92:56 - it's probably the it's the kind of stuff
92:58 - that i should be focusing on the coding
93:00 - train since
93:01 - again i'm really harping on the fact
93:02 - that i just had this total database
93:04 - merge pull request github disaster
93:06 - which i will really think deeply about
93:09 - while i'm
93:10 - after this live stream and come back and
93:12 - try to redeem myself next week
93:14 - but i really encourage you um to check
93:16 - out these uh courses that are available
93:18 - on brilliant another one that i
93:20 - really spent a lot of time with is the
93:23 - neural networks
93:24 - of course highly related to all the
93:25 - stuff that i do with ml5.js and
93:27 - tensorflow.js so if you want to
93:29 - sort of learn more behind the scenes of
93:31 - how neural networks work
93:32 - um and play with different this is
93:34 - showing you sort of visualizing the
93:36 - process of a neural network network
93:38 - uh recognizing a handwritten digit um
93:40 - you can check
93:41 - that out so what i tend to like to do
93:44 - i think i will uh i'm gonna have a
93:47 - little like
93:48 - wind right now is what i like to do
93:52 - uh is go to brilliant.brilliant.org the
93:56 - website i am already logged in
93:59 - and look at um one of its daily
94:01 - challenges
94:02 - i took a peek at this one before i
94:04 - started live streaming
94:05 - and i'm pretty sure i have a sense of
94:07 - how to answer it so um
94:09 - so i feel like i'm going to get a win
94:10 - here which i really need so sometimes
94:13 - my favorite aspect about work doing the
94:15 - puzzles on brilliant is i get them wrong
94:16 - and i learn something
94:17 - but based on all that i was trying to do
94:19 - with that live pull application
94:20 - getting something right is what i really
94:22 - feel i need right now thank you for this
94:24 - sponsor segment is like a therapy
94:25 - session for myself so
94:27 - um this this certainly seems connected
94:29 - to the geometry fundamentals course
94:31 - so if you're interested in this if you
94:33 - like this particular puzzle and
94:34 - challenge
94:35 - looking through the geometry
94:36 - fundamentals course i think would be
94:37 - highly relevant so
94:38 - um what let's read let's read the
94:40 - explanation here first so
94:42 - um some of these segments how can we
94:43 - find a the area of the colored triangle
94:46 - one we are only told
94:48 - the two lengths in the figure so i guess
94:51 - we know
94:51 - the with this this one tick and these
94:54 - two ticks and these two
94:55 - we know those lengths so we should be
94:57 - able to calculate this
95:00 - and then we know the area of the full
95:05 - um well this seems like
95:09 - not too difficult a problem keep reading
95:11 - to see one way to do this well let's
95:12 - read its explanation
95:14 - when we first when we first start when
95:16 - first starting a problem the wishful
95:18 - thinking strategy can help point you in
95:19 - the right direction
95:20 - i know the height of the colored
95:22 - triangle if i only knew the length of
95:24 - the base
95:25 - then i could find the area with the
95:26 - formula a equals one-half base
95:28 - times height yeah exactly
95:32 - the base of the color drawn is a pair of
95:33 - tick marks so does the hypotenuse
95:36 - that means the two segments of the same
95:38 - length are congruent
95:40 - so now you might think as follows i know
95:42 - the length of one leg of the middle
95:44 - triangle
95:45 - if i knew the length of the other leg
95:47 - then i could use the pythagorean theorem
95:49 - to find the length of the hypotenuse
95:51 - then i would have the missing leg of the
95:52 - colored triangle
95:56 - right
95:59 - uh oh i see the things that i know are
96:02 - the three and the four
96:03 - i misread this like this is what i'm
96:06 - trying to calculate so i know this three
96:08 - and i know this four i got it i got it i
96:11 - got it so this is going to run through
96:13 - uh show you that this is four uh then
96:16 - um and do some calculations and figure
96:20 - out that this side is 20 times three
96:22 - so one half so i encourage you to check
96:24 - this out i'm gonna do the actual
96:25 - challenge
96:26 - i want to do this one
96:29 - six equilateral triangles all with
96:32 - side length one let me let me let me
96:35 - pull up the chat here because i lost the
96:36 - chat and i don't know if anything's gone
96:39 - off the rails here
96:40 - um
96:46 - what is the total length of the
96:48 - highlighted segments
96:50 - so we have some if these are equilateral
96:52 - triangles
96:53 - and i can do this we've got some serious
96:55 - symmetry going on here
96:57 - right i'm almost certain based on the
97:00 - sort of
97:00 - yeah uh the symmetry here that the
97:02 - length of this
97:04 - is equal to the length of this right
97:07 - that that uh this wishful thinking is
97:10 - true
97:10 - based on the sort of symmetry of the
97:12 - this tiling of equilateral triangles
97:14 - therefore this whoops
97:18 - therefore this plus this is one
97:23 - similarly this plus this
97:26 - is two oh i forgot about this one that's
97:29 - three so we've got three and all i have
97:32 - left is this
97:33 - which is clearly one half so
97:36 - i'm so happy for this challenge i'm
97:39 - really really quite certain that the
97:40 - answer is three and a half
97:41 - i'm gonna i'll leave a a couple seconds
97:44 - here for anybody uh
97:45 - in the uh chat who wants to tell me i'm
97:47 - wrong
98:01 - i see we have a new member in the chat
98:02 - code guppy by the way i have to give
98:04 - code
98:05 - guppy a random number
98:08 - let's submit let's submit this let's
98:10 - feel let's have something that helps us
98:11 - feel a little good today
98:14 - in terms of this live stream there's
98:15 - plenty other things that i wanted to
98:17 - feel good about today i believe
98:18 - all right drum roll please i really hope
98:20 - this is right
98:22 - ah okay i have my one day streak again
98:26 - one of these days you're going to be
98:27 - shocked when you see i have a multi-day
98:28 - streak
98:29 - fantastic um feeling a little better
98:32 - all right oh
98:38 - that was wild
98:41 - that look at this animation that is
98:43 - really cool so this is one of the things
98:45 - um that i also love about these
98:47 - brilliant challenges is they really lead
98:49 - to
98:50 - kind of interesting animation ideas and
98:52 - i would certainly encourage you
98:54 - to uh you know one things i like to do
98:56 - is sometimes with one of these
98:57 - challenges is then try to make a p5.js
98:59 - sketch
99:00 - okay um i'm going to take
99:04 - a a short just just literally like a two
99:06 - minute break
99:07 - um just to kind of
99:11 - take a deep breath have a moment away
99:14 - from that live pole debacle that i'm
99:17 - definitely gonna spend some time this
99:19 - weekend cleaning up
99:20 - um and uh i will be back
99:24 - so um it is now intermission um i'll
99:26 - remind you
99:27 - that um if you're interested in
99:29 - brilliant you can sign up for free right
99:30 - now at brilliant.org
99:32 - codingtrain those daily puzzles and lots
99:34 - of other aspects of the site are free
99:36 - um and if you want to unlock all the

99:39 - um you can uh you'll get a 20 discount
99:42 - uh uh the first 200 people at least to
99:43 - go through this uh particular link
99:45 - okay um i'll be back i'm using my
99:48 - microphone and i'll be back in about two
99:52 - minutes
100:20 - do
100:34 - do
101:30 - do
101:52 - all right everybody i am again
102:01 - wow it's really bright i feel like i
102:02 - need to turn the lights down
102:06 - um go to my control center
102:10 - and powder my nose today so i feel like
102:13 - it's just
102:14 - too much um
102:18 - come on control center oh you got to be
102:20 - kidding me
102:26 - settings done well the lights don't seem
102:29 - to show up anymore that's so weird okay
102:32 - nothing is going right for me today
102:36 - sometimes i have these live streams and
102:38 - i feel like
102:40 - this incredible just coming together of
102:45 - ideas and weird
102:48 - code moments and it's beautiful
102:52 - and other times i feel like what was i
102:55 - doing
102:56 - for the last two hours oh my goodness
102:59 - thank you for being here with me um i
103:02 - am going to move on i'm gonna try to
103:04 - come up with something to do
103:05 - here in the next 50 minutes that will be
103:09 - a will have a bit more of a
103:12 - um hopefully outcome that you can take
103:15 - away with you
103:16 - to maybe try something new uh yourself
103:19 - this um weekend so i think what i
103:21 - actually want to do
103:23 - is
103:28 - i really don't understand what's
103:29 - happening today
103:33 - first of all code guppy thank you for
103:36 - joining
103:36 - code guppy i assume you are the code
103:38 - guppy from the wonderful code guppy
103:40 - website are you a different code guppy
103:42 - which is
103:43 - a um service that i have um
103:46 - looked at and i know that you've talked
103:48 - to folks at processing about
103:50 - service is maybe the wrong word but on
103:51 - educational coding websites so
103:53 - anyway thank you i think it is
103:57 - i i think the the sign here that i'm
104:01 - reading from the universe the universe
104:03 - is telling me
104:05 - to read some more random numbers so
104:08 - uh let's go ahead and do that
104:22 - row 14 column two is where i last left
104:26 - off
104:27 - oh a couple hours ago it was a simpler
104:30 - time when i had all this like energy
104:32 - and i was excited to be live streaming
104:35 - and i was reading random numbers and
104:36 - thinking about all the things i was
104:37 - going to create
104:39 - um and thank you k weekman
104:43 - for sharing the code guppy uh website
104:47 - um i think i think i probably have some
104:49 - unanswered
104:50 - um emails from you you have some
104:52 - unanswered
104:54 - i have some unanswered emails from you
104:56 - you have not received answers from me
104:57 - and i apologize for that
104:59 - um i am slowly getting to all the
105:02 - messages that i receive
105:03 - over time but i i really appreciate all
105:06 - that you're doing at codeguppy.com
105:08 - all right oh we're we're giving
105:12 - code guppy a um
105:16 - a random number for your membership oh
105:18 - wait this is a membership
105:22 - welcome code guppy to the cutting train
105:27 - thanks for boarding the coding train a
105:29 - youtube channel where
105:30 - i merge people's pull requests and
105:33 - resolve their conflicts
105:34 - without really bothering to thoughtfully
105:39 - check over what i'm doing i break
105:41 - everything and then i cry
105:43 - and well give out a random number
105:46 - the code guppy's random number is 5778
105:51 - that is from page 366 uh
105:54 - row 18265 column
105:58 - three all right
106:02 - um okay so um i'm trying to think
106:05 - quickly about what i could do
106:07 - and i think actually i think the the the
106:12 - uh ex the thing that i could do right
106:14 - now that will lead to
106:16 - um the most positive result of me
106:19 - actually showing something
106:20 - on the live stream that people could
106:21 - learn and try on their own is to look at
106:23 - the new release
106:24 - of ml5.js so let's go on over to
106:29 - the ml5.js website
106:33 - learn.ml5js.org
106:36 - and i believe if i go to
106:40 - the ml5 github and go take a look at ml5
106:44 - library and go under releases you will
106:47 - see
106:48 - as of two days ago
106:57 - version 0.6.0
107:01 - and if i click here it will show a few
107:03 - of the things that have been added
107:05 - i would say the most significant thing
107:08 - is
107:09 - two new models hand pose and face mesh
107:13 - so hand pose can be used to predict the
107:15 - location of 21 3d landmarks on the palm
107:19 - and fingers
107:20 - of a single hand and face mesh can be
107:22 - used to predict
107:23 - 486 3d landmarks on the human face
107:28 - wow all right um there's a bunch of
107:31 - other things
107:31 - uh that are in that have been updated
107:33 - and fixed
107:34 - in particular related to convolutional
107:36 - neural networks which i'm working on a
107:38 - video series about
107:39 - which will come out sometime in the next
107:40 - few weeks but let's take a look at those
107:43 - um those particular models and i'll do
107:45 - it right in the
107:46 - p5 web editor in fact um
107:51 - i wonder if i just go i think this has
107:54 - been updated if i go to
107:56 - examples.ml5js.org
107:57 - we can look for hand pose
108:01 - and let's click on hand pose webcam
108:05 - ah so i noticed that this is an issue
108:10 - with
108:11 - our build systems for the website and
108:13 - examples are everything
108:14 - and everything one of the things you can
108:15 - do with um
108:18 - with the excuse me for i'm just having
108:21 - trouble finishing my sentences all of a
108:22 - sudden
108:23 - one of the things you can do um
108:28 - with the p5 web editor is you can
108:30 - actually now have
108:32 - sort of named permalinks to your sketch
108:34 - whereas really this sketches url is its
108:36 - id
108:37 - and some of them are like breaking when
108:39 - we update ml5 and upload new examples
108:41 - so i'm not sure how to resolve that but
108:43 - i believe
108:45 - if i do this and i go to hand pose oh
108:48 - it's not there
108:49 - so i think maybe some of the the release
108:52 - process
108:52 - is still in progress and maybe that's
108:55 - why it's not showing up which is all the
108:57 - better
108:58 - for me to now uh figure out how to get
109:00 - it to work myself
109:02 - so let's just go to let's let's get it
109:05 - to work ourselves
109:06 - this will be an excellent uh exploration
109:09 - um
109:09 - i'm in the p5 web editor i've got a
109:11 - basic p5.js sketch going
109:13 - i want to make sure that i import the
109:16 - latest
109:18 - ml5 library which i can do
109:21 - right by copying to clipboard this and i
109:24 - can paste it
109:25 - right in here into um
109:29 - right here into index.html i'm actually
109:32 - going to adjust this
109:34 - and just change it from latest to 0.6.0
109:37 - i really prefer
109:38 - referring to a specific version because
109:41 - then i really know
109:42 - what version was i using when i wrote
109:44 - this code if it just is latest
109:45 - i won't remember that later and as ml5
109:47 - updates something else could break
109:50 - so um let's do that
109:53 - then let's come over here into sketch.js
109:57 - and i'm just
110:00 - going to use just the webcam so let's
110:03 - say video equals
110:05 - create capture um
110:10 - uh video when i think i don't put that
110:12 - in quotes i think i just do this
110:13 - create capture video video dot size 320
110:16 - 240 let's do that
110:18 - let's make the canvas 320.240 as well
110:22 - um and um let's not have anything in
110:26 - draw well let's just draw the video
110:27 - right now
110:32 - so let's see what we've got and thank
110:35 - you very much
110:36 - for my open broadcast studio a virtual
110:39 - camera
110:40 - ah now recently i figured out there's a
110:43 - quicker way to fix this
110:45 - if i go to here and i do
110:48 - smanit like you can see how it's like
110:50 - defaulting to the obs virtual camera
110:52 - i think if i click manage it'll take me
110:54 - to this page and i can just switch it to
110:56 - this
110:58 - and then if i go back to here and
111:01 - just re well let's hit save
111:05 - whoops save
111:08 - refresh do i need i don't know if i need
111:10 - to reload it but let's reload it
111:14 - beautiful okay so now i have the webcam
111:17 - showing up
111:18 - now how do i get this new model
111:22 - um and let's go over here and let's look
111:24 - for it over here
111:27 - um under
111:32 - hand pose here it is hand pose so by the
111:35 - way this is bomani mclendon who is one
111:37 - of the
111:37 - lead maintainer of the ml5 website who
111:39 - ported this particular model
111:41 - so i want to get essentially this to
111:43 - work
111:44 - um so we can see here
111:47 - what do i do i give it um
111:52 - i call ml5 hand pose i can
111:55 - optionally give it the video so that the
111:57 - model is sort of tied with the video
111:59 - a set of options and a callback let's
112:03 - let's grab this and go to the web editor
112:08 - i'll make a variable called hand pose
112:12 - i'll say hand pose equals ml5
112:16 - video
112:19 - options let's just give it an empty
112:22 - object right now we'll look at that
112:23 - later and then
112:24 - model ready
112:28 - let me move this over and then i'll
112:31 - write that callback function
112:33 - model ready console.log
112:37 - hand pose loaded so let's see what
112:39 - happens here if i run this again
112:48 - um maybe it's oh yeah just took a while
112:51 - to load
112:52 - so ml5 behind the scenes is going to a
112:55 - cloud
112:56 - server and retro
113:11 - okay so we've got the model and then
113:14 - presumably the other thing i can do now
113:17 - if i go back to let me close this
113:20 - here there is a predict function
113:24 - where i can give it the input media and
113:26 - get the results there's also an
113:28 - on so i think there's multiple ways of
113:32 - this is one of actually a points of
113:33 - confusion for me in working with the ml5
113:36 - library
113:37 - um i there's
113:40 - the models sometimes have different ways
113:42 - of working with
113:43 - them you can call predict on a
113:46 - particular like i want to predict the po
113:48 - hand pose
113:49 - on a particular image and if i'm doing
113:51 - the video i might ask for it to predict
113:53 - on this video frame
113:54 - then when i get the results give it the
113:55 - next video frame but i think this is a
113:57 - way of doing it
113:59 - where it will just look at the video
114:02 - over and over again and whenever it
114:05 - finds a new prediction will give me
114:06 - those results so i think this will make
114:08 - sense for me to use
114:09 - this style of working with ml5
114:12 - oh and that needs to go obviously like
114:15 - right here
114:16 - so basically and i think
114:19 - probably i should do this in a good
114:22 - practice would be to do this in model
114:24 - ready
114:25 - so the idea is
114:28 - let me load the model tie it to the
114:32 - video
114:32 - obviously i might want to configure it
114:34 - with some options which are empty right
114:35 - now
114:36 - and then once the model is ready
114:39 - handle the prediction event and just log
114:42 - the results
114:43 - so let's see what happens when i run
114:45 - this now
114:51 - right and so presumably uh
114:54 - in that object is going to be a lot of
114:57 - stuff about my hand
114:58 - let's try to look at it over here
115:02 - oh no i'm not getting sorry i'm happy no
115:05 - stop
115:05 - why why um okay
115:11 - so what do i let's see if i can um
115:14 - look at one of these you can see this
115:17 - right
115:19 - so this is when it finds a hand it
115:23 - offers me up this
115:24 - object the object has a confidence that
115:27 - it's seeing a hand
115:29 - it offers me a bounding box of the hand
115:31 - so an
115:32 - x and y and an x and y of the top left
115:36 - and bottom right of the hand
115:37 - these numbers seem rather high for my
115:41 - image being sized at 320 by 240
115:44 - and i'm also not sure why it's negative
115:46 - although maybe it's guessing that the
115:47 - hand is extending past the canvas we'll
115:49 - have to like
115:50 - experiment with that landmarks
115:53 - these are the xy z positions
115:56 - of these particular landmarks on the
115:59 - hand
116:01 - um wow this is really wild annotations i
116:05 - can look at the thumb
116:07 - these are maybe all the sort of parts
116:10 - that are on the thumb
116:11 - wow look at this ring finger middle
116:14 - finger index finger
116:15 - pinky i love my pinky
116:18 - and palm bass fascinating that all this
116:21 - stuff is in there
116:23 - so i suppose what i could do quickly
116:26 - is just iterate over all of the
116:28 - landmarks i'm not sure what to do with
116:30 - the z
116:30 - location right now i could use that to
116:33 - describe maybe the size of a circle
116:35 - i'm also wondering why it doesn't
116:38 - correspond
116:40 - to the um
116:43 - the actual size of my the video image
116:46 - that i've given it
116:48 - um and whether maybe it's using the
116:50 - native video size
116:51 - let's let's investigate this a little
116:52 - bit further um
116:55 - which is to say let's look at the
116:58 - example that i'm
116:59 - ultimately trying to write here
117:04 - video model ready on pose
117:08 - model ready draw key points look through
117:11 - all the predictions
117:11 - go through the landmarks ellipse key
117:13 - point zero one not using the z
117:17 - and keeping it at six forty by four
117:18 - eighty so there might be um
117:21 - i don't know whether this is my mistake
117:22 - or ml5's mistake or a bug or not
117:25 - but to me it looks like it is uh
117:28 - returning
117:28 - the xy positions based on the fact
117:32 - that the video the source image would be
117:34 - uh 640 by 480.
117:36 - so just for argument's sake right now
117:40 - i'm gonna um
117:43 - make the canvas 640 by 480 i'm going to
117:46 - comment this out
117:47 - and actually let's not draw
117:51 - let's see what we get
117:58 - oh whoa the camera went off that's so
118:02 - weird
118:03 - why did that happen again like it's
118:05 - plugged in it's charging
118:09 - i think the issue is i let the battery
118:13 - drain
118:14 - and it just like it can't keep up
118:17 - well we'll see how it does
118:23 - okay
118:28 - um okay so let's see here
118:34 - if i can do something similar so what i
118:36 - want to do
118:37 - is do i'll create uh
118:43 - um i don't know what to call it the um
118:48 - let's call it like the hand talk to the
118:52 - hand people
118:53 - um the hand
118:57 - equals results so i'm just always going
118:59 - to store the results in there and then
119:02 - in draw
119:05 - what did we say was in there when i
119:08 - looked there was
119:08 - something called landmarks
119:14 - um
119:16 - i have one was an object oh there could
119:18 - be multiple hands
119:21 - so let's call it uh hands
119:27 - so let's just say if
119:30 - hands that means that there's at least
119:33 - one
119:35 - our hands dot length is greater than
119:37 - zero let's just do that
119:40 - then let hand equal hands index zero
119:44 - so i'm just going to look at one right
119:46 - now and
119:48 - i want to look at the landmarks
119:52 - i should i should learn how to use
119:54 - object destructuring
119:56 - right is this how i would do it
120:00 - is that object destructuring so i'm
120:03 - pulling out
120:04 - the landmarks property from hand zero
120:06 - and putting it in its own variable
120:09 - and then i can look through
120:22 - every single one
120:26 - and it's an array and i can say
120:29 - uh oh there's gotta be can i do this
120:34 - is that also object destructuring can
120:37 - you do that if it's an array
120:39 - does that work i don't know
120:42 - let's see if that works and then i'm
120:44 - going to say
120:45 - uh phil 255 ellipse
120:49 - xy16
120:52 - that can't be right right
120:57 - i don't know i never i don't ooh okay
121:00 - cannot read property length of undefined
121:02 - so i guess in in
121:03 - when it starts it has the model hasn't
121:05 - loaded so let's
121:07 - this is maybe a silly way to do it but
121:08 - i'll do this
121:11 - oh my camera went off again i'm sorry
121:13 - about that everybody i'm just gonna
121:14 - i'm gonna let it okay
121:19 - whoa okay first of all it's insane how
121:22 - fast this is
121:25 - that is crazy how fast that is
121:29 - uh wow i'm shocked
121:33 - oh i sh i don't know why i'm
121:37 - deciding only to do one
121:41 - let's say
121:50 - hand of hands
121:54 - this is very weird what i'm doing my
121:57 - variable naming is really leaving a lot
121:58 - to be desired
122:01 - and then uh
122:05 - it's bothering me the way it auto
122:06 - formatted that so i'm just gonna say
122:08 - this
122:10 - no destructuring for me okay let's try
122:14 - is that right let's try running this so
122:16 - what could i do with this
122:19 - i mean
122:23 - okay come on let's see one hand oops
122:28 - one hand
122:32 - i can't see can i how come i can't get
122:33 - two
122:37 - what did i do to not
122:40 - if hands
122:43 - shouldn't i have gotten two if it sees
122:45 - two let's uh
122:52 - well my fan is computer fan is going
122:54 - crazy
122:55 - uh cannot read property length of
122:57 - undefined okay
122:59 - oh stop stop
123:06 - yeah different hands should be different
123:08 - colors for sure but i'm not sure why i'm
123:10 - only seeing
123:10 - one hand one
123:21 - oh maybe i have to set the options for
123:23 - multi or something
123:26 - i mean so what were the
123:30 - um what were the options
123:34 - and i also want to do the 3d stuff
123:38 - uh and i like that there's semantic
123:39 - groupings that i could color different
123:41 - parts of it
123:42 - and this whoops the camera is still
123:44 - sorry that i'm not showing myself i'm
123:45 - gonna let the
123:47 - camera kind of warm itself up a little
123:49 - bit
123:50 - uh so
123:53 - flip horizontal max continuous checks
123:56 - detect
123:57 - confidence score threshold
124:02 - interesting i don't know what if i'm
124:04 - doing something wrong or if it's just
124:06 - not able to get both hands let's try
124:09 - moving my
124:10 - moving a little further back from the
124:12 - camera that sometimes will do the trick
124:16 - here's one hand
124:26 - it's not mirrored so it's like making me
124:27 - crazy i can't figure out which hand is
124:29 - which
124:31 - well i could still do some interesting
124:32 - stuff with just one hand
124:35 - but i was
124:38 - i i'm wondering why it's not
124:41 - detecting two let's look at these
124:50 - options
124:53 - grab this
124:58 - flip horizontal boolean value for if the
125:01 - video should be flipped
125:03 - i actually would like that max
125:05 - continuous checks
125:06 - infinity detection confidence
125:09 - score threshold a threshold for removing
125:13 - multiple likely duplicate detections
125:17 - uh float representing a threshold for
125:19 - deciding whether boxes overlap too much
125:21 - and non-maximusly
125:23 - okay so i wonder if one of these
125:26 - thresholds would um
125:31 - kind of help like what if i put all
125:33 - these down
125:34 - like if i put detection confidence at
125:36 - zero
125:41 - and i want to actually make this true so
125:43 - if i put the detection confidence at
125:45 - zero it's gonna always think something
125:47 - is a hand
125:48 - like it's finding a hand in everything
125:51 - uh
125:52 - whoa so that was a bad idea let's make
125:56 - it like .25
125:58 - i don't think it's that the second hand
126:00 - has a low confidence
126:02 - can you join the dots on the hand i
126:04 - absolutely could i have to figure out
126:05 - how to do that
126:06 - so one
126:15 - no uh score threshold
126:23 - if i make those thresholds zero should
126:25 - probably i should do this more
126:28 - methodically
126:30 - wants me to join the dots using a line
126:34 - yeah okay i'm going to give up on this
126:36 - and i'm going to ask bomani and sort of
126:37 - research this
126:39 - um but let's let's uh
126:42 - let's let's see what some folks are
126:45 - asking for
126:46 - which is to sort of draw um draw the
126:49 - draw a line and
126:50 - apologies that i'm not showing my camera
126:51 - right now i
126:53 - am waiting for my camera to get a little
126:56 - charge
126:56 - built up um so what can i do
127:00 - well what order so
127:03 - first thing i want to do is actually i
127:05 - want to look at the z
127:07 - values so what are the z values
127:12 - what happens if i just put in the z
127:15 - right here as the size
127:17 - so i recognize this is not what folks
127:20 - were asking for but i want to get a
127:21 - sense of
127:23 - what happened there
127:26 - options is not defined whoops
127:30 - oh i probably could get away without
127:34 - passing it through but let's just put it
127:36 - back
127:37 - the way i had it
127:41 - so look at this so now
127:49 - closer they're bigger further away
127:53 - this month it's really kind of amazing
127:57 - and this is not a precise way of
127:59 - rendering this with
128:00 - three dimensionality but it is working
128:03 - pretty well that's pretty amazing um
128:06 - it's feeling kind of so
128:07 - let's think about joining the dots
128:10 - so one way i could approach that this is
128:14 - not a great strategy but let's just
128:18 - try it begin shape
128:21 - all right hold on let's do this twice
128:28 - let's just join them all with um
128:37 - let's give this a little bit of alpha
128:40 - let me
128:40 - join them all
128:44 - by setting them each at a vertex
128:48 - location
128:50 - so i'm curious what order are the
128:52 - landmarks in
128:54 - we'll find out now in a moment oh
128:59 - this and let me actually
129:03 - just comment out the circles right now
129:05 - just to see it this way
129:12 - okay so this
129:15 - is the arbitrary order
129:18 - it's kind of amazing actually it's in a
129:22 - sort of logical order that almost has
129:27 - so i can actually create a nice
129:31 - enclosed shape
129:40 - like this
129:46 - pretty interesting right so you can see
129:49 - the
129:55 - it's crunching your head and scratching
129:57 - your head
130:00 - it's crunching your head scrunching your
130:04 - head
130:06 - alright that's pretty interesting um
130:10 - take this out we could also
130:15 - look at
130:18 - does it show me uh yeah we could look at
130:21 - the semantic groupings um so let's look
130:24 - at the annotations
130:26 - this will be pretty interesting
130:30 - i'm going to leave that as is and
130:34 - i am going to take this
130:37 - out and let's say uh
130:40 - let group it let annotations equals hand
130:44 - dot annotations
130:46 - and then whoops and then
130:50 - i should be able to
130:53 - get all the keys so let parts
130:57 - equals annotation oh
131:00 - what do i say object dot keys
131:04 - annotations is that how i get all of the
131:06 - properties of an object
131:08 - i think so and then let part of parts
131:13 - uh let uh i don't know what to call this
131:17 - now
131:18 - uh you know i'll call this position
131:27 - oh no it's in the part it's just an
131:30 - array
131:31 - so let yeah let for
131:35 - let position
131:39 - of part and then draw
131:42 - an ellipse you can do this again
131:51 - and draw an ellipse at x y let's
131:56 - let's take is this right
131:59 - did i do this right so what i'm
132:02 - attempting to do
132:02 - is connect all the landmarks with a line
132:06 - then look at each annotation the thumb
132:10 - the finger except the
132:11 - pinky the piggy finger the ring finger
132:13 - the middle finger etc separately
132:16 - and what did i get wrong here
132:20 - uh on un unexpected token oh i have too
132:23 - many brackets
132:25 - okay oops
132:28 - i think my camera should be working
132:30 - again by the way it's had enough time to
132:32 - charge
132:47 - okay i'm back um
132:55 - what's going on here ellipse was
132:58 - expecting a number for the second
133:00 - parameter so i think i'm doing a kind of
133:04 - miserable job of
133:05 - unpacking this object so
133:09 - the annotations
133:14 - is
133:19 - an object where the
133:22 - arrays are grouped by property
133:28 - so this should be an array now of all
133:32 - those properties
133:36 - then oh no no no let that part of parts
133:39 - ah
133:39 - it's just the keys it's just the keys
133:43 - sorry
133:44 - so now i need to go through all the
133:48 - values
133:49 - so um
133:54 - let position of annotations
133:58 - part that's what i'm doing
134:02 - and again this is written in such an
134:04 - awful way and i would not want my
134:06 - example that ultimately
134:08 - would make it a tutorial to look like
134:10 - this
134:12 - but um let's first and thank you pedro
134:14 - for your
134:16 - pie super chat um let's see if this
134:19 - gets me to where i want to go for now
134:24 - okay great so yes i am seeing them all
134:26 - as circles
134:28 - and now and i'm sort of drawing a line
134:30 - and actually
134:32 - probably connecting them i'm realizing
134:35 - makes much more sense for me to now take
134:38 - this particular
134:42 - um let's just not work with the
134:46 - landmarks at all
134:47 - as a full array let's work with them
134:50 - individually
134:51 - and i'm going to go through all the
134:53 - positions and draw them as circles
134:57 - and then also do that
135:04 - again and again this is i'm just getting
135:08 - this to work
135:11 - it's a very awkward way and then draw
135:13 - connect them
135:15 - so now i should see
135:19 - uh all of the circles and all and all
135:21 - the connections for these particular
135:23 - groupings
135:26 - so we can see right each finger and i i
135:30 - should get rid of that close the close
135:32 - doesn't make any sense
135:33 - um anymore and
135:37 - i should say i'm gonna say stroke weight
135:40 - four and what i would like to do now
135:43 - is color give them a different color
135:45 - each
135:46 - so i will go to the coding train
135:50 - color colors where's that website that
135:53 - cj made
135:54 - whoa it was not in live
135:57 - poll it was in
136:00 - is it just in the website no
136:04 - there was a time
136:08 - colors no where did that
136:11 - where did cj make the colors
136:15 - there's that website that coding train
136:19 - did i bookmark it i must have right
136:24 - no no so sad
136:30 - uh
136:32 - i'll just make up some colors
136:35 - pink for pinky is a very good idea um
136:38 - how to trigger an event on thumbs up
136:41 - yeah let's we could we could definitely
136:42 - make that happen
136:43 - so that could be our let me finishing
136:46 - this out
136:48 - um so uh but i just wanted to see them
136:51 - as different colors
136:53 - let's just do um
136:58 - i'll just do it like this um
137:14 - really losing my mind here
137:33 - the super fast color scheme generator oh
137:35 - that's a good idea but i have a coding
137:37 - train color scheme
137:39 - and a website
137:44 - um
137:49 - all right let's see this in action
138:04 - whoops i like this
138:08 - oh it's so like spidery
138:24 - where's my mouse i lost my mouse what
138:26 - i've completely forgotten what i'm doing
138:28 - i forgot that i have stroke weight over
138:30 - here
138:31 - okay fine i'll get this i'll get a
138:34 - coolers dot
138:36 - co
138:41 - uh start the generator
138:46 - okay and
138:50 - copy hex sure
138:55 - i don't want i don't this is not
138:56 - colorful enough for me
139:01 - i want that i want the i want something
139:03 - more colorful
139:05 - okay i'm not a i'm not good at
139:08 - picking colors let's move on let's let's
139:11 - let's comment that i'll come back to
139:12 - that
139:13 - let's make a little thumbs up recognizer
139:16 - so here's the thing
139:18 - i have a whole um i'm gonna find a video
139:21 - for you
139:22 - called pose classifier
139:29 - so this is a particular video tutorial
139:32 - where i use the key points of the pose
139:35 - net model
139:37 - to um
139:40 - to classify poses
139:43 - and oh and thank you violet uh violet
139:45 - gave me the
139:46 - coding train color scheme site so i will
139:49 - pull that up in a second
139:52 - the way that i do this is i make the xy
139:55 - positions of
139:56 - every key point on the body's
139:59 - pose the input to a neural network
140:02 - i collect a data set with a lot of poses
140:05 - paired with labels and then i feed that
140:07 - through the neural network
140:09 - it learns those poses associated with
140:10 - those labels and then it can take new
140:12 - ones
140:12 - and yes and it works quite well this
140:15 - definitely
140:17 - would be a way to do it with the hand
140:20 - pose
140:20 - model and if i had infinite time
140:24 - uh that would be an example that i would
140:25 - build right now in fact you could
140:26 - probably get this code
140:27 - and swap it out really quickly i'm
140:29 - tempted to do that
140:30 - but one thing that i really do like to
140:33 - consider
140:35 - is that is there a way
140:38 - for me to
140:42 - simply analyze a hand pose
140:46 - and determine whether it's thumbs up or
140:49 - thumbs down
140:50 - for example now i know like
140:54 - if i'm all if this point over here
140:57 - is always the highest of all of the
141:00 - other points
141:02 - then maybe it is thumbs up
141:06 - if it is the lowest then maybe it's
141:09 - thumbs down
141:10 - right so certainly using a
141:12 - classification engine would be good
141:14 - but i bet you i can get this to work
141:18 - by just recognizing when the thumb is
141:20 - the highest point
141:22 - or the lowest point so which one is that
141:28 - it's certainly one of the ones that is
141:32 - um
141:39 - um and it is certainly one of the ones
141:41 - that is part of the annotations
141:45 - that is the thumb so let's do this
141:48 - let thumb
141:52 - equal annotations dot thumb
141:58 - boy wouldn't object destructuring be
142:00 - nice here
142:01 - and then let's say fill uh let's make a
142:04 - green
142:06 - let's just draw an ellipse
142:09 - at thumb
142:12 - index zero dot x thumb index
142:16 - zero dot y um
142:19 - that is uh 24. so a larger circle
142:24 - let's see what i get i just want to know
142:25 - which one is it and i could probably
142:27 - look it up
142:27 - but this is the quick way of finding it
142:30 - uh it's that top whoa it did them all
142:34 - that's weird because
142:38 - i am doing something let's take out this
142:44 - let's take out this and let's just look
142:48 - um for
142:52 - see which one it is so i'm not going to
142:55 - draw the other things as circles
143:01 - why don't i see the thumb
143:04 - okay so i made a mistake somewhere
143:07 - ellipse was expecting a number for the
143:09 - second oh there's no dot x
143:13 - these are arrays i'm just thinking
143:15 - they're organized into x y
143:18 - pairs so that might be something oh
143:21 - no no no no no it's not a two
143:24 - dimensional array
143:26 - it's literally wait no the thumb is an
143:28 - array no it is
143:30 - the thumb is an array of an arrays and
143:33 - the first array has an xyz so it is a
143:35 - two-dimensional array this should be
143:36 - right
143:37 - we're about to find out
143:44 - okay so that's the bottom one right that
143:47 - particular the first one is the bottom
143:49 - one
143:50 - how many are in the thumb um
143:56 - i mean i could just hard code it in i'm
143:58 - curious if it'll tell me anywhere
144:00 - let's just guess i think there are
144:02 - probably
144:03 - if we look well when the circles were
144:06 - there i think there were four
144:07 - so let's guess it's index three
144:10 - i think there were four key points like
144:12 - along the thumb like one two three
144:14 - four i think
144:17 - there we go i got the top one so i found
144:19 - the top of my thumb
144:22 - so now let's do the following
144:29 - thumb t x is this
144:35 - t y is this
144:39 - and i'm going to say a boolean thumbs
144:42 - i'm going to assume thumbs up
144:46 - is true oh no i don't need to say
144:48 - boolean
144:49 - and i'm going to assume thumbs
144:53 - down is also true then as i'm going
144:56 - through
144:57 - all of the other parts
145:02 - um and i shouldn't do there's no reason
145:04 - for me to do this by annotation
145:07 - but since i'm already doing that i can
145:09 - say if
145:10 - and i only need the y sorry i only need
145:12 - the y
145:13 - i only need the thumb y if
145:16 - this particular y of another point is
145:20 - above
145:23 - is above the thumb thumb y then
145:27 - thumbs up can't be true anymore right if
145:30 - something else
145:31 - is higher than the thumb then thumbs up
145:34 - is not true
145:36 - else if y is less than
145:40 - thumb y if this y is below then thumbs
145:43 - down
145:44 - is not true
145:48 - so then when i get to the end
145:53 - let's say this text align
145:57 - center center text size
146:00 - 64. if thumbs
146:04 - up text
146:13 - come on paste it in there my goodness
146:16 - what are you doing to me there we go
146:17 - text
146:18 - thumbs up with divided by two
146:22 - height divided by two else if
146:25 - thumbs down
146:29 - let's draw
146:34 - this one
146:38 - so i believe
146:41 - i should get okay what's happening here
146:44 - uh got some weird errors
146:48 - thumbs up is not defined what did i call
146:50 - these oh
146:53 - oh i'm in the for loop let's
146:57 - well yeah we shouldn't be drawing it
147:02 - we're going to do this within
147:03 - not the for loop but within the if
147:04 - statement if
147:06 - there is a hand to be detected
147:15 - um there's only ever one hand
147:19 - so i'll just do it here
147:23 - now let's try running this again
147:32 - thumbs up thumbs down
147:36 - thumbs up thumbs down
147:42 - i'm going to blow your mind now
147:46 - i'm going to take simon's suggestion and
147:49 - i'm going to say
147:50 - uh like i think that's like much bigger
147:53 - and i'm going to
147:57 - just draw the video
148:02 - i am going to hide this
148:07 - and i am going to
148:13 - comment this out
148:17 - save now watch this people
148:26 - oh wait i got an error wait what
148:29 - happened
148:31 - image was expecting oh oh okay
148:34 - if video
148:40 - i knew i could make something successful
148:41 - happen with the new ml5
148:44 - no what oh no it needs a place
148:48 - that's not the problem sorry
148:51 - needs to be at zero zero
148:59 - okay here we go everyone
149:06 - i mean look how accurate this is i was
149:08 - gonna say no machine learning involved
149:10 - but it's not true
149:11 - because i have a pre-trained model
149:15 - looking for thumbs up or thumbs down but
149:17 - i didn't have to train a neural network
149:18 - to recognize the difference between
149:20 - these poses now if i want to do like
149:22 - rock paper scissors i would
149:25 - definitely want to use a neural network
149:27 - because people could make scissors in
149:29 - all sorts of different directions and
149:30 - orientations
149:31 - but thumbs up versus thumbs down and i
149:33 - should debounce this
149:35 - so it only registers if it's like um
149:39 - if it only registers if it's um
149:43 - and i'm still drawing that green dot
149:46 - which i didn't realize i was drawing
149:49 - let's just take that out
149:52 - what about pointing left so here's a
149:55 - couple things
149:56 - one is like hey thumbs up
150:00 - thumbs down this is thumbs down right
150:03 - because
150:04 - somehow the thumb is lower than all the
150:05 - others so it is a bit of a problem
150:10 - if uh you know i'm not it's not a very
150:13 - sophisticated way of doing it
150:14 - but i would like to point out that it's
150:17 - very easy
150:18 - to sort of let yourself go into a place
150:20 - where you think
150:21 - you must use the most sophisticated
150:24 - advanced
150:25 - technique for determining something when
150:27 - actually
150:28 - just checking the y location of the top
150:30 - of the thumb versus the bottom
150:32 - of the rest of the fingers is quite
150:34 - accurate
150:36 - it bothers me i need to debounce this
150:40 - because i would like this to be and i
150:41 - would like to clean this up a little bit
150:43 - so this could be an actual example
150:46 - so first of all let's say
150:52 - i don't want to count it so let's do
150:54 - let's do a counter
150:56 - up counter down counter
151:01 - okay and so if
151:05 - thumbs up up counter
151:08 - okay so i'm gonna do this up counter
151:14 - again there's a more elegant way of
151:16 - doing this
151:19 - but i think this will work i could do
151:22 - that fading thing but i'm gonna do it
151:23 - differently
151:25 - um up counter plus plus
151:29 - else up counter minus minus
151:35 - and then if thumbs down
151:38 - down counter plus plus and all of you
151:41 - are thinking of a million other ways to
151:43 - write this code
151:44 - i get it uh
151:51 - then i'm gonna say up counter
151:54 - equals constrain up counter between 0
151:57 - and let's say 100
152:02 - that let's constrain down counter as
152:04 - well to within some range
152:06 - and then now i basically want to say if
152:08 - up counter is greater than 50
152:10 - else if down counter is greater than 50.
152:13 - so i only want to consider it a thumbs
152:16 - up or a thumbs down if it's sort of
152:17 - stably been there
152:19 - for and maybe i should say more than if
152:20 - it's 30 frames per second
152:22 - about one second and so it might
152:25 - actually make sense
152:26 - for me to sort of think in pack into
152:28 - multiples of 30.
152:30 - um let's let's see if my logic is not
152:34 - totally flawed here
152:39 - all right um
152:42 - whoa
152:46 - so why the flickering
152:55 - hmm
153:04 - like just if it's halfway it's got to
153:06 - like count it's got to be there for 30
153:08 - frames
153:10 - is my are my like values too large
153:14 - this is kind of a silly thing that i'm
153:15 - doing but i just
153:18 - oh and let's make these separate
153:28 - thumbs up
153:31 - increase the up counter otherwise keep
153:33 - them between 0 and 60. i don't
153:35 - understand what the
153:37 - flickering was
153:40 - yeah i mean console logging the counter
153:42 - would makes
153:46 - what have i done
153:52 - something wait
154:00 - weird okay fine
154:08 - what have i done i'm trying to add like
154:10 - a simple extra thing to this
154:33 - thumbs down is never going down
154:38 - weird
154:43 - oh whoops
154:46 - oh when did that change
154:51 - that should be wait
154:54 - if i don't know what did i did i mess
154:58 - that up
154:58 - and that's so weird
155:02 - this makes no sense
155:18 - so i think i have the right idea but my
155:21 - i don't know why
155:22 - i don't know when that changed
155:25 - um and
155:29 - yeah that that also would make sense
155:33 - to do this i mean this this has gotten
155:36 - really ridiculous
155:38 - but i also think that um
155:44 - you know it doesn't need
155:47 - so much
156:02 - you know this is this is silly what i'm
156:04 - doing i mean it's not silly it's
156:06 - it would make the interaction theory
156:07 - much more elegant but
156:26 - well it it just worked so much better
156:27 - without this extra debouncing
156:49 - i think actually what it should be i'm
156:52 - now realizing
156:53 - is or i don't know
157:05 - all right i gotta put this away i'm
157:08 - gonna put this away
157:10 - the the
157:14 - there's an elsif oh yeah
157:18 - uh yeah but i think the elsif is fine
157:20 - because
157:22 - if it's less than t y it can't be
157:24 - greater than
157:30 - so
157:42 - anyway it's pretty good i think maybe i
157:44 - thought i was going to make it much
157:45 - better
157:46 - um let's just um
157:52 - so okay i'm going to wrap this up
157:56 - it's save you're all going to make much
157:59 - better versions of this
158:00 - thumbs up or down tracker
158:03 - uh detector um
158:07 - and i am going to put this
158:10 - as a link in the um
158:14 - discord uh links uh channel that's part
158:17 - of the live stream
158:18 - right here under links so you can grab
158:20 - that code and try it on your own
158:22 - please make a version of this i think i
158:24 - think it's it's it's after 6
158:26 - 00 p.m here on the east coast and my
158:28 - brain is really fried
158:29 - and so clearly i am not thinking
158:31 - straight and my sort of technique for
158:33 - debouncing this
158:34 - is rather flawed um
158:39 - but um what i really would suggest doing
158:44 - is taking a look at this particular
158:47 - video
158:47 - i'll post a link to this as well
158:51 - hello and welcome to another um so i'll
158:54 - post a link to this video
158:56 - what i would love for somebody to try
158:58 - doing
158:59 - is try taking this
159:02 - idea but instead of using pose use
159:06 - all the landmarks of a hand and i think
159:09 - someone in the chat had suggested
159:12 - um someone in the chat had
159:15 - yeah technically when it's equal it's
159:17 - not thumbs up or thumbs down that's a
159:18 - good point
159:19 - um uh
159:22 - suggested like okay you could you could
159:24 - sort of like point and make like a game
159:26 - controller you could you could actually
159:28 - use regression here you could train a
159:29 - regression model
159:31 - basically to extract an angle based on
159:34 - the
159:34 - angle of your hand that would be kind of
159:36 - pretty interesting to do
159:38 - there's so many possibilities there so i
159:41 - i feel like i'm this is like a um i
159:44 - would give this live stream a b minus
159:47 - and i hope to be able to sort of
159:49 - organize and plan for how um
159:52 - i do things a little bit better but what
159:54 - i what
159:55 - if i were to summarize what happened
159:57 - today that you could take
159:59 - with you and sort of ponder and perhaps
160:02 - contribute back is one is
160:06 - i think my methodology of
160:10 - going through pull requests one at a
160:12 - time during a live stream
160:14 - is pretty flawed um especially if a lot
160:17 - come in all at once
160:19 - because they're just going to cause a
160:20 - lot of merge conflicts people are trying
160:22 - different things and it's not really a
160:23 - particularly
160:24 - productive way for me to maintain and
160:26 - grow this live poll application
160:29 - so i think that to do so i think
160:32 - i probably should put that aside for the
160:34 - live streams and just try to like
160:36 - now in the discord maybe we can make a
160:37 - channel about it maybe some of the folks
160:39 - who
160:40 - help with various github repos can help
160:42 - go through some of these pull requests
160:43 - maybe i can work on it find some time to
160:44 - work on it
160:45 - outside of the live stream but i would
160:47 - like to have a goal that by the next
160:48 - live stream
160:49 - that i have a working version of that
160:51 - that i could just use because i think
160:53 - i've done enough of the
160:54 - kind of talking about or explaining like
160:56 - the idea of the live poll application
160:58 - i should just sort of clean it up and i
160:59 - can go through it
161:01 - in a live stream to help people
161:02 - understand how it works but i don't
161:04 - think that's
161:05 - too um that didn't work so well as a
161:08 - segment
161:10 - um i do feel like looking at something
161:12 - new like the hand pose model that just
161:14 - came out in ml5 that i haven't worked
161:15 - with
161:16 - before that to me feels pretty
161:17 - successful um
161:20 - i wasn't able to necessarily um
161:24 - make something super creative with it
161:26 - but i was able to get it working and
161:28 - kind of
161:28 - look through how it works and now i
161:30 - would love for any of you
161:32 - who aren't just immediately going to bed
161:34 - right now not going to sleep
161:37 - and if you're you know working on some
161:38 - projects and stuff today if you try it
161:40 - please share it with me join the discord
161:43 - and in there's a share channel there you
161:44 - can you can tweet at me as well
161:46 - um at shiffman and that i would love to
161:48 - see if anybody kind of gets
161:50 - um this working and certainly what's
161:52 - great about this is this has now helped
161:53 - me
161:54 - potentially go and make a video tutorial
161:56 - an edited video that would then come out
161:58 - about the hand post model
161:59 - um other things i didn't get to i didn't
162:01 - get to looking at glitch and runway i
162:03 - still haven't gotten to the
162:04 - java processing library i wonder if i
162:07 - could i wonder
162:08 - such a bad idea but i almost feel like
162:10 - is that just gonna take me five minutes
162:13 - just let's remember the old days
162:17 - when i used to have a timer uh
162:23 - here we go folks i'm allowing myself
162:27 - the amount of time hold on
162:32 - that the tory the dog song is
162:37 - five minutes and 21 seconds
162:47 - let me just check here is this one
162:51 - yes so i have been say i said
162:58 - oh maybe this is not it where did i
163:06 - recently
163:08 - maybe it was an email must have been an
163:09 - email
163:13 - this hold on everybody just
163:22 - just just hold on a second i'm gonna i
163:25 - wanna
163:25 - i've been some i guess this was an email
163:27 - thread i thought it was a github issue
163:29 - this library http request for processing
163:32 - i really need
163:33 - to use this library for some examples
163:35 - that i imagine making
163:36 - for working with runway and anything
163:38 - else that requires an http request
163:40 - i didn't haven't made a release of this
163:42 - since february 26 2016
163:44 - and there's been a whole bunch of fixes
163:51 - that one and i wanted to just quickly
163:53 - make a new release
163:57 - but let's look at what some of these
163:59 - other i'm doing exactly what i said i
164:02 - wasn't gonna do
164:03 - this doesn't i don't get what this is so
164:06 - this i think i can't merge
164:08 - something about that i'd have to look at
164:10 - more and more detail but i was it was
164:12 - requested that i just quickly make a
164:13 - release of this
164:14 - so i'm going to see if i can do this
164:18 - in 5 minutes and 20 seconds and if not
164:21 - i'll come back to it next week this is
164:23 - definitely not going to work
164:32 - no can't clone a youtube video
164:41 - i'm getting the repo do i have eclipse
164:43 - on this computer
164:46 - sort of
164:53 - oh i had to go away i don't wanna i
164:55 - don't wanna deal with that right now
164:58 - okay
165:11 - allow cookies
165:15 - i can't believe i'm installing eclipse
165:19 - to do this this is definitely not gonna
165:26 - work four minutes and 18 seconds left
165:29 - everybody
165:30 - my download speeds have really got to
165:40 - improve
165:54 - do
166:08 - i'm really using a lot of time
166:22 - okay
166:25 - so if you're wondering eclipse is a
166:28 - development integrated ide
166:30 - that um you can use with a lot of
166:32 - different programming languages
166:34 - um it's the one that i used to use
166:38 - um like every day all the time
166:41 - and um i probably haven't done that in
166:43 - like 10 years
166:45 - but i have used it once or twice a year
166:47 - when i'm trying to like build some java
166:50 - processing thing and i think what i want
166:52 - is this one
166:54 - i did not think that i was gonna have to
166:56 - install eclipse
166:57 - i assumed i had it on this laptop but
167:01 - this is a pretty newish laptop so
167:03 - probably i just never bothered
167:09 - two minutes and 37 seconds then i'm then
167:11 - i'm moving to saying goodbye
167:18 - i i thought that i could do this in this
167:20 - amount of time because i didn't think i
167:21 - was gonna have to download and install
167:22 - the clips
167:27 - um after i sign off you might
167:31 - see a new video about making your own
167:33 - discord bot appear on the coding train
167:35 - youtube channel
167:37 - maybe i'll do it tomorrow morning sort
167:39 - of sunday
167:40 - sunday morning activity
167:47 - it's so dark out now i thought i was
167:49 - gonna go for a jog after i live stream
167:56 - okay this is definitely not happening
168:04 - oh my god what have i done
168:16 - i'm gonna let allow the whole time the
168:18 - time to run out
168:19 - this is a minute and 25 seconds coding
168:22 - challenge
168:23 - timed edition
168:27 - that always worked well in the past
168:35 - hi thomas first time in my stream this
168:38 - has been
168:40 - i'm giving myself now a c-plus for this
168:42 - live stream
168:44 - although the lighting in here is really
168:46 - just excellent right now
169:00 - okay 45 seconds
169:05 - dan do you ever visit tandon well right
169:08 - now i don't visit
169:09 - very many places at all um trying to
169:12 - stay safe and at home and with as few
169:15 - people as possible
169:17 - um but i assume you're asking about
169:20 - the tandon school of engineering i would
169:22 - otherwise be there every single day
169:25 - because the program that i work at
169:26 - called itp is
169:28 - um in the same building as several of
169:32 - the tandem programs
169:37 - nine seconds
169:50 - uh don't copy don't copy don't copy
169:54 - don't copy don't copy don't come
169:55 - just allow cookies a lot of cookies
169:57 - whatever whatever whatever donate no
169:59 - allow cookies yes
170:00 - okay all right
170:03 - boom so um i will come back to this
170:10 - uh so this is step one to be continued a
170:13 - big giant to be continued sign
170:15 - i don't have a button that says to be
170:17 - continued but um the next step for this
170:20 - is to use ant to rebuild the jar files
170:23 - for the library
170:25 - as well as i believe here under
170:27 - resources
170:28 - like i can't remember in maybe
170:30 - library.properties
170:31 - or build.properties this is where i
170:35 - would
170:36 - um update the version number
170:40 - to 0.1.4 so i'd have to make this
170:44 - five and make that 0.4 oh i've got to
170:46 - also
170:47 - get the processing repo and then add
170:49 - that to the build path all right well we
170:51 - got a little bit somewhere here i've
170:53 - gotta go um i'm gonna put on my
170:55 - uh old timey uh uh goodbye
170:59 - uh music i don't even know where that is
171:01 - anymore here it is
171:03 - um so
171:06 - i will leave you with this parting
171:08 - thought um this song has about
171:10 - two and a half minutes on it where i can
171:12 - also take a couple questions in the chat
171:14 - um sherp says i think i saw you once at
171:16 - tandon but i was too
171:18 - shy to say hi i've been watching you
171:20 - before i even got accepted nyu so people
171:22 - do
171:22 - i i have to say i have um in some of the
171:24 - tandem nyu buildings
171:25 - people will come up to me or say
171:27 - something in the elevator in the hallway
171:28 - and so don't be shy please
171:30 - come up and say hi to me next time you
171:32 - see me um
171:33 - and kobe is telling me that that i'm
171:35 - that i haven't done anything i don't do
171:36 - on a regular basis so i guess this is
171:38 - what i do
171:38 - this is what live streaming is for the
171:40 - coding train these days
171:44 - thank you very much thanks everybody for
171:47 - watching the coding train here on
171:49 - a saturday um
171:53 - i will play this uh song um when i go to
171:56 - the uh
171:56 - closing animation so what's coming up
171:58 - next on the coding train
172:01 - you will see the next videos that come
172:03 - out a three-part series on how to make a
172:05 - discord bot
172:06 - at the end of the last video um oh
172:09 - unoriginal pun i i will answer your
172:11 - question it's a
172:12 - pre-made animation that somebody made i
172:14 - can give you more details about that
172:16 - later and
172:16 - unfortunately ask about the intermission
172:18 - animation um
172:19 - the what was i saying
172:28 - ah the discord bot series there are
172:30 - three videos basically by the end of the
172:32 - third video all i have is a
172:34 - essentially a hello world discord bot
172:37 - it looks for the uh a posting of choo
172:40 - choo and replies with a message
172:42 - so there's lots of other things that
172:43 - discord bots can do and you might have
172:45 - some of your own ideas
172:46 - for what those could do so please if you
172:49 - watch those and and you get to the third
172:51 - video leave some
172:52 - requests or questions in the comments
172:54 - about what you think it might make sense
172:55 - for me to demonstrate
172:57 - as i continue that series the other
173:01 - um thing i wanted to mention
173:05 - is that i'm working on two new video
173:07 - tutorials about convolutional neural
173:09 - networks in ml5
173:11 - so stay tuned for those those will be
173:13 - coming out soon
173:15 - and that's all i got uh titan is saying
173:18 - i'm learning these days at code academy
173:20 - um codecademy is a wonderful website
173:22 - there are some alums of the itp
173:24 - program where i teach that work there
173:26 - and i think i have
173:27 - also they have some unanswered emails i
173:30 - have some
173:31 - they they have who has the unanswered
173:34 - emails
173:34 - if i've been sent an email and i haven't
173:36 - answered it i'm the unanswerer
173:39 - the email is unanswered i have the
173:41 - unanswered email but they sent the
173:43 - unanswered email so it's their
173:44 - unanswered email
173:46 - it's really confusing if only i could
173:47 - work that out i might be able to answer
173:48 - my emails
173:50 - all right everybody i'll see you next
173:52 - week on the coding train
173:53 - goodbye
173:56 - oh boy i'm still here
174:46 - this
175:01 - the start of this dot song never forget
175:02 - the vista
175:16 - i'm gonna say once again here we go
175:29 - it's look forward to cartesian
175:42 - coordination
175:48 - auto-tune and the internet will fix that
175:50 - for me
175:55 - sing it with me
176:20 - unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what
176:23 - else
176:23 - is there yes kittens
176:27 - thank you very much kittens and rainbows
176:29 - and cupcakes notice that
176:30 - look what i get i'm really losing my
176:33 - mind
176:34 - okay let's do it
177:02 - the kittens kittens and kittens and
177:05 - kittens kids
177:17 - the kittens and kittens
177:50 - i feel just sort of like a nice feeling
177:53 - of relaxation
177:55 - everything's gonna be okay today dream
177:57 - is not broken it has not frozen this is
177:59 - a
178:00 - this is a wonderful thing okay we're
178:02 - gonna do it
178:03 - i'm really getting to something i need
178:04 - my sound effects
178:26 - that was invalid syntax i forgot uh
178:28 - there was one other
178:29 - thing here that i think is important
178:32 - that i will use
178:32 - continuously over and over again all
178:35 - sorts of text generation
178:37 - analysis things that i will use
178:40 - continuously over and over again
178:43 - first thing i need to do is
178:58 - and kittens and kittens and kittens
179:00 - kittens and kittens and kittens and
179:01 - kittens kittens and kittens and kittens
179:03 - and dusty
179:14 - you

Cleaned transcript:

so do do check one two test one two uh checking my audio good afternoon evening morning to all of you uh hi let me know if you can hear me i'll be starting in just a few minutes do do do do hmm hello happy 3 34 pm on a saturday november 7th it is me dan schiffman from the coding train coming to you live from my attic do i look more beautiful today than i usually do i have some new lights and a new setup that i would like to experiment with a little bit here it's been a week to say the least i can't believe that the last time i was here live streaming was halloween one week ago today otherwise known as about 67 years eight months and 31 hours ago i'm very tired and typically i do try to live stream in the morning um but this morning i had a special socially distanced parents versus kids little league masked little league game to play um and so uh that's what i was doing and so but it's i'm actually in a very good mood i'm very tired my brain is barely functioning before i forget let me please thank today's sponsor of the coding train no wrong button there he is brilliant uh brilliant oh that is a website for when you have when you're well rested and feeling ready to learn you can go there and try a lot of interactive exercises they have all these courses in uh so many things related to the kinds of things that i love and try to write code examples around here in the coding train from geometry to maths to neural networks to computer science to algorithms all that kind of good stuff so i definitely encourage you to meow meow there's a new new design new look new set of illustrations on the website check out brilliant.org codingtrain you can sign up there for free um and let's if you go through that link it lets them know that you found it the coding train and then if you would like to unlock all of their content um you uh the first 200 people to do so will get a 20 discount off the premium subscription back to my camera here um let's see let i'm looking over here at my monitor and i think i am positively glowing there is a little bit of an issue with the uh key uh it just my green screen is like uh the camera's a little bit wonky but let's see let's do let's run a little test here i got these new uh lights um elgato not a sponsor but hey i'm very available um let's see done here i'm in my elgato control center on my phone and any moment now um the control panel for these lights should pop up they're connected to my wifi network i literally set this up within the last five minutes ah there we go so i should be able to i've got a key light over here i'm going to press a button it is now off i have a key light air over here i'm going to press a button it is now off look i'm in the dark full of noise my face it is not showing its true beauty now i will turn this light back on and this light back on and uh let's just i'm just curious here this is like an eye test i'm gonna make i'm gonna go all full brightness oh no that's the color temperature full brightness full brightness no that's the color temperature full brightness let's go to 55 000 lumens or k or whatever the stuff means i don't even know 5 000 how do i look too bright too oh too bright let's go back down so anyway i uh could use uh consultant here to help me figure out how to sort of optimally get these lights going but i think this is going to be a big improvement um you know i realized that the placement might not be ideal i am wearing a baseball cap because no one wants to see my hair right now it's bad one of the nice things about live streaming from home from your own attic nobody knows if you showered or not i might have showered sometime in the last week possibly more than once i don't know it's all a big blur i slept also there were some times when i slept there were many times where i'm just like refreshing various browser tabs i'm going to take a deep breath i hope everybody has been taking care of themselves and doing well this week um that you're having a nice weekend it is i'm i'm in brooklyn new york and boy is it a gorgeous day outside i spent the entire day outside until um just now i do have a fan running i think i might turn that off because it's a little noisy for the microphone oh that's turning it higher there's got to be a way to turn this off there we go the fan is now awesome there should be a little less noise microphone should be a little clearer i also am getting a new microphone so soon enough this will no longer be my microphone that's exciting stuff all right what do i have to do today i have to blow the train whistle i have to say thank you to the members through the youtube membership program thing of the coding train it's actually the fact that a lot of people have recently been joining at least in my relative scale um that i felt confident to acquire some new lights to try to make things uh look a little nicer so cheers to you i don't have a really strong plan for today um i do want to read some random numbers i know that unoriginal pun who woke up apparently at 5 30 on a sunday it's still saturday where i am you are coming to me from the future that's very exciting to me has not received their random number yet so i will have to provide an original pun with a random number uh and then i have a lot of news coding train breaking news from the coding trade news desk oh no no no no not that kind of news although that was a lot of news a lot of news my breaking news is there's a new version of ml5js kind of a little bit of a soft release i can't remember if the medium post went up yet or not but um 0.6.0 is there some new stuff in ml5.js i want to take a look at that today i have been working on a new set of video tutorials uh related to convolutional neural networks in ml5.js and maybe i'll look at some of the examples i've been working on for those everything's taking me a really long time these days so apologies for not a lot of new sequence tutorial content that's come out um but there are three how to make your own discord bot videos just waiting they're actually on the channel you can find them right now but i have to like flip a couple switches turn a couple keys press a few more buttons and they'll be available for you to watch they're right now sitting at members only i'm still finishing up the captions for one of them and a few minor details so those will be happening uh i don't know i might just release one of them right after i finish live streaming which will be at around 5 30 p.m today i'm trying to speak slowly and calmly today i was a little bit too crazy i think last week on halloween to be frank so maybe today i'll be a little a little more of the usual regular everyday coding train choo choo ah the other thing's on my mind i have been working with runway ml um and trying to uh and creating a new template on glitch for you to use hosted machine learning models with runway ml as well as hide your api keys in a emv file using glitch so much stuff that's something that i've been sort of putting together i would like to show you that i hope someone's keeping track of this list because i'm not just making it up as i go i think what i'm actually going to start with is i need to update the http requests library for processing that's gonna possibly be the most one of the more boring things i've ever done in the live stream uh you could turn it off now come back a few hours i won't still be here but i'll probably still be trying to figure out how ant works again an eclipse so that i've got to work on and so i started ml5 processing and community contributions by the last message in the discord is from bruno it just says the lights look great and every time i look over i see that message the lights look great and i think ah the lights look great i feel like maybe i turn them up too bright are they too bright do i need to make them warmer cooler i don't know i don't know i don't know all right um what is going on now let me move over to my fancy laptop computer machine thank you again to brilliant as the sponsor of today's live stream look look at the key i feel like with these new lights the green screen key is like well it's not flawless oh thank you simon the live poll that's actually very high primarily up on my list something i don't know if you can hear it when my children start to get loud can you hear them they're downstairs i can hear them very clearly but i don't think it makes its way into this microphone computec is asking about discord bot with discord.js let's just have a looksee here my computer's not working how do i open up a web browser there's a web browser uh let me move over here um we move this here so we see our nice masked sun i'm gonna go to thecodingtrain.com brand new on the coding train whoa ah well first of all no that's not brand new breaking news here on the coding train news desk i've got something i know there's nothing in my ear i i'm pressing there is there's this in my ear but no no i don't have a producer can't do math check the map producer talking to me news stuff just me just me here uh more no learning discord bot so the first two are actually right here and one of the things i'm excited to share with you is this new uh thumbnail design there is a new coding trained character choo choo the bot there's a little bit of a problem with the choo choo bot name which is there's actually on twitter there is a wonderful uh twitter bot called choo choo bot already uh which um tweets uh just little uh random uh emoji train themes i'm just the only thing that i'm sad about this because it's like the greatest thing ever is that i didn't make it myself so maybe i shouldn't be using the choo choo bot name but certainly on twitter this is choo choo bot but my discord bot is choo choo bot so again i will maybe flip the switch to these after the live stream today to make them public but um if you are a member they're available and they're coming and the third one should be you know tomorrow monday tuesday the third one we're actually start getting and writing code that will be available okay um now let's begin let's begin with our ceremonial reading of the random numbers find my book unoriginal pun it's time it's time to find you a random number oh this is a really interesting one it's where my eye was drawn to immediately it's on page 97 it is row 4815 column column seven and it is the random number three thousand four hundred all right that is unoriginal puns new random number now let me find where i last left off in our book story time here on the coding train um i believe it is here it was halloween oh it was last week exactly seven years ago on october 31 2020 row 12 column 15. that's right i'm just still here on the first page just on the first page of this book this whole book i don't know i'm not gonna am i ever gonna get to the second page obviously not if i keep talking like this row twelve column five seventy thousand seventy eight eighteen thousand four hundred and seventy five forty thousand six hundred and ten sixty eight thousand seven hundred and eleven seventy seven thousand eight hundred and seventeen eighty eight thousand six hundred and eighty five forty thousand two hundred eighty six thousand five hundred and seven fifty eight thousand four hundred and one thirty six thousand seven hundred and sixty six 67 951 90 364. 74 493 nine thousand six hundred and nine eleven thousand and sixty two ninety nine thousand five hundred and ninety four sixty seven thousand 348. just in case you thought that this was something that you might be watching with any actual useful content just wanted to make it clear this is the vibe okay it's a mood that's that's what that's what people say these days the kids that's they are called what was the last number i read 99 817 no no no no no wait where was i wrote 12 column five no i think i got to 67 348 so i think i'm on row 14 column two row 14 column 2. uh next random number row 14 column 2. so in case you're wondering what is this over here this is the coding train discord it is where the community comes together to chat with each other about all sorts of things um and i encourage you to join you can actually join by going to thecodingtrain.com discord or i just press the button and the uh a direct link to the uh discord invite should show up in the chat as well so please come on and join the water is warm and fuzzy there are random numbers to be had there is code to explore it is what it is all right now let's look at some community contributions one of the things that the coding train discord bot created by this stream chat to stream chatbot thing is i could say exclamation point wheel and it will take me to the uh community the wheel of community contributions which we will now do on the first segment of the coding train here live i will take a look through let me refresh this page uh i will take a look through this wheel of community contributions and i will spin that wheel like this and wherever it lands we'll take a look it's something that somebody made from the coding train it's usually by david snyder it has been submitted to the coding terrain website uh for every video and challenge and example there's a place where you can make your own version of it and submit it this one is called amplitude frequency phase and i shall uh click on it and view it and this one is uh ah based off the fourier series coding challenge and it is contributed by abdul halig abdul thank you for participating in this thing that we do where we like to try to be creative and make stuff with our code and share it with each other um and i'm so excited that yours was picked just now for me to get to look at experience so i am going to click on that and go over it looks like it was made in the whoa oh my goodness this is really cool this is awesome all right so this looks like it is the fourier a fourier series that is approximating a square wave um this is covered you know extensively in the particular video that i made on the subject but it looks like what abdul has added is an ability to alter the visualization based on a set of parameters and properties so i i'm gonna have to sort of speculate and wonder like what is this even let me minimize uh discord here it is kind of in the way um so this must be one of these must be period or frequency or offset or something like that i don't know what the zero is and then there's some like sliders here one thing that i can kind of make sense of is square versus soft tooth versus phased square so let's just look at that here's a approximation of a sawtooth wave uh which looks more like this diagonal pattern coming up and going down oh i loved how it just kind of like stopped there for a moment why why why must i get notifications on my wrist while i'm live streaming all right that's a sawtooth wave let's look at the phased square wave what's a phase square wave versus a square wave it looks like the top and bottom sort of peaks and valleys of the wave have its own kind of variable oscillation to them let's go back to square and see if we can understand what these sliders do so this is um ah this must be the number of sort of iterations uh that uh that are used to approximate the wave so we can see it is much more square let's move this back down to like a sort of middle point um now let me take a look at what this slider might do zooming in and out it looks like or no just increasing the amplitude it's not zooming it's uh it's i think it's just altering the amplitude i'm not sure why i'm yeah because as the amplitude grows the radius of this first what are these called epicycles circular loops rotational patterns whatever the word might be i need more camera space for my arms i'm really in this tiny little box here i want to be able to gesture further up but i can't someday i'll i'll figure that out uh my other setup where i record the tutorials i have so much more green screen space to work with than here in my attic um now so that's cool to see let's put this on let's see what this one is and this is the um well certainly the period or the frequency of the wave the period being i always get this wrong the period is the amount of time it takes for one full cycle of the wave and the frequency is the number of cycles of the wave through one unit of time so they're in there the frequency is the inverse of the period um this is wonderful thank you for this excellent work i love to this is what i really like to one of the things i really like to see with my coding challenges is i'm usually like sort of rushing to just get something working up on the screen and i'm hard coding in various parameters and variables and thinking about how you might thoughtfully create an interface to alter the different parameters of a system really allow other people to explore the algorithm the generative process more deeply and so i think this is a really excellent example of that i might suggest if i may be so bold here is the uh moment of critique the constructive positive the compliment sandwich if you will because i think this is wonderful and i'm just gonna say it's wonderful again in a moment and here's what i might suggest abdul is that for me looking at this um i need a little bit more hand holding so i would love some labels to know what these various sliders do uh something that could be an interesting thing to think about are there like are there some presets that i that are sort of known presets that would allow me to sort of quickly see how different parameters might uh lead to specific kinds of results um but this is uh wonderful i i really love it all right so thank you abdul a big ring the bell for you and we will move on to look at another community contribution we are spinning that wheel and we are landing on chin scratch emoji editable ah editable this whole time i'm looking at that thinking what does it mean for the game of life to be edible this is gonna take me a minute the animals don't need the game of life don't eat me game of life no no editable i think i have a sense of what that means let's take a look at the editable editable game of life by uh kobe uh kobe a frequent contributor uh and help maintainer manager person of the coding trained discord created this editable game of life and i'm also noting in the chat here that uh k weekman pointed out that it is nanowrimo that is relevant for coding terrain i knew that and i sort of forgot about that i would love to touch on that or talk about that um in a little bit okay yes yes yes by the way now you know what you have to do this weekend program your own edible game of life maybe oh you could wouldn't it be nice if i ever have another birthday which presumably i will i want a game of life cake it just has like a game of life pattern so if i don't really like cake maybe you could make me a nice like sort of vegan carrot cake not too much sugar high in you know you use some whole wheat flour maybe it's kind of my speed now back to the game of life again uh editable game of life let's take a look at this so i'm going to assume here that what the idea of it being editable it's kind of like when i have the metaballs coding challenge that i just couldn't stop seeing it as meatballs maybe i have like i ate a very large meal at like 2 30 which is one of the reasons why i had to push this back because i hadn't eaten all day so i'm not hungry i'm sleepy i'm very sleepy and i'm surprised how many words are able to come out of my mouth in sequence based on how sleepy i am um but let's click around and let's edit this game of life so now what i'm wondering is am i not seeing ah okay let's shrink it here so what i was looking for is when is it going to activate so i can create my own pattern by clicking on these and what does this slider do maybe that's like a speed once i play it but it's not actually going from generation to generation so maybe the game of life is unfamiliar to you first of all um the game of life was invented by john conway who passed away um this year um from complications with the coronavirus which is um very sad uh john conway i think he was i don't know if he it was had reached 90 years old but he was i believe in his 80s very well known mathematician who pioneered a lot of things famously hated maybe that's not the right words to use but famously sort of um was maybe frustrated with people's interpretations of the game of life might be the right way to characterize it uh maybe some of you could provide some resources or writings about uh his thoughts on the game of life in the chat i'm i'm uh um i don't wanna i don't wanna uh mischaracterize his actual opinion on it but it is a system that i really fell in love with as one of the first generative systems that i learned about it is a grid of cells every cell has a state on or off as visualized by black or white and the next state is a function of its neighboring states um so let's see what happens with this particular configuration i'm going to hit play and i'm guessing that this is the speed because if i ramp this up it's going to go faster now this does not look like the game of life to me this distinct i don't know if kobe or saint plays 82 simon said he died at the age of 82. um this does not at all look like what the game of life looks like to me it is i wonder if this is also a variation on the algorithm itself um so i would i don't uh kobe is often i know kobe is on a different time zone so i wouldn't be surprised i don't i don't know who any of you are who are watching this right now at 5 30 a.m or 3 a.m but please make sure you're taking selfcare getting some rest i will live stream with other times in the future mostly i'm just wasting time here reading random numbers so you're not missing anything but um if kobe does show up or if anybody knows uh further context this looks quite different which is one of the things to ring the bell about one of the reasons why i love systems like the game of life and teaching about those systems is not because well reproducing the game of life as its original rules is a moment of wonder and happiness that can be for you um but um what might might find even more thrilling is to invent your own game of life so to speak so what kind of rules can you develop uh create makeup um and i encourage you to do so and i'm getting uh some breaking news in my ear here uh this was a sketch created in a voice chat um yeah so i think this that's what simon was telling me there was a voice chat where this sketch was created okay how about one more it's four o'clock everybody feeling good about one more community contribution because i am here because of you the coding trade community you keep me going you and sanka is that still a thing can you get sanka i like to drink beverages with caffeine in them when i'm very tired and haven't slept all week because one week sometimes lasts a month or a year and that's how this week has been and how the last several months have been the last year has been the last several years have been we're doing another community contribution uh how do i get out of this close whoa and we're gonna spin this wheel by the way in this room is an actual drum kit my son plays the drums he's been playing on an electronic drum kit for the longest time and a friend was moving and giving away their drum kit so now we have a drum kit i do not play the drums but if i could get it set up over here i could try to do my own drum roll all right where do we land troll sweeper now i'm pretty sure that these have been vetted one of the reasons why i can use this wheel is because of the vetting process the community contributions they actually went through two processes one is they were merged as a pull request into the coding train so there was a process of checking them then and then actually these are separately being pulled from a spreadsheet although fun planet if that's the right uh viewer name created this api to all the challenges and so if you are interested in contributing and working on this it is a project that is a community driven and lead project to create this wheel of contributions but let's take a look at troll sweeper no trolls were harmed i assume in the creation of the troll sweeper this was made by klaus klaus class class if you're in the if you're watching today or if anybody happens to know class or know that name how to pronounce it correctly please let me know gil and the original challenge is minesweeper so minesweeper is a game much like the game of life that operates on a grid uh cells can have um i think i made it b sweeper because you know i'm a kind of nonviolent pacifist kind of person and i didn't want to sort of think about bombs blowing up on a grid so i called it b sweeper i think but the original game is about mines and you're trying to find the mines or avoid the mines etcetera etcetera let's take a look at troll sweeper and use shift plus mouse click to flag a troll r to restart okay let's see if i can play and win this game there are 12 of them somewhere okay so i can do shift mouse click to flag one there oh this is just this is flag sweeper there's definitely one there right there's one there and there can't be one here then and there can't be one here then and then there can't be one here here can't be one here or here there has to be one here i know how to play this game this is very scary what if i get it wrong and now we see the trolls i did i did it on purpose i don't know if you noticed i could play again this is fun actually i really like about this um is that sort of moment of surprise when the trolls all appear i think that one of the things i i often wonder about creative coding interactive systems and it might sound corny to say this but you i would suspect that most of you had the experience of watching a film or listening to a piece of music where you had you know really strong feelings whether fear or love or sadness um and can you create those kinds of feelings from interactive systems and i would say here a little shock surprise little moment there when i saw those trolls appear so great work um you know i i would be interesting to think about i mean this is a sort of tried and true game but are there other kinds of variations about how the grid is organized what kind of multiple kinds of characters there could be that you want to find or don't want to find what other kinds of interactions might you consider beyond just mouse clicks could you build this as a physical device i think a lot of possibilities of things you could think about with projects like this okay now i think that's good for our community contributions today i am a happy boy i don't know this song from wherever i download this royalty few music it's called happy boy theme so i'm gonna move on and i think i think i've got to take a look at the live poll because um i don't want to let that project just linger and go nowhere and once we have it really working i think it'll be a very exciting thing to use on the coding train where i can very quickly put up a live poll and have people interact with it and sort of see results live on the screen so let's go take a look at that so for the next little bit i will be taking a look at your issues and pull requests related to the live poll application this is definitely a maintenance day on the coding train i don't particularly want to uh start anything new or look at anything uh new um and mostly i just want to like kind of keep some things up to date and work on a few things that i'm a little bit behind on um so let's see here there are 13 pull requests 13. how many get through 13 pull requests okay let's take a look we'll go in reverse time order and uh take a look here at this pull request from drc let's actually run the live poll just so i can sort of see where it is so what is the live poll application the idea of the live poll is to create a web application where i can quickly spin up a question which has multiple answers people can answer them in real time and using a view of that poll and an overlay in open broadcast studio i'll be able to see the results in real time um as an overlay onto my camera feed here and i'm sure this already exists and i could just use some software to do it but we're trying i'm trying to make my own coding train i'm you know when i say i am trying to help facilitate a coding train one being made um so i'm pretty sure that i have this on the desktop still uh here let's go to the main branch let's just kind of like grab whatever was there from last time uh let's open it up with visual studio code and see what i've got going here and um let's run it let's go to port 3000 and see there we go so this is the poll uh it is both it needs a lot of work um it is both the um the results of the poll and the interface for voting all in one so presumably if i click a and hit vote many times oh my goodness there's already been so so many votes and now i'm gonna go in this i'm gonna freak out i'm going to database db and i forget that i'm using this crazy database thing that doesn't delete the old records okay well i don't know about you but i'm feeling very stressed out right now so that's the idea let's go take a look at what sort of uh pull requests we've got going on here um this is from october 4th wow over a month ago apologies to drc um and thank you um let's take a look here and by the way the um de pam sen i believe is the github user who created the coding train um api so um i figured i would improve on the rest endpoints to use destructuring for the request parameters and update the database call to increment on update rather than searching and updating so this all sounds like a good idea and there's some discussion here how am i really this is hard to do live um okay i really like the new database calls but there are some other changes oh i wrote this 28 days ago resolve the conflicts okay this is how i review pull requests on the coding trade scan over it the button is green which means i can merge it do you hear the haunt the horns honking horns honking all day long cheering loudly in brooklyn is wonderful um so i'm going to click uh merge pull requests um here yeah that's this got sidetracked um this is how i like to do things i don't necessarily recommend this is how you maintain your open source projects it works for me merge pull request and let's just make sure um things work still i will grab the new uh uh the changes oh what i have changes why do i have changes something sad happened i don't i feel like my changes are meaningless i'm going to stash oh i was supposed to i could have squashed it yeah well let's let's go to squash a different one i always like to squash my pull requests and it's very important to not hold any grudges to to be kind and squash those pull requests okay get pull origin mean okay i've got those changes in now let's run it again uh refresh the page looks the same could i clear the database totally i won't do that yet let's keep going through the progress so i think that if i recall correctly um that was a pull request that just cleaned up the code a little bit and used object destructuring which is a way of setting varia or taking an object apart and putting it into individual variables which is very convenient to do in javascript moving along the twitter library is a thing that i need to work on too uh pull requests we're down to 12. okay so now we're going to go back to pull requests and let's go to add a simple oh right now i remember we discussed this so i think this i'm going to hold off on i think i would like to try a different database for this project and so maybe i will let this happen in parallel i'm a little bit afraid to merge this in right now because i'm not super familiar with sqlite and we will we will come back to that one so let's go to pull request number 10 refactor to use a post request oh this is from simon you can create an interface but for now you can use a piece of software called insomnia to make post requests so this also i think is a nice a wonderful um excellent point to raise and discuss that uh i could use this sort of voting with a post request instead of a get request i think i might like to leave it as a get request right now i tend to use those when there is not sort of information that needs to be hidden that's being passed through the request and if the information is coming in in very very small bitesized chunks so the id and the choice are i think can be sort of easily passed through the route i am open to hearing other points of view thank you simon for this i think um let's hold off on this one for right now and keep things simple with a get request so thank you and let's write a little note here um and um i always use my most used emoji of course is the sparkle heart because it's how i feel about all of you who are submitting pull requests and um there we go so now oh we got through another one i don't think i can ring the bell unless i merge it some small fixes um let's see oh there's some conflicts let's take a look at it first so one thing i might suggest um const 219 i haven't done my work here which is to set up the repository with a pull request template which would guide you through the kinds of things that i'm expecting to see in the description so i apologize that's my uh sort of failing on my end but i would say that a good practice is when you submit a pull request if you can write a little bit even introduce yourself um in the description of the pull request that's always helpful for the maintainer of an open source repo let's go look at files changed um oh editor config oh i love this i don't know what it is but i'm desperate to learn how this kind of stuff works because i think you can create these config files that basically control how your code editor works on a project by project basis so i'll keep that adding um dot env to get ignore that makes sense i don't have anything yet that i need to store in env but certainly if i did i would want to add that um and then requiring the env package i'm good with that uh name lowercase is supposed to be lowercase i'll take that these all look fine with me let's see what our merge conflicts are i have my merge conflict theme song which i don't really have but all right everybody it's time just like i like to squash those pull requests i like to resolve all my conflicts oh package.lock this i don't know what to do pause hold timeout uh oh po post i'm being told i'm being told that my point of view on post get and post is is not um the conventional wisdom uh post makes more semantic sense here because it's for sending data i understand i agree i'm probably i'm usually wrong in these cases i i optimize for readability and educational purposes and i think a get is much easier to work with on the client side uh than a post from whatever clients might ultimately want to connect to this live poll so for example let's say we wanted to build a raspberry pi an arduino with buttons to vote um by able to submit our vote through a get request we might make that a little bit easier uh to sort of manage and deal with i might be wrong still okay um i don't know what to do about this uh merge conflict in the package um i know i never understand what packaged lock is it has something to do with like versions and all that and dependencies i think if i just take this out and do this and do this and then that looks right now right did i fix it i mean is there something else i need to oh i think i did that right and i'm being told i'm being told a post is much easier so maybe my thinking is very flawed there i've always thought this way about teaching and in sort of the sort of creative coding rapid prototyping context um who knows if i got that package.lock right i understand i underst i understand what i'm doing i take all the risks and responsibility i'm here to merge to resolve my conflicts and squash and merge so what does squash and merge do if you have not heard of that before so first of all um the the original button is was just this merge pull request what that is doing is it's taking the changes from all of the various commits and here you can see there are one two three four commits and adding them to the history of the project and sometimes within open source projects it's advisable to take even if a given pull request has many different separate commits in them it can be uh useful to squash all of those into one commit so the project's actual history then has the all the change of the pull request within one um one commit and it it you don't actually lose you can still have multiple authors and differentiate these in in various ways it's a very sophisticated system but i do think that kind of does make sense i'll switch to squash and merge don't ask me to explain rebase and merge i'm not prepared for that today maybe another week squash and merge let's do that and now let's uh grab that so by the way the proper way for me to do this would be for me to pull that branch and test the branch locally and then merge or to actually have tests but for me i'm just sort of playfully enjoying this and um see and kind of just enjoying merging them and pulling them and we'll fix it somebody will fix it later this is all for our own i was going to say edification that's a callback um let's run it again oh no okay npm install so there was a new package.env my microphone is really i'm afraid to move the microphone and this is really insane what just happened because i don't know if you can see the light flashing you can see my arm because i just got a very very ridiculously generous super chat i it kind of makes me a little uncomfortable if i'm being perfectly honest uh thank you alexander sapphire i'll read your message uh four years ago i watched your first ever coding challenge video four years later i'm a software engineer consultant and stem evangelist who specializes in web technologies i owe you my career that's that that's got to be a little bit strong but i appreciate it for introducing me to js thank you for everything you do and a lot of heart emojis which of course by the way these kind of messages i uh really uh they do mean a lot to me to get them uh i i love to receive them uh without there's no need to provide a super chat or any kind of donation along with them you can always send them to daniel at thecodingtrain.com i do it takes me a long time to get to that email inbox but i do read all of the messages that come to there eventually you know within a few months my other email boxes are no better but um so please uh thank you for that message and the chat um i will um you have won you don't win anything i mean you've won your whoa camera oh oh no so i got a confession to make here and i apologize for this i installed my two elgato key lights hold on a second here we're gonna this is gonna be fun uh let me go to this uh and now i am just give me a second here everybody this is going to be worth it microphone's still going right okay whoops uh wrong camera here we go um so um this is me uh one of the one of the things that i love is oh you don't see that is this new uh way of just wirelessly getting a feed from my camera um into the live stream and you can see here that's one of the key lights that's the other key life i'll show you my like incredibly messy attic full of toys and various things and the sort of console that i'm looking at and laptop so here i am again um the camera that i use which is this camera here um i keep it plugged in but i thought i got to plug in these new lights i only have two plugs it's fully charged it'll last through a live stream i don't know whether it went to sleep like my cameras used to do all the time on the coding train if you were back from those days welcome again but um or if it actually the battery died so i am now uh walking around um i'm gonna take a look here and see whether it went to sleep or whether the battery actually died looks like it just went to sleep so i think unfortunately no battery exhausted look at that um oh it said uh let's see if we so it said by the way so this is my setup you can see now with a one light um and another light little behind the scenes here uh this is the camera view and battery exhausted so i will i think for the time being unplug one of my key lights to plug the camera back in i need another extension cord oh there's my knee hello everyone i think you're still seeing you probably can't barely hear me because the mic isn't coming through my phone far away now the camera is plugged back in um and it's quite a bit darker in here i probably should figure out how to oh i got dizzy stood up too fast um it should come it still says battery exhausted but it's plugged in now so you would think it's going to come back i guess what i'll do is it it is charging we can see there that it is charging that light's on so i think i'll turn it off and i will just give it um a few minutes um is it time for my break yet probably not this is kind of fun to stream this way i can just move this oops move this over here uh and i'll just put this here there we go all right while it's charging this is uh what was i doing the live poll i was thinking alexander i was going to give alexander a random number but you know what i wanted to say is that i do get messages like this you know oh thank you i got a job because of you or some things along those kind of lines and i i would like to say i appreciate that but i would say to all of you look into yourself you got that job for yourself you found that passion for yourself i'm thrilled to play whatever small tiny role in providing a little help or inspiration along the way but um i you know um really that all of the wonder of expression and creativity with code and the things that you are doing all of that is is comes comes from you and i i i love that you choose to share it with me and that i get to like be a small part of it so thank you okay um i hope that camera goes back on soon what was i doing i installed wait okay random number for alexander um the random number uh we have the book right here uh um i think for a super chat we'll go to the table of gaussian deviates which is uh 1.498 we'll take uh where's that camera right there that's that'll be your camera all right moving along i assume that the camera i'm gonna be able to turn it back on any second how long could it possibly take let's go back to the browser and i merged that another pull request uh refactor oh no we already make the emojis make more sense oh oh how could the emojis make any more sense that they already do they're all trains these make tremendous sense okay let's see uh what do we got here instead of constantly scaling so that the winning option is full of emojis has each emoji represent one vote then after it goes off the screen have each emoji represent five votes 25 votes i like this i like this idea this is very exciting this sounds like a difficult math problem and uh and okay let's see here so it looks like maybe there's some merge conflicts so let's take a look at that i'm going to resolve our merge conflicts um this looks like that'll be fine to keep the max emojis there now as a new thing um and then anything else the number of emojis is is w not being used anymore so is that what was being replaced from simon w was previously used to maybe um in some sort of rendering of the emojis but let's so let's do that let's take this out i think and so num emoji ah i see so this is the process of um figuring out what's 4 30. uh figuring out um what the divisor is based off of how many emojis how many votes there have been overall got it thank you simon this is wonderful so let's uh mark this as resolved commit this merge and then we shall um squash we we've we've resolved our conflicts we're squatching our pull requests everything is so happy today confirm squash and merge okay there we go oh i have something i wanted to uh highlight and mention um today that i that i have to remember to do okay uh but i should do that right now before i forget um all right emerge another polar crest let's try to move more quickly here add a dev script to run nodemon that sounds awesome um uh oh package.lock you are the bane of my existence um let's add uh nodemon should be fine i don't know what i just did but okay whatever well this is bad this is bad no this is bad okay wait wait wait wait wait wait i don't know i think this is right i resolve no remove all conflicts this doesn't i i haven't had this experience before where package.lock gets all wonky can i just delete it and like ignore it and uh i don't want it shouldn't be in git ignore but can't it like work itself out in a different way somebody explained what package.lock was to me before um okay so i think this is good scroll back up i think the camera's gotta have gotten enough juice now by now right so let me go see if the camera has come turning it on it is not telling me the battery is exhausted so it is telling me that the battery is dead but it is staying on and it is plugged in so hopefully it won't uh wow it really lasted so so little okay so i can oh boy i really need that other light huh oh this is so sad this is so all of this expensive hightech equipment i have here and i can't manage to find three plugs i guess i i do have an extension cord that might just be what i need to do because i have many more plugs in this room um please hold let me get that other light plugged in i need to mute myself okay i'm just i'm gonna get my extension cord out i'm running here plugging in extension cord and hopefully i'm not going to unplug something and shut this whole thing down by accident it's plugged in this is like a 40 foot extension cord to go about two and a half feet that i need but now everything's plugged in both of my lights and i return to a brightly lit space okay all right thanks for bearing with me here everybody uh we've got nodemon now um i should read this discussion ah oh so one of the interesting things is um i typically um just install nodemon not as a dev develop dependency but as a global module so it's just like a command i can always run i don't know what the sort of proper um you know sort of socalled proper technique is but let's see what this does so let's squash and merge this one uh get pull origin main oh i can do npm install and let it sort out the files yeah that's what i thought but it's still like um why is it showing up in the uh as a conflict in the pull request like i still have to deal with it there um so let's do npm install now um and let's just see npm run dev yeah so it's running nodemon so by the way i should probably get used to doing this so typically the way that i tend to work is just to like execute a particular javascript file by saying node index.js but in a project's package.json um under main uh it's listed as index.js and these are various scripts that can be run so start is an alias essentially to node index.js and dev is an alias to nodemon index.js in the ml5 library for example there's npn build and nbm run build nbn run start npm run serve like there's all these different things to like build the website to build the library to to there's like a laundry list of things you can run so i should probably get in the habit of demonstrating that and saying npm run start so um but the the nice thing about nodemon is um nodemon or node monitor listens to the files listens like keeps keeps its eye doesn't have any ears or eyes but it tracks the files and if any changes are made it will restart the server all right um let's see here um sorry i know that i know i know that this might not be the most exciting live stream ever but this is really useful stuff for me to do um updated ui um this looks good although i love oh i like this as a trained car now i think i'm gonna start getting into the place where um i can't resolve the merge conflicts anymore because so i love this idea um and i'm sorry that so one thing i want to apologize to people if you were hoping that these pull requests would be part of hacktoberfest i kind of forgot about that and now it is november so if anybody were really had their heart set on this being a hacktoberfest uh accepted pull request and it's like it's i'm entirely responsible for you not getting your tree planted or tshirt let me know maybe i can send you a sticker or something um but um let me just write here apologies i think i need to move a little more quickly here through some of the ones that i can actually implement um i love this and would like what i think what i should be doing is ones that i've reviewed and like the idea of if those get updated after the live stream i shouldn't wait till the next time i'm looking at a live stream to merge it it should just go in more quickly so i hope please let us know sparkle and so let's do that thank you so much for everyone who's contributed um let's move on to um improved poll structure a post for creating a new poll question string option string votes number okay change votes poll idea route to poll poll idea to avoid confusion with vote make necessary changes to work with arrays this all seems really really useful and i really do want to be able to create new polls to test cleardatabase.bdb uncomment create new poll function invocation commented back i really want to merge this so can i resolve these conflicts let's see here um this seems kind of uh silly it's just like silly formatting that got conflicted then this is um the poll id oh merch conflicts are so hard i think maybe maybe this wasn't the best idea for how to sort of like manage and maintain this project i also realized the reason it's getting darker in here and i'm getting more shadowing is the sun is going down and i was really benefiting from the sun shining through the window that's over there i guess i could point this light more this direction or make it a little bit brighter just wanna see if i turn it a little bit if that helps the keying maybe a little bit um all right now oh this is going to be hard so this was the new thing oh oh so so hard can i merge this this is so hard this is so hard okay i want to add this yes so this changed the name from pull pull id to vote oh okay okay okay that makes sense and this just had the object destructuring stuff oh no what what oh right okay i see i think if i'm right that this is the new stuff i want to keep and then i don't need this anymore okay so that's that this is the new poll great so i think we're good and i just need to figure out what the changes are so this is also really um using a new a different branch name would be super helpful here because then i could tell uh if you're like making your pull requests from your own main branch then it's hard for me to see the different branches because they're both called main but i think this is the more recent object destructuring so that can that can be kept in lieu of these two lines and then this if no poll would return error if the choice it's less than the length return and then increase i think this is all good i think it was just that okay i think we're good here so this is going to be exciting to try mark is resolved oh no no oh there's also sketch.js which just has now i think the idea is that it was changed to oh my god oh this is hard okay i think i know what's going on here i think that um de palm sen changed it to pole and simon added max emojis so i want to get rid of votes and keep pull but i want to keep the max emojis and then down here i want simon's new loop here which is replaces this no wait this finds the max votes then this is simon's loop oh my god oh no no no oh boy yes cause oh this is hard i need simon's algorithm to make its way back up here okay i got it now so this is the new way of doing it with poll options and simon let's try to pull simon's code up so let's get max votes and the divisor sorted out that that would replace this and instead of choice of choices the new way of doing it is poll dot votes i this is really insane uh and that's that and then this is fine okay but i need max uh where does max emojis that was already defined up here perfect okay so that's good um that's fixed and now this is i equals zero i is less than poll.options.length and then variables breakdown is this i is index before it was choice which was an alphabet so this should be poll.votes dot votes index i okay 10 and then i think that's right that's the only thing that changes with simon's new algorithm all right we're going to find out we might have to do some more fixing and the white space is all messed up this is going to require some work but this is exciting we're making serious progress here people once again the button is green it means i can click it i'm gonna take a break in a minute and kind of move on from this project uh squash and merge the button is green it means i can push it yeah i'm gonna fix whatever indentation bracket stuff uh now here on my own um so let's go take a look at uh here and i think if i do save whoa right so um whoops ah no ah i want to format the document wait what happened to my pritier uh oh oh no so something is wrong right okay so let's take a look at this clear background pull options oops for loop oh pull the number of votes pull options the actual option okay what's going on here oh let's see am i running the server okay sketch.js line 70 unexpected so i have an error on line 70. do i have an extra aha okay i think it format i might have taken out format on save uh format oh no it is format on safe who knows what's going on all right hopefully now we're good okay uh huh what's happening on the server oh id is not defined index.js 30 line 11. oh i've really i've really done a horrible thing here 30 line uh okay get poll poll id constant id equals await database update what yeah profit mesh is writing ideally after each pull request merge everyone else who raised a pull request needs to update their local copy and resolve the merge conflict on their end and then update their pull crest resolve code yeah i think maybe this methodology is not gonna is not working out for me to try to resolve these conflicts especially when i am not used to reading code that is now written with some of the styles that have that are here but i don't know if somebody um um i don't know if somebody can can catch what i missed this is the this is let's look at this route the idea of this route is we are getting everything from a pole so and what i think let me go back and look at the project uh history for a second because i think the change here um and let's look at the history let's look at the um i think this is the change that i have now messed up so let's look at what was changed here um the id the idea is that this is changed to this oh oh my god oh i'm gonna have to put this aside i'm gonna have to call on the community to save me because i this this is very clear to me what happened in this change um i'm pull this is like pulling out ah i didn't know you could do object destructuring like this pole id id equals request params look at that so this is like i d i d huh pole id id this is the same as what i did here you're getting the id as the poll idea id now i'm getting the id as the poll id so i should be getting this id as the poll id my lights are blinking does that mean that this is supposed to be this and that was my mistake oh wait should you snowden cannot access id before initialization was that the await database update i think i know how to fix this javascript is so crazy i do know how to fix this which is that i can do i don't even understand like where is it getting this stuff from where is it getting choice i i really messed this up i deleted complete functions i really ruined it okay yeah i lost like a whole let's go look at i think what i need to do is look at um this branch here i need to look at the um what was the one that i what i was this one okay let's look at this um let's go back and look at um let's look at dpawn mensan's uh branch so what did what was changed here this is without my messing it up under pull pull id oh maybe maybe this pull request actually had a mistake in it because it looks like uh this looks like what it what i have a reverb do we need a code style guide yeah all right everyone uh it's time to read some brands things have gone awry i'm gonna look at this later i was hoping to get like a nice little win here to like at least have this be able to create a new poll which i'm very excited to have this feature but i uh when your philosophy on on pull request is to just if the button is green to press the button i might need to uh adjust uh adjust my way of doing this also why i sometimes i like to write things even if it's more longwinded without this kind of object destructuring stuff because i find it very hard to read and understand um what's going on but um yeah like if i just go here let's just look at the this is i'm in oh no no no no no no go here no i'm in the wrong place ah what i want to do how come it's not taking me to where i want to go i want to go here there we go and i want to look at what branches there main and i want to look here this is what i want to see right this is this is the way the function is written here it looks the same right oh no error oh no there's air here id is not fine so i think there's a mistake in okay well where was id defined i'm very stubborn as you all know and i i sometimes have a lot of trouble ah oh i see i did everything right but for this new system to work the create new poll function has to be called for there to be an id because that create new poll returns id well now let's go and look at let's look at the instructions that i didn't read uh and then i'm really pulling that putting this aside uh where was it did i did i close it um is this one okay to test clear database dot db uncomment create new poll all right so let's let's follow these instructions database.db i deleted everything from it we're going to then uncomment create new poll function invocation then comment it back after poll is created in sketch.js fix all poll ids okay 9 and 32. interesting so now there's a pull and an id though right because there's a whole new database structure oh there's a whole new database structure so now here line 9 that's the new id which is line 10 and line 32 which i guess here hopefully now oh wait no i have to uncomment it uncomment create new poll run it again ah still id is not defined i think i think there's a mistake database dot update returns an object result of the function is what you're destructuring right right that i sort of understood okay okay so if i really want to solve this which i insist on doing i want to do the following let me let me be stubborn and solve this and then i will take my break um right can't i do this right shouldn't i be able to look at it and see what it's giving me back now um if i do this right i just want to like what's that object that comes out but yeah still there's something here that doesn't there's a thing that doesn't make any sense to me here but i will humor me for a second here yeah it's this like am i supposed to set like oh wait a sec wait a second wait a sec wait a sec yeah no no why oh i know it what got deleted by accident yeah this whole thing yeah hello people this this this was missing where did that that got deleted somewhere right i have to pull the particular id that's the whole point oh this was a disaster choice is not defined there's no choice that's up here oh i'm in the wrong place this these functions got merged oh everything's gone so horrible everything's everything's gone so wrong a pixel i appreciate your messages sometimes i have to like get revert to the rescue okay i'm canceling this so i i um i i've learned my lesson i thought i could do uh something somewhat superhuman that i clearly could not do um i i am going to come back to this i'm gonna move on to some other stuff this was a this was a failure i am sorry i don't know i i can't even speak let's let's take i'm gonna take a break i'm gonna thank the sponsor so i'm gonna have to totally like reorient my entire brain take a deep breath uh anybody who wants to um kind of fix this i'm actually going to um stash all the stuff i just if anybody wants to work on fixing this right now um while i take my break you are welcome to um you can find the horrible disaster that is everything right here in this github repo i will paste it as a link into the discord but i am going to oh this is really rough um i'm going to take a minute here to thank today's sponsor here's the thing coding is really hard and in particular managing web applications that involve databases and frontends and backends is really something that's particularly hard to do especially while you're live streaming which is why most of the content i tend to focus on has to do with algorithms generative art patterns visualizations kind of stuff that i can kind of bite off and chew in in a single chunk and a place where i essentially harvest so many of these ideas is a website called brilliant and brilliant is both an app and a website and has a lot of other aspects to it as well so i'm um going to open something up here so one thing that's really um exciting to me about brilliant so first of all what is brilliant it's a website and app that makes learning accessible and fun their approach is based on problem solving and active learning so everything unlike the disaster that you're watching that is my live stream it's actually a place where instead of watching somebody else do stuff you can go and read and interact and try and try different puzzles and interactive exercises to learn a particular topic algebra programming neural networks and actually new there's a whole lot of new design elements and an entire new uh illustration style called pixp i x and you can see it highlighted in particular in its um a refresh of its um geometry fundamentals course so the geometry fundamentals course is really awesome it's probably the it's the kind of stuff that i should be focusing on the coding train since again i'm really harping on the fact that i just had this total database merge pull request github disaster which i will really think deeply about while i'm after this live stream and come back and try to redeem myself next week but i really encourage you um to check out these uh courses that are available on brilliant another one that i really spent a lot of time with is the neural networks of course highly related to all the stuff that i do with ml5.js and tensorflow.js so if you want to sort of learn more behind the scenes of how neural networks work um and play with different this is showing you sort of visualizing the process of a neural network network uh recognizing a handwritten digit um you can check that out so what i tend to like to do i think i will uh i'm gonna have a little like wind right now is what i like to do uh is go to brilliant.brilliant.org the website i am already logged in and look at um one of its daily challenges i took a peek at this one before i started live streaming and i'm pretty sure i have a sense of how to answer it so um so i feel like i'm going to get a win here which i really need so sometimes my favorite aspect about work doing the puzzles on brilliant is i get them wrong and i learn something but based on all that i was trying to do with that live pull application getting something right is what i really feel i need right now thank you for this sponsor segment is like a therapy session for myself so um this this certainly seems connected to the geometry fundamentals course so if you're interested in this if you like this particular puzzle and challenge looking through the geometry fundamentals course i think would be highly relevant so um what let's read let's read the explanation here first so um some of these segments how can we find a the area of the colored triangle one we are only told the two lengths in the figure so i guess we know the with this this one tick and these two ticks and these two we know those lengths so we should be able to calculate this and then we know the area of the full um well this seems like not too difficult a problem keep reading to see one way to do this well let's read its explanation when we first when we first start when first starting a problem the wishful thinking strategy can help point you in the right direction i know the height of the colored triangle if i only knew the length of the base then i could find the area with the formula a equals onehalf base times height yeah exactly the base of the color drawn is a pair of tick marks so does the hypotenuse that means the two segments of the same length are congruent so now you might think as follows i know the length of one leg of the middle triangle if i knew the length of the other leg then i could use the pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse then i would have the missing leg of the colored triangle right uh oh i see the things that i know are the three and the four i misread this like this is what i'm trying to calculate so i know this three and i know this four i got it i got it i got it so this is going to run through uh show you that this is four uh then um and do some calculations and figure out that this side is 20 times three so one half so i encourage you to check this out i'm gonna do the actual challenge i want to do this one six equilateral triangles all with side length one let me let me let me pull up the chat here because i lost the chat and i don't know if anything's gone off the rails here um what is the total length of the highlighted segments so we have some if these are equilateral triangles and i can do this we've got some serious symmetry going on here right i'm almost certain based on the sort of yeah uh the symmetry here that the length of this is equal to the length of this right that that uh this wishful thinking is true based on the sort of symmetry of the this tiling of equilateral triangles therefore this whoops therefore this plus this is one similarly this plus this is two oh i forgot about this one that's three so we've got three and all i have left is this which is clearly one half so i'm so happy for this challenge i'm really really quite certain that the answer is three and a half i'm gonna i'll leave a a couple seconds here for anybody uh in the uh chat who wants to tell me i'm wrong i see we have a new member in the chat code guppy by the way i have to give code guppy a random number let's submit let's submit this let's feel let's have something that helps us feel a little good today in terms of this live stream there's plenty other things that i wanted to feel good about today i believe all right drum roll please i really hope this is right ah okay i have my one day streak again one of these days you're going to be shocked when you see i have a multiday streak fantastic um feeling a little better all right oh that was wild that look at this animation that is really cool so this is one of the things um that i also love about these brilliant challenges is they really lead to kind of interesting animation ideas and i would certainly encourage you to uh you know one things i like to do is sometimes with one of these challenges is then try to make a p5.js sketch okay um i'm going to take a a short just just literally like a two minute break um just to kind of take a deep breath have a moment away from that live pole debacle that i'm definitely gonna spend some time this weekend cleaning up um and uh i will be back so um it is now intermission um i'll remind you that um if you're interested in brilliant you can sign up for free right now at brilliant.org codingtrain those daily puzzles and lots of other aspects of the site are free um and if you want to unlock all the courses with a premium subscription um you can uh you'll get a 20 discount uh uh the first 200 people at least to go through this uh particular link okay um i'll be back i'm using my microphone and i'll be back in about two minutes do do do all right everybody i am again wow it's really bright i feel like i need to turn the lights down um go to my control center and powder my nose today so i feel like it's just too much um come on control center oh you got to be kidding me settings done well the lights don't seem to show up anymore that's so weird okay nothing is going right for me today sometimes i have these live streams and i feel like this incredible just coming together of ideas and weird code moments and it's beautiful and other times i feel like what was i doing for the last two hours oh my goodness thank you for being here with me um i am going to move on i'm gonna try to come up with something to do here in the next 50 minutes that will be a will have a bit more of a um hopefully outcome that you can take away with you to maybe try something new uh yourself this um weekend so i think what i actually want to do is i really don't understand what's happening today first of all code guppy thank you for joining code guppy i assume you are the code guppy from the wonderful code guppy website are you a different code guppy which is a um service that i have um looked at and i know that you've talked to folks at processing about service is maybe the wrong word but on educational coding websites so anyway thank you i think it is i i think the the sign here that i'm reading from the universe the universe is telling me to read some more random numbers so uh let's go ahead and do that row 14 column two is where i last left off oh a couple hours ago it was a simpler time when i had all this like energy and i was excited to be live streaming and i was reading random numbers and thinking about all the things i was going to create um and thank you k weekman for sharing the code guppy uh website um i think i think i probably have some unanswered um emails from you you have some unanswered i have some unanswered emails from you you have not received answers from me and i apologize for that um i am slowly getting to all the messages that i receive over time but i i really appreciate all that you're doing at codeguppy.com all right oh we're we're giving code guppy a um a random number for your membership oh wait this is a membership welcome code guppy to the cutting train thanks for boarding the coding train a youtube channel where i merge people's pull requests and resolve their conflicts without really bothering to thoughtfully check over what i'm doing i break everything and then i cry and well give out a random number the code guppy's random number is 5778 that is from page 366 uh row 18265 column three all right um okay so um i'm trying to think quickly about what i could do and i think actually i think the the the uh ex the thing that i could do right now that will lead to um the most positive result of me actually showing something on the live stream that people could learn and try on their own is to look at the new release of ml5.js so let's go on over to the ml5.js website learn.ml5js.org and i believe if i go to the ml5 github and go take a look at ml5 library and go under releases you will see as of two days ago version 0.6.0 and if i click here it will show a few of the things that have been added i would say the most significant thing is two new models hand pose and face mesh so hand pose can be used to predict the location of 21 3d landmarks on the palm and fingers of a single hand and face mesh can be used to predict 486 3d landmarks on the human face wow all right um there's a bunch of other things uh that are in that have been updated and fixed in particular related to convolutional neural networks which i'm working on a video series about which will come out sometime in the next few weeks but let's take a look at those um those particular models and i'll do it right in the p5 web editor in fact um i wonder if i just go i think this has been updated if i go to examples.ml5js.org we can look for hand pose and let's click on hand pose webcam ah so i noticed that this is an issue with our build systems for the website and examples are everything and everything one of the things you can do with um with the excuse me for i'm just having trouble finishing my sentences all of a sudden one of the things you can do um with the p5 web editor is you can actually now have sort of named permalinks to your sketch whereas really this sketches url is its id and some of them are like breaking when we update ml5 and upload new examples so i'm not sure how to resolve that but i believe if i do this and i go to hand pose oh it's not there so i think maybe some of the the release process is still in progress and maybe that's why it's not showing up which is all the better for me to now uh figure out how to get it to work myself so let's just go to let's let's get it to work ourselves this will be an excellent uh exploration um i'm in the p5 web editor i've got a basic p5.js sketch going i want to make sure that i import the latest ml5 library which i can do right by copying to clipboard this and i can paste it right in here into um right here into index.html i'm actually going to adjust this and just change it from latest to 0.6.0 i really prefer referring to a specific version because then i really know what version was i using when i wrote this code if it just is latest i won't remember that later and as ml5 updates something else could break so um let's do that then let's come over here into sketch.js and i'm just going to use just the webcam so let's say video equals create capture um uh video when i think i don't put that in quotes i think i just do this create capture video video dot size 320 240 let's do that let's make the canvas 320.240 as well um and um let's not have anything in draw well let's just draw the video right now so let's see what we've got and thank you very much for my open broadcast studio a virtual camera ah now recently i figured out there's a quicker way to fix this if i go to here and i do smanit like you can see how it's like defaulting to the obs virtual camera i think if i click manage it'll take me to this page and i can just switch it to this and then if i go back to here and just re well let's hit save whoops save refresh do i need i don't know if i need to reload it but let's reload it beautiful okay so now i have the webcam showing up now how do i get this new model um and let's go over here and let's look for it over here um under hand pose here it is hand pose so by the way this is bomani mclendon who is one of the lead maintainer of the ml5 website who ported this particular model so i want to get essentially this to work um so we can see here what do i do i give it um i call ml5 hand pose i can optionally give it the video so that the model is sort of tied with the video a set of options and a callback let's let's grab this and go to the web editor i'll make a variable called hand pose i'll say hand pose equals ml5 video options let's just give it an empty object right now we'll look at that later and then model ready let me move this over and then i'll write that callback function model ready console.log hand pose loaded so let's see what happens here if i run this again um maybe it's oh yeah just took a while to load so ml5 behind the scenes is going to a cloud server and retro okay so we've got the model and then presumably the other thing i can do now if i go back to let me close this here there is a predict function where i can give it the input media and get the results there's also an on so i think there's multiple ways of this is one of actually a points of confusion for me in working with the ml5 library um i there's the models sometimes have different ways of working with them you can call predict on a particular like i want to predict the po hand pose on a particular image and if i'm doing the video i might ask for it to predict on this video frame then when i get the results give it the next video frame but i think this is a way of doing it where it will just look at the video over and over again and whenever it finds a new prediction will give me those results so i think this will make sense for me to use this style of working with ml5 oh and that needs to go obviously like right here so basically and i think probably i should do this in a good practice would be to do this in model ready so the idea is let me load the model tie it to the video obviously i might want to configure it with some options which are empty right now and then once the model is ready handle the prediction event and just log the results so let's see what happens when i run this now right and so presumably uh in that object is going to be a lot of stuff about my hand let's try to look at it over here oh no i'm not getting sorry i'm happy no stop why why um okay so what do i let's see if i can um look at one of these you can see this right so this is when it finds a hand it offers me up this object the object has a confidence that it's seeing a hand it offers me a bounding box of the hand so an x and y and an x and y of the top left and bottom right of the hand these numbers seem rather high for my image being sized at 320 by 240 and i'm also not sure why it's negative although maybe it's guessing that the hand is extending past the canvas we'll have to like experiment with that landmarks these are the xy z positions of these particular landmarks on the hand um wow this is really wild annotations i can look at the thumb these are maybe all the sort of parts that are on the thumb wow look at this ring finger middle finger index finger pinky i love my pinky and palm bass fascinating that all this stuff is in there so i suppose what i could do quickly is just iterate over all of the landmarks i'm not sure what to do with the z location right now i could use that to describe maybe the size of a circle i'm also wondering why it doesn't correspond to the um the actual size of my the video image that i've given it um and whether maybe it's using the native video size let's let's investigate this a little bit further um which is to say let's look at the example that i'm ultimately trying to write here video model ready on pose model ready draw key points look through all the predictions go through the landmarks ellipse key point zero one not using the z and keeping it at six forty by four eighty so there might be um i don't know whether this is my mistake or ml5's mistake or a bug or not but to me it looks like it is uh returning the xy positions based on the fact that the video the source image would be uh 640 by 480. so just for argument's sake right now i'm gonna um make the canvas 640 by 480 i'm going to comment this out and actually let's not draw let's see what we get oh whoa the camera went off that's so weird why did that happen again like it's plugged in it's charging i think the issue is i let the battery drain and it just like it can't keep up well we'll see how it does okay um okay so let's see here if i can do something similar so what i want to do is do i'll create uh um i don't know what to call it the um let's call it like the hand talk to the hand people um the hand equals results so i'm just always going to store the results in there and then in draw what did we say was in there when i looked there was something called landmarks um i have one was an object oh there could be multiple hands so let's call it uh hands so let's just say if hands that means that there's at least one our hands dot length is greater than zero let's just do that then let hand equal hands index zero so i'm just going to look at one right now and i want to look at the landmarks i should i should learn how to use object destructuring right is this how i would do it is that object destructuring so i'm pulling out the landmarks property from hand zero and putting it in its own variable and then i can look through every single one and it's an array and i can say uh oh there's gotta be can i do this is that also object destructuring can you do that if it's an array does that work i don't know let's see if that works and then i'm going to say uh phil 255 ellipse xy16 that can't be right right i don't know i never i don't ooh okay cannot read property length of undefined so i guess in in when it starts it has the model hasn't loaded so let's this is maybe a silly way to do it but i'll do this oh my camera went off again i'm sorry about that everybody i'm just gonna i'm gonna let it okay whoa okay first of all it's insane how fast this is that is crazy how fast that is uh wow i'm shocked oh i sh i don't know why i'm deciding only to do one let's say hand of hands this is very weird what i'm doing my variable naming is really leaving a lot to be desired and then uh it's bothering me the way it auto formatted that so i'm just gonna say this no destructuring for me okay let's try is that right let's try running this so what could i do with this i mean okay come on let's see one hand oops one hand i can't see can i how come i can't get two what did i do to not if hands shouldn't i have gotten two if it sees two let's uh well my fan is computer fan is going crazy uh cannot read property length of undefined okay oh stop stop yeah different hands should be different colors for sure but i'm not sure why i'm only seeing one hand one oh maybe i have to set the options for multi or something i mean so what were the um what were the options and i also want to do the 3d stuff uh and i like that there's semantic groupings that i could color different parts of it and this whoops the camera is still sorry that i'm not showing myself i'm gonna let the camera kind of warm itself up a little bit uh so flip horizontal max continuous checks detect confidence score threshold interesting i don't know what if i'm doing something wrong or if it's just not able to get both hands let's try moving my moving a little further back from the camera that sometimes will do the trick here's one hand it's not mirrored so it's like making me crazy i can't figure out which hand is which well i could still do some interesting stuff with just one hand but i was i i'm wondering why it's not detecting two let's look at these options grab this flip horizontal boolean value for if the video should be flipped i actually would like that max continuous checks infinity detection confidence score threshold a threshold for removing multiple likely duplicate detections uh float representing a threshold for deciding whether boxes overlap too much and nonmaximusly okay so i wonder if one of these thresholds would um kind of help like what if i put all these down like if i put detection confidence at zero and i want to actually make this true so if i put the detection confidence at zero it's gonna always think something is a hand like it's finding a hand in everything uh whoa so that was a bad idea let's make it like .25 i don't think it's that the second hand has a low confidence can you join the dots on the hand i absolutely could i have to figure out how to do that so one no uh score threshold if i make those thresholds zero should probably i should do this more methodically wants me to join the dots using a line yeah okay i'm going to give up on this and i'm going to ask bomani and sort of research this um but let's let's uh let's let's see what some folks are asking for which is to sort of draw um draw the draw a line and apologies that i'm not showing my camera right now i am waiting for my camera to get a little charge built up um so what can i do well what order so first thing i want to do is actually i want to look at the z values so what are the z values what happens if i just put in the z right here as the size so i recognize this is not what folks were asking for but i want to get a sense of what happened there options is not defined whoops oh i probably could get away without passing it through but let's just put it back the way i had it so look at this so now closer they're bigger further away this month it's really kind of amazing and this is not a precise way of rendering this with three dimensionality but it is working pretty well that's pretty amazing um it's feeling kind of so let's think about joining the dots so one way i could approach that this is not a great strategy but let's just try it begin shape all right hold on let's do this twice let's just join them all with um let's give this a little bit of alpha let me join them all by setting them each at a vertex location so i'm curious what order are the landmarks in we'll find out now in a moment oh this and let me actually just comment out the circles right now just to see it this way okay so this is the arbitrary order it's kind of amazing actually it's in a sort of logical order that almost has so i can actually create a nice enclosed shape like this pretty interesting right so you can see the it's crunching your head and scratching your head it's crunching your head scrunching your head alright that's pretty interesting um take this out we could also look at does it show me uh yeah we could look at the semantic groupings um so let's look at the annotations this will be pretty interesting i'm going to leave that as is and i am going to take this out and let's say uh let group it let annotations equals hand dot annotations and then whoops and then i should be able to get all the keys so let parts equals annotation oh what do i say object dot keys annotations is that how i get all of the properties of an object i think so and then let part of parts uh let uh i don't know what to call this now uh you know i'll call this position oh no it's in the part it's just an array so let yeah let for let position of part and then draw an ellipse you can do this again and draw an ellipse at x y let's let's take is this right did i do this right so what i'm attempting to do is connect all the landmarks with a line then look at each annotation the thumb the finger except the pinky the piggy finger the ring finger the middle finger etc separately and what did i get wrong here uh on un unexpected token oh i have too many brackets okay oops i think my camera should be working again by the way it's had enough time to charge okay i'm back um what's going on here ellipse was expecting a number for the second parameter so i think i'm doing a kind of miserable job of unpacking this object so the annotations is an object where the arrays are grouped by property so this should be an array now of all those properties then oh no no no let that part of parts ah it's just the keys it's just the keys sorry so now i need to go through all the values so um let position of annotations part that's what i'm doing and again this is written in such an awful way and i would not want my example that ultimately would make it a tutorial to look like this but um let's first and thank you pedro for your pie super chat um let's see if this gets me to where i want to go for now okay great so yes i am seeing them all as circles and now and i'm sort of drawing a line and actually probably connecting them i'm realizing makes much more sense for me to now take this particular um let's just not work with the landmarks at all as a full array let's work with them individually and i'm going to go through all the positions and draw them as circles and then also do that again and again this is i'm just getting this to work it's a very awkward way and then draw connect them so now i should see uh all of the circles and all and all the connections for these particular groupings so we can see right each finger and i i should get rid of that close the close doesn't make any sense um anymore and i should say i'm gonna say stroke weight four and what i would like to do now is color give them a different color each so i will go to the coding train color colors where's that website that cj made whoa it was not in live poll it was in is it just in the website no there was a time colors no where did that where did cj make the colors there's that website that coding train did i bookmark it i must have right no no so sad uh i'll just make up some colors pink for pinky is a very good idea um how to trigger an event on thumbs up yeah let's we could we could definitely make that happen so that could be our let me finishing this out um so uh but i just wanted to see them as different colors let's just do um i'll just do it like this um really losing my mind here the super fast color scheme generator oh that's a good idea but i have a coding train color scheme and a website um all right let's see this in action whoops i like this oh it's so like spidery where's my mouse i lost my mouse what i've completely forgotten what i'm doing i forgot that i have stroke weight over here okay fine i'll get this i'll get a coolers dot co uh start the generator okay and copy hex sure i don't want i don't this is not colorful enough for me i want that i want the i want something more colorful okay i'm not a i'm not good at picking colors let's move on let's let's let's comment that i'll come back to that let's make a little thumbs up recognizer so here's the thing i have a whole um i'm gonna find a video for you called pose classifier so this is a particular video tutorial where i use the key points of the pose net model to um to classify poses and oh and thank you violet uh violet gave me the coding train color scheme site so i will pull that up in a second the way that i do this is i make the xy positions of every key point on the body's pose the input to a neural network i collect a data set with a lot of poses paired with labels and then i feed that through the neural network it learns those poses associated with those labels and then it can take new ones and yes and it works quite well this definitely would be a way to do it with the hand pose model and if i had infinite time uh that would be an example that i would build right now in fact you could probably get this code and swap it out really quickly i'm tempted to do that but one thing that i really do like to consider is that is there a way for me to simply analyze a hand pose and determine whether it's thumbs up or thumbs down for example now i know like if i'm all if this point over here is always the highest of all of the other points then maybe it is thumbs up if it is the lowest then maybe it's thumbs down right so certainly using a classification engine would be good but i bet you i can get this to work by just recognizing when the thumb is the highest point or the lowest point so which one is that it's certainly one of the ones that is um um and it is certainly one of the ones that is part of the annotations that is the thumb so let's do this let thumb equal annotations dot thumb boy wouldn't object destructuring be nice here and then let's say fill uh let's make a green let's just draw an ellipse at thumb index zero dot x thumb index zero dot y um that is uh 24. so a larger circle let's see what i get i just want to know which one is it and i could probably look it up but this is the quick way of finding it uh it's that top whoa it did them all that's weird because i am doing something let's take out this let's take out this and let's just look um for see which one it is so i'm not going to draw the other things as circles why don't i see the thumb okay so i made a mistake somewhere ellipse was expecting a number for the second oh there's no dot x these are arrays i'm just thinking they're organized into x y pairs so that might be something oh no no no no no it's not a two dimensional array it's literally wait no the thumb is an array no it is the thumb is an array of an arrays and the first array has an xyz so it is a twodimensional array this should be right we're about to find out okay so that's the bottom one right that particular the first one is the bottom one how many are in the thumb um i mean i could just hard code it in i'm curious if it'll tell me anywhere let's just guess i think there are probably if we look well when the circles were there i think there were four so let's guess it's index three i think there were four key points like along the thumb like one two three four i think there we go i got the top one so i found the top of my thumb so now let's do the following thumb t x is this t y is this and i'm going to say a boolean thumbs i'm going to assume thumbs up is true oh no i don't need to say boolean and i'm going to assume thumbs down is also true then as i'm going through all of the other parts um and i shouldn't do there's no reason for me to do this by annotation but since i'm already doing that i can say if and i only need the y sorry i only need the y i only need the thumb y if this particular y of another point is above is above the thumb thumb y then thumbs up can't be true anymore right if something else is higher than the thumb then thumbs up is not true else if y is less than thumb y if this y is below then thumbs down is not true so then when i get to the end let's say this text align center center text size 64. if thumbs up text come on paste it in there my goodness what are you doing to me there we go text thumbs up with divided by two height divided by two else if thumbs down let's draw this one so i believe i should get okay what's happening here uh got some weird errors thumbs up is not defined what did i call these oh oh i'm in the for loop let's well yeah we shouldn't be drawing it we're going to do this within not the for loop but within the if statement if there is a hand to be detected um there's only ever one hand so i'll just do it here now let's try running this again thumbs up thumbs down thumbs up thumbs down i'm going to blow your mind now i'm going to take simon's suggestion and i'm going to say uh like i think that's like much bigger and i'm going to just draw the video i am going to hide this and i am going to comment this out save now watch this people oh wait i got an error wait what happened image was expecting oh oh okay if video i knew i could make something successful happen with the new ml5 no what oh no it needs a place that's not the problem sorry needs to be at zero zero okay here we go everyone i mean look how accurate this is i was gonna say no machine learning involved but it's not true because i have a pretrained model looking for thumbs up or thumbs down but i didn't have to train a neural network to recognize the difference between these poses now if i want to do like rock paper scissors i would definitely want to use a neural network because people could make scissors in all sorts of different directions and orientations but thumbs up versus thumbs down and i should debounce this so it only registers if it's like um if it only registers if it's um and i'm still drawing that green dot which i didn't realize i was drawing let's just take that out what about pointing left so here's a couple things one is like hey thumbs up thumbs down this is thumbs down right because somehow the thumb is lower than all the others so it is a bit of a problem if uh you know i'm not it's not a very sophisticated way of doing it but i would like to point out that it's very easy to sort of let yourself go into a place where you think you must use the most sophisticated advanced technique for determining something when actually just checking the y location of the top of the thumb versus the bottom of the rest of the fingers is quite accurate it bothers me i need to debounce this because i would like this to be and i would like to clean this up a little bit so this could be an actual example so first of all let's say i don't want to count it so let's do let's do a counter up counter down counter okay and so if thumbs up up counter okay so i'm gonna do this up counter again there's a more elegant way of doing this but i think this will work i could do that fading thing but i'm gonna do it differently um up counter plus plus else up counter minus minus and then if thumbs down down counter plus plus and all of you are thinking of a million other ways to write this code i get it uh then i'm gonna say up counter equals constrain up counter between 0 and let's say 100 that let's constrain down counter as well to within some range and then now i basically want to say if up counter is greater than 50 else if down counter is greater than 50. so i only want to consider it a thumbs up or a thumbs down if it's sort of stably been there for and maybe i should say more than if it's 30 frames per second about one second and so it might actually make sense for me to sort of think in pack into multiples of 30. um let's let's see if my logic is not totally flawed here all right um whoa so why the flickering hmm like just if it's halfway it's got to like count it's got to be there for 30 frames is my are my like values too large this is kind of a silly thing that i'm doing but i just oh and let's make these separate thumbs up increase the up counter otherwise keep them between 0 and 60. i don't understand what the flickering was yeah i mean console logging the counter would makes what have i done something wait weird okay fine what have i done i'm trying to add like a simple extra thing to this thumbs down is never going down weird oh whoops oh when did that change that should be wait if i don't know what did i did i mess that up and that's so weird this makes no sense so i think i have the right idea but my i don't know why i don't know when that changed um and yeah that that also would make sense to do this i mean this this has gotten really ridiculous but i also think that um you know it doesn't need so much you know this is this is silly what i'm doing i mean it's not silly it's it would make the interaction theory much more elegant but well it it just worked so much better without this extra debouncing i think actually what it should be i'm now realizing is or i don't know all right i gotta put this away i'm gonna put this away the the there's an elsif oh yeah uh yeah but i think the elsif is fine because if it's less than t y it can't be greater than so anyway it's pretty good i think maybe i thought i was going to make it much better um let's just um so okay i'm going to wrap this up it's save you're all going to make much better versions of this thumbs up or down tracker uh detector um and i am going to put this as a link in the um discord uh links uh channel that's part of the live stream right here under links so you can grab that code and try it on your own please make a version of this i think i think it's it's it's after 6 00 p.m here on the east coast and my brain is really fried and so clearly i am not thinking straight and my sort of technique for debouncing this is rather flawed um but um what i really would suggest doing is taking a look at this particular video i'll post a link to this as well hello and welcome to another um so i'll post a link to this video what i would love for somebody to try doing is try taking this idea but instead of using pose use all the landmarks of a hand and i think someone in the chat had suggested um someone in the chat had yeah technically when it's equal it's not thumbs up or thumbs down that's a good point um uh suggested like okay you could you could sort of like point and make like a game controller you could you could actually use regression here you could train a regression model basically to extract an angle based on the angle of your hand that would be kind of pretty interesting to do there's so many possibilities there so i i feel like i'm this is like a um i would give this live stream a b minus and i hope to be able to sort of organize and plan for how um i do things a little bit better but what i what if i were to summarize what happened today that you could take with you and sort of ponder and perhaps contribute back is one is i think my methodology of going through pull requests one at a time during a live stream is pretty flawed um especially if a lot come in all at once because they're just going to cause a lot of merge conflicts people are trying different things and it's not really a particularly productive way for me to maintain and grow this live poll application so i think that to do so i think i probably should put that aside for the live streams and just try to like now in the discord maybe we can make a channel about it maybe some of the folks who help with various github repos can help go through some of these pull requests maybe i can work on it find some time to work on it outside of the live stream but i would like to have a goal that by the next live stream that i have a working version of that that i could just use because i think i've done enough of the kind of talking about or explaining like the idea of the live poll application i should just sort of clean it up and i can go through it in a live stream to help people understand how it works but i don't think that's too um that didn't work so well as a segment um i do feel like looking at something new like the hand pose model that just came out in ml5 that i haven't worked with before that to me feels pretty successful um i wasn't able to necessarily um make something super creative with it but i was able to get it working and kind of look through how it works and now i would love for any of you who aren't just immediately going to bed right now not going to sleep and if you're you know working on some projects and stuff today if you try it please share it with me join the discord and in there's a share channel there you can you can tweet at me as well um at shiffman and that i would love to see if anybody kind of gets um this working and certainly what's great about this is this has now helped me potentially go and make a video tutorial an edited video that would then come out about the hand post model um other things i didn't get to i didn't get to looking at glitch and runway i still haven't gotten to the java processing library i wonder if i could i wonder such a bad idea but i almost feel like is that just gonna take me five minutes just let's remember the old days when i used to have a timer uh here we go folks i'm allowing myself the amount of time hold on that the tory the dog song is five minutes and 21 seconds let me just check here is this one yes so i have been say i said oh maybe this is not it where did i recently maybe it was an email must have been an email this hold on everybody just just just hold on a second i'm gonna i wanna i've been some i guess this was an email thread i thought it was a github issue this library http request for processing i really need to use this library for some examples that i imagine making for working with runway and anything else that requires an http request i didn't haven't made a release of this since february 26 2016 and there's been a whole bunch of fixes that one and i wanted to just quickly make a new release but let's look at what some of these other i'm doing exactly what i said i wasn't gonna do this doesn't i don't get what this is so this i think i can't merge something about that i'd have to look at more and more detail but i was it was requested that i just quickly make a release of this so i'm going to see if i can do this in 5 minutes and 20 seconds and if not i'll come back to it next week this is definitely not going to work no can't clone a youtube video i'm getting the repo do i have eclipse on this computer sort of oh i had to go away i don't wanna i don't wanna deal with that right now okay allow cookies i can't believe i'm installing eclipse to do this this is definitely not gonna work four minutes and 18 seconds left everybody my download speeds have really got to improve do i'm really using a lot of time okay so if you're wondering eclipse is a development integrated ide that um you can use with a lot of different programming languages um it's the one that i used to use um like every day all the time and um i probably haven't done that in like 10 years but i have used it once or twice a year when i'm trying to like build some java processing thing and i think what i want is this one i did not think that i was gonna have to install eclipse i assumed i had it on this laptop but this is a pretty newish laptop so probably i just never bothered two minutes and 37 seconds then i'm then i'm moving to saying goodbye i i thought that i could do this in this amount of time because i didn't think i was gonna have to download and install the clips um after i sign off you might see a new video about making your own discord bot appear on the coding train youtube channel maybe i'll do it tomorrow morning sort of sunday sunday morning activity it's so dark out now i thought i was gonna go for a jog after i live stream okay this is definitely not happening oh my god what have i done i'm gonna let allow the whole time the time to run out this is a minute and 25 seconds coding challenge timed edition that always worked well in the past hi thomas first time in my stream this has been i'm giving myself now a cplus for this live stream although the lighting in here is really just excellent right now okay 45 seconds dan do you ever visit tandon well right now i don't visit very many places at all um trying to stay safe and at home and with as few people as possible um but i assume you're asking about the tandon school of engineering i would otherwise be there every single day because the program that i work at called itp is um in the same building as several of the tandem programs nine seconds uh don't copy don't copy don't copy don't copy don't copy don't come just allow cookies a lot of cookies whatever whatever whatever donate no allow cookies yes okay all right boom so um i will come back to this uh so this is step one to be continued a big giant to be continued sign i don't have a button that says to be continued but um the next step for this is to use ant to rebuild the jar files for the library as well as i believe here under resources like i can't remember in maybe library.properties or build.properties this is where i would um update the version number to 0.1.4 so i'd have to make this five and make that 0.4 oh i've got to also get the processing repo and then add that to the build path all right well we got a little bit somewhere here i've gotta go um i'm gonna put on my uh old timey uh uh goodbye uh music i don't even know where that is anymore here it is um so i will leave you with this parting thought um this song has about two and a half minutes on it where i can also take a couple questions in the chat um sherp says i think i saw you once at tandon but i was too shy to say hi i've been watching you before i even got accepted nyu so people do i i have to say i have um in some of the tandem nyu buildings people will come up to me or say something in the elevator in the hallway and so don't be shy please come up and say hi to me next time you see me um and kobe is telling me that that i'm that i haven't done anything i don't do on a regular basis so i guess this is what i do this is what live streaming is for the coding train these days thank you very much thanks everybody for watching the coding train here on a saturday um i will play this uh song um when i go to the uh closing animation so what's coming up next on the coding train you will see the next videos that come out a threepart series on how to make a discord bot at the end of the last video um oh unoriginal pun i i will answer your question it's a premade animation that somebody made i can give you more details about that later and unfortunately ask about the intermission animation um the what was i saying ah the discord bot series there are three videos basically by the end of the third video all i have is a essentially a hello world discord bot it looks for the uh a posting of choo choo and replies with a message so there's lots of other things that discord bots can do and you might have some of your own ideas for what those could do so please if you watch those and and you get to the third video leave some requests or questions in the comments about what you think it might make sense for me to demonstrate as i continue that series the other um thing i wanted to mention is that i'm working on two new video tutorials about convolutional neural networks in ml5 so stay tuned for those those will be coming out soon and that's all i got uh titan is saying i'm learning these days at code academy um codecademy is a wonderful website there are some alums of the itp program where i teach that work there and i think i have also they have some unanswered emails i have some they they have who has the unanswered emails if i've been sent an email and i haven't answered it i'm the unanswerer the email is unanswered i have the unanswered email but they sent the unanswered email so it's their unanswered email it's really confusing if only i could work that out i might be able to answer my emails all right everybody i'll see you next week on the coding train goodbye oh boy i'm still here this the start of this dot song never forget the vista i'm gonna say once again here we go it's look forward to cartesian coordination autotune and the internet will fix that for me sing it with me unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what else is there yes kittens thank you very much kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice that look what i get i'm really losing my mind okay let's do it the kittens kittens and kittens and kittens kids the kittens and kittens i feel just sort of like a nice feeling of relaxation everything's gonna be okay today dream is not broken it has not frozen this is a this is a wonderful thing okay we're gonna do it i'm really getting to something i need my sound effects that was invalid syntax i forgot uh there was one other thing here that i think is important that i will use continuously over and over again all sorts of text generation analysis things that i will use continuously over and over again first thing i need to do is and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and dusty you
