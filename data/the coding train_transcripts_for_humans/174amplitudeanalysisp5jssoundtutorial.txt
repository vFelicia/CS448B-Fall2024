00:00 - hello welcome to one more video but this
00:03 - is not the last one about sound in the
00:05 - browser using p5.js sound library so in
00:08 - this video what i want to demonstrate to
00:10 - you is how to listen to the audio that's
00:12 - playing back and draw something
00:14 - according to how loud that sound is so
00:16 - we can have a responsive shape on the
00:18 - screen responding to a particular audio
00:21 - now before i do that i'm going to add a
00:22 - little bonus tip in this video which is
00:25 - that right this play button right plays
00:28 - my sound so the sound is playing it has
00:30 - a little and i start to dance or
00:32 - whatever it is that i always do this is
00:33 - playing but notice what happens if I run
00:35 - this sketch and I hit play really
00:37 - quickly now I get this error message not
00:40 - ready to play filed I the play button
00:43 - appeared before the sound is actually
00:45 - loaded now we know the sound is loaded
00:47 - when I see loaded in the JavaScript
00:50 - console in the browser this is not
00:51 - something that a user would see I have
00:52 - the console open for debugging asked us
00:55 - or a developer of this sketch but what I
00:57 - can do in the code here come back code
01:00 - come to me code here it is is this right
01:03 - remember the song is loaded and the
01:06 - loaded function is the callback and in
01:08 - the callback function I am logging the
01:11 - loaded logging loaded to the console but
01:14 - button is created and setup there's no
01:16 - reason why I couldn't just take these
01:18 - two lines of code and actually put them
01:21 - in the callback so the idea here is that
01:23 - I don't want the play button to appear
01:26 - on screen until the sound is actually
01:28 - loaded and ready to be played but draw
01:30 - can start looping so we can see that you
01:33 - know if I were to put just some sort of
01:35 - you know animation in here can you see
01:38 - that you can't see that the play button
01:40 - doesn't actually appear until the sound
01:42 - is actually loaded I apologize for the
01:44 - flickering let me just take that out so
01:46 - you can see no play button play button
01:48 - and now the guarantee is that the sound
01:51 - can play so little extra bonus tip here
01:54 - at the beginning of my jazzy tune
01:56 - tutorial not p5.js
01:59 - and then okay but now moving on oh I
02:04 - forgot what I was doing this tutorial is
02:07 - listening to the audio we pause the
02:09 - music so there's a lot of different
02:11 - things you can do in terms of sound
02:13 - analysis the simplest thing is just
02:16 - listening to the volume of the sound is
02:18 - the sound loud or not so loud at this
02:20 - particular moment another word for
02:22 - volume is amplitude and this has to do
02:24 - with sound being a waveform right if
02:29 - sound exists is some sort of waveform
02:32 - the amplitude being the kind of height
02:35 - of that wave the distance between the
02:37 - top and the bottom of that wave so what
02:42 - I can do in p5 is actually create and
02:45 - I'm going to create a variable called a
02:47 - mp4 amplitude and I could say a and P
02:50 - equals new p v dot amplitude now this is
02:56 - actually an now an amplitude object this
02:58 - kind of in a way global and amplitude
03:01 - object is just gonna listen to the
03:03 - volume of kind of all the sound stuff
03:05 - that's happening with this sketch there
03:07 - is a way I think with the p5 sound
03:09 - connect function not connect like
03:11 - Microsoft Connect connect like the word
03:13 - connect like my fingers are connected
03:15 - that particular function allows you to
03:17 - connect different analysis objects to
03:19 - different audio inputs and outputs so
03:22 - there's a more than you can do that's a
03:23 - bit more sophisticated but by default
03:24 - I'm just gonna say make an amplitude
03:26 - object and now if I run this sketch and
03:30 - I play the sound I can look at that in
03:33 - the console you can see I have this
03:35 - amplitude object it has a lot of
03:36 - information associated with it and I can
03:38 - call the function get level and we can
03:42 - see I've got this number right now so
03:44 - the current volume is 0.05 so the volume
03:48 - is going to give you some
03:50 - a range of 0 and 1 but for the purposes
03:54 - of this video tutorial I set the maximum
03:58 - volume essentially at K 3 to lower the
04:01 - volume of the song so that I the mix is
04:03 - a little bit better than talking in the
04:04 - sound volume so in that sense the
04:07 - maximum value I'm actually going to get
04:09 - in this video tutorial is 0.3 although
04:11 - you might get one so you know the first
04:14 - thing I can obviously do here is perhaps
04:16 - do something like let me draw a
04:17 - background and then I want to draw an
04:20 - ellipse in the center of the window let
04:24 - me just make it 100 by a hundred and
04:26 - I'll set the fill to something so we can
04:31 - see I have this nice ellipse in the
04:33 - center of the screen and what I want is
04:35 - for that ellipse to grow and shrink
04:36 - based on the volume so I could say
04:39 - something like volume equals amplitude
04:42 - get level and now I could just put that
04:47 - volume here inside the ellipse function
04:54 - do you see that ellipse there it is
05:00 - there's my tiny little ellipse responded
05:02 - to the volume it's thankfully with me
05:04 - the problem is of course is such a tiny
05:05 - number so this is the perfect
05:07 - opportunity for us to use the map
05:09 - function the math function takes a
05:11 - number with a particular range and maps
05:13 - it to another way and we know the range
05:15 - of volume is between zero and point
05:16 - three so I'm gonna go here and I'm gonna
05:21 - make a variable called I am for diameter
05:24 - is math the volume which has a range
05:27 - between zero and point three
05:29 - and I want to map that diameter between
05:30 - ten and let's say a 200 oh the camera
05:34 - just went off
05:35 - I don't like dance with no camera okay
05:40 - so here we go
05:41 - right oh and then I want to put diameter
05:43 - in here so now there's my circle oh
05:49 - that's just the green I was like what am
05:51 - i drawing some sort of sound graph over
05:53 - here that's just the flow in my green
05:54 - screen okay now I'm gonna hit play and
05:57 - you can see it being responsible so you
06:02 - know you might start to think to
06:03 - yourself oh I need some sort of
06:05 - elaborate beat detection thing but in a
06:08 - way vol so you can imagine you know
06:15 - multiple sounds multiple volumes you
06:18 - know having when the volume reaches a
06:19 - certain threshold having some burst of
06:21 - particles happen missus just sort of
06:23 - like hello world moving to the void and
06:25 - by the way I can also do this with mic
06:28 - input so I could get my voice
06:30 - controlling the size of the circle and I
06:32 - will definitely do that in a future
06:34 - video now there is more that you can do
06:36 - with analyzing a particular sound and
06:38 - that's something called a frequency
06:41 - analysis essentially and something
06:43 - called FFT which is a means for taking a
06:47 - particular sound and looking at the
06:48 - amplitudes across different frequencies
06:50 - so are the high-pitched part of the
06:53 - sound or the low parts of the sounds
06:56 - very high so you can get a sense of kind
06:58 - of more about the sound through that and
07:01 - I could have different circles
07:02 - representing different pitches and those
07:04 - pictures
07:05 - and I'll also do that in a future video
07:07 - as well okay thanks for watching this
07:09 - one and then we'll do more people just
07:11 - sound videos to come someday they might
07:13 - already be there cuz he would be
07:14 - watching this in the future goodbye
