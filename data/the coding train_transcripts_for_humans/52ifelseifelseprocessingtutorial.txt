00:00 - Ok, here we are again.
00:03 - Welcome
00:04 - we are at the beginning of something
what's happening here is
00:07 - if you recall, we are talking about
how to have a program
00:12 - choose a path essentially.
00:14 - How do we have a program execute some code
sometimes and other code other times
00:22 - We are doing that with 
a conditional statement
00:25 - A conditional statement involves saying:
00:27 - if this condition is met then execute
the lines of code in between
00:32 - the open and curly close brackets.
00:35 - We can see an example of that running
over here which we built in the last video
00:39 - I dressed it up a little bit.
There is now a white line over here
00:42 - that shows us if the mouse is over here
is less than 100 pixels
00:48 - and is not executing that code
which draws a red background
00:51 - but as soon as I move the mouse over...
clicking the window and have it focused
00:57 - and move the mouse over we can see
we now have a red background.
01:01 - No red background
01:02 - Red background
01:03 - No red background
01:04 - Red background
01:05 - Our program is doing something different
each time through draw
01:08 - based on a condition.
01:09 - This is how everything works.
01:11 - If you are programming Pong:
if the ball hits the paddle
01:15 - then change the ball direction
and if the ball go passed the paddle
01:19 - change the score, etc.
01:21 - This is what we're doing: we
we just want to be able to set a condition
01:24 - and execute different code
based on those conditions
01:27 - everything you do is gonna be
sort of thinking through
01:28 - and design that logic.
01:30 - So that's the beginning of this,
01:32 - there are a few more pieces
that we want to get through
01:34 - for example: what if we were to say
"i wanna draw another line
01:40 - i wanna draw a line that is
a little bit further over
01:43 - and it is at 200 pixels".
01:49 - Let me run this now
01:52 - 200 and that's a little mistake there.
I wanto also the top of the line
01:56 - to be at 200 pixels.
01:58 - So... here we have black background,
here we have red background,
02:03 - here we have... red background.
02:06 - What if I want a third option:
black to red to, say, blue?
02:11 - I know I can say (typing):
if mouseX is greater than 200
02:19 - draw a blue background.
02:24 - I think we're gonna have 
that program working out
02:27 - black
02:28 - red
02:29 - blue
02:29 - depending on where the mouse is.
02:31 - black, red, blue.
02:32 - Here's the thing: what is going on here?
02:35 - There are two different cases:
02:38 - if the mouse is greater than 100
execute this code.
02:42 - If the mouse is greater than 200
execute this code.
02:49 - but we are actually testing both of these.
We are actually drawing a red background
02:53 - and we are drawing a blue background.
02:55 - What if we have something different
where instead of drawing a background
03:02 - we want to draw some rectangles.
03:05 - So let's just say: 
let's make a red rectangle
03:09 - and I'll put it somewhere on the screen
03:14 - and while we're here,
we will draw a green rectangle
03:22 - and we will put it a little bit lower down
03:25 - So, what's is going on here?
03:28 - no rectangle
03:30 - red rectangle
03:31 - and the green rectangle
03:33 - no green rectangle
03:34 - green rectangle
03:35 - no rectangles.
03:36 - But if I want the green rectangle
to appear here
03:39 - and the red one disappear.
03:41 - In this case here what 
take the mouse's at 400?
03:46 - If the mouse is at 400
it's greater than 100
03:50 - and greater than 200
03:51 - so we are going to see the red
rectangle and the green rectangle.
03:55 - There is another way we can start to 
make this code work slightly differently.
04:00 - What if we want to exclusively only
execute one of these?
04:04 - What if we want to, let's say, this:
04:11 - (writing)
else if mouse X is greater than 200.
04:22 - Now, this look similar
04:25 - If the mouse is greater than 100
If the mouse is greater than 200
04:30 - If the mouse is greater than 100
else if the mouse is greater than 200.
04:34 - We can think of this "else if"
as the word otherwise if
04:42 - I hate this video 
that I'm making right now
04:44 - I have to just keep going...
04:48 - This is gonna be fine,
we will remake all of these anyway
04:54 - If the mouse is greater than 100
otherwise if the mouse is greater than 200
04:57 - The thing, what's important here, 
there's is something important here
05:00 - that we are totally missing.
05:02 - The thing that's important here
with this structure "else if"
05:05 - with the structure if 
both of these can happen
05:08 - With the structure else if
only one of these can ever be executed
05:14 - The interesting thing is:
this is a huge mistake we've made here.
05:18 - Pause the video. Don't pause it yet.
Wait.
05:22 - Take a look at this.
Something is horribly wrong.
05:25 - Syntax is fine... It'll run,
Processing will give zero errors
05:28 - but we are gonna have a problem.
05:29 - Pause the video and think about that,
and then come back.
05:32 - Ok, you're back. Let's go over here
and put that code in
05:36 - So I'm gonna say... (typing) else if
the mouseX is greater than 200
05:44 - so I revise this code.
05:47 - The mouse is about 50 pixels
it's not greater than 100,
05:52 - it's not greater than 200,
we're just not seeing any rectangles.
05:56 - The mouse is now greater than 100,
we're seeing a red rectangle
05:58 - that's what we expected to see
06:02 - Let's stand here,
it's better when I stand here.
06:11 - Now I move over here.
What's happening?
06:14 - The mouse is greater than 200
but there is no green rectangle
06:18 - Why is that?
06:20 - Let's think about it.
06:22 - Let's say for the moment:
what happens when the mouse x is 150?
06:28 - If mouse X is 150 this is true,
so we execute this code
06:32 - we don't execute this code.
06:34 - With an else if the first thing we find
to be true we leave.
06:40 - If mouse X is 250.
250 is greater than 100
06:46 - execute this code.
We leave. We're done.
06:53 - What happen if I make this 200 
and I make this 100?
06:58 - All this weird logic stuff that 
you're stuck thinking about all the time
07:02 - Let's make this 200
07:04 - It's just like 7 minutes,
this is a disaster.
07:06 - This should be like a 3 minutes video
just going over else if and elses
07:10 - this is my life right now...
07:15 - Here we go
07:18 - Mouse x is here
07:20 - now I've got a green rectangle
07:22 - now I've got a red rectangle
07:23 - green rectangle
07:23 - red rectangle
07:25 - Why?
07:25 - Because when it's 250 
we're executing this code
07:29 - and skipping out
07:31 - when it's 150, this become false
if this's false, we can check the next one
07:36 - and the next one is true 
and then we skip out.
07:38 - With else if when you have an if statement
joined with an else if
07:41 - you only ever do one of these.
07:44 - And we can even go so far, just to say,
else if mouse x is greater than 50...
07:50 - we can join this as many as we want.
07:52 - Let's go over here and add that in
07:55 - We're going to say... let's start with 500
400, just keep adding more of these in
08:04 - we can see we're gonna have
a whole bunch of these
08:07 - 300, 200, and we can have 
different colors
08:17 - different locations
with different sizes...
08:27 - Let's see what happens now.
08:31 - You know what? This was nice
having these lines there
08:34 - so let's add all the lines
so we can see where all the stuff is
08:41 - Set a line at 300 and 400.
08:47 - And 100 doesn't do anything anymore
or maybe it does
08:50 - we need a line at 500.
08:52 - This video is a disaster. 
I have to remake these.
08:56 - I haven't really though this thru yet,
I should this after something or whatever
09:03 - This is all like a mess and it's all wrong
everything is wrong
09:12 - What's going on here?
09:13 - These pixels makes no sense
09:15 - these weird (unintelligible) like
one (unintelligible) rectangular design
09:18 - that we've made.
What's going on?
09:20 - The point that we are emphasizing here
is that what we're doing is
09:24 - with this if statement
we're creating a set of possibilities
09:29 - only one of which can be executed
09:32 - So first we see if we're greater than 500
09:34 - if that's not true we see
if it's greater than 400
09:36 - if that's not true 300, etc.
09:38 - This is essentially the kind of logic
you want to start programming
09:41 - if you want 
to create rollovers essentially
09:44 - we've created this regions
that when mouse is over them
09:47 - something happen.
09:48 - Something you may try to do
as an exercise right now
09:53 - because this video is so clearly
explain all this perfectly
09:57 - and (unintelligible) to miss 
the important part
09:59 - which is like what else if is
10:01 - I should just start this over
but I'm not gonna start it over
10:07 - (rumbling)
10:22 - This is fine, 
this is gonna be a long video
10:24 - later this is gonna be shorter
we'll been redoing all these anyway
10:28 - everything is ok, we're calm
we're fine, you're listening
10:31 - (rumbling)
10:37 - The exercise for you:
10:41 - here's your Processing window
divide it into four quadrants
10:45 - and have the quadrants highlight
whenever you move the mouse over them
10:50 - so the mouse should be here, 
that's the mouse
10:53 - and this is showing that's highlighted
10:55 - As you move the mouse over
create this regions rollover
10:57 - it's very similar to what 
we've done over here
11:00 - the only differences is instead of these
horizontal regions
11:04 - this vertical line sections
11:06 - you've got a section screen 
on a grid
11:08 - Here's what kind did't say:
with any if statement
11:13 - we can also have an else.
