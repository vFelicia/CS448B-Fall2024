00:00 - hello welcome to another guest video I'm
00:02 - super excited about this I'm trying to
00:04 - do this more and more and I have more
00:05 - guests here in the studio today and the
00:07 - first one that I'm going to introduce
00:09 - you to in this video is Sarah Dresner
00:12 - and Sarah is a web technologists she
00:14 - does a lot of work with JavaScript a lot
00:16 - of JavaScript libraries that I know
00:18 - nothing about including modeis which has
00:21 - made this particular visualization which
00:23 - is exactly what she's going to build in
00:25 - the video so if you like what you see
00:26 - behind me that's what you're going to
00:27 - learn how to do um Sarah works speaks it
00:30 - a lot of conferences and teaches at
00:31 - conferences and she works with Val head
00:33 - too and and travels internationally to
00:35 - do web animation workshops and if you
00:38 - want to find out more you can go to web
00:39 - animation workshops com so check out
00:42 - their workshop series check out their
00:44 - their websites and check out this
00:46 - tutorial that you're about to watch
00:47 - Thanks so as Dan mentioned I'm Sarah
00:50 - Dresner I'm here today to talk to you
00:53 - about mo GA s mo da Jas is an animation
00:55 - library for the web and we're going to
00:58 - be doing a lot of work with it today
01:00 - using JavaScript and then under the hood
01:03 - it's actually going to be dreaming up a
01:04 - lot of SVG which is really cool SVG is
01:06 - scalable vector graphics so we actually
01:10 - don't need the HTML pan panel here we
01:13 - just need the JavaScript panel I'm
01:16 - leaving the CSS panel open for you so
01:18 - you can see that I'm working with body
01:20 - background you know it's dark black bass
01:23 - or a dark gray basically but that's
01:25 - basically all we're going to be doing in
01:27 - that panel too I also already have
01:30 - loaded this modeis min you know here and
01:35 - if you go look at this pen later you can
01:37 - fork it and grab that that link I'm also
01:40 - going to work with Babel
01:41 - so that I can or Babel I don't know so
01:44 - that I can work with some JavaScript
01:46 - pre-processing and do some work with es6
01:49 - today so basically we're going to do a
01:52 - burst bursts are really really fun
01:55 - because they're so simple and you can
01:58 - drum up something really beautiful
02:00 - really easily so we're going to just say
02:02 - Const burst here equals new mo j s dot
02:08 - burst and then inside here we're gonna
02:12 - say
02:13 - radius if I can type is inside up
02:19 - another object zero - I don't know 360
02:24 - and then what we can do even from here
02:28 - is just play it and see what we've got
02:31 - so if I hit play you can see that I
02:35 - already have something just bursting
02:36 - across the screen it's these little pink
02:39 - dots that's really cool but let's make
02:41 - it a little bit more interesting we've
02:42 - got circles so far but I can actually
02:44 - talk to the children of these like
02:47 - little units we saw we have about five
02:48 - of them and I can say you should be a
02:51 - shape that's maybe a rect and then maybe
02:56 - you should have a longer duration
02:58 - because we're actually having a hard
02:59 - time seeing all of the stuff that's
03:01 - coming up here so I'm going to give it
03:03 - three thousand seconds three thousand
03:05 - milliseconds sorry and then you can see
03:07 - it bursts apart which is really cool so
03:10 - that's just the beginning of what we can
03:12 - do we can actually start to add other
03:14 - shapes here so you saw before we have a
03:16 - circle and you can see that it's kind of
03:21 - pink from the get-go we can also make
03:24 - them a little bit bigger so maybe we
03:25 - should make the and this is a different
03:27 - kind of radius so the radius of them of
03:30 - the bursts is actually like how big the
03:32 - burst is but the radius of the children
03:34 - is going to be how big those shapes are
03:36 - so maybe we'll change them in this
03:38 - object it once we put an object in here
03:41 - we can do thirty to five and then I need
03:47 - a comma here in order to make it work
03:49 - and then you can see it's like a big
03:52 - burst that's way way cool so then I can
03:55 - change it to whatever I want there's a
03:57 - lot of different kinds of shapes in
03:59 - modeis right out of the box so we might
04:02 - change it to something like a cross but
04:04 - the interesting thing is you'll see it
04:06 - disappear because crosses don't have a
04:08 - fill and we're working with the fill so
04:11 - instead we're going to give a stroke and
04:13 - what's cool about that is we can say
04:16 - stroke is you know teal I'm going to do
04:21 - consistent you know a kind of things
04:25 - here and then we've got these crosses
04:27 - that kind of boom across the screen we
04:29 - can even change the stroke width while
04:31 - it's moving so let's do we have to do
04:34 - camel casing here and we'll do let's say
04:39 - six to zero and then we can see it kind
04:46 - of like burst out and be big and then
04:49 - get smaller um might be nice if it kind
04:52 - of rotated as we goes across so we can
04:54 - even put in an angle here and do from
04:59 - like 360 to zero and then we can see it
05:09 - kind of like shattering apart we can
05:11 - change the number of children which is
05:13 - nice so we can do count and do something
05:16 - like 20 all of a sudden and then it's
05:18 - like a tons of things that are just
05:20 - bursting across that's really really fun
05:23 - so that's like a basic mode j/s burst
05:26 - but maybe we want to do more than one
05:28 - maybe we want to make it kind of
05:29 - interesting here as it goes so I'm
05:32 - actually going to get rid of this play
05:34 - for just a second and I'm going to say
05:36 - new timeline equals mo dot J oh no I
05:44 - want to say con story about that cons
05:46 - timeline equals new mo j/s timeline and
05:51 - then I can make it do things like repeat
05:56 - which is nice because then we can kind
05:58 - of continually see it as it goes along
06:00 - and then I'm also going to make sure
06:02 - that I play it because we want to play
06:05 - it but we also have to add in this
06:08 - bursts that we have
06:10 - so we'll do add and then we say burst
06:14 - and now but we need to play dot here and
06:19 - now you can see the bursts kind of
06:21 - appearing and also it's going to keep
06:23 - going so we can also just start adding
06:26 - other shapes here if we want so we can
06:28 - copy all of what we have here and say
06:31 - khan's burst 2 Khan's add burst 2 and
06:36 - now there's going to be two of them that
06:39 - maybe will make them a little bit
06:40 - different
06:40 - you can see that the difference between
06:42 - these so this one's going to be magenta
06:44 - and this one's count is going to be 10
06:47 - maybe like 12 or something and maybe
06:51 - we'll put this in another direction so
06:53 - that we can see the difference between
06:54 - those two things kind of bursting apart
06:57 - right so we got negative 360 now one's
07:02 - going one way and ones going the other
07:04 - way that's kind of fun and now they're
07:06 - scattering across the screen that's kind
07:08 - of nice we can also change this from a
07:11 - cross to something else like a zig zag
07:13 - that's cool and now we have like a
07:19 - totally different shape moving across
07:21 - that's really like kind of interesting
07:23 - as it like morphs and moves so we can
07:28 - also change the color as its as it's
07:30 - going across just by putting it in that
07:32 - other object so we can do magenta - pink
07:36 - pink is kind of like a lighter color so
07:38 - it'll change as it's going so cool we
07:43 - can also just like we can see that
07:45 - there's like that you know default pink
07:47 - in there that's because the zigzag
07:49 - actually has a default fill so we're
07:51 - going to say fill none here and then we
07:54 - can see the zig zag go across and that's
07:57 - going to have a default of three points
07:59 - but zig zags are really cool when they
08:01 - have lots of points so maybe we'll do
08:03 - points you know seven or something like
08:07 - that and then we have these zigzags that
08:10 - have like all of this character it's
08:11 - really really fun so we can also play
08:14 - with opacity right right now we're just
08:16 - kind of having them scale out an
08:18 - infinite infinity but we can also say
08:21 - something like opacity is you know one
08:25 - two zero and then we meet our comma
08:28 - there and then we can actually watch
08:31 - that pink kind of go away as it as it
08:33 - kind of moves off the screen maybe you
08:35 - want we want to do something else too
08:37 - because we've got right now we've got
08:38 - these pretty big radiuses so maybe I'll
08:41 - change this one to a hundred
08:42 - oops that's a thousand that's really big
08:45 - and then this one will do two hundred so
08:48 - we can see them kind of like blowing
08:52 - apart a little
08:53 - differently each time that's really fun
08:55 - too so right now we have two different
08:58 - shapes kind of bursting maybe we want to
09:00 - kind of accent it with a circle that's
09:02 - just one circle that's kind of blowing
09:04 - apart so the way that we would do that
09:06 - is pretty similar to what we had before
09:09 - but it would be a shape so we'd say
09:11 - Const circ equals new mo Jas shape and
09:19 - it's all pretty much the same syntax
09:22 - over and over again so you can kind of
09:24 - see that it would be like a circle here
09:26 - and I'm going to say do the same thing
09:29 - where we're like radius is from zero to
09:34 - you know 200 and we're also going to say
09:39 - let's say we don't want to fill because
09:42 - we just want the outline so we'll say
09:44 - fill none and then we'll say stroke is
09:47 - going to be maybe yellow
09:50 - so that's kind of fun so now we don't
09:53 - see it yet right because we've got to
09:55 - add it here so we'll add it in and then
09:57 - we get to see what happens so right now
10:00 - it's kind of going really fast remember
10:02 - we're how we talked about how like the
10:04 - default is for it to go pretty quickly I
10:06 - think it's 250 milliseconds so we'll
10:08 - also make the duration of this pretty
10:11 - much longer so we'll do 3,000 here and
10:15 - then it kind of blows apart the same way
10:17 - maybe we'll make it a little bit
10:18 - different front so that it's not
10:19 - overlaying on the crosses we can do
10:22 - three hundred three thousand five
10:24 - hundred milliseconds here so that's kind
10:27 - of nice we also might want to do like an
10:29 - opacity from zero to one like we had
10:32 - with the other one or I mean one to zero
10:34 - so then we have it blowing apart this
10:38 - way so that's kind of nice so now we
10:42 - have this like circle that's kind of
10:44 - blowing out at the same time but it
10:46 - might be nice to have two circles it
10:48 - might be nice to have like a circle and
10:50 - then another circle coming out at the
10:51 - same time so right now we have a bunch
10:54 - of things that we might want to reuse we
10:56 - have a radius we have our filled that's
10:59 - none we have our stroke that's yellow we
11:01 - have the opacity from zero to one we
11:04 - might want to keep like all that stuff
11:05 - so what we can do in
11:07 - instead is you know make some default
11:10 - options since we've got our es6 in here
11:15 - we can actually use a thing called a
11:17 - spread operator which is a really really
11:19 - nice thing so I'm going to take this
11:21 - circ and I'm going to call it Const circ
11:24 - opt instead and then I'm going to say
11:27 - that this is an object instead so the
11:33 - nice thing here is I can say Const circ
11:36 - because that's what we had before is new
11:41 - mo j s dot shape like we did before and
11:47 - we can do these three dots which is the
11:51 - spread operator and we can say circ
11:54 - underscore opt and then what will happen
11:57 - is it will start to use those options
11:59 - from before that's really really sweet
12:01 - because now we can just make a second
12:04 - one we'll so we'll call it circ - we can
12:07 - add those options and then I'm going to
12:09 - add a slight delay on this one so then
12:14 - we can add it here and we have two
12:19 - circles really really fast because we
12:22 - have all of those options that we're
12:23 - able to reuse and we can override some
12:25 - of them we can change some of them so
12:27 - that's really really fun and then for
12:30 - the last thing that we're going to do
12:31 - we're probably just going to do like
12:33 - those base circles again
12:35 - just one last base circle so let's go
12:38 - back and take one of these bursts that
12:41 - we have here
12:42 - maybe we're just going to make something
12:45 - very very similar to this but we're
12:48 - going to take out some of these fill
12:50 - none stroke stuff we're going to take
12:53 - out the zig zag because remember the
12:55 - default is that children are always
12:59 - going to be circles so instead we're
13:02 - going to say burst 3 and then we're
13:05 - going to give it a different count of
13:06 - let's say 5 and then let's see what
13:09 - color shall we make it let's say color
13:13 - purple and then we can add burst 3 in
13:19 - here
13:24 - so now you can see it's like giant and
13:27 - then it's getting smaller but maybe we
13:29 - want to make them a little bit more
13:30 - subtle because they're super big so
13:33 - maybe for the radius for the verse three
13:36 - we could say something like let's go for
13:39 - fifteen to ten see how that looks
13:44 - that's better that's kind of like not so
13:47 - bad but maybe we want to make it just
13:49 - like a little more subtle than that so
13:51 - let's do and we don't need the stroke
13:53 - within there and then we have a radius
13:56 - of ten and we're going to make it go to
13:58 - five so basically everything in these
14:03 - objects were interpolating the values of
14:05 - all of the things that we're using the
14:07 - angle the radius the opacity we're going
14:11 - from one to zero every single time we
14:13 - use one of those objects and we're
14:15 - passing it for everything else like the
14:17 - duration it stays stable so we can just
14:20 - use that over and over again so if I
14:21 - wanted to refactor this these bursts I
14:24 - could find things that were common for
14:26 - all of them I think maybe they don't
14:28 - have so many things in common though so
14:31 - it might not be possible but you can see
14:33 - what we did with that circ opt where we
14:35 - just basically used those those same
14:37 - options over and over again and that
14:38 - spread operator and es6 really helps
14:41 - with that and that's really really
14:42 - awesome that timeline is great too
14:44 - because we can just keep adding things
14:46 - and we know that they're all going to
14:48 - repeat at the same time together which
14:50 - is really really fun so if we look at
14:52 - this in my like little code open thing
14:55 - that opens it immediately in dev tools
14:58 - it's a Chrome extension you can see all
15:00 - of these things bursting apart whenever
15:02 - it plays so that's about it thank you
15:06 - for watching and thanks for tuning in
15:09 - bye
15:14 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hello welcome to another guest video I'm super excited about this I'm trying to do this more and more and I have more guests here in the studio today and the first one that I'm going to introduce you to in this video is Sarah Dresner and Sarah is a web technologists she does a lot of work with JavaScript a lot of JavaScript libraries that I know nothing about including modeis which has made this particular visualization which is exactly what she's going to build in the video so if you like what you see behind me that's what you're going to learn how to do um Sarah works speaks it a lot of conferences and teaches at conferences and she works with Val head too and and travels internationally to do web animation workshops and if you want to find out more you can go to web animation workshops com so check out their workshop series check out their their websites and check out this tutorial that you're about to watch Thanks so as Dan mentioned I'm Sarah Dresner I'm here today to talk to you about mo GA s mo da Jas is an animation library for the web and we're going to be doing a lot of work with it today using JavaScript and then under the hood it's actually going to be dreaming up a lot of SVG which is really cool SVG is scalable vector graphics so we actually don't need the HTML pan panel here we just need the JavaScript panel I'm leaving the CSS panel open for you so you can see that I'm working with body background you know it's dark black bass or a dark gray basically but that's basically all we're going to be doing in that panel too I also already have loaded this modeis min you know here and if you go look at this pen later you can fork it and grab that that link I'm also going to work with Babel so that I can or Babel I don't know so that I can work with some JavaScript preprocessing and do some work with es6 today so basically we're going to do a burst bursts are really really fun because they're so simple and you can drum up something really beautiful really easily so we're going to just say Const burst here equals new mo j s dot burst and then inside here we're gonna say radius if I can type is inside up another object zero I don't know 360 and then what we can do even from here is just play it and see what we've got so if I hit play you can see that I already have something just bursting across the screen it's these little pink dots that's really cool but let's make it a little bit more interesting we've got circles so far but I can actually talk to the children of these like little units we saw we have about five of them and I can say you should be a shape that's maybe a rect and then maybe you should have a longer duration because we're actually having a hard time seeing all of the stuff that's coming up here so I'm going to give it three thousand seconds three thousand milliseconds sorry and then you can see it bursts apart which is really cool so that's just the beginning of what we can do we can actually start to add other shapes here so you saw before we have a circle and you can see that it's kind of pink from the getgo we can also make them a little bit bigger so maybe we should make the and this is a different kind of radius so the radius of them of the bursts is actually like how big the burst is but the radius of the children is going to be how big those shapes are so maybe we'll change them in this object it once we put an object in here we can do thirty to five and then I need a comma here in order to make it work and then you can see it's like a big burst that's way way cool so then I can change it to whatever I want there's a lot of different kinds of shapes in modeis right out of the box so we might change it to something like a cross but the interesting thing is you'll see it disappear because crosses don't have a fill and we're working with the fill so instead we're going to give a stroke and what's cool about that is we can say stroke is you know teal I'm going to do consistent you know a kind of things here and then we've got these crosses that kind of boom across the screen we can even change the stroke width while it's moving so let's do we have to do camel casing here and we'll do let's say six to zero and then we can see it kind of like burst out and be big and then get smaller um might be nice if it kind of rotated as we goes across so we can even put in an angle here and do from like 360 to zero and then we can see it kind of like shattering apart we can change the number of children which is nice so we can do count and do something like 20 all of a sudden and then it's like a tons of things that are just bursting across that's really really fun so that's like a basic mode j/s burst but maybe we want to do more than one maybe we want to make it kind of interesting here as it goes so I'm actually going to get rid of this play for just a second and I'm going to say new timeline equals mo dot J oh no I want to say con story about that cons timeline equals new mo j/s timeline and then I can make it do things like repeat which is nice because then we can kind of continually see it as it goes along and then I'm also going to make sure that I play it because we want to play it but we also have to add in this bursts that we have so we'll do add and then we say burst and now but we need to play dot here and now you can see the bursts kind of appearing and also it's going to keep going so we can also just start adding other shapes here if we want so we can copy all of what we have here and say khan's burst 2 Khan's add burst 2 and now there's going to be two of them that maybe will make them a little bit different you can see that the difference between these so this one's going to be magenta and this one's count is going to be 10 maybe like 12 or something and maybe we'll put this in another direction so that we can see the difference between those two things kind of bursting apart right so we got negative 360 now one's going one way and ones going the other way that's kind of fun and now they're scattering across the screen that's kind of nice we can also change this from a cross to something else like a zig zag that's cool and now we have like a totally different shape moving across that's really like kind of interesting as it like morphs and moves so we can also change the color as its as it's going across just by putting it in that other object so we can do magenta pink pink is kind of like a lighter color so it'll change as it's going so cool we can also just like we can see that there's like that you know default pink in there that's because the zigzag actually has a default fill so we're going to say fill none here and then we can see the zig zag go across and that's going to have a default of three points but zig zags are really cool when they have lots of points so maybe we'll do points you know seven or something like that and then we have these zigzags that have like all of this character it's really really fun so we can also play with opacity right right now we're just kind of having them scale out an infinite infinity but we can also say something like opacity is you know one two zero and then we meet our comma there and then we can actually watch that pink kind of go away as it as it kind of moves off the screen maybe you want we want to do something else too because we've got right now we've got these pretty big radiuses so maybe I'll change this one to a hundred oops that's a thousand that's really big and then this one will do two hundred so we can see them kind of like blowing apart a little differently each time that's really fun too so right now we have two different shapes kind of bursting maybe we want to kind of accent it with a circle that's just one circle that's kind of blowing apart so the way that we would do that is pretty similar to what we had before but it would be a shape so we'd say Const circ equals new mo Jas shape and it's all pretty much the same syntax over and over again so you can kind of see that it would be like a circle here and I'm going to say do the same thing where we're like radius is from zero to you know 200 and we're also going to say let's say we don't want to fill because we just want the outline so we'll say fill none and then we'll say stroke is going to be maybe yellow so that's kind of fun so now we don't see it yet right because we've got to add it here so we'll add it in and then we get to see what happens so right now it's kind of going really fast remember we're how we talked about how like the default is for it to go pretty quickly I think it's 250 milliseconds so we'll also make the duration of this pretty much longer so we'll do 3,000 here and then it kind of blows apart the same way maybe we'll make it a little bit different front so that it's not overlaying on the crosses we can do three hundred three thousand five hundred milliseconds here so that's kind of nice we also might want to do like an opacity from zero to one like we had with the other one or I mean one to zero so then we have it blowing apart this way so that's kind of nice so now we have this like circle that's kind of blowing out at the same time but it might be nice to have two circles it might be nice to have like a circle and then another circle coming out at the same time so right now we have a bunch of things that we might want to reuse we have a radius we have our filled that's none we have our stroke that's yellow we have the opacity from zero to one we might want to keep like all that stuff so what we can do in instead is you know make some default options since we've got our es6 in here we can actually use a thing called a spread operator which is a really really nice thing so I'm going to take this circ and I'm going to call it Const circ opt instead and then I'm going to say that this is an object instead so the nice thing here is I can say Const circ because that's what we had before is new mo j s dot shape like we did before and we can do these three dots which is the spread operator and we can say circ underscore opt and then what will happen is it will start to use those options from before that's really really sweet because now we can just make a second one we'll so we'll call it circ we can add those options and then I'm going to add a slight delay on this one so then we can add it here and we have two circles really really fast because we have all of those options that we're able to reuse and we can override some of them we can change some of them so that's really really fun and then for the last thing that we're going to do we're probably just going to do like those base circles again just one last base circle so let's go back and take one of these bursts that we have here maybe we're just going to make something very very similar to this but we're going to take out some of these fill none stroke stuff we're going to take out the zig zag because remember the default is that children are always going to be circles so instead we're going to say burst 3 and then we're going to give it a different count of let's say 5 and then let's see what color shall we make it let's say color purple and then we can add burst 3 in here so now you can see it's like giant and then it's getting smaller but maybe we want to make them a little bit more subtle because they're super big so maybe for the radius for the verse three we could say something like let's go for fifteen to ten see how that looks that's better that's kind of like not so bad but maybe we want to make it just like a little more subtle than that so let's do and we don't need the stroke within there and then we have a radius of ten and we're going to make it go to five so basically everything in these objects were interpolating the values of all of the things that we're using the angle the radius the opacity we're going from one to zero every single time we use one of those objects and we're passing it for everything else like the duration it stays stable so we can just use that over and over again so if I wanted to refactor this these bursts I could find things that were common for all of them I think maybe they don't have so many things in common though so it might not be possible but you can see what we did with that circ opt where we just basically used those those same options over and over again and that spread operator and es6 really helps with that and that's really really awesome that timeline is great too because we can just keep adding things and we know that they're all going to repeat at the same time together which is really really fun so if we look at this in my like little code open thing that opens it immediately in dev tools it's a Chrome extension you can see all of these things bursting apart whenever it plays so that's about it thank you for watching and thanks for tuning in bye
